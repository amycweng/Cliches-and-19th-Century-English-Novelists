roger ingleton minor by talbot baines reed you would expect this book with its schoolish title and by one of the most distinguished authors of books about school life to be another such book but it isn't and in fact it is much more of an adult's book than a child's old squire roger ingleton dies in the first few pages of the book and we are left with two more roger ingletons the first of these had had a row with his family twenty years before had stormed out had then led a dissipated life and finally had been reported dead somewhere in india the third one is the eponymous hero of the book he is handed a sealed envelope left by his deceased father and in it the father says that he is not at all sure that the older son is really dead so young roger goes looking for his older brother who will of course then inherit all the property honest and generous we must say the book takes us through all sorts of twists and is really very good value we recommend that you read it or listen to it as it is well worth the trouble nh roger ingleton minor by talbot baines reed chapter one a summons the snow lay thick round maxfield manor though it had been falling scarcely an hour it had already transfigured the dull old place from a gloomy pile of black and grey into a gleaming vision of white it lodged in deep piles in the angles of the rugged gables and swirled up in heavy drifts against the hall door it sat heavily on the broad ivy leaves over the porch and blotted out lawn path and flowerbed in a universal pall of white velvet the wind flattened oaks in the park were become tables of snow and away over the down to the edge of the cliff itself the dazzling canopy stretched making the gulls as they skimmed its surface in troubled flight appear dingy and the uneasy ocean beyond more than ever grey and leaden and the snow was falling still and promised to make a night of it at least so thought one of the inmates of the manor house as he got up from his music stool and casually looked out of the fast darkening window thanking his stars that it mattered little to him in his cosy bachelor den whether it went on a night or a fortnight this complacent individual was a man at whom one would be disposed to look twice before coming to any definite conclusion respecting him at the first glance you might put him down for twenty five at the second you would wonder whether you had possibly made a slight miscalculation of twenty years his keen eyes his smooth face his athletic figure his somewhat dandified dress were all in favour of the young man the double line across his brow the enigmas about his lips the imperturbable gravity of his features bespoke the elder handsome he was not he was hardly good looking and the nervous twitch of his eyebrow as it came down over his single eye glass constantly disfigured him what was his temper his character his soul you might sit for a month before him and never discover but from his deep massive chest his long arms his lithe step and the poise of his head upon his broad shoulders you would probably conclude that his enemy if he had one would do well not to frequent the same dark lane as mr frank armstrong this afternoon as he draws his curtain and lights his lamp he is passably content with himself and the world for he has just discovered a new volume of schumann that takes his fancy he has no quarrel therefore with the snow except that by its sudden arrival it will probably hold his promising pupil master roger prisoner for the night at castleridge where he and his mother have driven for dinner the tutor has sufficient interest in his work to make him regret this interruption of his duties but for the present he will console himself with schumann so he returns to his music stool the one spot in creation where he allows that he can be really happy and loses himself in a maze of sweet sound so engrossed is he in his congenial occupation that he is quite unaware of the door behind him opening and a voice saying beg pardon sir but the master wants you raffles the page boy who happened to be the messenger was obliged to deliver his summons three times the last time with the accompaniment of a tap on the tutor's shoulder before that virtuoso swung round on his stool and demanded what is it raffles please sir the master wants you hinstanter mr armstrong was inclined to compliment raffles on his latin but on second thoughts the tutor's second thoughts murdered a great number of his good sayings he considered that neither the page nor himself would be much better for the jest and spared himself he nodded to the messenger to go and closing the piano screwed his eye glass in his eye ready to depart please sir said raffles at the door the governor he's dicky to day you'd best have your heye on 'im thank you raffles i will said the tutor going out he paced the long passage which led from his quarters to the oak hall whistling sotto voce a bar or two of the schumann as he went then his manner became sombre as he crossed the polished boards and entered the passage beyond which led to his employer's library old roger ingleton was sitting in the almost dark room staring fixedly into the fire there was little light except that of the flickering embers in his dim worn face though not yet seventy his spare form was bent into the body of an old old man and the hands which feebly tapped the arms of the chair on which they rested were the worn out members of a man long past his work he saw little and heard less nor was he ever to be met outside the confines of his library or in summer weather the sunny balcony on to which it opened only when he talked were you able to realise that this worn out body did not belong to a tithonus but to a man whose inward faculties were still alert and vigorous whatever might be said of his outward failure could he but have been accommodated with the physical frame of a man of fifty he had spirit enough to fill it and become once more what he was twenty years ago a complete man sit down armstrong said he when presently his dim eyes and ears became aware of the tutor's presence there's no need to light the lamp and you need not trouble to talk for i should not be able to hear you the tutor shook the eye glass out of his eye and seated himself at a corner of the hearth in silence mr ingleton having thus prepared his audience looked silently into the fire for another half hour until the room was dark and all the tutor could see was a wan hand fidgeting uneasily on the arm of the chair then with a weary effort the squire turned his head and began as if continuing a conversation i have not been unobservant armstrong you came at a time when roger needed a friend so far you have done well by him and i am content with my choice of a tutor what contents me more is to think you are not yet tired of your charge i rather envy you armstrong i came to grief where you succeeded i once flattered myself i could bring up a boy he happened to be my son too but here the old man resumed his gaze into the fire and the room was as silent as the grave for a quarter of an hour the tutor began to be uneasy perhaps he had yearnings for his piano and schumann for all that he sat like a statue and waited at last the squire moved again i dreaded a repetition of that armstrong had he lived here he stopped again abruptly the tutor waited patiently for five minutes and then screwed his eye glass into his eye as he did so the old man uttered a sound very like a snore mr armstrong gave an imperceptible shrug of his shoulders and inwardly meditated a retreat when the sound came through the darkness again there was something in it which brought the tutor suddenly to his feet he struck a match and hastily lit a candle squire ingleton sat there just as he had sat an hour ago when the tutor found him except that the hand on the chair arm was quiet and his chin sunk a little deeper in his chest the tutor passed the candle before the old man's face and then scarcely less pallid than his master rang the bell raffles said he as the page entered come here quick the squire is ill i said he was dicky gasped the boy i knowed it whenever hold your tongue sir and help me lift him to the sofa between them they moved the stricken man to the couch where he lay open eyed speechless appealing we must get dr brandram raffles that'll puzzle you said the boy a night like this and the two 'orses at castleridge is there any chance of your mistress returning to night not if tom robbins knows it he's mighty tender of his 'orses and a night like this go and fetch the housekeeper at once said the tutor raffles vanished mr armstrong was not the man to lose his head on an emergency but now as he bent over the helpless paralytic and tried to read his wants in the eyes that looked up into his he found it needed a mighty effort to pull himself together and resolve how to act he must go for the doctor five miles away there was no one else about the place who could cover the ground as quickly but if he went he must leave the sufferer to the tender mercies of raffles and the housekeeper a prospect at which mr armstrong shuddered especially when the latter self important functionary entered talking at large and proposing half a dozen contradictory specifics in the short passage from the door to the sick couch mr armstrong only delayed to suggest meekly that his impression was that a warm bath would under the circumstances be of benefit and then not waiting for the contemptuous much you know about it which the suggestion evoked he set off it was no light task on a night like this to plough through the snow for five miles in search of help and the lanes to yeld were even in open weather none of the easiest but the tutor was not the kind of man to trouble himself about difficulties of that sort provided only he could find the doctor in and transport him in a reasonable time to maxfield as he passed the stables he glanced within on the off chance of finding a horse available but the place was empty and not even a stable boy could be made to hear his summons so he tramped out into the road where the snow lay a foot deep and with long strides carved his way through it towards yeld half a mile on he overtook a country cart heavily laden and stuck fast in the snow ah hodder said he to the nonplussed old man in charge you may as well give it up so i are without your telling growled the countryman very well i want your horse for a couple of hours the squire's ill and i have to fetch the doctor and without another word and heedless of the ejaculations of the bewildered hodder he began to loose the animal's girths i'm blamed if you have a hair of him said the yokel i don't want one here and he pitched him a half crown the man gaped stupidly at the unharnessing of his beast and began to pump up for another protest but before the words were ready mr armstrong had led the horse out of the shafts and had vaulted on his bare back eh sputtered hodder may i good bye and thanks said the tutor clapping his heels to the animal's flanks you shall have him back safe and he plunged away leaving the gaping son of the soil with his half crown in his hand to the laborious task of hoisting his lower jaw back into its normal position dr brandram in whose medical preserves maxfield manor lay was solacing himself with an after dinner pipe in his little cottage at yeld when the tutor crusted in snow from head to foot broke unceremoniously on his privacy an intuition told the doctor what was the matter before even his visitor could say the squire has had a stroke come at once the doctor put down his pipe and with a sigh kicked off his cosy slippers he has chosen a bad night armstrong how are the roads a foot deep shall you drive or ride i never ride you'll need both horses to get through and i can lend you a spent third thank you how did he look he knew what had happened i think but could not speak or move of course suppose you and i do the latter and postpone the former till we are under weigh in less than ten minutes the doctor's gig was trundling through the snow with three horses to drag it and mr armstrong in charge of the reins yes said the doctor he's been leading up to this for a long time as you have probably observed i can't say i have said mr armstrong ah well you've only known him a year i knew him twenty years ago ah replied the tutor chirruping encouragement to the horses roger ingleton's life twenty years ago was a life to make an insurance company cheerful said the doctor what changed it he had a scape grace son they fell out there was a furious quarrel and one day the father and son ugh fought with clenched fists sir like two two costermongers and the boy did not get the best of it he left home and no wonder and was never heard of since faugh it was a sickening business that explains what he was saying this afternoon about a son he had once he was telling me about it when he was struck ay that blow has been owing him for twenty years it is the last round of the fight armstrong but continued he this is all a secret no one knows it at maxfield i doubt if your pupil so much as imagines he ever had a brother he has never mentioned it to me said the tutor no need that he should know said the doctor let the dead bury his dead is he dead then before the squire married again said the doctor the poor boy went straight to the dogs and they made an end of him there let's talk of something else i don't know why i tell you what has never passed my lips for twenty years i wish you hadn't said mr armstrong shortly whipping up his horses the two men remained silent during most of that cold laborious journey the doctor's few attempts at conversation fell flat and he took refuge finally in his pipe as for the tutor he had his hands full steering his team between the lane side ditches and thinking of the wrecked life that lay waiting at the journey's end it was nearly ten o'clock before the dim lights of maxfield manor showed ahead the snow on the home drive was undisturbed by the wheels of any other vehicle the mother and son had not returned at any rate yet as the two men entered the hall was full of scared domestics talking in undertones and feeding on the occasional bulletin which the privileged raffles was permitted to carry from the sick room to the outer world at the sight of the doctor and mr armstrong they sneaked off grudgingly to their own territories leaving raffles to escort the gentlemen to the scene of the tragedy old roger ingleton lay on the sofa with eyes half closed upturned to the ceiling alive still but no more cups and wine glasses on the table near told of the housekeeper's fruitless experiments at restoration and the inflamed countenance of that ministering angel herself spoke ominously of the four hours during which the sufferer's comfort had been under her charge the tutor after satisfying himself that his mission had not been too late retired to the fireplace where he leaned dismally and watched through his eye glass the doctor's examination after a few minutes the latter walked across to him did you say mrs ingleton and the boy will not be back till the morning probably not if so they will be too late he will not last the night i will fetch them said mr armstrong quietly good fellow you are having a night of it i shall remain here so you can take whichever of my horses you like the mare will go best thanks said the tutor pulling himself together for this new task before he quitted the room he stepped up to the couch and bent for a moment over the helpless form of his employer there was no recognition in the glazed eyes and the hand which he just touched with his own was nerveless and dead already with a silent nod to the doctor mr armstrong left the room and was presently once more ploughing on horseback through the deep snow it was well this man was a man of iron and master of himself or he might have flagged under this new effort with the distressing prospect awaiting him at his journey's end as it was he urged doggedly forward forgetful of the existence of such an individual as frank armstrong and dwelling only on the dying man behind and the mourners ahead the clock was chiming one in castleridge church when at length he reined up his spent horse at the stable entrance to the grange here for a weary quarter of an hour he rang called and whistled before the glimmer of a lantern gave promise of an answer to the stable boy's not altogether polite inquiry mr armstrong replied mr ingleton of maxfield is ill call robbins and tell him to put the horses in immediately to take his mistress and mr roger home and get some one in the house to call them don't delay an instant this peremptory speech fairly aroused the sleepy stable boy and in a few minutes mr armstrong was standing in the hall of the grange talking to a footman take me up to his room said he pushing the bewildered servant before him up the staircase the man not at all sure that he was not in the grip of an armed burglar ascended the stair in a maze not daring to look behind him at the end of a corridor he stopped is that the room give me the lamp go and tell your master to get up say a messenger has come with bad news from maxfield and look here put some wraps in the carriage and have some coffee or wine ready in the hall in ten minutes the fellow greatly reassured by this short parley went off to fulfil his instructions while the tutor with what was very like a sigh opened the door and entered his pupil's bedroom roger ingleton minor lay sound asleep with his arms behind his head and a smile on his resolute lips as the light of the lamp fell on his face it looked very pale with its frame of black curly hair and the deep fringe of its long eyelashes but the finely chiselled nostrils and firm mouth redeemed it from all suspicion of weakness even as he slept you might judge this lad of nineteen had a will of his own hidden up in the delicate framework of his body and resembled his father at least in this that his outer man was too narrow a tenement for what it contained almost at the first flash of the light his big black eyes opened and he started to a sitting posture bewildered scared oh why hullo armstrong what's the matter i'm sorry to disturb you roger but the boy bounded out of bed and stood facing his tutor in his night dress but i want you to dress as sharp as you can your father is unwell unwell repeated the boy shivering you do not mean he is dead no no but ill he has had a stroke dr brandram is with him i thought it better not to wait till the morning before fetching you mother does she know by this time why ever did we not go back groaned the boy is there any hope armstrong some yes go to your mother and tell her so the carriage will be ready in five minutes in five minutes the boy and his mother descended to the hall where already their host and hostess were down to bid them farewell it was difficult to imagine that the slender dark eyed handsome woman who stood there and looked round for a moment so white and trembling and bewildered was really the mother of the young man on whose arm she leant even under a blow such as this mrs ingleton belied her age by a decade she was still on the sunny side of forty you and i might have doubted if she was yet thirty captain curtice and his wife had the true kindness to attempt no words as they sympathisingly bade their visitors farewell when the hall door opened and let in the cold blast the poor lady staggered a moment and clung closer to her son's side then abandoning composure to the wintry winds she found her best refuge in tears and let herself be led to the carriage the tutor helped to put her in and looked inquiringly at his pupil come in too please said the latter there is room inside mr armstrong would fain have taken his seat beside robbins on the box he hated scenes and tears and tragedies of all sorts but there was something in his pupil's voice which touched him he took his place within and prayed that the moments might fly till they reached maxfield scarcely a word was spoken once roger hazarded a question but it was the signal for a new outburst on his mother's part and he wisely desisted and leant back in his corner silent and motionless as for the tutor with the front seat to himself he nursed his knee and gazed fixedly out of the window the whole way what weeks those two hours seemed how the horses laboured and panted and halted and how interminably dismal was the dull muffled crunching of the wheels through the snow at length a blurred light passed the window and the tutor released his knee and put up his eye glass here we are said he that was the lodge roger slowly and reluctantly sat forward and wrapped his mother's shawl closer round her raffles stood on the door step and in the hall beyond mr armstrong could see the doctor standing as he stepped out the page touched him on the arm no 'urry whispered he all over whereupon the tutor quietly crept away to the seclusion of his own room chapter two the living among the dead the household of maxfield worn out by the excitement of the night slept or rather lay in bed till hard on midday the tutor as he slowly turned on his side and caught sight of the winter sun through the frost bespangled window felt profoundly disinclined to rise he shrank from the tasks that awaited him the task of witnessing the grief of the widow and the pale looks of the orphan heir the dismal negotiations with undertakers and clergymen and lawyers the stupid questions of the domestics the sickly fragrance of stephanotis in the house then too there was the awkward uncertainty as to his own future what effect would the tragedy of last night have on that was it a notice to quit or what he should be sorry to go he liked the place he liked his pupil and further he had nowhere else to go altogether mr armstrong felt very reluctant to exchange his easy bed for the chances and changes of the waking world besides lastly the water in his bath he could see was frozen and it was hopeless on a day like this to expect that raffles would bring him sufficient hot even to shave with however the tutor had had some little practice before now in doing what he did not like with a sigh and a shiver therefore he flung aside his blankets and proceeded to break the ice literally and take his bath after that he felt decidedly better and with the help of a steady ten minutes grind at the dumb bells he succeeded in pulling himself together he had reached this stage in his toilet when a knock came at the door come in raffles said mr armstrong beginning to see some prospect of a shave after all it was not raffles but dr brandram equipped for the road i'm off armstrong said he i'd ask you to come and drive me only i think you are wanted here see the boy eats enough and doesn't mope you must amuse him if you can you understand what i told you last night was not for him by the way here the doctor held out a sealed packet this was lying on the old man's table last night it was probably to give it to you that he sent for you in the afternoon and then forgot it well good bye i shall come to morrow if the roads are passable i only hope for my sake all this will not make any difference to your remaining at maxfield mr armstrong finished his toilet leisurely and then proceeded to examine the packet it was a large envelope addressed frank armstrong esquire in the old man's quavering hand within was another envelope firmly sealed on which the same hand had written these words to be given unopened into the hands of roger ingleton junior on his twentieth birthday the effort of writing those few words had evidently been almost more than the writer could accomplish for towards the end the letters became almost illegible and the words were huddled in a heap at the corner of the paper the sealing too to judge from the straggling blots of wax all over and the ineffective marks of the seal must have been the labour of a painful morning to the feeble half blind old man to the tutor however as he held the missive in his hand and looked at it with the reverence one feels for a token from the dead it seemed to make one or two things tolerably clear first that the contents whatever they were were secret and important else the old man would never have taken upon himself a labour he could so easily have devolved upon another secondly that this old man rightly or wrongly regarded frank armstrong as a man to be trusted and contemplated that a year hence he would occupy the same position with regard to the heir of maxfield as he did now having arrived at which conclusions the tutor returned the packet to its outer envelope and locked the whole up in his desk which done he descended to the breakfast room as he had expected no one was there what was worse there was no sign either of fire or breakfast to a man who has not tasted food for about twenty hours such a discovery could not fail to be depressing and mr armstrong meekly decided to summon raffles to his assistance as he passed down the passage he could not forbear halting for a moment at the door of a certain room behind which he knew the mortal remains of his dead employer lay as he paused not liking to enter liking still less to pass on the sound of footsteps within startled him it was not difficult after a moment's reflection to guess to whom they belonged and the tutor softly tapped on the door the only answer was the abrupt halting of the footsteps mr armstrong entered and found his pupil roger was standing in the ulster he had worn last night his eyes were black and heavy with weariness his face was almost as white as the face of him who lay on the couch and as he turned to the open door his teeth chattered with cold i couldn't leave him alone whispered he apologetically as the tutor laid a gentle hand on his arm of course of course replied mr armstrong i guessed it was you would you rather be left alone no said the lad wearily i thought by staying here i should get some help some i don't know what armstrong but instead i'm half asleep i've been yawning and shivering and forgotten who was here and here his eyes filled with tears dear old fellow said the tutor you are fagged out come and get a little rest roger sighed partly to feel himself beaten partly at the prospect of rest all right said he i'm ashamed you should see me so weak when i wanted to be strong yes i'll come in one minute he walked over to the couch and knelt beside it his worn out body had succumbed at last to the misery against which it had battled so long and for a moment he yielded himself to his sorrow the tutor waited a moment and then walked quietly from the room for a quarter of an hour he paced restlessly in the cold passage outside then as his pupil did not appear he returned to the chamber of death roger ingleton as he expected had fallen asleep where he knelt the wretched days between the death and the funeral dragged on in the usual dismal fashion mrs ingleton kept her room the domestics took the occasion to neglect their work and roger ingleton minor passed through all the stages from inconsolable misery to subdued cheerfulness mr armstrong alone went through no stages but remained the same unimpassioned individual he had been ever since he became a member of the maxfield household armstrong said the boy the day before the funeral do you know i'm the only male ingleton left i didn't know it have you no uncles or cousins none on our side some distant cousins on mother's side but they're abroad we were going over the lot yesterday mother and i but we couldn't scrape up a single relation to come to morrow we shall have to get you and brandram and fathers solicitor to come to the funeral if you don't mind of course i shall come said mr armstrong and by the way it seems rather queer doesn't it that i shall have charge of all this big property and i suppose be master of all the people about the place naturally amongst your humble and obedient servants the present tutor of maxfield will need to be included oh you said roger smiling yes you'll need to look out how you behave you know or i shall have to terminate our engagement isn't it queer queer as it was the tutor winced at the jest and screwed his eye glass a little deeper into his eye seriously though said roger i'm awfully glad i've got you here to advise me i want to do things well about the place and keep square with the tenants and improve a great many things i noticed a whole lot of cottages to day that want rebuilding and i think i ought to build a club room for the young fellows in the village and give a new lifeboat to replace the vega' what do you think i'll tell you this time to morrow meanwhile what do you say to a ride before dark it would do you good they had a long trot through the lanes and along the shore ending with a canter over the downs which landed the heir of maxfield at home with a glow in his cheeks and an appetite such as he had not known for a week next day the funeral took place in the family vault at the little churchyard of yeld the villagers as in duty bound flocked to pay their last respects to the old squire whose face for the last twenty years they had scarcely seen and of whose existence save on rent day many of them had been well nigh ignorant many an eye turned curiously to the slim pale boy as he stood alone the last of his house at the open tomb and many a speculation as to his temper and prospects occupied minds which were supposed to be intent on the solemn words of the burial service roger himself with that waywardness of the attention which afflicts us even in the gravest acts of our life found himself listening to the words in a sort of dream while his mind was occupied in reading over to himself the names of his ancestors inscribed on the panels of the vault john ingleton of maxfield manor who died ye ninth day of june aetat peter ingleton of maxfield manor his son obiit march paul ingleton only son of above peter born january died september ruth beloved wife of roger ingleton esquire of maxfield manor who died on february aged now a new inscription would be added roger ingleton son of the above named paul ingleton who died january and when that was added there would yet be space for another name below roger shuddered a little and brought his mind back with an effort to the solemn act which was taking place the clergyman's voice ceased and the fatherless lad stooped to get a last view of the flower covered coffin then with a heart lonelier than he had ever known it before he turned away the people fell back and made a silent lane for him to pass poor lad said a country wife as she looked after him pity knows he'll be this way again before long hold thy tongue said another thee'd look white and shaky if thee was the only man of thy name left on earth eh uncle hodder let un go said the venerable proprietor of the tutor's borrowed horse last week let 'un go the ingletons was all weaklings but they held out to nigh on threescore and ten years all bar the best of them there was naught weak about him yet he dropped off in blossom time ay ay poor lad said the elder of the women in a whisper pity of the boy he'd have taken the load on his shoulders to day better than yonder white child hold thy tongue and come and take thy look at the old squire's last lying place roger overheard none of their talk but wandered on lonely but angry with himself for feeling as unemotional as he did he told the coachman he would walk home and started along the half thawed lanes hoping that the five miles solitary walk would help to bring him into a frame of mind more appropriate to the occasion but try as he would his mind wandered first to his mother then to maxfield and the villagers then to his pet schemes for a model village then to armstrong and his studies then to a certain pair of foils that hung in his room then to the possibility of a yacht next summer then to the county festivities next winter with perhaps a ball at maxfield then to his approaching majority and all the delights of unfettered manhood then he had got so far at the end of a mile when he heard steps tramping through the mud behind him it was mr armstrong the boy's first impulse was to put on an air of dejection he was far from feeling but his honesty came to his rescue in time hullo armstrong i'm so glad it's you you'll never guess what i was thinking about when i heard you about being elected mp for the county asked the tutor gravely how did you guess that i tried to think about other things you know but luckily you chose to be natural instead well i hope you'll be elected when the time comes the two beguiled their walk in talk which if not exactly what might have been expected of mourners at least served to restore the boy's highly strung mind to its proper tone and to make the aspect of things in general brighter for him than it had been when he started so dismally from the graveyard now said he with a sigh as they entered the house now comes the awful business of reading the will pottinger is sure to make an occasion of it it would be worth your while to be present to hear him perform thanks said the tutor i'll look to you for a full account of the ceremony by and by i'll accompany it to slow music upstairs but as it happened mr armstrong was not permitted to escape as he had fondly hoped to his piano raffles followed him presently to his room and said please sir mr pottinger sends his compliments and will be glad if you will step down to the library sir mr armstrong scowled what does he want he muttered he wants a gentleman or two to say 'ear 'ear i fancy said the page with a grin mr armstrong gave a melancholy glance at his piano and screwed his glass in his eye aggressively all right raffles you can go what does the old idiot want with me i wonder said he to himself unless it's to give me a month's notice and tell me i may clear out heigho i hope not with which pleasant misgivings he strolled down stairs in the library was assembled a small but select audience to do mr pottinger the yeld attorney honour the widow was there looking pale but charming in her deep mourning and tasteful cap roger was there restless impatient and a little angry at all the fuss dr brandram and the rector were there resigned as men who had been through ceremonies of the kind before and a deputation of dead servants sat on chairs near the door gratified to be included in the party and mentally going over their services to the testator and appraising them in anticipation we were waiting for you mr armstrong said the attorney severely as the tutor entered mr armstrong looked not at all well pleased to be thus accosted and walked to a seat in the bay window behind mr pottinger the man of the law put on his glasses took a sip of water from a tumbler he had had brought in blew his nose and glancing round on his audience with all the enjoyment of a man who feels himself master of the situation began to make a little speech there was first a little condescending preamble concerning the virtues of the deceased which every one but roger listened to respectfully the son felt it as much as he could put up with to sit still and hear it and began to fidget ominously and greatly to the disturbance of the speaker when mr pottinger after a few reproachful pauses left this topic and began to discourse on his own relations with the late squire it was the turn of dr brandram to become restless this is not the occasion for dwelling on the gratification i received from here the doctor deliberately rose and walked across the room for a footstool which as deliberately he walked back with and laid at the feet of mrs ingleton beg pardon go on said he meeting the astonished eye of the attorney the gratification i received from the kind expressions here a large coal inconsiderately fell out of the fire with a loud clamour raffles with considerable commotion came from his seat and proceeded to restore it to its lost estate mr pottinger took his glasses from his nose and regarded the performance with such abject distress that roger catching sight of his face involuntarily smiled really exclaimed the now thoroughly offended friend of the family really my boy on an occasion such as this here the rector to every one's relief came gallantly to the rescue this is very tedious mr pottinger said he the friends here i am sure will prefer that you should omit all these useless preliminaries and come to the business at once let me read the document for you my eyes are younger than yours at this terrific act of insubordination and the almost blasphemous suggestion which capped it the lawyer fell back in his chair and broke out into a profuse perspiration gazing at the rector as he would at some suddenly intruding wild animal then with a gasp taking in the peril of the whole situation he hastily took up the will and plunged into it it was a long tedious document hard to understand and when it was ended no one exactly grasped its purport then came the moment of mr pottinger's revenge the party was at his mercy after all what does it all amount to said the doctor interpreting the perplexed looks of the company i had better perhaps explain it in simple words said the attorney condescendingly if you will give me your attention you might have heard a pin drop now briefly the provisions of our dear friend's will are these proper provision is made for the support in comfort of the widow during her life legacies are also left as you have heard to certain friends servants and charities the whole of the remaining property which it is my impression will be found to be very considerable is left in trust for the testator's only son roger our young friend here who is to receive it absolutely on reaching the age of twenty one the conditions of the trust are a trifle peculiar there are three trustees who are also guardians of the heir the first is mrs ingleton the widow the second is edward oliphant esquire of her majesty's indian army second cousin i understand of mrs ingleton and in the event which i trust is not likely of the death of our young friend here heir presumptive to the property his trusteeship is dependent on his coming to this country and assuming the duties of guardian to the heir and provision is made accordingly the third trustee and guardian is mr frank armstrong who is entitled to act so long as he holds his present post of tutor to the heir which post he will retain only during mrs ingleton's pleasure it is also provided that in the event of any difference of opinion among the trustees mrs ingleton as is most proper shall be permitted to decide and lastly a curious eccentricity on our dear friend's part which was perhaps hardly necessary to insert in the event of roger ingleton previous to his attaining his majority becoming a felon a lunatic or marrying he is to be regarded as dead and the property thereby passes to the next heir captain oliphant i think we may congratulate ourselves on what is really a very simple will and which provided the trustees named consent to act presents very little difficulty i have telegraphed already to captain oliphant mr armstrong will you do me the favour at your convenience of intimating to me your consent or otherwise mr armstrong made no response it was indeed doubtful whether he had heard the question for at that precise moment gazing about him in bewilderment at the unexpected responsibility thus thrown upon him his eyes became suddenly riveted by a picture it was a portrait partly concealed behind the curtain of the window in which he sat but unveiled sufficiently to disclose the face of a fair haired boy younger by some years than roger with clear blue eyes and strong compressed mouth somewhat sullen in temper but with an air of recklessness and determination which even in the portrait fascinated the beholder mr armstrong although he had frequently been in his late employer's study had never noticed this picture before now as he caught sight of it and suddenly met the flash of those wild bright eyes he experienced something like a shock he could not help recalling dr brandram's sad story the other day something seemed mysteriously to connect this portrait and the story together in his mind strange that at such a moment when the fate of the younger son was being decided his guardian should thus come suddenly face to face with the elder mr armstrong was not a superstitious man but he felt decidedly glad when a general break up of the party allowed him to get out of range of these not altogether friendly eyes and escape to the seclusion of his own room chapter three a missing inscription a week later mr pottinger as he trotted into his office found a letter and a telegram lying side by side on his desk he opened the telegram first and read bombay january consent am starting oliphant that's all right said the lawyer to himself we shall have one competent executor at any rate he endorsed the telegram and proceeded to open the letter it too was a very brief communication sir i beg to say i accept the duties of trustee and guardian conferred on me by the will of the late roger ingleton esquire yours etcetera frank armstrong humph growled the attorney i was afraid so well well it's not my affair the squire knew my opinion so my conscience is clear an adventurer nothing less a dangerous man don't like him well well to do mr pottinger justice this opinion of his was of no recent date indeed it was of as long standing as the tutor's first arrival at maxfield eighteen months ago it was one of the few matters on which he and his late client had differed calmly indifferent as to the effect of his communication on the lawyer mr armstrong was at that moment having an audience with his co trustee and mistress mrs ingleton mr armstrong said she i hope for all our sakes you see your way to accept the duties my dear husband requested of you i have written to mr pottinger to notify my consent i am so glad i shall have to depend on you for so much it will be so good for roger to have you with him his father was always anxious about him most anxious you know mr armstrong added she if there is any any question as to salary or anything i can do to make your position here comfortable you must tell me for roger's sake i am anxious you should be happy here thank you madam i am most comfortable said mr armstrong looking anything but what he described himself he had a detestation of business interviews and wished profoundly he was out of this i am sure you will like captain oliphant said the widow i have not seen him for many years indeed since shortly after roger was born but we have heard from him constantly and mr ingleton had a high opinion of him he is a very distant cousin of mine you know so i understand poor fellow his wife died quite young his three children will be quite grown up now poor things well thank you very much mr armstrong i hope we shall always be good friends for dear roger's sake good bye roger as may be imagined had not waited a whole week before ascertaining his tutor's intentions he had been a good deal staggered at first by his father's will with its curious provisions but amongst a great deal that was perplexing and disappointing in it he derived no little comfort from the fact that mr armstrong was to be one of his legal protectors i don't see you know said he as he lounged against his tutor's mantelpiece one evening i don't see why a fellow of nineteen can't be trusted to behave himself without being tied up in this way it's my impression i know as well how to behave now as i am likely to do when i am twenty one that is a reflection in advance on my dealings with you during the next two years said the tutor with a grin as he swung himself half round on the piano stool so as to get his hand within reach of the keys i don't mind you said the boy but i hope this cousin edward or whoever he is won't try to deal' with me too i am informed he is virtue and amiability itself said the tutor if he is all serene i'll take my walks abroad with one little hand in yours and the other in his like a good boy if he's not there'll be a row armstrong in anticipation of which i feel in the humour for a turn at the foils so they adjourned into the big empty room dedicated to the manly sports of the man and his boy and there for half an hour a mortal combat raged at the end of which roger pulled off his mask and said panting where did you learn foils armstrong for a year i've been trying to run you through the body and i've never even yet scratched your arm i fenced a good deal at oxford ah i wonder if i shall ever go to oxford this will cuts me out of that nicely not at all how well you can't be my tutor here while i'm an undergraduate there can you i'd sooner give up oxford than you armstrong kind of you wrong of you too perhaps but at twenty one you'll be your own master i may not be in the humour then besides i shall have my hands full of work here then it's hard lines to have to kick my heels in idleness for two years while i've so many plans in my head for improving the place and to have to ask your leave to spend so much as a halfpenny it is rather tragic it strikes me however that cousin edward will be the financial partner of our firm i shall attend to the literary part of the business and poor mother has to umpire in all your squabbles upon my word why couldn't i have been treated like a man straight off instead of being washed and dressed and fed with a spoon and wheeled in a perambulator by three respectable middle aged persons who all vote me a nuisance in the first place roger ingleton i am not yet middle aged in the second place i do not vote you a nuisance in the third place if you stand there much longer like that with your coat off you will catch your death of cold which would annoy me exceedingly this was one of many conversations which took place it was difficult to say whether mr armstrong took his new duties seriously or not he generally contrived to say something flippant about them when his pupil tackled him on the subject but at the same time he rarely failed to give the boy a hint or two that somewhere hidden away behind the cool odd exterior of the man there lurked a very warm corner for the fatherless heir of maxfield for the next week or two the days passed uneventfully the manor house settled down to its old routine minus the old man who had once been its master the villagers having satisfied themselves that things were likely to be pretty much the same for them under the new regime as the old resumed their usual ways and touched their caps regularly to the young squire the trampled grass in yeld churchyard lifted its head again and a new inscription was added to the family roll on the door of the vault armstrong said the heir one day as he stood inspecting this last memorial i have a good mind to have my brother's name put on here too this was the first time the tutor had ever heard the boy mention his brother indeed he had like dr brandram doubted whether roger so much as knew that he had had a brother what brother he inquired vaguely oh he died long ago before i was born he was the son of father's first wife you know pointing to the inscription of ruth ingleton's name he is not buried here he died abroad i believe but i think his death should be recorded with the others don't you certainly said the tutor i must try to find the exact date said roger as they walked away my father would hardly ever talk about him his death must have been a knock down blow to him and i believe it broke his mother's heart sometimes i wish he had lived he was called roger too i dare say brandram or the vicar can tell me about it mr armstrong was a good deal concerned at this unexpected curiosity on the boy's part he doubted whether it would not be better to tell him the sad story at once as he had heard it from the doctor he disliked secrets extremely especially when he happened to be the custodian of them and painful as the discovery of this one might be to his ward it might be best that he should know it now instead of hovering indefinitely in profitless mystery it was therefore with some sense of relief that half way home he perceived dr brandram in the road ahead the doctor was in fact bound for maxfield by the way doctor said the tutor determined to take the bull by the horns and glaring at his friend rather fiercely through his eye glass we were talking about you just now roger has been telling me about an elder brother of his who died long ago and thinks some record of the death should be made on the vault i think so too i was saying said roger my father never cared to talk about it so except that he died abroad and that his name was the same as mine i really don't know much about him did you know him the doctor looked uncomfortable and not altogether grateful to mr armstrong for landing him in this dilemma don't you think said he ignoring the last question as the squire did not put up an inscription it would be better to leave the tomb as it is i don't see that said the boy of course i should say where he really did die where was that by the way i really did not hear abroad i understood your father to say was he delicate then that he had to go away how old was he doctor upon my word he was so seldom at home and when he was i saw so little of him that my memory is very hazy about him altogether he can't have been more than a boy of fifteen or sixteen i should say by the way roger how does the new cob do middling he's rather lumpy to ride i shall get mother to swop him for a horse if she can i say doctor what was he like who the cob oh your brother i fancy he was a fine young fellow but not particularly good looking at all like me not at all i should say but really as i say i can recall very little about him the doctor uttered this in a tone which conveyed so broad a hint that he did not relish the subject that roger decidedly mystified desisted from further inquiries what on earth said the former to mr armstrong when at last they had reached maxfield and the boy had left them what on earth has put all this into his head i cannot tell you i rather hoped you would tell him all you knew it would come better from you if i know anything of roger he will find it out for himself whether you like it or not nice thing to be a family doctor growled dr brandram and have charge of the family skeletons between you and me armstrong i was never quite satisfied about the story of the boy's death abroad the old man said he had had news of it and that was all anybody even the poor mother ever got out of him really brandram said the tutor you are a most uncomfortable person i wish you would not make me a party to these mysteries i don't like them they are upsetting well well old fellow replied the doctor whatever it was once it's no mystery now for the poor fellow has long ago made good his right to an inscription on the tombstone you need have no doubt of that a letter with an indian post mark which arrived that same evening served for the present at least to divert the thoughts of roger as well as of his tutor to other channels the letter was from captain oliphant addressed to mrs ingleton my very dear cousin it read need i say with what deep sympathy i received the news of our dear roger's sudden call at this great distance blows of this kind fall with cruel heaviness and i assure you i felt crushed as i realised that i should no more grasp the hand of one of the noblest men it has been my privilege to call by the name of friend if my loss is so great what must yours be i dare not think of it i was truly touched by our dear one's thought of me in desiring that i should join you in the care of his orphaned boy i regard this dying wish as a sacred trust put upon me which gratitude and love alike require that i should accept ere this letter reaches you i shall myself be nearing england the provision our dear roger has made has emboldened me to resign my commission so that i may devote my whole time without distraction to my new charge you know dear cousin the special bond of sympathy that unites us your boy has been robbed of a parent my children long since have had to mourn a mother i cannot leave them here they accompany me to england where perhaps for all of us there awaits a community of comfort i bespeak your motherly heart for them as i promise you a father's affection for your boy i will write no more at present the oriana' is due in london i believe about february and we shall i need hardly assure you not linger long before bringing in our own persons to maxfield whatever sympathy four loving hearts can carry amongst them with love to the dear boy believe me dear cousin your loving and sympathising fellow mourner edward oliphant mrs ingleton highly gratified handed the beautiful letter first to her son then to mr armstrong roger was hardly as taken with it as his mother civil enough said he and i dare say he means all he says but i don't warm to the prospect of being cherished by him besides there is something a trifle too neat in the way he invites his whole family to maxfield what do you think armstrong mr armstrong was perusing the letter with knitted brows and a curl of his lips he vouchsafed no reply until he had come to the end then he shook the glass ominously out of his eye and said i'll tell you that when i see him roger knew his tutor well enough to see that he did not like the letter at all and he felt somewhat fortified in his own misgivings accordingly i wonder what mother will do with them all said the boy surely we aren't to have the place turned into a nursery for two years i understand the young people are more than children said the tutor so much the worse growled roger on the morning before the oriana was due mrs ingleton suggested to her son that it would be a polite thing if he were to go to town and meet the travellers on their arrival roger not particularly charmed with the prospect stipulated that mr arm strong should come with him and somewhat shocked his fond parent by expressing the hope that the vessel might be a few days late and so allow time for a little jaunt in london before the arrival of his new guardian mr armstrong meekly acquiesced in the proposal and scarcely less exhilarated than his pupil retired to pack for the journey roger meanwhile occupied the interval before starting by writing a letter in the study since his father's death he had taken quiet possession of this room one of the pleasantest in the house a feeling of reverence for the dead had prompted him to disturb its contents and furniture as little as possible and hitherto his occupation had scarcely extended beyond the arm chair at the fire and the writing table to day however as he sat biting his pen and looking for an inspiration out of the window his eye chanced to rest for a moment on a frame corner peeping from behind a curtain he thought nothing of it for a while and having found his idea went on writing but presently his eyes strayed again and once more lit upon the misplaced piece of gilding he went over mechanically to adjust it pondering his letter all the while why ever can't they hang things where they can be seen said he as he drew back the curtain the last words dropped half spoken from his lips as he disclosed the portrait of a certain boy flashing at him with his reckless eyes and half defying him out of the canvas like mr armstrong when he had encountered the picture a month ago roger ingleton instinctively guessed in whose presence he stood the discovery had something in it both of a shock and a disappointment if this was really his elder brother he was strangely different from what he had in fancy pictured him he had imagined him his own age whereas this was a boy considerably his junior he had imagined him dark and grave whereas this was fair and mocking and he had imagined him amiable and sympathetic whereas this was hostile and defiant yet for all that roger stood fascinated a chord deep in his nature thrilled as he said to himself my brother he the young man felt himself captive to this imperious boy he wished he knew the mind of the picture or could hear its voice what were the eyes flashing at at whom or what were the lips thus curled was it wickedness or anger or insolence or all together that made the face so unlike any other face he knew how long he spent over these speculations half afraid half enamoured of the picture he could not say he forgot all about his letter nor did he finally descend from the clouds till a voice behind him said what have you got there old fellow oh armstrong said the boy turning round hurriedly like one detected in mischief look here at this picture the tutor was looking who is it he asked my elder brother i'm sure i didn't know we had it there's not much family likeness in it said mr armstrong are you sure it is he i feel positive of it stay perhaps there's something written on the back and he lifted the picture from the nail the paper at the back was almost black with dust and age they wiped it carefully with a duster and took it to the window no said roger nothing there yes said the tutor what's this and he pointed out a few faint marks in very faded ink which after considerable trouble they deciphered ri born september died the last figure was illegible that settles it said roger all except the exact date when he died upon my word i'm quite glad it is my brother after all i shouldn't have liked if he'd turned out any one else do you know added he as he was about to replace the picture i think i shall take it up to my room i've taken rather a fancy to him that afternoon the two friends took the train to london where considerably to the relief of both they heard that the oriana was not expected in dock for three days chapter four acquaintances new and old roger's projected jaunt in london did not turn out as satisfactorily as he had anticipated as he caught a heavy cold on the first day which kept him a prisoner in his hotel mr armstrong needed all his authority to restrain the invalid within bounds and it was only by threatening to convey him bodily home that the boy consented to nurse himself even so it was as much as he could do to shake off his cold sufficiently on the morning of the arrival of the oriana to accompany his tutor to the dock to greet his unknown kinsfolk as he shouldered his way on board over the crowded gangway he found himself speculating somewhat nervously as to which of the numerous passengers standing about the deck was his new guardian was it the ferocious man with the great black beard who was swearing at his indian servant in a voice loud enough to be heard all over the ship or was it the dissipated looking fellow who walked unsteadily across the motionless ship and finally clung for support to the deck railings or was it the discontented looking little person who scowled at the company at large from the bridge or was it the complacent man with the expansive presence and leonine head who smoked a big cigar and was exchanging a few effusive farewells with a small group of fellow voyagers roger accosted one of the stewards will you please tell captain oliphant that mr roger ingleton is on board with mr armstrong and would like to see him the man gave a look up and down and went straight to the expansive person before mentioned the visitors could see the gentleman start a little as the steward delivered his message and pitch his cigar away as with a serious face he walked in their direction my poor dear boy said he taking roger's hand this is good of you very good how glad i am to see you how is your dear mamma mother is very well have you had a good voyage oh this is mr armstrong mr armstrong all this while had been staring through his eye glass at his co trustee in no very amiable way and now replied to that gentleman's greeting with a somewhat stiff how do you do where on earth did i see you before my gentleman said he to himself and having put the riddle he promptly gave it up mr oliphant displayed very little interest in his fellow guardian but said to roger the children will be so delighted to see you we have talked so much of you they will be here directly they are just putting together their things in the cabin but now tell me all about yourself my boy roger did not feel equal to this comprehensive task and said i suppose you'll like to go straight on to maxfield wouldn't you oh yes it may be a day before we get our luggage clear so we will come to your hotel to night and go on to morrow why my boy what a cough you have ah here comes rosalind the figure which approached the group was that of a young lady about seventeen years of age tall and slim clad in a loose cloak which floated about her like a cloud and considerably encumbered with sundry shawls and bags on one arm a restive dog in another and a hat which refused to remain on her head in the wind mr armstrong was perhaps no great connoisseur of female charms but he thought as he slowly tried to make up his mind whether he should venture to assist her that he had rarely seen a more interesting picture her face was flushed with the glow of youth and health an artist might have found fault with it here and there but to the tutor it seemed completely beautiful the fine poise of her head upon the dainty neck the classic cut of mouth and nostril the large dark liquid eyes the snowy forehead the short clustering wind tossed hair the frank countenance the refinement in every gesture all combined to astonish the good man into admiration yet with all his admiration he felt a little afraid of this radiant apparition consequently by the time he had half decided to advance to her succour his ward had stepped forward and forestalled him let me help you cousin rosalind said roger she turned on him a look half surprise half pleasure and then allowing him to take cloaks bags dog and all said really papa you must go and help down in the cabin it's an awful chaos and tom and jill are making it ten times worse do go and she sat down with a gesture of despair on one of the benches and proceeded to adjust her unruly hat while doing this she looked up at roger who stood meekly before her with her belongings thanks don't mind holding them put them down anywhere roger and do there's a dear boy go and help father and the others in that horrid horrid cabin roger more flurried and docile than he had felt himself for a long while dropped the baggage and thrusting the dog into armstrong's hands flew off to obey the behests of his new cousin the young lady now looked up in charming bewilderment at the tutor who could not fail to read the question in her eyes and felt called upon to answer it may i introduce myself said he i am frank armstrong roger's tutor i'm so glad said she with a little laugh i'd imagined you a horrid elderly person with a white cravat and tortoise shell spectacles it is such a relief and she sighed at the mere recollection of her forebodings there's no saying what we may become in time said mr armstrong i suppose said she eyeing him curiously once more you're the other trustee or whatever it's called i hope you and father will get on well i can't see what use either of you can be roger looks as if he could take care of himself are you awfully fond of him i am rather said the tutor in a voice which quite satisfied his hearer heigho said she presently picking up the dog and stroking its ears i'm glad this dreadful voyage is over mr armstrong what do they all think about all of us coming to maxfield if i lived there i should hate it mrs ingleton i know is very pleased yes but you men aren't there'll be fearful rows i know i wish we'd stayed behind in india it's hateful to be stuck down where you aren't wanted for every one to vote you a nuisance i can hardly imagine any one voting you a nuisance said mr armstrong half frightened at his own temerity she glanced up with a little threatening of a blaze in her eyes don't said she that's the sort of thing the silly young gentlemen say on board ship i don't like it the poor tutor winced as much under this rebuff as if he had been just detected in a plot to run away with his fair companion and having nothing to say in extenuation of his crime he relapsed into silence miss oliphant apparently unaware of the effect of her little protest stroked her dog again and said are you an artist no are you i want to be i'd give anything to get out of going to maxfield and have a room here in town near the galleries it will be awful waste of time in that dull place perhaps your father began the tutor but she took him up half angrily my father intends us to stay at maxfield in fact you may as well know it at once and let roger know it too we're as poor as church mice and can't afford to do anything else oh how i wish we had stopped where we were and her voice actually trembled as she said the words it was an uncomfortable position for mr armstrong once again his mother wit failed him and he watched the little hand as it moved up and down the dog's back in silence i tell you this continued the young lady because tutors are generally poor and you'll understand it i wish papa understood it half as well i do believe he really enjoys the prospect of going and landing himself and all of us at that place you forget that it is by the desire and invitation of the old squire said the tutor father might easily have declined he ought to have he wasn't like you fond of roger he doesn't care at least i fancy he doesn't much about roger at all oh i wish i could earn enough to pay for every bite every one of us eats to the tutor's immense relief at this point captain oliphant reappeared followed by roger with a boy and little girl the boy was some years the junior of the heir of maxfield a rotund matter of fact jovial looking lad sturdy in body easy in temper and perhaps by no means brilliant in intellect the turmoil of debarkation failed to ruffle him and the information given him in sundry quarters that he was the fons et origo of all the confusion in the cabin failed to impress him everything that befell tom oliphant came in the day's work and would probably vanish with the night's sleep meanwhile it was the duty of every one himself included to be jolly so he accepted his father's chidings and roger's greetings in equally good part agreed with every word the former said and gave in his allegiance to the latter with one and the same smile and thought to himself how jolly to be in england at last and perhaps some day to see the oxford and cambridge boat race the little maid who tripped at his side was perhaps ten or eleven an odd blending of the sister's beauty and alertness with the brother's vigorous contentment a prophet versed in such matters would have predicted that ten years hence miss jill oliphant might seriously interfere with the shape of her elder sister's nose but as no prophets were present only a fogey like mr armstrong and an inexperienced boy like roger no one concerned themselves about the future but voted the little lady of ten a winsome child well thanks for all your help said tom to his elder sister i don't know what we should have done without her eh roger upon my word with you in charge down there retorted the young lady i wouldn't have been safe in that awful place a minute longer i wonder you haven't packed up jill in one of the trunks oh cousin roger took care of me said miss jill demurely i hope armstrong did the same to you rosalind said roger here tom this is my tutor frank armstrong a brick here jill say how do you do to mr armstrong jill horrified mr armstrong by putting up her face to be kissed indeed the poor gentleman as he shook the glass out of his eye and gazed down at this forward young person in consternation presented so pitiable a spectacle that rosalind roger and tom all began to laugh she won't bite said tom reassuringly mr armstrong thus encouraged took off his hat and stooping down kissed the child on the brow much to that little lady's satisfaction this important operation performed captain oliphant expressed concern for roger's cough and proposed that his ward should take the girls and himself to the hotel while no doubt mr armstrong would not mind remaining to help tom with the luggage by which excellent arrangement the party succeeded at last in getting clear of the oriana the tutor had his hands full most of that morning tom oliphant's idea of looking after the luggage was to put his hands in his pockets and whistle pleasantly up and down the upper deck nor was it till mr armstrong took him bodily below and made him point out one by one the family properties among which by the way he included several articles belonging to other owners that he could be reduced to business at all then for half an hour he worked hard at the end of which time he turned to his companion with a friendly grin thanks awfully mr armstrong i say i wonder if you'll be my tutor as well as frank's i heard father say something about it wouldn't it be stunning mr armstrong gave a qualified assent i'm not a bit clever you know like rosalind but i'd like to have a tutor awfully i say haven't we done enough with these blessed boxes they'll be all right now should we have time to see christy's minstrels on our way to the hotel do you think i'd like it frightfully my dear boy said mr armstrong if we are to get all the things properly cleared and labelled and sent off to maxfield we shall have no time for anything else if the way you stick to your lessons is anything like the way you stick to this task i don't envy your tutor this covert threat at once reduced tom to a sense of discipline and he made a gallant effort to secure mr armstrong's good opinion the tutor was right it was well on in the afternoon when they had the baggage finally disposed of and were free to follow to the hotel here they found instead of the party they expected a hurriedly scrawled line from roger dear armstrong oliphant has taken it into his head to go down to maxfield at once by the two train so we are starting i'm sorry he can't wait so as all to go together if you are back in time to come by the evening train do come if not first train in the morning yours ever ri it was too late to get a train that day so mr armstrong much disgusted had to make up his mind to remain tom on the contrary was delighted and proposed twenty different plans for spending the evening which finally resolved themselves into the coveted visit to christy's minstrels the tutor in no very festive humour allowed himself to be overborne by the eagerness of his young companion and found himself in due time jammed into a seat in a very hot hall listening to the very miscellaneous performance of the coloured gentlemen who never perform out of london the tutor who had some ideas of his own on the subject of music listened very patiently sometimes pleased sometimes distressed and always conscious of the enthusiastic delight of his companion whose unaffected comments formed to him the most amusing part of the entertainment isn't that stunning thanks awfully mr armstrong for bringing me hooray bones again i say i'm looking forward to the break down ain't you and so on whatever mr armstrong's anticipations may have been as to the rapture of the coming break down he contained himself admirably and with his glass inquiringly stuck in his eye listened attentively to all that went on and occasionally speculated as to how miss rosalind oliphant was enjoying her visit to maxfield the programme was half over and tom was repairing the ravages of nature with a bun when mr armstrong became suddenly aware of a person in the row but one in front looking round fixedly in his direction to judge by the close cropped erect hair and stubbly chin of this somewhat disreputable looking individual he was a foreigner and when presently catching the tutor's eye he began to indulge in pantomimic gestures of recognition it was safe to guess he was a frenchman who's that chap nodding to you said tom with his mouth full is he tipsy he lays himself open to the suspicion said mr armstrong slowly at any rate as i vote we go put and get some fresh air he will have to find some one else to make faces at come along tom did not at all like risking his seat and particularly charged the lady next to him to preserve it from invasion at the risk of her life then wondering a little at mr armstrong's impatience to reach the fresh air he followed him out the frenchman witnessed the proceeding with some little disappointment and sat craning his neck in the direction in which they had gone for some minutes then as if moved by a similar yearning for fresh air he too left his seat and went out the band was beginning to play as he did so and most of the loiterers were crowding back for the second part you go in i'll come directly said mr armstrong to the boy tom needed no second invitation and a moment later had forgotten everything in the delightful prelude to the break down he did not even observe that mr armstrong had not returned to his seat well gustav said that gentleman in french as the foreigner approached him where he waited in the outer lobby eh bien man cher replied the other 'ow 'appy i am to see you i can speak ze englise foine n'est ce pas what are you doing in london i am vaiter garcon at ze private hotel 'zey give me foods and drinks and one black coat but not no vage oh mon ami it is ver' ver' 'ard and the old man ah helas he is ver' ver' ill he vill die next week moi i can not to him go and marie she write me she must leave paris this day to her duties it is sad for the poor old pere to die with not von friend to 'old 'is 'and ah if ze petite francoise yet lived ma pauvre enfant she would stay and stop said the tutor imperatively is he still in the old place helas non you make ze joke you ve are ver' ver' poor and 'ave no homes mon pere he is to the hopital thank 'eaven they 'ave zere give 'im ze bed to die which hospital is he at said the tutor de saint luc i will see him the frenchman gave a little hysterical laugh then with tears in his eyes he seized the hand of the englishman and wrung it rapturously oh mon ami mon cher ami cried he 'eaven will bless you i am 'appy that you say that you vill see 'im yes you vill 'old 'is 'and ven he do die he sall have one friend to kiss his poor front oh i am content i am gay how long he would have gone on thus it is hard to say mr armstrong cut short the scene rather abruptly there there said he good bye gustav i shall go very soon and will come and see you when i return and he went back to the performance you've missed it said tom as he dropped into his seat it was the finest break down' you ever saw that one next but one to bones kept it up best we couldn't get an encore out of them never mind perhaps they'll have another to finish up there's lot's more in the programme mr armstrong watched it all with the same critical interest as before but his mind was far away it wandered to the foreign city to the gaunt pauper hospital there to a little low bed where lay an old dying friendless man tossing and moaning for the laggard death to give him rest he saw nothing of what went on before him he felt none of the merry boy's nudges at his side he even forgot roger and maxfield the performance was over at last well that was a jolly spree i wish it was coming all over again chirped the boy oh thank you awfully mr armstrong for bringing me did you like it too that last break down wasn't up to the other but i'm glad you've seen one of them at any rate as they crowded out mr armstrong was surprised and a little vexed to see gustav still hanging about the lobby waiting for him he dropped behind the boy for a moment and beckoned him well gustav said he impatiently ah mon ami said the frenchman putting a little bunch of early violets into the tutor's hands vill you give 'im zese from me 'tis all i can send but he will love zem for the sake of me and ze little francoise adieu adieu mon cher ami it took not a minute but in that time tom had wandered serenely on never dreaming that his protector was not close at his heels nor did he discover his mistake till he found himself half way up piccadilly enlarging to a stranger at his side on the excellence of the evening's performance then he looked round and missed his companion the pavement was crowded with wayfarers of all sorts some pressing one way some another among them all the boy could not discover the stalwart form of mr armstrong he pushed back to the hall but he was not there he followed one or two figures that looked like his but they were strangers all then he returned up the street at a run hoping to overtake him but in vain he knew nothing of london he did not even know the name of the hotel he had no money in his pocket he was in short lost as for mr armstrong not seeing his charge at the door he had started to run in the direction of the hotel which was the opposite direction to that taken by tom seeing no sign of the prodigal he too returned to the hall just after tom had started a second time on the contrary tack and so for an hour these two played hide and seek sometimes almost within reach of one another at others with the whole length of the street between them at last the crowd on the pavement thinned and the tutor sorely chagrined started off to the hotel on the chance of the boy having turned up there no tom was there tom in fact was at that moment debating somewhere about a mile and a half away whether he should not try to make his way to the oriana at the docks and remain quietly there till claimed what a joke it would all be when he was found what an adventure for his first night in london it was not very easy even for tom oliphant to derive much amusement from these philosophical reflections and he looked about him rather dismally for some one of whom to inquire his way a seedy looking person was standing under a lamppost hard by trying to light a cigarette in the wind tom decided to tackle him please can you tell me the way to the docks where the p and o steamers come in said he the man let drop his match and stared at the boy vy said he with an odd shrug that is some long walks from here mais comment vas you not at ze christy minstrel to night viz a nice gentleman rather said the boy were you there i say wasn't it a clipping turn out i did like it especially the break down i say i'm lost the fellow who was looking after me has lost me oh you 'ave lost 'im i am 'appy you to find you sall not valk to ze dock no i sall give you sleeps at ze hotel and to morrow you sall find zat dear gentleman come wiz me oh but you know he'll be looking for me besides i've got no tin father forgot to leave me any i'd better go to the docks i say you sall not zey will be all shut fast zere no my dear friend you sall come sleep at my hotel and you sall have nothings to pay it will be all right i would die for to help ze friend of my friend is mr armstrong a friend of yours asked the boy i thought you were only cheeking him that time in the hall oh all right if you know him thanks awfully gustav as delighted as a cat who has found her kitten led the boy off jubilantly to his third rate hotel off the strand taking the precaution as he passed to leave word at the hall that if a gentleman called who had lost a boy he should be told where he would find him he smuggled tom up to his own garret and made him royally welcome with three quarters of his scanty supper and the whole of his narrow bed sleeping himself on the floor cheerfully for the sake of the cher ami who had that night promised to go to paris to hold the hand of his dying father about three in the morning there was a loud ringing of the bell and a sound of steps and voices on the stairs and presently mr armstrong entered the room gustav sprang up with his finger on his lips pointing to the sleeping boy oh mon ami whispered he 'ow 'appy i am you 'ave found 'im but i keep him ver' safe i love to do it for you are ver' good to me and the pauvre pere he sall rest here till to day vile you helas that i have no two beds to offer you you sall take one in ze hotel and at morning we sall all be 'appy together mr armstrong grimly accepted this proposal and took a room for the night at gustav's hotel the next morning scarcely waiting to take breakfast or bid another adieu to his grateful friend he hurried the genial tom who had enjoyed himself extremely to the station and carried him down by express train to maxfield chapter five a churchyard cough when mr armstrong with his jovial charge arrived about midday at maxfield he was struck with the transformation scene which had taken place since he quitted it gloomily a day or two before the house was the same the furniture was untouched the ordinary domestic routine appeared to be unaltered but a sense of something new pervaded the place which he could interpret only by the one word oliphant the captain had made a touching entry full of sympathy full of affection full of a desire to spare his dear cousin all business worry full of the responsibility that was on him to take charge of the dear fatherless boy full of that calm sense of duty which enables a man to assert himself on all occasions for the good of those committed to his care as for his charming daughters they had floated majestically into their quarters miss rosalind a trifle defiantly making no secret of her dislike of the whole business miss jill merrily delighted with the novelty and beauty of this new home so much more to her mind than the barrack home in india and roger despite all his sinister anticipations found himself tolerant already of the new guardian and more than tolerant of his suite for somehow his pulses had taken to beating a little quicker since yesterday and when half a dozen times that evening he had heard a summons down the landing to come and hang this picture or like a dear boy unfasten that strap or like an angel come and make himself agreeable unless he intended his cousins to sit by themselves all the evening as penance for coming where they were not wanted at all such summonses roger ingleton had experienced quite a novel sensation of nervousness and awkwardness which contributed to make him very uncomfortable why said he as he and his tutor greeted one another again in mr armstrong's room why it seems ages since i saw you and yet it's only yesterday i wish we could all have come down together do you know armstrong i half fancy it's not going to be as awful as i expected that's all right said mr armstrong who had already begun to entertain a contrary impression oliphant seems civilly disposed and not inclined to interfere and the girls well they seem harmless enough how do you like tom tom's a nice quiet business like boy said the tutor with a grin i'll tell you more about him soon but at present i have no time i must catch the four o'clock train back to london what what ever for exclaimed roger with falling face urgent private affairs i shall be away perhaps a week said mr armstrong shortly in a tone which discouraged roger from making further inquiries i'm awfully sorry said he i shall miss you specially just now if i could have taken any other time i would said the tutor busily throwing his things into his bag all the time but i am going to a death bed oh armstrong i'm so sorry is it a relation as i regard relations yes now i must go and make my apologies to your mother i'll come and see you before i go he found the lady sitting in the library in consultation with captain oliphant the table was spread with the late squire's papers and documents concerning which the captain was evincing considerable interest the tutor glared a little through his glass at the spectacle of this industry and disposing of his co trustee's greeting with a half nod accosted mrs ingleton i must ask you to excuse me for a few days mrs ingleton i have just received news which render a journey necessary indeed said captain oliphant looking up from his papers i am afraid mr armstrong we must ask you to postpone it as there are a good many business matters of importance to be gone into which will require the attention of all the trustees it is an inconvenient time to seek for leave of absence the tutor's mouth stiffened ominously you take unnecessary interest in my affairs sir i shall be at your service on my return mrs ingleton i am sorry for this interruption in roger's studies it shall be as brief as i can make it oh of course mr armstrong said the lady i hope it is nothing serious we shall be glad to have you back to consult about things that is all captain oliphant means i'm sure the tutor bowed i really hope said captain oliphant blandly mr armstrong will appreciate my desire to cooperate harmoniously in the sacred trust laid upon us all by the dying wish of our dear friend i have no wish to do anything else sir said the tutor shortly if you will allow me good bye mrs ingleton roger was a good deal concerned to notice the grim cloud on his friend's face when he returned for a moment to his room for his bag he knew him too well to ask questions but made up for his silence by the warmth of his farewell come back soon armstrong it will be awfully slow while you're away let's carry your bag down stairs as they passed the end of the lobby a certain door chanced to open and armstrong caught a vision of an easel and a fair head beyond and beyond that a mantelpiece decorated with all sorts of oriental and feminine knick knacks he might have observed more had his glass been up and had he not been eagerly accosted by miss jill who just then was running out of the room mr armstrong mr armstrong shouted she in glee rosalind he's come back here he is and without more ado she caught the embarrassed tutor by the arm and demanded a kiss he compromised feebly by patting her head whereat miss jill pouted you're more unkind than yesterday she said you kissed me then you shouldn't ask mr armstrong to do horrid things said miss rosalind coming to the door the tutor very hot and flurried replied to this cruel challenge by saluting the little tyrant and bowing to her sister won't you come in and see the studio said the latter it's a little less dreadful than yesterday thanks to roger what are you carrying that bag for roger armstrong's going up to town for a few days how horrid said miss rosalind with vexation in her voice just while jill and i are feeling so lonely cooped up here like nuns with not a soul to talk to and knowing we're in everybody's way armstrong has a sad enough reason for going said roger but i say it's not very complimentary to me to say you've not a soul to talk to the half jesting petulance in rosalind's face had given place to a look almost of pain as she held out her hand good bye mr armstrong said she i didn't know you were in trouble it will be jolly when you come home chimed in jill somehow in mr armstrong's ears as he whirled along to town that afternoon those two pretty farewells rang continuous changes when at evening he took his seat in the dover express they still followed him now in solos now in duet now in restless fugue on the steamer they rose and fell with the uneasy waves and played in the whistling wind as he sped towards paris past the acacia hedges and poplar avenues among foreign scenes amidst the chatter of foreign tongues surrounded by foreign faces he still caught the sound of those two distant voices one quiet and low the other gay and piping and even when at last he dropped asleep and forgot everything else they joined in with the rattle of the rail to give him his lullaby such are the freaks of which a sensitive musical ear is often the victim at maxfield meanwhile he remained in the minds of one or two of the inmates the two young ladies assisted by their cousin and genially obstructed by their easy going brother proceeded seriously in the task of adorning the studio now and then speculating about the absent tutor and now and then feeling very dejected and lonely roger did his best to enliven the evening and make his visitors feel at home but although tom and jill readily consented to be comforted miss rosalind as stubbornly refused and protested a score of times that the cabin of the oriana itself was preferable to the misery of being condemned as she termed it to eat her head off in this dismal place she was sorry for mr armstrong but she was vexed too that he should go off the very first day after her arrival and leave her to fight her battles alone after that talk on the steamer she had in her own mind reckoned on him as an ally and it disappointed her not to find him at her bidding after all but she was not the only person whose mind was exercised by the tutor's abrupt exodus captain oliphant felt decidedly hurt by the manner of his going it argued a lack of appreciation of the newly arrived trustee's position in the household on which he had hardly calculated and it bespoke a spirit of independence in the tutor himself which his colleague could not but regard as unpromising indeed when after the day's labours captain oliphant sought the seclusion of his own apartment this amiable pleasant spoken gentleman grew quite warm with himself who is this grandee he asked himself a man hired at a few pounds a year and fed at the maxfield table in order to help the heir to a little quite unnecessary knowledge of the ancient classics and modern sciences what was the old dotard the old dotard by the way was captain oliphant's private manner of referring to the lamented dear one whose name so often trembled on his lips in public what was the old dotard thinking about at any rate i should like to know a little more about the fellow myself with this laudable intention he questioned mrs ingleton next morning he is a good friend to dear roger said the mother roger is devoted to him i am sure you will get to like him edward he is perhaps a little odd in his manner but he has a good heart this was about all mrs ingleton knew except that he was a university man and an accomplished musician captain oliphant was not much enlightened by this description he sat down and for the third time carefully read over the dear one's will i think said he at lunch time i will stroll over to yeld this afternoon and see mr pottinger roger will you walk with me a walk would do you good you are looking pale my boy oh i'm all right said roger whose cough however was still obstinate i'll come with pleasure a walk of five miles on a damp afternoon through drenched country lanes may be a good specific for a cough in india but in england it occasionally fails in this respect roger was wet through when he reached yeld i shall not be long said the captain as they reached the attorney's door don't catch cold there's a good fellow remember your health is very precious roger undertook to act on this considerate advice and occupied his time of waiting by strolling up and down the high street in the rain paying a call here and there at one or two shops and finally dropping in to see his friend dr brandram the captain meanwhile was having an interesting chat with the attorney after introducing himself and receiving the suitable congratulations he said mr ingleton's will mr pottinger so far as i can understand it seems fairly simple and i am ready and anxious to perform my part of its provisions yes you see after all it is only a matter of two years' trouble as soon as master roger comes of age you will be released unless says the captain laughing he marries becomes mad or goes to prison isn't that it what a curious proviso it is the old squire had his peculiarities like most of us he set his heart on this boy turning out well ah i presume this tutor mr armstrong has very high qualifications since so much depends on him of that i can't say captain oliphant to tell you the truth i never quite understood that appointment but doubtless the squire knew best doubtless he must have had a very high opinion of him to associate him with mrs ingleton and me in the guardianship i take it by the way that hardly extends beyond his present duties as tutor that's just it said mr pottinger according to the will he has the right to participate in every action taken by the other trustees either as regards the boy or the estate or anything else how very singular you don't mean to say that he is to be consulted in matters of finance or the management of the property technically yes if he claims it i imagine however he is hardly aware of this and i am not inclined to urge him to claim it i should be sorry to give you an unfavourable impression captain oliphant but i do not like this mr armstrong he appears to be well thought of at maxfield said the captain my private opinion is but you must not let it influence you that he is somewhat of an adventurer i know nothing of his antecedents indeed not even where he lives no the squire was reticent on the matter he told me he had good recommendations with him and that he was an oxford man surely that should be satisfactory i hope we shall find him not difficult to get on with after all we shall have to wait a week or so however before putting the question to the test as he has just gone off rather abruptly and at this particular time rather inopportunely on a journey for what object i do not know humph said the attorney i do not like mysteries however i trust it will be as you say dr brandram when presently the captain called in for his ward was in by no means a good temper i have been blowing roger up sky high said he puffing his smoke rather viciously in the captain's direction for behaving like a lunatic the idea of his coming out and getting himself wet through with this cold upon him dear dear said the captain has he got wet through why my dear boy what did i tell you you shouldn't have let him come said the doctor bluntly he's no business to play tricks with himself really doctor said roger laughing and coughing alternately i'm not a baby you're worse said the doctor severely don't let it happen again you must go home in a fly i won't allow you to walk armstrong wouldn't have let you do it it grated on the captain's nerves to hear the tutor thus quoted in what seemed to be a reflection on himself roger my boy said he you are fortunate to have somebody to look well after you i quite agree with the doctor we must drive home i hope your things are dry he's made me change everything i had on said roger quite right quite right the doctor took an opportunity before the fly arrived of talking to the captain seriously about his ward's health he's not robust you can see that yourself said he and he won't take care of himself that's equally evident you must make him do it or i won't answer for the consequences the captain laughed pleasantly my duties grow on me apace said he i have come over from india to look after his morals his estate his education and now i find i must add to them the oversight of of his flannels certainly see they are well aired that's more important than any of the others good bye the maxfield household was a dismal one that evening mrs ingleton in distress had prevailed on roger to go to bed miss rosalind defrauded in one day of her two allies sulked in a dignified way in her own room and visited her displeasure with the world in general on poor jill who consoled herself by beginning a letter to her dear mr armstrong tom having wandered joyously over the whole house making friends with everybody and admiring everything was engaged in the feverish occupation of trying to find his stamp album which he had left behind in india the only serene member of the party was captain oliphant who in the arm chair of the library smoked an excellent cigar and ruminated on things at large poor lad said he to himself great pity he's so delicate not at all a pleasant cough quite a churchyard tone about it tut tut i'm not favourably impressed with that doctor an officious bumpkin he seems to me and this armstrong i should really like to know a little more about him pottinger was decidedly of my way of thinking not a nice fellow at all armstrong wrong sort of companion for roger poor fellow how he's coughing to night and this kindly soul actually laid down his cigar and went out into the passage to listen shocking cough said he as he returned and relit his cigar then he took out a document from his pocket a copy of the will in fact and read it again which done he relapsed into genial meditation ones more presently his kindly feelings prompted him to pay his ward a visit well my boy how are you better i hope oh yes said roger coughing it's only a cold in my head i'll soon be all right i'm awfully sorry to desert the girls and tom tell them nothing i can do for you is there thanks very much i'm all right i shall get to sleep pretty soon good night cousin edward good night dear boy another time you must take better care of yourself remember your life is precious to us all with these affectionate words captain oliphant left the room candle in hand as he passed his daughter's boudoir he looked in it was empty the young ladies had long since taken refuge in their bedroom all the house in fact except captain oliphant had done the same that gentleman as he passed another door which stood half open could not resist a friendly impulse to peep in it was a snug room with a piano in one corner and foils boxing gloves oxford prints and other tokens of a bachelor proprietorship displayed on the walls the table was littered with classical exercises music scores and letters a college boating jacket hung behind the door and one or two prize goblets decorated the mantelpiece captain oliphant displayed a genial interest in everything he read the inscriptions on the goblets glanced casually through the papers read the addresses on a few of the letters and generally took stock of the apartment of course like an honourable gentleman he disturbed nothing and presently distressed by a sudden fit of coughing from the direction of his ward's room he hastily stepped out into the lobby again and made his way back to the library before he went to bed this methodical person committed three several matters to paper in his memorandum book he wrote the name of a certain college at oxford and a date corresponding oddly enough to the name and date on one of the goblets in mr armstrong's room that done he scrawled a post card to dr brandram requesting him to call and see roger whose cough was still a little troublesome after that he pulled out of his pocket and read with a somewhat pained expression a letter he had received the day before by the indian mail it was gather long but the passage which pained captain oliphant particularly ran thus the trouble about the mess accounts is not blown over yet i have done what i can for you i hope you will make it unnecessary for me to enter into details with the parties chiefly interested in that affair it depends pretty much on what you are able to tell me whether i can give you the time you mention in your last you will consult your own interests best by being quite square and so on the expression which captain oliphant mentally applied to the writer as he re read this pleasant passage was not wholly flattering and his countenance as i have said bore traces of considerable pain however after a little meditation it cleared somewhat and he wrote it seems to me a pity you should take up a position which can only end in trouble all round you know how things stand and how impossible it is to hasten matters at the present moment there seems every probability of my being able to discharge all my accounts yours among them considerably earlier than the time first mentioned it is worth your while under the circumstances reconsidering what you must allow me to say is a preposterous claim for interest of course if you charge me for the full term i have very little inducement to settle up sooner turn it over like a sensible man and believe me meanwhile yours truly eo ps i enclose a copy of the clauses of the will most likely to interest you i am sorry to say my ward is in very bad i might say seriously bad health he has a constitutional complaint which i greatly fear will make this winter a most anxious time to us all after this captain oliphant soothed himself down with a cigarette and spent a little time in admiring contemplation of an excellent portrait of mrs ingleton on the wall finally he went cheerfully to bed chapter six a case of eviction a week passed and mr armstrong did not return by the end of that time miss rosalind oliphant for better or worse had settled down into her new quarters and made herself as much at home as a fair bohemian can do anywhere she still resented the fate which brought her to maxfield at all and annoyed her father constantly by casting their dependence on the hospitality of the place in his teeth i wish you had some business father said she so that we could pay our way i don't suppose my pictures will ever sell but every penny i earn shall go to roger couldn't we go and live in the lodge somewhere where we can rosalind said her father you vex me by talking like a child after the education i have tried to provide for you i had a right to hope you would at least regulate your tongue by a little common sense do you not know that i have given up my profession everything in order to come to do my duty here i wish you hadn't said the girl doggedly it would have been so easy to decline the trust and remain independent it's awful to think we've nothing to live on but what we get out of roger's money foolish girl said her father with a forced laugh you are a delightful specimen of a woman's incapacity to understand the very rudiments of business why you absurd child old roger ingleton's will bequeathed me l a year for acting as the boy's guardian yes for two years and roger would have been all that richer if you'd declined i'm sure his mother and mr armstrong are plenty to look after him i'd have liked you so much better dear father if you'd stayed in the army i'm afraid my poor girl it is useless to argue with you when you do get a wrong idea into your head nothing will induce you to part with it even if it involves an injustice to your poor father father said she you know it is because i love you and enough said he rather sternly i know you mean well and he went at the door however he returned and said by the way rosalind i must mention one matter not for discussion but as my express wish you named mr armstrong just now i desire that you hold no communication with him i have reason for knowing he is not a desirable person at all if so you had better take us away from here said rosalind flushing you've no right to let us stay silence miss and bear in mind what i tell you do you understand rosalind had taken up her brush and was painting furiously at her picture captain oliphant having waited a minute for an answer and getting none stalked out of the room a model of parental anguish as for miss rosalind she painted away for a quarter of an hour and then said to herself is he with which profound inquiry she laid down her brush and went to visit her invalid cousin roger was up though still coughing and ensconced in his study how jolly of you to come said he i came because i'd nothing else to do said she i'm not jolly at all why what's the row can't you guess don't you know that i owe you already for a week's board and lodgings and haven't earned sixpence to pay you i shall put you in the county court said roger solemnly it's no joke to me said she i know it isn't and i wish to goodness i could help you out by the way though added he jumping up from his chair i've got it don't said she you'll only start the cough what have you got an idea yes rosalind do you know i'm going to get some painting lessons where oh i wish i could afford some too is there any one near here who teaches yes some one who's just starting a rather jolly girl only she has an awful temper and i'm afraid when she sees what a poor hand i make she'll have no patience with me rosalind looked at him steadily and then smiled how nice of you may i really try i'll teach you all i know will you promise to be nice and never to fly out at me no i'll promise nothing of the sort but if you learn well i'll be very proud and your terms she looked at him again would a shilling an hour be an awful lot no it's very moderate i accept the terms i'll begin to day this satisfactory bargain being concluded miss rosalind inquired how her new pupil's cold was nearly all right i'm glad to have got rid of it before armstrong comes back when will that be i don't know he hasn't written a line i hope he'll come soon are you awfully fond of him asked rosalind rather replied the boy that's exactly what he said when i asked him if he was fond of you odd said roger with a laugh but i say what do you think of my den isn't it rather snug i like one of the pictures said rosalind pointing to a certain portrait on the mantelpiece i'm awfully glad said roger do you know who it is no a brother of mine who died long before i was born rosalind took the picture in her hands and carried it to the window the scrutiny lasted some minutes then she replaced it on the chimney piece well said roger do you like him yes i do aren't you a little afraid of him too not a bit he looks like a hero roger sighed i'm glad there's one in the family said he why not two i say will your tutor mind your having painting lessons of me mind not he i shouldn't be surprised if he wants to have some too rosalind laughed that would be too terrible said she but i must go now will you lend me this picture for a little i'd like to look at it again roger laughed oh yes if you'll promise not to fall in love with him for good when roger presented himself at the appointed hour in his cousin's studio he found that young lady very much in earnest and not at all disposed to regard her new functions as a jest roger who had come expecting to be amused found himself ignominiously set down at a table beside the amenable tom who had been coerced into joining the class and directed to copy a very elementary representation of a gable of a cottage which the instructress had set up on the easel six times was he compelled to tackle this simple object before his copy was pronounced passable and until that rosalind sternly discouraged all conversation or inattention really roger said she when at last he meekly submitted his final copy for a boy of your age you are an uncommonly rough hand tom is a much more promising pupil than you i haven't promised you a bob an hour though rejoined that not to be flattered genius beginning to whistle silence sir said miss rosalind stamping her little foot with something like temper as long as you are in my class you must do as i tell you here roger protested you're rather strict said he i don't mind working hard and attending to all you say but i vote we enjoy ourselves too all three of us you mean said rosalind petulantly that you come here to play while i try to work no i don't i come to do both and i want you to as well very well then i withdraw from my engagement said the young lady with an ominous flush we don't agree about art unless you can give yourself up to it while you are about it it's not meant for you and and i'm very sorry indeed i made such a stupid mistake as to think you meant what you said when you told me you wanted to learn and she took the copy down from the easel look here rosalind said roger in unusual perturbation i'm so sorry you're quite right of course one can't do two things at once i'll you're a dear boy as i've said before said miss oliphant brightening up suddenly and accepting her victory serenely now please both of you draw the picture again from memory as exactly as you can what's the long and short of it all presently whispered tom who had been supremely indifferent to the argument is it larks or no larks shut up that's what it is said roger all right thanks said tom contentedly and for a quarter of an hour more the two worked steadily and silently the only sound in the room being the scratching of their pencils and rosalind's occasional terse criticisms over their shoulders this little incident opened roger's eyes considerably he was astonished at himself afterwards for taking his rebuff so meekly and submitting to what after all was rather a preposterous regulation he was aware that he would not have submitted to any one but rosalind or possibly armstrong why he should do so to her he did not particularly know unless it was because he felt it would be pleasanter on the whole to have her as a friend than as a foe when three days later mr armstrong neither appeared nor communicated with any member of the household the uneasiness which his prolonged absence caused found expression in several different ways miss jill cried in a corner miss rosalind tossed her head and painted fiercely roger already pulled down with a return of his cough moped in his own room while his mother impressed by the growing indignation of her cousin began to work herself into a mild state of wrath tom alone was serene i expect he's having a jolly time with that french chap he volunteered at the family dinner with whom inquired his father pricking his ears oh a chum of his not half a bad sort of cove only he dropped all his h's' he turned up at christy's you know but missed the best break down while he and mr armstrong were hob nobbing outside i saw it though it was prime why didn't you tell me this before demanded captain oliphant i didn't know you'd care about it said his son in mild surprise you see it was this way the fellow had wooden shoes on and when the music began slow he began a shuffle and gradually put on the pace till you couldn't tell one foot from the other here miss rosalind broke into a derisive laugh really tom said she you are too clever however did you guess that we were all dying to hear how a break down is danced i didn't till father said so here roger and the two young ladies laughed again whereat tom concluding he had said something good unawares laughed too and thought to himself how jolly it is to be clever and keep the table at a roar in private captain oliphant pursued the subject of gustav and his relations apart from their mutual connexion with the break down with the maxfield tutor he received very little satisfaction from his inquiry tom was so full of his main topic that the other events of that memorable evening in town occupied but a secondary place in his memory he recollected gustav as a good natured foreigner whom armstrong called by his christian name and who talked french in return he could not remember where he lived except that it was ten minutes' walk from christy's minstrels nor had he the slightest idea what the two men talked about except that armstrong had promised to hold somebody's hand and that gustav had tried to kiss him by way of recompense captain oliphant chose to take a very serious view of this disclosure it fitted in exactly with his theory that the tutor was an adventurer of shady antecedents and as such an undesirable companion for the late dear one's orphan boy i should not feel i was doing my duty said he to mr pottinger that afternoon if i were not to follow this up we don't know whom we have to deal with and the fact of mr ingleton having confided in him really you know weighs very little with me old men of enfeebled intellect my dear pottinger are so easily hoodwinked quite so does it not occur to you captain that a simple solution of the difficulty would be for mrs ingleton to send her boy to college mrs ingleton said the captain is unfortunately incapable of regarding this subject in any light but that of her son's likings and roger ingleton minor is infatuated humph said the lawyer i thought so then i agree with you it will be useful to institute a few inquiries leave that to me said the captain by the way what about that piece of land you were speaking of ah said the lawyer making as near an approach to a blush as he could muster the fact is hodder's lease falls in next week he has had it at a ridiculously low figure and is not a profitable tenant that is the old dotard who is always croaking about maxfield in the days before the flood well almost as remote a period he was here in the time of the late squire's father at any rate his lease falls in and i happen to know a person who is willing to give twenty per cent more for the land than he pays i can't tell you his name said the lawyer looking sufficiently conscious but i happen to know he would be a better tenant to maxfield than the old man mr pottinger amused himself with making a little mystery about a matter that was no secret to captain oliphant that gallant gentleman knew as well as the lawyer did that mr pottinger himself whose land adjoined hodder's was the eligible tenant in question there will be no difficulty about that pottinger of course you must give hodder the option of offering your friend's price if he does not it is clearly the duty of the executors to take the better tenant he took up his hat and turned to go by the way said he at the door it will hardly be necessary i take it to go through the farce of bringing a trifling matter of this kind before the other executors mrs ingleton should really be spared all worry of this sort and as for the other one well he chooses to be somewhere else quite so quite so if you and mrs ingleton sign the lease it will be sufficient said mr pottinger unluckily for the pleasantly arranged plan of these two good gentlemen miss rosalind oliphant took it into her pretty head a day or so afterwards to call at old hodder's cottage in passing to ask for a glass of milk the young lady was in a very discontented frame of mind she was angry with mr armstrong for staying away so long not that she cared what he did but till he came back she felt she did not know the full extent of the forces arrayed against her at maxfield and she wanted to know the worst besides although roger was diligently prosecuting his art studies and displaying the most docile obedience to her discipline she could not help thinking he would not have taken to art except to please her and that displeased her mightily besides tom her brother was too silly for anything he insisted on enjoying himself whoever else was miserable and jill was very little better altogether miss oliphant was out of humour and felt this walk would do her good she found the hodder family in mighty tribulation the old man sat in his corner with his hat on the floor beside him crying and boohing like a child and his two little granddaughters looked on at his grief pale and half frightened knowing something bad had happened but unable to guess what why hodder said miss rosalind whatever's the matter what a noise you're making what has happened happened cried the old man with a voice quavering into a shrill treble how would he like it himself seventy years boy and man have i sat here like my father before me i've seen yon elm grow from a stick to what she is now i've buried all my kith and kin bar them two lassies of course i know you're very old but why are you crying demanded rosalind crying wouldn't you cry missy if you was to be turned neck and crop into the road at threescore years and ten nonsense what do you mean come tuesday sobbed the old man me and the lassies will be trespassers in this here very place what exclaimed miss rosalind do you mean you're to be turned out who dares to do such a thing you go and ask mr pottinger if you doubt it blubbered the old man he ought to know without another word miss rosalind flung herself from the cottage and marched straight for the lawyer's pale with bosom heaving and a light in her eyes that armstrong had he been there to see it would have shivered at mr pottinger said she breaking unceremoniously into the lawyer's private room what is this i hear how dare you frighten old hodder by talking about his leaving his farm the lawyer stared at this beautiful apparition not knowing whether to be amused or angry it was the first time any one in maxfield had addressed him in this strain and the sensation was so novel that he felt fairly taken aback really dear young lady i am delighted with any excuse that gives me the pleasure of a visit from mr pottinger said the young lady in a tone which made him open his eyes still wider will you tell me yes or no if what hodder tells me is true that depends on what hodder says replied the lawyer trying to look cheerful he says he has had notice to leave his farm next week is that true that entirely depends on himself if i must suffer cross examination from so charming a counsel you mean i mean my pretty young lady that if he chooses to pay the new rent he is entitled to stay you have raised his rent a poor old man of seventy five i have no power to do that but i understand he has had the land for next to nothing it is worth more now mr pottinger said miss rosalind let me tell you that if you have any hand in this wicked business you are a bad man whatever you profess to be i shouldn't sleep to night if i failed to tell you that so is everybody who dares treat an old man thus pardon me miss oliphant that is not quite respectful to your own father she rounded on him with trembling lips my father she began and faltered my father is not the sort of man to do a thing of this kind unless he were cajoled into it by some some some one like you mr pottinger with which she left the room much to the lawyer's relief who tried to laugh to himself at the pretty vixen but couldn't be as merry as he would have wished rosalind on her return to maxfield went straight with flashing eyes to roger's room and told him the story roger she said if you are half a man you will stop it you are master here or will be are you going to let this poor old man be turned out of his home you are not the dear boy i take you for if you are of course it must be stopped said roger amazed at her vehemence and it shall be i always thought pottinger a sneak i assure you rosalind i shall make poor old hodder happy before we are a day older so good bye i'll go at once but he was no match for the lawyer who politely recounted the circumstances and referred him to his guardians who however as he pointed out had no choice but to accept the best paying tenant it is done in your interest my dear boy said mr pottinger we are bound to consider your interests whether you like it or not mortified beyond measure both on his own account and at the prospect of facing rosalind roger returned slowly to maxfield as he entered a hand was laid on his shoulder mr armstrong had come back chapter seven mr armstrong puts down his foot mr armstrong as unconcerned as if he had just returned from a half hour's stroll had little idea of the flutter which his return caused to the maxfield family he could hardly know that raffles was parading the lower regions rubbing his hands and informing his acquaintance down there that the season for larks was coming on nor as he was out of earshot could he be supposed to know the particularly forcible expressions which captain oliphant rehearsed to himself in celebration of the occasion as for the young people it did afford him a passing gratification to feel his pupil's arm linked once more in his own and to encounter the expected boisterous welcome from tom and jill miss rosalind was busy forsooth and if mr armstrong flattered himself she took the slightest interest in his return he might find out his mistake i'll join you in a minute roger said he to his ward but i must go and pay my respects to your mother oh she'll keep said roger i want to hear what you've been up to in five minutes said the tutor going to the drawing room mrs ingleton was there looking pale and fragile pouring out afternoon tea for captain oliphant why mr armstrong said she we had given you up for lost roger was getting quite melancholy without you i understood began the captain when you asked leave mrs ingleton i must ask you to excuse my long absence i went to see a dying friend and was unable to return earlier you might have written said the captain returning to the charge mr armstrong screwed his eye glass round and stared at the speaker i beg your pardon said he i say sir you might have written let me tell you mr armstrong that as my dear relative's co trustee and guardian i am sorry observed the tutor addressing mrs ingleton that roger's cough is still troubling him he is waiting for me upstairs by the bye but i was anxious to offer you my apologies without delay for my long absence mr armstrong said the captain stepping between the tutor and the door this will not do sir when i speak to you i expect you to listen mr armstrong bowed politely i repeat sir your conduct satisfies neither me nor your mistress you forget sir that you are here on sufferance and i desire to caution you that it may become necessary to dispense with your services unless i am speaking to you mr armstrong mr armstrong was examining with some curiosity a china group on the mantelpiece he turned round gravely you were saying said he the captain gave it up we shall discuss this matter some other time said he pray pray said mrs ingleton with tears in her eyes let us not forget that my boy's happiness depends on our harmony i am sure mr armstrong recognises that i depend on you both mr armstrong bowed again and finding that the captain had returned to his chair he quietly left the room when he entered roger's room humming a tune to himself he neither looked like a man who had returned from a funeral or from an altercation in the drawing room in five minutes he was in possession of most of what had taken place during his absence of roger's cold of the painting lessons of tom's reminiscences of christy's minstrels and most of all of hodder's tribulation and what sort of an artist are you turning out inquired he oh all right but i say armstrong i want you to make it right about hodder before anything will you come and see him my dear fellow hodder is as safe in his cottage as you are here leave that to your responsible guardian my present intention is to work on the tender mercies of raffles for some dinner i have travelled right through from paris since this morning your friend died inquired roger yes i was in time to be of some little help i think but he was past recovery how is miss oliphant all right but in an awful state about old hodder i'm afraid to meet her myself she will be relieved to have you back will she really said the tutor laughing i hardly flatter myself her comfort depends on which particular hemisphere i happen to be in miss oliphant as it happened had taken to a spell of hard work in her studio and was not visible all the evening she was in fact making a copy of the portrait roger had lent her and the work interested her greatly this bold fearless almost insolent boy's face fascinated her she seemed to be able to interpret the defiance that flashed in his eye and to solve the problem which gathered on his half mocking lips she was half afraid half enamoured of this old piece of canvas why are not you here now she muttered as she gazed at it you don't look like the sort of boy to die should we be friends or enemies heigho i shouldn't care much which if only you were here roger minor is a dear boy but you are she didn't say what he was but worked late into the night with her copy at bedtime jill came in radiant he's come back rosalind dear mr armstrong's come back oh said rosalind shortly aren't you glad oh i am why should i be glad i don't care two straws for all the mr armstrongs in the world go to bed jill and don't be a goose jill obeyed a little discomfited and was sound asleep long before the artist joined her and long before she woke from her dreams next morning rosalind was astir and abroad she had resolved to pay an early call on old hodder if not to relieve his mind about the eviction at least to take him some comfort in the shape of a little tea and sugar the old man was sitting outside the cottage smoking and moaning to himself he cheered up a bit at the sight of his visitor still more at the sight of the tea but it was a short lived gleam of comfort and he relapsed at the earliest opportunity into the doleful little good it'll do me said he as have known this place man and boy seventy five years missy never a word did they say to me till now the old squire had allers his nod for hodder and when times was bad he let the rent stand and young master roger was of the same sort oh roger is your friend still said rosalind he's doing everything to help you i don't mean him he's good enough but he's a boy but young master roger as was he had a will of his own missy not one of 'em durst stand up to him rosalind became interested do you mean the one who died said she ay they say he died they said as much and wrote it on the tombstone do you mean that there was ever a doubt about it said the young lady uncomfortably they said he died so he must have died said old hodder sipping his tea it was all talk to the likes of me young master roger wasn't of the dying sort he went abroad i hear she asked so they say it's a score of years or more since i tell 'ee missy young master roger wouldn't have stood by to see me turned out like this he'd have here there was a click at the gate and a long shadow fell on the footpath it was mr armstrong in his flannels he looked somewhat alarmed to find miss rosalind in possession still more to perceive that she proposed to remain where she was his impulse was to make a feeble excuse and say he would call again but his courage revived on second thoughts ah hodder said he after saluting the young lady what's all this about turning you out of your cottage what a notion to get into your head you may call it a notion mr armstrong said the old man but what about this here piece of paper and he produced a blue legal document mr armstrong put up his eye glass and read it with a face which as rosalind furtively glanced upwards seemed inscrutable when he had finished he coolly put it in his pocket i'll see to this said he you choose the best time of day for a walk miss oliphant shall you really be able to settle this for hodder replied she i've very little doubt about it the old man chuckled ungallantly he he said he missy you ladies are good enough for tea and sugar but it takes a man to put the likes of me right with my masters armstrong flushed angrily at this speech and was about to relieve his mind when rosalind laughingly interposed poor old hodder you're quite right i should never have been clever enough to help you good bye i'm so glad to tell the truth miss oliphant was a good deal more engrossed with what the old man had let drop concerning the lost roger than with the tutor and his knowledge of the law of landlord and tenant suppose he did not die she said half scared at the boldness of the suggestion if he were to come back and she went back and looked long once more at the picture then with less satisfaction she contemplated her own copy thus employed roger found her when he passed her door an hour later still harping on my brother said he i've done with him thank you said rosalind handing him back the picture see i have one of my own now why it's better than the original i like it better that shows how little you know about painting it shows how much you know about my brother said he but if you like to keep the original and let me have the copy i should consider i had the best of the bargain rosalind tossed her head and locked her own copy up in her desk roger she said when that was done where did he die the date is on the picture if one could only make it out he was abroad at the time i believe where i never heard have you never tried to find out roger looked at her startled it was before i was born said he father never spoke of him but why do you ask only a girl's curiosity i thought if any one knew you would but there is the bell for lunch armstrong meanwhile had been having an interview of a different kind he strolled into mr pottinger's office almost at the same time as that worthy lawyer himself so you are back asked the latter yes and quite at your service said the tutor i am afraid my absence has been inconvenient but i am ready for business now by the way i have brought you back a document which must have been left on old hodder by mistake i certainly did not sanction it the lawyer sat back in his chair and gazed at the tutor through his spectacles mr armstrong leaning against the chimney piece put up his glass and gazed leisurely back the two men understood one another pretty well already the notice is quite in order i have captain oliphant's instructions and mine you were not here i am here now and i object to hodder's being disturbed do i make myself clear but you must excuse me mr pottinger i shall be glad to discuss the matter with you in the presence of my co trustees meanwhile good morning the lawyer jumped out of his chair like a man shot what sir you an interloper an adventurer a nobody a parasite do you suppose i am going to be talked to by you as if i didn't know my own duty do you know master usher that you can any day receive a week's notice of dismissal a month's i think observed the tutor taking up his hat in that respect perhaps i have the advantage of the solicitor to the trust however we won't talk of that just now good morning again mr armstrong looked in on his friend the doctor whom he found in an opportune moment at breakfast the two men had a long chat over their coffee and finally adjourned for a walk along the shore ending up with a cool spring dip in sheephaven cove after which much refreshed and glad to be once more in his familiar haunts the tutor strolled cheerfully back to maxfield for lunch he was quite aware things had undergone a change he had two new enemies but he was not afraid of them he had a new pupil but he liked him he had a devoted new champion in the shape of a little girl but that was no hardship roger too despite his new friends was still loyal to his tutor and mrs ingleton by all appearances still regarded him as a useful friend what then was the difference it could hardly have anything to do with a certain young person half his own age with whom the tutor had not had two hours' continuous conversation in his life and of whose behaviour generally he did not at all know whether he approved or not ridiculous said mr armstrong to himself with a smile as he strolled up the carriage drive at that moment the distant hall door opened and a light figure stepped out for a moment on to the door step to pat the great mastiff that lay sleeping on the mat the apparition the caress and the vanishing occupied scarcely half a minute and when it was past mr armstrong was only ten paces nearer the house than he had been when it appeared but somehow in those few seconds the amused smile on his lips faded away and the eye glass dropped somewhat limply from his eye as he repeated to himself more emphatically than before ridiculous at lunch roger innocently broached the question of hodder's eviction mother said he what do you think that idiot pottinger has been up to he's taken it into his wise head to threaten to turn old hodder out of his cottage unless he pays a higher rent in future i went to row him about it but he's far too dense to see what a scoundrelly thing it is how shocking said mrs ingleton poor old hodder has been in that place all his life your father was always fond of him roger i wouldn't have him disturbed for the world you'll have to tell pottinger so yourself said roger he says he's bound to screw all he can out of the old chap in my interests if you please the captain had listened to this parley with anything but comfort and was about at this point to explain when mr armstrong seeing his chance adroitly stepped in you may make yourself easy about the matter roger evidently mr pottinger has acted most unwarrantably on his own responsibility i have been to see him this morning and told him in future he is not to take upon himself to do anything about the estate without consulting mrs ingleton and captain oliphant and myself then hodder is not to be disturbed inquired rosalind i have seen that the notice is withdrawn i for one should certainly never sanction it oh how delightful you are said the young lady how happy you will have made the poor old man father do get that horrid pottinger sent away he's a monster i told him so yesterday but he wouldn't believe me rosalind said her father whose lunch was not agreeing with him at all it vexes me to see you interfere in matters in which you have no concern it seems to me my dear eva he added addressing mrs ingleton whom he had already taken to calling by her christian name that these business questions had much better be left for discussion among ourselves and not at the family meal perhaps so said mrs ingleton only we are all so interested in poor old hodder we hardly regard this as a business question however i am delighted to hear it is all right now i only wish mr pottinger had consulted you edward before he took such a step oh he did blurted out rosalind but as i told him of course papa not knowing what a villain he was would believe all he said it was all the more shame of him to go and impose on papa who hasn't had time to get to know all the people about the place instead of going to auntie or mr armstrong who know all of them i don't think he'll do it again said the young lady firing up like a charming amazon at the remembrance of her interview captain oliphant pushed his chair brusquely back from the table and got up looking so armstrong thought not as proud of his loyal daughter as he should have been eva said he drily i shall be in the library if you want me will you tell raffles to bring me in the times when it arrives i'm afraid papa will be very angry with me said rosalind dolefully as she and roger walked back across the hall but if he won't stand up for himself some one must i'm quite sure he would give the impression to any one who did not know him that he had purposely been harsh to poor hodder as it happened captain oliphant displayed no anger the question of hodder was allowed to drop and no further reference was made to his threatened eviction mr pottinger during the week meekly submitted an agreement to permit him to remain where he was which the trustees sanctioned unanimously and when the old man's champions at maxfield rejoiced in the discomfiture of the man of the law captain edward oliphant said nothing in his defence after this matters went on quietly as they will do when one storm has blown over and the next is yet below the horizon armstrong settled down to his duties with his two pupils or rather his three pupils for miss jill made a point of receiving lessons too miss rosalind worked away at her painting and succeeded in evoking a glimmering interest in art in the philistine breasts of her two students the young people divided their leisure between riding cricket tennis and yachting mrs ingleton as the weeks went by not only grew more pale but began to be aware of the attentions of her sympathetic kinsman and to be sorely perplexed and disturbed thereat and the captain himself received his indian letters regularly by each mail and confessed to himself that but for two considerations one appertaining to love the other to hate he had better far have remained in her majesty's service abroad chapter eight two ends of a rope the summer passed and even captain oliphant began to grow reconciled to his surroundings that is to say he discovered that at present it was his policy to make himself agreeable even to his co trustee armstrong with the position he held at maxfield as roger's friend and mrs ingleton's trusted servant was not to be disposed of quite as easily as the gallant officer had at first anticipated at the same time while he remained where he was the captain felt himself decidedly embarrassed in the working out of sundry little projects which floated in his ingenious brain besides which time was getting on roger would be twenty in november and a year later captain oliphant had reached this pleasant stage in his meditations one morning as he sipped his coffee in his own room when raffles entered with the letters eightpence to pay on this one please sir it was a letter with an indian post mark unstamped the captain regarded it with knitted brows then tossing it on the table said give it back i won't take it in raffles raffles reflecting within himself that the captain must have a vast amount of correspondence if he could afford to chuck away an interesting document like this took the letter and retired wait a minute called the captain as the door was closing let me look at it again raffles guessed as much and brought the missive back triumphantly the captain again regarded it with expressions of anything but cordiality and seemed half inclined to reject it once more but he took it up again and posed it in his hand you can leave it raffles said he presently give the postman the eightpence it was some time before captain oliphant opened the letter he sipped his coffee and glared at it viciously as it lay on the table beside him what game is the scoundrel up to now muttered he i began to hope i was rid of him what does he want now he opened the letter and read dear comrade you have not answered my last three letters and i feel quite anxious to know of your welfare you will be pleased to hear that i have arranged to take my leave home during the coming autumn the captain put the letter down with an exclamation which startled the sparrows on the window ledge and set the breakfast cup shaking in its saucer coming home he gasped then he read on i look forward to inquiring personally after your health and prospects in which as you know my dear fellow i am much interested it would be very nice of you as the only friend i have in england to ask your old comrade on a visit to you in your comfortable quarters a particular advantage in such an arrangement would be that it would prevent my coming without being asked i am due by the nile' about the first week in october come and meet me in town i have no doubt i shall get a line at southampton to say at which hotel i shall find you i fear you will find me financially in low water but i shall have with me papers relating to the regimental accounts previous to your regretted departure from india which no doubt some people would regard as valuable au revoir my dear fellow yours ever rr ps commend me to your charming family i look forward with particular pleasure to make the acquaintance of the young ladies of whom i have heard delightful reports over here raffles when he came in to remove the breakfast things could not help being struck with the narrow escape captain oliphant had had of throwing away for the sake of a paltry eightpence a most interesting and appetising letter the captain sat holding it abstractedly in his hand nor was it till the door opened half an hour later and rosalind sailed in that he hastily pulled himself together and crumpled the paper away in his pocket why papa what is the matter is there any bad news in that letter on the contrary it announces the arrival from india of a very dear old comrade oh said rosalind you will like to hear all about the people over there does he belong to our regiment no dear but i shall expect you to be very agreeable to him when he comes here but he's not coming here is he she asked in amazement where else do you suppose he would be likely to come to visit me oh but papa we cannot we must not ask people here as it is think of all four of us living here on roger's money it isn't fair rosalind you use expressions which to anyone but your father would be positively offensive rest assured that i do not require my own child to correct me oh of course dear father i don't mean that but but it sounds extremely as if you did mean it i do hope you won't ask any one here said she doggedly rosalind you offend me you are incapable as i have told you before of appreciating your duty either to me or yourself oblige me by going papa dear i am only anxious go said the captain brusquely she obeyed mr armstrong as he met her in the hall and marked the bright colour in her cheeks and the light in her eyes thought to himself how uncommonly well she was looking this morning he might have thought otherwise had he seen her in her studio half an hour later with the colour all faded striving miserably to resume her painting at the point where she had left it off her good father meanwhile naturally put out continued his meditations a most vexing child no support to me at all on the contrary an embarrassment i might have guessed she would cut up rough yet i do so long for a little sympathy wonder if i shall get any from my dear cousin eva some fine day hum i more and more incline to that venture it would suit my book to say nothing of my being really almost in love with the dear creature but i'm so abominably shy let's see ratman is due first week in october a month hence i shall have to keep him quiet some how he won't be satisfied with things as they are i'm afraid all very well to be heir presumptive when there's little prospect of presuming dear roger is certainly not robust not at all poor boy still he seems tenacious of what would be very much more useful to me than to him yes it would strengthen my hands vastly if my dear cousin eva were to give me the right to regard the lad as a father there would be something definite in that it would solve the armstrong question for one thing i flatter myself and as for rosalind yes by the way he took out the letter again and read the postscript carefully yes tut tut how oddly things do work out sometimes evidently it is my duty all round for the sake of everybody to cast aside my natural bashfulness and use the opportunities providence gives me with which reflection he lit a cigar and had a pleasant ramble in the park with little miss jill who had rarely seen her papa more lively or amusing his spirits were destined to be still further cheered by an occurrence which took place on the following day roger despite his delicate health had managed to get through a creditable amount of work during the summer under mr armstrong's guidance he was shortly to go up for his first ba in london and with that ordeal in view had been tempted to tax his strength even more than was good for him at last the tutor put down his foot no old fellow said he if you work any move you will go backwards instead of forward you must take this week easy and go up fresh for the exam depend on it you will do far better than if you tried to keep it up till the last moment in vain roger pleaded threatened mutinied the tutor was inexorable and fortified by the joint authority of mrs ingleton and dr brandram carried the day he had also an unexpected ally in miss rosalind don't be obstinate roger said she the three fates are too many for you and don't sulk whatever you do there's a dear boy but make yourself nice and propose to take tom and jill and me across to pulpit island to morrow if you are so wedded to lessons you and tom shall have your art class for once in a way on the pelican's rock instead of my room roger could hardly hold out after this and mr armstrong a little envious set the seal of his approval to the programme i wish you'd come too said tom can't you oh do said jill it would be twice as nice mr armstrong has enough of all of us on working days said rosalind rather cruelly to forego a chance of being rid of us on a holiday quite so said the tutor trying to enjoy the situation when the mice are away the cat will play on the piano the next day promised well for the picnic and roger had sufficiently warmed up to the proposed expedition to be able to enter eagerly into the preparations the pulpit island a desolate cavernous rock three miles from the coast dominated by a lighthouse was a familiar hunting ground of his in days gone by and he decidedly enjoyed the prospect of doing the honours of the place to his cousins now particularly one of them as not a breath of air was stirring they decided not to encumber the small boat with mast or sail but to row leisurely across with just as much energy as suited their holiday humour the channel was on the whole free from currents and as roger knew the landing places as well as the oldest sailor in the place any precaution in the way of a pilot was needless armstrong as he watched the little craft slowly glide over the glassy water dwindling smaller and smaller but sending back the sound of voices and laughter long after it itself had become an indistinguishable speck in the gleaming water wished himself one of the crew but as fate had ordained otherwise he retreated to his piano and succeeded in irritating captain oliphant considerably by his brilliant execution vocal and instrumental of some of his favourite pieces the day however was too hot even for music and after an hour's practice mr armstrong gave it up and took a book but that was dull and he tried to write some letters worse and worse the place was stifling and the pen almost melted in his hand what was the matter with him why did he feel so down so lonely surely he could exist a day without his pupil whatever the temperature perhaps he had his doubts about the boy's success in the coming examination no he fancied that would be all right he would try a stroll in the park it could not at least be hotter under the trees than in the house across the passage a door stood wide open a familiar door through which he caught sight of a familiar easel on the floor and over the fireplace one or two familiar indian knick knacks he couldn't help stopping a moment to peep in it seemed cooler in there what was the picture on the easel might he not just look a view of the park with the sea beyond pretty but no not as good as it might be landscape was not this artist's strong point ah there was a portrait on the mantelpiece that promised better why it was the identical boy's portrait that had once hung in the old squire's library no it was a copy but an extraordinary copy as if the original had suddenly lived while it was being made mr armstrong had rarely seen a portrait which looked so like speaking and breathing the original in roger's room was weak compared with this and in front of it stood a glass with a rose whose petals leaned over and just touched the canvas mr armstrong feeling very guilty beat a hasty retreat into the hot passage and made his way down stairs he was a little jealous of that portrait perched there in that cool room with the sweet rose in front of it going out said captain oliphant in the hall the captain by the way had taken to being civil to his co trustee much to mr armstrong's annoyance warm isn't it yes said he beautiful day for those young people beautiful said the tutor as he spoke he casually tapped the barometer at the hall door as was his habit to his surprise the dial gave a great leap downward something was wrong with it evidently for the sky was as monotonously blue as it had been all day and not a leaf stirred in the trees however mr armstrong took the precaution to return to his own room for a moment to consult the barometer there it too answered him with a downward plunge the tutor screwed his glass rather excitedly into his eye and looked at the clock half past three he touched the bell tell the groom to saddle pomona' for me raffles i will come to the stables in a minute or two and mount there you need a bit of exercise this weather you do remarked raffles to himself as he retired to keep warm a few minutes later the tutor was riding smartly to yeld during the half hour occupied by that journey the signs of the approaching storm became manifest the blue of the sky took a leaden hue and out at sea an ominous cloud bank lifted its head on the horizon while the sultry air seemed to breathe hot on the rider's cheek he pulled up short at dr brandram's door what's the matter now asked the doctor i hate to see you on horseback it always means bad news is mrs ingleton poorly i am not at all comfortable about her no nobody's ill but i want you for all that there's a storm coming on so the glass says all the more reason for staying indoors the youngsters from the hall are out in it well can i lend you an umbrella don't be an ass brandram they are out in an open boat at sea the doctor jumped to his feet by jove he exclaimed they went to the island this morning and will have started back a quarter of an hour ago they've caught it already then said the doctor look the horizon was lurid with clouds pulpit island out at sea seemed instead of three miles distant to have come in to within a mile the channel between still gleaming in the sun was struck by a bar of shadow which seemed like a scar on the surface the two men as they stood in the street looking seaward could hear already the solemn hum through the breathless air and feel the first cool whiff of the breeze on their faces while at their feet there fell with a sudden plash a heavy drop of rain had they a sail asked the doctor no it's coming south east they will drive in this side of sheep head that's what i thought an awful coast and not a boat there get the horse in the gig said dr brandram while i put together what we are likely to want look sharp armstrong wanted no encouragement to be expeditious and had the trap at the door almost before the doctor had his pile of blankets wraps with brandy and other restoratives ready to put in it in the village they paused to buy a rope and to warn one or two stragglers of their errand then in the gathering storm they drove hard towards sheep head there was no mistake about the gale now the sky was black with clouds and the rain and wind struck them simultaneously as they urged on the warning hum had already risen to a roar and the wave as they raced crest over crest to the shore hissed and seethed with a fury which could be heard a mile off neither of the men spoke armstrong with the reins in his hand kept his eyes stolidly between the horse's ears the doctor more agitated looked eagerly out across the sea at last near the summit of the tall angular headland the gig came abruptly to a standstill the horse was tied up and the two men scarcely able to keep their feet staggered to the cliff edge there for half an hour they lay straining their eyes seaward with the full fury of the blast on their faces it was hopeless to expect to see anything for the rain drove blindingly in their eyes and though scarcely five o'clock the afternoon was almost as dark as evening could they possibly drive clear of the point asked the doctor not possibly i think come down to the shore we are no use here wait a bit it seems to be getting lighter it was but for a long time the glow served only to make the obscurity more visible presently however the rain paused for a moment and enabled them to dear their eyes and look steadily ahead dr brandram felt his arm suddenly gripped as his companion exclaimed hoarsely what's that something red sure enough there was a speck of red tossed about in the waves now visible now lost now returning it was all that could be seen but it was enough for mr armstrong it's the boat she wore a red cloak come down come down no stop till we see how they are driving there's time enough as far as they could calculate the boat if boat it was was being driven straight for sheephaven cove under the cliff on which they stood a furious rugged shore unless indeed a miracle should chance to pitch them into the deep natural harbour that lay in between the low rocks and the headland come down said armstrong again from the sea level nothing not even the red speck was discernible and for a terrible five minutes they wondered as they scrambled out on hands and knees to the outmost limit of the jutting rocks whether among the wild breakers the little boat and its precious crew had not vanished for ever it was all they could do to struggle to their feet and clinging to the rocks turn their faces seaward a new paroxysm of the gale well nigh dashed them backwards and for a time prevented their seeing anything but in a minute or two it eased off enough to allow them to open their eyes see there look out look out cried the doctor pointing he was right about a quarter of a mile away buffeted like a cork on the water was a boat and in it something red stand up and wave it's no use shouting said armstrong taking advantage of a temporary lull they stood and waved their coats above their heads whether they were seen or not they could not tell no signal came in return only the boat as it seemed stern foremost drove on towards them hold on and get your rope ready said the doctor will she clear the rocks or no we shall see they've no oars out stay there while i wave again this time it was not in vain there was a stir in the boat the red cloak was seen to wave aloft and a faint cry mingled with the storm hold on cried the doctor they see us thank god i'll go on waving presently they could see one oar put out in an attempt to steer the boat into the cove but in a moment it was swept away and she drove on as helplessly as before it seemed years while she gradually approached stern foremost now seeming to lurch straight towards the fatal rocks now to stand clear for the narrow channel they could distinguish the four passengers at last she in red sat in the stern looking ahead holding her little sister at her side the two lads in the middle were baling out wildly pausing every now and then to turn white faces landward but returning at once to their task and indeed the boat sat so low in the water that it was a miracle how she floated at all armstrong stood up his friend holding him and waved his coil of rope above his head the signal was read in a moment the two girls retreated to the middle of the boat to make room for roger in the stern on and on they came for an instant it seemed as if nothing could save them for an ugly cross wave hurled them straight towards the rocks but the next righted them as suddenly lifting them high on its crest and dashing them headlong towards the one spot where help awaited them before they rose again a deft cast from armstrong had sent the rope across the bows within roger's reach while the doctor with the other end lashed round his body was running at full speed towards the calmer water of the cove for a moment the line hung slack as a great back wave lifted the boat on its crest and carried it seawards but suddenly the strain came carrying the two men on shore nearly off their feet and grinding on the gunwale of the boat with a creak which could be heard even above the waves hold on now cried armstrong as a forward wave surged up behind the boat all obeyed but roger who seeking to ease the strain began to haul in on the rope the wave tossed the boat up with a furious lurch half swamping it as it did so and flinging it down again headlong into the trough when it rose once more the rope still held and three of her passengers were safe but roger was not to be seen with an exclamation which even the doctor in the midst of his excitement could hear armstrong flung himself blindly into the chaos of water for a moment or two it seemed as if he had gone straight to his fate for amid the foam and lashing spray they strained their eyes in vain for a glimpse either of him or his pupil then he appeared high above their heads on the crest of a wave striking out to where for one instant an upstretched arm and nothing more rose feebly from the water the next moment hurled thither as it seemed by the wave he had reached it and was battling for dear life with the surf that swept him back seaward by this time a few bystanders had ventured out on to the rocks one of them with a rope which after three vain attempts fell within reach of the exhausted pair by its aid armstrong piloted his senseless charge into the calmer water of the cove and the whole party a few moments later were safe on terra firma chapter nine the captain relieves guard when mr armstrong having with some difficulty taken in who and where he was proceeded as was natural under the circumstances to feel for his eye glass he discovered that his right arm hung powerless at his side and refused to perform its familiar functions the next thing he was aware of was that rosalind and the doctor were kneeling on the rocks beside the senseless form of roger who lay white as a corpse with the blood trickling from a gash on the temple then jill crept beside him pale and sobbing and said something he did not hear what finally the ruddy countenance of tom dawned upon him and made him aware even in the midst of his dream that one person at least had thoroughly enjoyed the day's adventures and was no whit the worse either for the fright or the drenching how they all got up to maxfield the tutor was never able to say for the pain of his broken arm became so intense that he was as near swooning as he had ever been in his life and but for the timely services of the doctor who was able to give him some little relief he might have disgraced himself for ever by fainting light off he remembered seeing roger lying in the carriage with eyes half open his head on rosalind's shoulder and he remembered feeling his own hand held fast in the two hands of his little champion the next thing he was conscious of was that he was in his own bed with his arm firmly bound beside him and the friendly face of dr brandram bent over him that's better isn't it old fellow said the latter it's a wonder it was only the arm you must keep quiet now for you shipped a lot of water and were a quarter drowned into the bargain what about roger he'll do now at least i hope so i was concerned about him at first but he came round i envy you your plunge just my luck all the big things are done by the other fellows and i'm left to hold on to the rope and order the physic never mind i never expected to see either of you out of that caldron i certainly could never have come out myself miss oliphant is she all right right as a trivet and has mounted guard over her cousin already if he doesn't get well with her for nurse he's an obstinate customer thanks brandram come again soon captain oliphant's concern at this untoward misadventure may well be imagined he shed tears with the mother over their dear one's narrow escape and censured in terms of righteous indignation all who had been parties to the hazardous expedition he cross examined the doctor as to the dangers to be apprehended from the patient's present condition and shook his head gloomily at the probable consequences of so terrible a shock to his already fragile constitution he summoned his three children into his presence to be severally kissed in recognition of their deliverance and sent a message by raffles to mr armstrong to say that he was glad to hear his injuries were only of a slight nature and trusted he would take what time was necessary from his duties to make a proper recovery after which in a passably good humour he returned to his room and wondered what improvements he should make at maxfield if by any melancholy dispensation of providence the property should fall into his unworthy hands of course there were the usual thorns among the roses mrs ingleton ill herself was far too painfully absorbed in her boy's danger to lend an ear to the tender nothings of her sympathetic kinsman and the whole party were so possessed with the notion that mr armstrong was something of a hero that any suggestion to the contrary was just then clearly inopportune the main fact however was that roger ingleton minor dear lad was very ill indeed i trust doctor said the captain about a fortnight after the accident to dr brandram who was quitting the house with a decidedly long face i trust our dear young patient is on a good road now to recovery i don't like the look of him i must confess replied the doctor but with perfect quiet and nothing to excite him he will pull round the one thing to be dreaded is excitement the lungs we have got well in hand but that blow on his temple makes an ugly complication poor fellow is there nothing one can do let him alone with your sweet daughter to nurse him she is an angel captain oliphant if you'll excuse my saying so she knows as we all do how precious his life is and how is your other patient armstrong practically well i have given him leave to get up he has the constitution of a tiger i wish we could give some of it to the boy ah indeed said the captain with a sigh on the following day a desire took possession of the guardian to visit his dear ward in the sick chamber rosalind who had clung to her post defiant of fatigue and sleep had been prevailed upon in deference to her father's peremptory command to seize an hour's sleep in her own room i will sit with him myself said the captain you must not be selfish my child in using your privilege you forget that what gratifies you may also be a pleasure to others i am going to town in a few days who knows if i may see the dear fellow again father exclaimed rosalind seizing his arm almost roughly he is getting better the doctor says so my poor child said her father with a forced cheerfulness far more terrifying to the girl than his previous melancholy i was wrong to alarm you yes of course he is getting better of course come we must all be brave rosalind quite broken down went to her bed and cried herself to sleep when the captain entered the sick chamber he found the mother at the bedside my dear eva said he let me beg you to take a little rest i will remain here do give me the pleasure for once you know how i shall value the privilege mrs ingleton who was in truth fairly worn out was fain to consent on condition that she should be called at once if necessary having escorted her affectionately to the door captain oliphant seated himself at the bedside and looked hard at his ward the boy lay in a feverish doze his large dark eyes half closed and his head turning now and again restlessly on the pillow my poor dear fellow said his guardian bending over him how do you feel this afternoon better i think where's rosalind gone to bed i am really afraid of her becoming ill she looks so pale and worn she was so good to me said roger i never thought of her getting ill how long have i been ill he asked three weeks my boy what a narrow escape you had you know i never heard yet what happened that day in the boat how did it all happen whereupon roger rousing himself still more began to go over the events of that memorable day which at that distance of time seemed to loom out in his mind more terrible than at the time his guardian deeply interested in the narrative drew him out into a full and particular account of all that passed the picnic on the island the sudden storm the drive before the wind the awful roar of the surf on the shore what each one said and thought and prepared for and then of the crowning excitement of the rescue the struggle in the water and the drowning sensations when all was told the boy's head fell exhausted on the pillow his chest heaved and he lay half muttering to himself half moaning a pitiful spectacle of weakness and exhaustion when an hour later rosalind glided in her father walked with finger to his lips to meet her make no noise said he the dear lad is sleeping don't disturb him whatever you do that was a bad night in the sick room the fever rose higher and higher roger tossed and moaned ceaselessly all night and for the first time wandered in his talk armstrong who looked in once or twice durst not let himself be seen by the patient for fear of adding to his excitement a midnight messenger was despatched for dr brandram who came looking very grave and remained at the bedside all night captain oliphant was indefatigable in his inquiries and attentions he denied himself his natural sleep in order to linger near the dear one's door and feed on the crumbs of information which from time to time came out he insisted on lending dr brandram a pair of his own slippers and besought armstrong with his bad arm to take care of himself and go shares in his brandy and water finally when the doctor peremptorily ordered every one to bed he retired in a chastened mood to his own room where he packed his trunk and smoked his cigar thoughtfully till daylight struggled through the windows then he took a brief nap in his arm chair and was astir in time to meet the doctor as he descended to the hall what news he asked don't ask me said the doctor my calculations are completely upset something has excited him whom did he see yesterday only my daughter and his mother and for a short time myself was he at all disturbed while you were there on the contrary he was drowsy when i entered and drowsy when i left he may possibly have caught sight of mr armstrong when he looked in he should not have come near him in his present state anything that reminds him of the accident is bad for him dear dear what a pity no doubt the boy caught sight of him tell me doctor may i venture up to town for a day or two on important business if you thought i should stay no i hope it's not quite as bad as that but you should leave word where a message will find you if necessary good day i'm not quite such a fool growled the doctor to himself as he walked to the stables as you think me my fine fellow if you were in the room half an hour last night this is all explained to think that you are the father of that ministering angel too the captain in a spirit of subdued cheerfulness travelled up that afternoon to town the weather was superb the country rich with harvest looked beautiful the carriage was unusually comfortable and the cigars magnificent altogether this good man felt that he had much to be thankful for and quietly wondered within himself whether on his arrival at the langham hotel he should find a telegram from maxfield already awaiting him instead he found what pleased him decidedly less a telegram from southampton business keeps me here for a week arrive london friday evening ratman the captain expressed himself to himself as greatly annoyed by this simple message and for the rest of that evening quite lost his natural gaiety next morning however not being a man to waste the precious hours he decided like a dutiful son of his alma mater to take a little run to oxford he had still in his pocket a certain memorandum made long ago of the name of a certain college at that seat of learning at which at a certain date of which he had also a note a person in whom he felt interested had been a student why not improve the occasion by a few inquiries on the spot as to the academical career of that interesting person it was a brilliant idea no sooner conceived than executed that afternoon among a crowd of returning undergraduates at college might have been seen the well dressed military form of a certain gentleman who politely inquired for the senior tutor i have called sir on behalf of a friend of mine in india to inquire respecting a mr frank armstrong who is or was a year or two since an undergraduate here armstrong armstrong no man of that name here at present ah i fancy we had a man here of that name some years since could you conveniently inform me how long it is since he left the tutor referred to his lists he left three years ago i remember him now well my friend would be extremely grateful for any information he has lost sight of him since he was at oxford well the fact is armstrong was not a particular success here he was a fairly good scholar and athlete too i believe but his course here ended abruptly dear dear do you mean to say he was expelled hardly so but he left the place heavily in debt at the end of his second year he wrote to the authorities to say that the source of supply on which he had depended for paying his college and other bills which had accumulated to a very considerable extent had suddenly ceased and he was unable to meet his obligations as he was in destitution he could make no suggestion for meeting them and requested us to accept an undertaking from him to discharge them if possible at a future time under the circumstances he was informed that he was not to come up again and his name was struck off the books i believe that since then a few of his debts have been reduced by small instalments i am very grieved to hear what you tell me could you very kindly tell me the address from which he last wrote if i remember it was from a coffee house in london and he mentioned that he was hoping to obtain employment as a private tutor in a family well sir although this is very disagreeable news for my friend i am sure he will thank you all the same i suppose you have no idea beyond this address in london what became of him none or where he lived before he came to oxford i was looking for that i see the address on the entrance form is blue street london captain oliphant made a note of the address and after effusive thanks said good bye he spent two interesting days in oxford looking about him and enjoying himself considerably but although he met several men whose names he knew and made several new acquaintances he was unable to hear anything further of the defaulting undergraduate of college on his return to town as he had still a day or two to spare this industrious gentleman with a good deal of trouble found out number blue street for a person of his refined tastes it was in a shockingly low neighbourhood near one of the docks and blue street itself was one of the shadiest metaphorically of its streets it consisted mainly of slop shops patronised by the shipping interest and displaying wares of which one half at least might be safely counted upon as stolen property number three which for some unexplained reason was located half way down the street was an establishment of this sort very offensive to the nose and not at all agreeable to the eye old clothes of every fashion and antiquity hung exposed in the dingy window while within a still larger assortment lay piled up on the counter nor were the clothes all second hand watches marlinspikes compasses spoons books boxes and curiosities crowded the narrow space in the midst of which the shrivelled old lady who called herself proprietress was scarcely visible come in don't be afraid cried she as the captain paused doubtfully at the door is this number my good woman look over the door 'aint you got no eyes number blue street this is blue street is it not if yer doubts it go and read the name at the end of the street what do you want clothes or money neither i want information replied the captain then yer've come to the wrong shop don't sell it 'ere so clear out do you think i don't know what you're arter very well said the captain that will be so much saved i shall have to get for nothing what i meant to pay for she looked at him doubtfully and growled why can't yer say what yer want instead of talking gibberish there if this is number blue street and you are the same person who was here five years ago go on i may have something to give you from an old lodger but not till i'm sure you have a right to it what him very likely said the captain calmly lighting a cigarette i shall know if you're right i dare say right do you suppose i'm made of lodgers 'aint you talking about the singing chap armstrong he called himself but at the hall they called him signor something francisco or the likes of that the captain pricked his ears with a vengeance and in his eagerness rattled the keys encouragingly in his trouser pocket that won't do said he i must have come to the wrong place after all what sort of looking man was he and where did he come from he'd got a pair of arms would knock you into the middle of next week and when he went down to the hall which hall the dragon' music hall what don't you know it go on with you when he went there he flashed it with an eye glass lor' you should 'ave heard him sing he'd a made your hair curl it was lovely ah he wore an eye glass and sang did he said the captain and where did he come from and what became of him when he left you come from i don't know the other end of the world i fancy myself where he went to i don't know neither i fancy myself he took up with a bad lot at the hall and turned me up howsomever i got my dues out of him so it's no concern of mine there you are mister now what have you got for me the captain looked doubtful and shook his head i'm afraid it's not right after all said he it doesn't correspond with the particulars i have had you no other lodgers what did i tell you snarled the woman perceiving she was to be done out of her reward after all come are you going to give me what you promised or not if you 'aint clear out of here my beauty or i'll break every bone of your ugly body and since with a stick in her hand she looked very like putting her threat into execution the captain beat a hasty retreat chuckling to himself at the thought of his own excellent cleverness upon my word said he to himself as he strolled westward i am having a most interesting time what a versatile genius my co trustee appears to be a tutor to an heir a defaulting and rusticated undergraduate a penniless music hall cad dear dear what a curious settlement of scores we shall have to be sure or rather should have had had our poor dear roger remained with us heigho what a curious sensation it will be to be sure to own a fortune at the hotel the porter met him with a telegram he expected as much he could guess what was inside it really seemed waste of energy to open it but he must go through with his melancholy functions and he therefore took a seat in the hall and composed his face for the worst thankful to say good night fever abated all hopeful rosalind captain oliphant turned pale crushed the pink paper viciously in his hands and uttered an exclamation which called forth the sympathy of the hotel servants who loitered in the hall poor gentleman said the lady manager to her clerk he's got some bad news in that telegram he had indeed chapter ten robert ratman esquire gentleman the next morning as captain oliphant somewhat depressed by the good news of last might was attempting to write to his dear cousin expression his thankfulness for the mercies vouchsafed to their precious boy he was considerably disturbed to feel himself slapped on the shoulder and hear a voice behind him exclaim got you my man how are you teddy the captain turned with a startled face and confronted a stylishly dressed man of about thirty five who but for the dissipated look of his eyes and the vulgarity of his ornaments might have passed for a gentleman he wore a light suit diamonds and turquoises blazed from his fingers a diamond stud flashed from his shirt front and from his heavy watch chain hung a bunch of seals and charms enough to supply half a dozen men of ordinary pretensions his light hat was tilted at an angle on his head his brilliant kid boots sparkled beneath the snow white spats and the lavender gloves he flourished in his hands were light enough for a ball room once he might have been a handsome man there were still traces of determination about his mouth his nose was finely cut and his lustreless eyes still retained occasional flashes of their old spirit there was a recklessness in his face and demeanour which once when it belonged to an honest man might been attractive and when he took off his hat and you saw the well shaped head with its crisp curly hair you could not help feeling that you saw the ruin of a fine fellow it was when he began to talk that you would best understand what a ruin it was he was chary of his oaths and loose expressions but when he spoke the words came out vulgarly with a sleepy half tipsy drawl which jarred on the ear any words from the lips of robert ratman however would have jarred on the ears of captain oliphant aren't you glad to see me said the new arrival putting his hat cheerfully on the writing table and helping himself to an easy chair as usual writing billets doux to the ladies ah teddy my boy at your time of life too now for a youngster like me i thought you would not be able to leave southampton till the end of the week couldn't resist the temptation of giving you a pleasant surprise why teddy you look exactly as if you thought it was the arm of the law on your shoulder and heard the rattle of the handcuffs never mind they're all safe i know where they keep them ratman said the captain you have a very poor idea of humour you have made me blot my letter and i shall have to write it over again take your time old boy no hurry i shall not be going away for six months or so captain oliphant came to the conclusion he had better finish the letter with the blot than attempt a new one having done so he put it in his pocket and turned with a good show of coolness to his guest when do we run down to maxfield inquired the latter not for some time there is illness in the house you must wait oh i don't mind if you don't who is the invalid young croesus yes dangerously ill i expect every day to hear that it is all over ratman laughed order two suits of black while you're about it but teddy my boy doesn't it strike you you'd be more usefully employed down there than here it seems unfeeling of a guardian to be enjoying himself in town while his ward is in extremis at home doesn't it who is nursing him my daughter chiefly ratman laughed coarsely ho ho clever teddy you've left a deputy to look after your interests have you poor boy no wonder you expect news of him captain oliphant crimson and trembling rose to his feet ratman muttered he between his teeth i may be all you take me for but don't talk of my daughter she she and he almost choked at the word she is as good as i and you are black talk about me if you like but forget that i have children of my own my dear boy you are quite amusing i will make a point of forgetting the interesting fact so the boy is being well looked after too well replied the captain pulling himself together after his last outbreak the doctor is daft about him and besides him as i told you there is the tutor ah i forgot about him is he a nice sort of chap he's your worst enemy as well as mine while he is about the place there's no chance for either of us thanks don't bring me into it say there's no chance for you i can take care of myself and how about mamma she is at present too ill and distracted by her son's danger to think of anything else if the boy dies i shall not need to trouble her if he gets well i may find it my duty to become his stepfather charming man and fortunate mamma meanwhile what are you going to do for me my dear fellow you must wait i can put you up at maxfield if you behave decently but as to money you will spoil all if you are impatient i am not the only trustee remember i have to be careful that's all very well sounds beautiful but do you know teddy i've not quite as much confidence in you as i should like to have i can't enjoy my holiday without some pocket money the big lump might wait if properly secured but the interest would be very convenient to me just now what shall i give you a receipt for added he taking a seat at the table a hundred don't be a fool ratman i've nothing i can give you just now said the captain angrily ratman put down his pen and whistled a stave drubbing his fingers on the table then he took the pen again a hundred eh he repeated the captain ground his teeth in impotent fury no fifty thanks very much i'll make it seventy five if you don't mind captain oliphant with black countenance slowly counted the notes out onto the table while his friend with many flourishes wrote out the receipt before signing it he counted the money quite right perfectly right thanks very much teddy now let us go out and see the sights you forget it's years since i was in town tell me first said the captain going to the window was turning his back about that you know that affair in about your robbing the mess funds supplied his friend cheerfully certainly my dear boy quite a simple matter shortly after you left deputy assistant something or other came with a long face this is a bad job' says he your friend oliphant's left the accounts in an awful mess doesn't look well at all where is he' nonsense my dear deputy assistant' says i must be a mistake oliphant's a man of his word besides he's just come into a fortune bound to be right if you look into it' will you make it good if it's wrong' asks he don't mind if i do' says i within reason he's a young family' only way of hushing it up either that or bringing him back between a file of soldiers' you don't mean that' says i what's the figure' l' says he liar growled the captain wheeling round it wasn't half that they're bound to make something out of it always happens well as you'd told me you'd got the pickings of a cool half million i felt i couldn't go wrong in covering you so i came down with five hundred of needful got them to promise to let the rest stand till i had done myself the pleasure of a run over here just to remind you that they have you on their mind you've disappointed me teddy my boy but i won't desert you don't say you've no friends i'll stick by you i rather fancy the captain was probably able to form a pretty clear estimate how much of this glib story was fact and how much fiction whatever the proportion may have been he had to acknowledge that this friend of his held him in an uncomfortable grip and had better for the present at least be conciliated so the two went out arm in arm for a stroll the first of many they took during their fortnight's sojourn in town the news from maxfield became unpleasingly damping here for instance is a letter the doting father received from his son and heir a week after ratman's arrival dear pater isn't it fizzing that old roger is pretty nearly out of the wood the fever's come down like anything and he's getting quite chirpy i can't fancy how a chap can hang on at all with nothing to eat but milk it wouldn't fill up my chinks if ever i get a fever keep me going on beefsteak and mashed potatoes it's been a great lark having no lessons armstrong's forgotten my existence i think he and rosalind have regular rows about sitting up with him i mean roger and rosalind generally has to cave in it does her good to cave in now and then armstrong's the only one can make her i can't nor can brandram brandram's a stunner i drive him in and out of yeld every day and he's up to no end of larks and now roger's pulling round he's as festive as an owl jill's in jolly dumps because she's out of it all rosalind sits on her and tells her she's too much of a kid to be any good and she doesn't get much change out of armstrong so she has to knock about with me all day which is awful slow i say go and see christy's minstrels when you're in town and get them to let jockabilly do the break down it will make you split if that french chap is hanging about tip him a bob for me and be civil to him because he was decent enough to me auntie eva said something about your bringing a gentleman home with you i hope he's a jolly sort of chap rosalind's temper is all anyhow when i told her a visitor was coming she shut me up with a regular flea in my ear never mind she's been a brick to old roger and auntie eva so we must make allowances old hodder calls up nearly every day to ask after us all he's grown quite young since he was left alone in his cottage and armstrong came down like a sack of coals on that beast pottinger my dear father if you would like to know what i most hope you'll bring home for me it's a football rugby for the coming winter armstrong's promised to coach me in the drop kick can you do it i shall be glad to see you home as i'm jolly low in pocket money besides the affection one feels for those who are absent jill joins in love your affectionate tom' ps auntie eva is not nearly so down on her luck now that roger's taken his turn if he's well enough she's going to have a little kick up on his birthday which will be rare larks a letter inquired ratman who had watched the not altogether delighted expression on his friend's face as he read it good news may i read it if you like said the captain tossing it across the table ratman who evidently had a better appreciation of juvenile vagaries than the father read it with an amused smile on his face nice boy that said he he and i will be friends remember said the captain our bargain do and say what you like with me but before my children don't be afraid teddy my boy depend on me for doing the high moral business the innocent babes shall never guess that you owe me three years' pay and that i could walk you off to the next police station for a sharper it's amusing when you come to think of it isn't it but i say it looks as if you'll have to trouble mamma after all the boy's getting well in spite of his nurses i'm really impatient to see the happy family when shall we go next week we must be decent and wait till he's better now oh all right if we can't go to the funeral we'll go to the birthday party eh it's all one to me teddy as long as you don't make a fool of me in the long run you wait and it'll be all right said the captain with a trace in his voice of something like desperation at the end of the following week these two nice gentlemen presented themselves at maxfield captain oliphant had written for the brougham to meet them and as tom and jill were in it mr ratman was spared the embarrassment of meeting the whole household at one time before the house was reached he had impressed tom with the conviction that there was a considerable possibility of larks in his father's visitor but jill who had acquired the habit of contrasting every gentleman she saw with her dear mr armstrong was obdurate to his fascinations i don't want to talk to you said she shortly when for the twentieth time he renewed his friendly overtures i don't like you and hope you're not going to stay long ratman took his rebuff as complacently as he could and jill having exhausted her conversation with this outburst put her hand apologetically into her father's and remained silent the rest of the drive at maxfield the visitor who appeared to experience no difficulty in making himself at home received a polite welcome from the widow whose style he generally approved and considered a good deal better than his gallant comrade deserved then as none of the rest of the household put in an appearance he retired serenely to his comfortable apartment to dress for dinner captain oliphant's first anxiety was naturally for his dear young ward he found him sitting up in an arm chair with rosalind reading shakespeare to him hullo guardian said he you see the place hasn't got rid of me yet thanks to my kind nurse here i am indeed thankful my dear boy for your recovery and how is my rosalind she came and kissed him very well dear father but roger has to keep very quiet still so you must only stay a minute or two or i shall get into disgrace with the doctor he has been so good have you seen cousin eva yes my child but come with me i want to introduce you to mr ratman she looked inclined to rebel but after a moment closed her book and having smoothed the invalid's cushions followed her father from the room the captain felt decidedly nervous as she walked silently at his side at her own door she paused abruptly and said won't you come in father i want to say something to you a storm brewing said the captain to himself i expected it he followed her into her studio and closed the door what is it i am going to leave maxfield father i cannot stay here any longer living on other people i am going to accept an engagement at the vicarage as governess what exclaimed her father what freak is this miss i forbid you to do anything of the kind i am very sorry you don't approve i thought you would it will enable me to support myself and perhaps help to keep jill i shall get my board and lodging and l a year i am going on monday i wanted to tell you before any one else knew of it i repeat you must abandon the idea at once it is most derogatory in one of our family in addition to which i particularly desire to have you here during mr ratman's visit it is chiefly on that account i have decided to go it is not right father indeed it is not to go on as we are she put her hands on his shoulders and kissed him and looked into his eyes it was an ordeal on which captain edward oliphant had not calculated the sight of her there the touch of her hands the clear flash of her eyes recalled to him all sorts of unpleasant memories they reminded him of a day long ago when the girl's mother had stood thus and pleaded with him for the sake of their children to be pure and honest and self respecting it reminded him of his own miserable schemings and follies and how he had rejected that dear appeal and ever since slipped and slipped out of reach of any love but the love of himself it reminded him of the day when he heard that the one prop of his manhood had gone from him and of how even then his sorrow was tempered by the thought that he was a free man to follow his own paths without question or reproof now suddenly the same hands seemed for a moment to lie on his shoulders the same eyes to look into his the same voice to fall on his ear and he staggered under the illusion for a moment at least hope was within his reach but the sound of a man's voice in the passage without recalled him with a shiver to himself it was ratman's voice the voice of the man to whom he owed money who held the secret of his crime who claimed his villainy and who could say might even have to be pacified with a human sacrifice he shook her off rudely and said in dry hard tones rosalind i am disappointed in you i will not discuss the matter with you you know my wish i expect you to obey me and he left the room she remained standing where she was till the bell rang for dinner then with a shiver she went down stairs on the stairs she met mr armstrong your father has returned said he yes with a friend are you going down or shall you stay with roger may i he asked you know how glad he will be so the tutor turned back and thought to himself that miss rosalind was evidently anxious that he should not be a witness to her introduction to her father's friend mr ratman brilliantly arranged in evening dress and evidently already very much at home was comfortably leaning against the mantelpiece in the hall as she descended he did not wait for an introduction i could tell miss oliphant anywhere said he advancing by her likeness to her father may i offer you my arm i am not at all like father said she quietly scanning him as she spoke in a way which made even him uncomfortable and then putting her hand on her father's arm thus repulsed the visitor cheerfully offered his arm to mrs ingleton congratulating her as he did so on the recovery of her son during the meal he was aware that the young lady's eyes were completing their scrutiny and although being a bashful man he did not venture too often to meet them with his own he was conscious that the result was not altogether satisfactory to himself his few attempts to talk to her fell flat and in spite of the captain's almost nervous attempts to improve the festivity of the occasion the meal was an uncomfortable one where's old armstrong demanded tom with roger replied rosalind have you seen armstrong inquired the boy of the visitor he's a stunner i can tell you he can bend a poker double across his knee you'll like him awfully and he plays the piano like one o'clock he's our tutor you know no end of a chap mr ratman was fain to express a longing desire to make the acquaintance of so redoubtable a hero does he lick you he inquired sometimes when it's wanted but bless you he could take the lot of us left handed couldn't he jill oh yes said jill enthusiastically and he saved roger's life and prevented hodder being turned out and won such a lot of prizes at oxford he must be a fine fellow said ratman with a disagreeable laugh you admire him too of course miss oliphant yes he's honest said she teddy my boy said the visitor when he and his friend had been left alone at the table that girl of yours is a treasure she don't fancy me but she'll get over that i like her teddy i like her that evening on his way to say good night to his dear ward captain oliphant stopped at his daughter's door she was hard at work over a picture rosalind said he you have disappointed me but if your mind is made up i know it is no use my setting up my authority against your self will therefore to relieve you of the sin of disobedience to your father's wishes i withdraw my refusal to your proposal you may do as you like good night chapter eleven awkward questions the sun when it peeped through the blinds next morning found mr robert ratman wide awake his was one of those active minds which do not waste unnecessary time in sluggish repose but on the contrary do a principal part of their most effective brain work while other people are asleep snug enough so far said he to himself turning over on his side the place will suit me after all capital table easy going hostess charming young bohemian to amuse me money going about and all that teddy wants stirring up i shall have to flick him a bit he'll go well enough when he's once started but he's wasting his time here disgracefully eight months since he came and absolutely nothing done the boy's not buried the mother's not married and the tutor's not had his month's notice like to see this precious tutor by the way upon my honour it's about time i came and opened shop here and with a grunt he got out of bed and began to array himself preparatory to a stroll round the park before breakfast it was a delicious september morning the birds hardly convinced that the summer was over were singing merrily in the trees the hum of the not distant ocean droned solemnly in the air the sunlight played fitfully with the gold of the harvest fields and the lowing cattle in the meadows added their music to nature's peaceful morning anthem mr ratman was only half alive to the beauties of nature he was considerably more impressed with the substantial masonry of the manor house with the size of the timber the appointments of the stables and the acreage of the park they all spelt money to him suggesting a good deal more behind teddy's certainly a man to be looked after said he to himself he's wasting his time scandalously yet he's clever in his way is edward he has tucked his family into the big bed snugly and made the most of his chance that way why he had reached this pleasant stage in his reflections when something darted round from a side walk and collided with him suddenly it was miss jill taking an early scamper with her dog and little dreaming that she was not as usual the sole occupant of the grounds hullo my little lady said mr ratman recognising his enemy of yesterday you nearly did for me that time come you'll have to tell me you are sorry and beg my pardon very prettily no i won't exclaimed jill and proceeded to run mr ratman was not beyond a bit of fun himself besides he did not quite like to be thus set down by a child of twelve therefore although his running days had passed their prime he gave chase and a very exciting race ensued jill as fleet as the wind darted forward with little to fear from her pursuer while the dog naturally regarding the whole affair as an entertainment got up for his benefit barked jubilantly and did his best to force the pace after a minute or two mr ratman began to wonder if the game was worth the candle and was turning over in his mind the awkward possibility of owning himself beaten when he perceived that the little fugitive was by some error of judgment on her part leading the way into what looked uncommonly like a cul de sac therefore although painfully aware of the stitch in his side he bravely held on and had the gratification in a minute more of running his little victim to earth after all aha said he laughing and panting you can't get away from me you see now my little beauty i'm going to take you back in custody to the place where you started from and make you beg my pardon very prettily for nearly knocking me over in vain jill protested and struggled he held her by the wrist as with a vice and rather enjoying her wild efforts to escape literally proceeded to carry his threat into execution he had nearly brought her back to the starting place and she having fought and struggled all the way was beginning with humiliation to feel her eyes growing dim with tears when a gentleman dressed in boating flannels with one arm in a sling and an eye glass in his eye stepped abruptly across the path a moment later mr robert ratman lay on the grass half a dozen yards away on the flat of his back blinking up at the sky several curious reflections passed through his mind as he occupied this not very exhilarating position jill had escaped after all that was annoying he should have a black eye for a week that was very annoying this left handed individual with the eye glass must be the tutor that was most excessively annoying and the injured gentleman neither looking nor feeling at all well pulled himself together and sprang to his feet jill was there clinging to her champion run away jill said armstrong but you have only one arm said she go jill said he so decisively that the little maid darting only one look behind her fled towards the house all she saw was the two men facing one another one flurried vicious and noisy the other curious silent disgusted you dog hissed ratman with an oath what do you mean by that my meaning should have been clear it was intended to be ratman tried hard to copy his adversary's composure but failed miserably with many imprecations and heedless of the tutor's maimed condition he threw himself upon him but robert ratman's boxing like his running was a trifle out of date and once more he found himself on his back regarding the clouds as they flitted by overhead this time the tutor assumed the initiative get up said he advancing to his prostrate antagonist ratman was surprised at himself when after a moment's doubt he obeyed what's your name demanded mr armstrong surveying him from head to foot again by some curious mental process mr ratman obeyed what are you doing down here i am captain oliphant's guest growled ratman the tutor looked him up and down in a manner which was clearly not calculated to imply admiration of captain oliphant's choice of friends allow me to tell you sir that in this part of the world we call men like you blackguards and the tutor whose eye glass had become uncomfortably deranged during this brief interview screwed it in with a wrench and turned on his heel where's jolly old ratman inquired tom when the family presently assembled for breakfast tired with his journey no doubt said mrs ingleton as no one disputed this theory and jill's exchange of glances with her champion passed unheeded there seemed every prospect of the meal passing off peaceably but tom as usual contrived to improve the occasion in the wrong direction you'll like him armstrong when you see him he's no end of a chap all larks he'll make you roar with his rummy stories i have met him already said the tutor shortly then he is up jill my child said the captain go and knock at mr ratman's door and tell him breakfast is ready i won't go near him said jill flushing up he's a horrid hateful man isn't he mr armstrong mr armstrong thus appealed to looked a little uncomfortable and nodded yes blurted the girl and if it hadn't been for mr armstrong father he might have hurt me very much explain yourself said the fond father becoming interested i don't want to talk about him said jill what does all this mean armstrong as far as i am concerned it means that i took the liberty of knocking mr ratman down for insulting your daughter i am sorry you were not present to do it yourself captain oliphant turned white and red and black in succession you knocked a visitor of mine down twice said the tutor helping himself to sugar oh what a lark exclaimed tom oh i wish i'd been up too was it a good mill i say how many rounds six why ever didn't you come and tell me jill be quiet tom said jill did you get him clean on the jaw i say persisted tom like the one hold your tongue sir said his father peremptorily mr armstrong i must ask you to explain this matter later this is not the place for such talk quite so i regret the matter was referred to tom be good enough to pass miss oliphant the toast tom could scarcely be induced to take the hint and talked at large on the science of boxing during the remainder of the meal with an access of high spirits which on any other occasion would have been amusing mr ratman later in the day appeared with a decidedly marred visage and announced with the best grace he could that an important business letter that morning necessitated his return to london in private he explained himself more fully to his host if this is what you call making me comfortable growled he with an unusual number of oaths interspersed in his sentence you've a pretty notion of your own interests my dear fellow how could i help it you can help it now and you'll have to i may be only a creditor but i'll let you see i am not going to be treated in this house like a dog for all that the awkward thing is that if you had behaved shut up about how i behaved snarled the other you'll have to clear that cad out of the way here i'll not come back till you do and till i do come back you're sitting on a volcano my dear fellow you will spoil everything if you take such an absurd view of the matter really you will of course i'll put you right you are my guest but remember my difficult position here it will be a precious deal more difficult for you soon i can promise you said mr ratman lifting his hand to his swollen eye with an oath now then i'll give you a month if you're not rid of this fellow by then and aren't a good deal nearer than you are now to squaring up with me you'll be sorry you ever heard my name i'm that already said the captain i can promise nothing but i'll do what i can you'll have to do more if you're to get rid of me how about money this abrupt question fairly staggered the captain who broke out money didn't you drain me of every penny i had in london the fellow laughed coarsely what did you drain the regimental mess of i should like to know you needn't think you're out of that wood now i shall want l for my month in town i mean to enjoy myself the captain laughed dismally where are you going to get it from you look sharp i tell you ratman i haven't any money you can't get blood out of a stone then you must give me a bill at a month no no i won't begin that said the captain who had fibre enough left in him to know that a bill was the first plunge into an unknown region of financial difficulty if you're bent on ruining me in any case for heaven's sake do it at once and have done with it remember you bring down more than me whatever i may be they don't deserve it for their sake then give me the bill bless you any one can put his hand to paper consider yourself lucky i don't insist on taking it out in hard cash it was no use arguing or protesting with a man like this the captain flung himself miserably into a chair and scrawled out the ill omened document ratman snatched it up with a grunt of triumph that's more like said he what's the use of all that fuss plenty of things can happen in a month order the dogcart in half an hour the abrupt departure of captain oliphant's guest might have excited more remark than it did had not another departure from maxfield that same day thrown it somewhat into the shade true to her promise or rather threat miss rosalind had packed up her things and had them transported to the vicarage it was not without a pang that she uprooted herself from her surroundings in maxfield or bore the protests of roger the tears of jill and the chaff of tom for her desertion it's not that you're not all awfully kind said she to the first that afternoon when the party was assembled in his room you are too kind that's why i'm going if a little of the opposite treatment would induce you to stay said roger i'd gladly try it don't you think it's a little unkind of her to go when we all want her to stay eh armstrong that depends said mr armstrong diplomatically i should be inclined to say no myself thank you mr armstrong i'm glad i've got one person to back me up every one else is down on me auntie father roger jill tom i'm not down on you put in tom i think it's rather larks your going to the vicarage no more of that beastly art class for us but if you want to know who's down on you it's jolly old ratman i've just been to see him off in the tantrums to london i asked him to be sure and be back for roger's birthday and he said he'd try if his black eye was well enough that must have been a ripping clean shot of yours armstrong he'll get over it all right you bet he was grinning about it already and said he'd have a return some day i asked him if he didn't think rosalind was a stunner one's got to be civil to fellows you know and he said rather' and envied the kids at the vicarage i don't you always make yourself jolly civil to other people but i don't come in for much of it nor does jill i can't bear your going away said jill with tears in her eyes i'll be so lonely but it would be far worse if mr armstrong were to go away too you'll stay won't you dear mr armstrong dear mr armstrong jerked his eye glass by way of assent and said he was sure everybody would miss miss oliphant and and he would say good bye now as he had some letters to get off by the post miss rosalind who had just been thinking a little kindly of the tutor stiffened somewhat at this abrupt exit and thought mr armstrong might at least have offered to escort her over to her new quarters to tell the truth that poor gentleman would have given a finger off his hand for the chance and retired to his room very dejected about the whole business so dejected that he fidgeted about his room a good while before he noticed a note addressed to himself in captain oliphant's hand lying on the table he opened it and read mr frank armstrong is informed that his services as tutor to roger ingleton will not be required after this day month the th prox mr armstrong is at liberty to remain at maxfield until that date or may leave at once on accepting a month's wages in lieu of notice for the executors of roger ingleton edward oliphant the tutor's lips curled into a grim smile as he perused this pleasing document and then tossed it into the waste paper basket he relieved his feelings with a few chords on the piano and then after a few more uneasy turns in his room went off to call on his co trustee on his way down stairs he met rosalind and her escort about to take their departure come along with us do said tom we're just going to trot rosalind over to her diggings and then we can have a high old lark in the paddock on our way back the programme is not attractive thomas said the tutor good bye again miss oliphant captain oliphant had already bidden his daughter a tender farewell and was enjoying a cigar in the library oh said he as the tutor entered you got my note did you sir i did thanks well sir that was the question i was about to ask you excuse my saying it but it was a very foolish note for a man in your position to write did mrs ingleton mrs ingleton has decided on my advice to send her son to oxford i have recently been there and made inquiries indeed i'll join you in your smoke if you don't mind and the tutor drew a chair up to the table and filled his pipe captain oliphant was considerably disconcerted at this cool reception of his piece of news but warned by previous experiences he forbore to bluster i think the life will suit him he is wasting his time here if his health improves sufficiently said the tutor there is a good deal to be said in favour of the university you think so do you said his co guardian drily you are an oxford man yourself i understand yes i was at college so i heard from a friend of mine there who remembered your name mr armstrong twitched his glass a little and puffed away yes said the captain encouraged by this slight symptom of uneasiness i heard a good deal about you up there as it happened kind of you to take so much interest in me you ascertained of course that i left oxford in debt and without a degree this was check again for the captain who had counted upon this discovery as an effective bombshell for his side as regards roger however proceeded the tutor reaching across for the captain's ash tray i would advise balliol in preference to we shall not need to trouble you for your advice but i shall most certainly give it by this time captain oliphant's self control was rapidly evaporating he was beginning to feel himself a little small and that always annoyed him look here mr frank armstrong said he leaning back in his chair and trying hard to look superior it is just as well for you and me to understand one another i have heard what sort of figure you cut at oxford and the disgrace in which you left the university allow me to say sir that it reflects little credit on your honour that you should have imposed on your late employer and taken advantage of his weak health and faculties to foist yourself upon his family under false colours will you oblige me with a light interposed mr armstrong you are under a delusion if you think i am not perfectly well acquainted with your disreputable antecedents let me tell you sir that a music hall cad is not a fitting companion for a lad of roger's rank and expectations i perfectly agree with you but really this has very little to do with our arrangements for roger's future do you mean to deny sir that you were a music hall singer by no means i was on the whole i rather enjoyed the vocation at the time i look upon that and the year about which you apparently have not been fortunate enough to learn anything during which i was tutor and private secretary in the family of the hon james welcher the most notorious blackleg in the kingdom as two of the most interesting episodes in my career i can believe it and before you devoted your energies to singing disreputable songs to the blackguards of the east end pardon me i was particular my songs were for the most part of the classical order but what were you saying i was saying said the captain now fairly dropping the dignified and falling back on the abusive what were you before that really captain oliphant you have been so acute and successful so far i would not on any account deprive you of the satisfaction of discovering what little more remains to complete my humble biography by your own exertions meanwhile as to roger's college had you leisure when at oxford to make any inquiries as to that rather important question oblige me by addressing your conversation to some one else sir i am not disposed to be asked questions by an adventurer and sharper who the tutor's face blackened the glass fell from his eye and he rose to his feet so suddenly that the chair on which he had been sitting fell back violently captain oliphant turned pale and started to his feet too in an attitude of self defence and retreat but the tutor only walked over to the fireplace to knock out his ashes into the fender and then resuming his glass said quietly i beg your pardon i interrupted you captain oliphant did not pursue the subject and presently retired leaving his co trustee master of the situation strange said the latter to himself when the enemy had gone what a look he has of his daughter the resemblance was distinctly fortunate for him five minutes ago chapter twelve a windfall for the captain the impending birthday festivities at maxfield were a topic of interest to others than merely the residents at the manor house there indeed the prospect was considerably damped by the failing health of mrs ingleton and the absence of rosalind from the scene of action the burden of the arrangements fell upon the tutor who only half relished the duties of major domo and heartily wished the uncomfortable date was past mrs ingleton however ill as she was was intent on celebrating the occasion in a manner becoming the hospitable traditions of the house of which her son was now the head and accordingly a large party of the neighbouring gentry was invited for the occasion among the uninvited guests one individual was anticipating the event with considerable interest this was robert ratman esquire as he lounged comfortably on a sofa at the grand hotel in london and perused a letter which had just reached him by the post i shall have to get you to take another bill in place of the one i gave you due on the th the fact is i forgot that was the day of my ward's twentieth birthday when there are to be celebrations at maxfield what on earth has that to do with it grunted the reader if you will take my advice you will postpone your return here till after that date in any case please understand i am unable to attend to money matters at present it may interest you to know that the tutor is under notice to leave here the reader uttered a not very complimentary expletive also that i am on the best of terms with the fair widow eo thinks i'm a fool does he grunted mr ratman i shall have to undeceive him there so he laid down his cigar and wrote dear teddy it sounds very nice but it's not good enough you've mistaken your man my boy you'll have to stump up l on the day and i'll wait a month for the rest and interest i shall be on the spot to receive it and join in the festivities if you are not lying you deserve credit for getting rid of the tutor see he is packed off before i come and see i get no more impertinence from those brats of yours unless you wish trouble to their father yours rr the receipt of this genial epistle considerably marred the pleasure with which captain oliphant looked forward to the approaching festivities at maxfield it had been bad enough to have the oxford scheme and all it involved fall through roger had explained in his pleasant manner that he was not disposed to accept his guardian's advice as to a university course at present and as his decision was backed up by both mrs ingleton and mr armstrong the poor man found himself in a minority and no nearer a solution to his difficulties than before in addition to this roger was every day recovering health and in rosalind's absence devoting himself more loyally than ever to his tutor's direction and instruction altogether captain oliphant had a dismal consciousness of being out in the cold his carefully thought cut plans seemed to advance no further mrs ingleton's ill health was an unlooked for difficulty he even began to suspect that when he did screw himself up to the point of proposing he should make by no means as easy a conquest of the fair widow as he had flattered himself she good lady liked him as her boy's guardian but in his own personal capacity was disappointingly indifferent to his attentions with all these worries upon him it was little wonder if mr ratman's letters hurt his feelings he was very much inclined to throw up the sponge and vanish from the maxfield horizon and might have attempted the feat had not a letter which arrived on the following day suggested another way out of his difficulties it came from america addressed to the late squire and read thus dear ingleton i guess you've forgotten the scape grace brother in law who thirty six years ago on the day you married his sister ruth borrowed a hundred pounds of you without the slightest intention of paying you back he has not forgotten you your hundred pounds started me in life right away here where i am now a boss and mayor of my city i've put off being honest as long as i can but can't well manage it any longer i send you back the money in english bank notes and another hundred for interest it won't do you much good but i reckon i'll sleep better at night to have got rid of it i saw in the papers the death of my sister and her son my nephew such is life i got more good from that marriage than she did i take for granted you are still in the old place and like all the ingletons i ever met alive and kicking yours out of debt ralph headland captain oliphant read and re read this curious letter and hummed a tune to himself he gave a professional twitch to each of the hundred pound notes and held them up one after the other to the light then he examined the post mark on the envelope and failed to decipher the name of the town very singular said he to himself tapping his fingers on the envelope quite like a chapter in a story really it restores one's faith in one's fellow man to find honesty asserting itself in this way after thirty six years' suppression our dear one must have forgotten this debt years ago or written it off as a gift i'm sure he would not have liked to accept it now very singular indeed then he hummed on for five minutes and tried to recall what he had been thinking about before the letter came he fancied it was about ratman yes ratman was a bad man and must be got rid of not so much on the captain's account as for the sake of the innocent darlings whose happiness he threatened and as if there were some connection between the two ideas captain oliphant abstractedly put the two notes into his own pocket and proceeded thoughtfully to tear up the letter and envelope of the american mayor he had hardly completed this function when the door opened and rosalind sailed in looking particularly charming after a breezy walk across the park she had rarely seen her father in better and more amiable spirits ah my dear child said he it does one good to see you again a week's absence is a long time and how are you getting on at the vicarage they are awfully kind to me said rosalind and i like my little pupils i half wish it was harder work as it is i get time for a little art in between lessons i've come over to day to finish my picture of the old tower for roger's birthday ah to be sure the dear boy's birthday is getting near we shall depend on you to help us here on the day rosalind so they make you happy do they i am very glad to hear it have you all you want everything dear father and it makes all the difference to me to feel i am supporting myself brave little puss see now added the fond parent taking out a couple of sovereigns from his purse i want you to take these to get any little trifle which may add to your comfort i have not been very lavish with pocket money but i think just now you may find this useful take it my dear child and bless you really i have all i you must not refuse me daughter it will please me if you take it so rosalind kissed her father gratefully and said she should be sure to find the money useful if he could really spare it and he good man only wished it were twice as much i have just had a note said he from mr ratman who announces his return on the th during the few days he remains my dear rosalind i think you should try even if it cost you an effort to be friendly after all he is an old comrade and i have reasons for desiring not to offend him oh why ever do you let him come back after the unkind way he behaved to jill i'm sure he is a bad man father indeed i wonder at his thinking of coming at all after what has happened i dare say his manner may have been rough but it was meant only in good natured fun let us think no more about that i was annoyed at the whole affair but i must ask you rosalind not to give him unnecessary offence when he comes again i can't pretend to like people i detest said she but if he conducts himself like a gentleman and goes away soon there needn't be any trouble about it and she went off to rejoice roger with a visit during the week that followed captain oliphant impressed the whole family with his chastened good humour he paid a friendly call at the vicarage and expressed his obligations to the vicar and his wife for their consideration and trusted his daughter who though he said so who should not he was sure was a conscientious girl would do her work well and requite them for their kindness he bought tom his longed for football and ordered from town a handsome dressing case for his dear ward he delighted miss jill by allowing her to drive him in his rounds among the tenantry when he had a friendly word for everybody jill in charge of the reins was as happy as a queen and quite captivated by her father's cheerful good humour i wonder what makes you so jolly she said as they spanked along the country lanes to yeld dear dear old daddy i shall always drive you now for you see i can manage the pony can't i mr armstrong taught me he says i shall make a first rate whip i'm sure i was very stupid when i first tried but he is ever so patient he scolds sometimes but he always lets me know when he's pleased so i don't mind do you know father i'd give my head for mr armstrong any day i like him so captain oliphant shrugged his shoulders he wasn't equal to coping with a case of sheer infatuation i'm sure persisted jill flicking the pony into a trot he's fifty million times as nice as that horrible mr ratman mr ratman is a friend of mine said her father and i fear he must think you a very silly little girl to object to a bit of fun as you did i don't mind what he thinks it wasn't fun at all he hurt me very much ugh well he was very much annoyed and so was i at what happened and when he comes here again next week is he coming again next week yes all right i shall run away then or if i can't do that i shall keep a knife in my pocket please father don't let him come and the child nearly cried in her eagerness listen to me jill said her father sternly unless you can behave yourself sensibly i shall be very angry indeed i expect you to be polite to mr ratman while he is here he'd better be polite to young ladies said the irrepressible jill if he doesn't i know somebody who will make him be silent miss and bear in mind my wishes that afternoon captain oliphant sent a polite message to his co trustee requesting the favour of an interview mr armstrong found him in an unusually balmy frame of mind anxious to go into the executorship accounts everything was square and exact the rents and other receipts were all in order and the amount duly paid into the bank the tutor quite admired his colleague's aptitude for figures and the lucid manner in which he accounted for every farthing which had passed through his hands he was hardly prepared for such precision and there and then modified the previous bad impression he had formed it is necessary to be particular in money matters said the captain especially where the money of others is involved perhaps you will check my figures sir and let me know if you agree in the result mr armstrong spent an afternoon painfully going over the agent's and banker's accounts and satisfying himself that all was absolutely correct and in order he countersigned the balance sheet and went out of his way to thank captain oliphant for taking so much of the labour as to save both him and mrs ingleton a great deal of time thank you said the captain drily a compliment from signor francisco is worth receiving but it is uncalled for good afternoon sir mr armstrong flushed and screwed his glass violently in his eye a civil pleasant spoken gentleman said he to himself as he returned to his room a few days later the day before the birthday captain oliphant received a telegram couched in the following lordly terms arrive send trap to meet me ratman he frowned to himself as he read it the tone did not betoken peace it rather called to mind a good many unpleasant reflections the chief of which was that mr ratman would find matters no further advanced as regarded the widow the heir or the tutor the only comfort was that he could hardly make himself disagreeable about the bill the coachman was sent down with the dogcart but if mr ratman expected any further demonstration of welcome he was disappointed mrs ingleton was in bed jill was dining at the rectory roger and armstrong were taking a long ride tom was poaching on the maxfield preserves only captain oliphant was at home oh you're here to receive me are you snarled the visitor how long has it taken you to organise this flattering reception i should like to know i really have nothing to do with other persons' arrangements said the captain if they happen to be out it's not my concern but it's mine you ought to have sent the heir down to meet me i've not seen him yet and had those girls of yours here to give me afternoon tea where are they the captain attempted to explain that won't do for me said the visitor not by any means they should have been on the spot when did the tutor leave he is still here still here said ratman with a curse didn't i tell you he was to be packed off before i came you said a good many things ratman i expected he would have gone a fortnight ago but he can't be moved ratman growled out a string of oaths get me some tea said he and tell them to take my traps upstairs what time do we dine i was going to propose that we should dine together in my room at seven said the captain not good enough i'll dine with the lot of you at the big table and now about my bill now was the captain's turn what about it said he what about it i want the money for it that's what's about it all right keep your temper you shall have the hundred to morrow when it's due ratman glanced up at his host with a leer whose till have you been robbing now he said captain oliphant frowned you haven't a very genial way about you ratman try a cigar oh bless you said he i ask no questions it's all one to me so long as it's solid pounds shillings and pence you wait till to morrow and it will be all right said the captain and meanwhile my dear fellow try to make yourself agreeable and don't spoil sport by being unreasonably exacting ah here's the tea at dinner that evening mr ratman found his only companions captain oliphant roger and mr armstrong the talk was difficult the captain working hard to give his guest a friendly lead mr armstrong trying to appear oblivious of the fact that he had knocked the fellow down twice for a cad and roger as head of the house trying to be affable to a person whom he had expected to find detestable and who quite came up to expectations as the meal went on mr ratman showed alarming symptoms of requiring no friendly lead to encourage his powers of conversation despite his host's deprecatory signals he began to tell stories of an offensive character and joke about matters not generally held to be amusing in a company of gentlemen captain oliphant grew hot and nervous mr armstrong leant back coolly in his chair and kept his eye curiously on the speaker an apparently interested listener roger after the first surprise flushed wrathfully and fidgeted ominously with his napkin ring he was nearly at the end of his tether and an awkward scene might have ensued had not tom opportunely broken in upon the party very hungry and flushed with a good afternoon's sport hullo ratman said he greeting the visitor turned up again got over your black eye all right i've told armstrong to let me know when the next mill comes off and i'll hold the sponge been telling them some of your rummy stories i roared over that you told me about the be quiet tom and go and wash yourself before dinner said his father all right but i say ratman you'd better steer clear of my young sister jill she's got a downer on you and so has do you hear sir shouted the father somehow this genial interruption robbed mr ratman of his ideas and stopped the flow of his discourse much to the relief of the remainder of the party well said mr armstrong when he and his ward met afterwards in the room of the latter how do you like our new visitor so badly that i am thankful for once that rosalind has gone mr armstrong looked hard at his ward for a moment then he twitched his glass uncomfortably and replied in an absent sort of way quite so quite so chapter thirteen a voice from the dead roger ingleton's reflections as he lay awake on the morning of his twentieth birthday were not altogether self congratulatory he was painfully aware that he was what he himself would have styled a poor creature he was as weak physically as a girl he was not particularly clever he was given to a melancholy which made him pass for dull in society ill health dogged him whenever he tried to achieve anything out of the commonplace his tenantry regarded him still as a boy and very few of his few friends set much store by him for his own sake apart from his fortune a poor show altogether said he to himself that boy on the wall there would have made a much better thing of it there's some go in him especially the copy that rosalind here he pulled up in addition to his other misfortunes it occurred to him now definitely for the first time that he was in love she doesn't care two straws about me said he ungratefully that is except in a sisterly way why should she i know nothing about art which she loves i'm saddled with pots of money which she hates the only way i can interest her is by being ill i'm not even scape grace enough to make it worth her while to take me in hand to reform me heigho it's a pity that brother of mine had not lived yes you he added shaking his head at the portrait with your wild harum scarum face and mocking laugh you'd have suited her and been able to make her like you i can't i believe she thinks more of armstrong than me not much wonder either only wouldn't he be horrified if any one suggested such a thing and the somewhat dismal soliloquy ended in a some what dismal laugh as the heir of maxfield assumed the perpendicular and pulled up his blind mr armstrong fresh from his dip in the sea came in before he had finished dressing well old fellow said he many happy returns how are you pretty fit i'm not sorry there's a year between each said the boy what's wrong said the tutor oh nothing only i don't feel particularly festive i've been lying awake a long time pity you didn't get up shocking habit to lie in bed after you're awake at that rate i should often be up at two in the morning said roger i doubt it but what's wrong roger put down his brush and flung himself on a chair i don't know yes i do can't you guess cheese for supper suggested the tutor seriously don't be a fool armstrong and don't laugh at me i'm not in the mood for a joke you know what it is well enough the tutor's glass dropped from his eye and he walked over to the window quite so i overtook her in the park a quarter of an hour ago and she is already in the house wondering why you are so late down on your birthday roger sprang up and resumed his toilet has she really come armstrong i say i wish i knew how to make her care for me i'm not an expert in these matters but it occurs to me that the sort of thing you want is not made you mean that if she doesn't care for me for what i am it's no use trying to get her to care for me by being what i am not roger you have a brilliant way occasionally of putting things exactly as they should be put that's not much consolation pursued the boy possibly said the tutor but as i say i am not an expert in these delicate affairs much as i would like to prescribe i rather advise your taking a second opinion your mother's say i was engaged to teach you classics and the sciences but the art of love was not included among the subjects to be treated of mr armstrong was late for breakfast that morning for some reason of his own he wasted ten minutes at his piano before he obeyed the summons of the gong and the chords he played were mostly minor but when he did appear his glass was fixed as jauntily as ever and his pursed lips looked impervious to any impression from within or without to his surprise he found miss jill waiting outside the door i didn't mean to go in said she where that horrid man is till you came i don't mind a bit now come along dear mr armstrong dear mr armstrong came along feeling decidedly compromised but yet a little grateful to his loyal adherent as usual he dropped into his seat at the foot of the table after a bow to miss oliphant and a friendly nod to tom jill to her consternation found a seat carefully reserved for her next to mr ratman her impulse on making the discovery was to run but a glance at mr armstrong who sat watching her in a friendly way reassured her to gain time she went round the table and kissed every one including the tutor and especially the hero of the day whom she artfully tried to persuade in honour of the occasion to make room for her next to himself but when that transparent little artifice failed she bridled up and marched boldly to the inevitable well little puss said mr ratman haven't you got a kiss for me no she replied father says i'm to be civil to you so i'll say good morning but i don't mean it a bit and i still think you're a horrid bad man though i don't say so i'm not a bit afraid of you either because mr armstrong is here to punish you if you behave wickedly tom as usual improved matters with a loud laugh good old jilly cried he let him have it sit on his head he's got no friends never you mind ratman she doesn't silence sir thundered his father or leave the table instantly tom subsided promptly and you jill continued her father do not speak till you're spoken to jill looked down at mr armstrong to see if he counselled further resistance but as he was studiously busy with the ham she capitulated and said then i hope no one will speak to me because i don't want to talk mr ratman made an effort to turn the incident off with a laugh and addressed his further remarks to his host but as that gentleman found some difficulty in being cordial and as the rest of the party continued to enjoy the meal without paying much attention to him he was on the whole relieved when the performance came to an end on his way to the captain's room afterwards he encountered mr armstrong the two men glared at one another in a hostile manner for a moment and then the tutor observed casually that it was a cold day it will be hotter before it's much older growled the late owner of a certain black eye i can well believe that said the tutor drily yes sir i shall have something to say to you delighted i'm sure at any time that suits you you and i had better understand one another at once said mr ratman why not i flatter myself i understand you perfectly already do you now look here my fine fellow it's easy for you to give yourself airs but i know a good deal more about you than i dare say you would care to own yourself if you'll take my advice the sooner you clear out of here the better you may think you've a snug berth here and flatter yourself you pass for a saint with your pupil and his mamma but let me tell you i could open their eyes to a thing or two which would alter their opinion as well as the opinion of certain young lady friends who who do not require the assistance of robert ratman to keep them out of bad company retorted the tutor hotly for him no but they may require the assistance of robert ratman to keep them from being ashamed of their own father mr armstrong the tutor glared through his glass he understood this threat what of that said he merely said mr ratman that it depends pretty much on you whether they are to continue to believe themselves the children of an officer and a gentleman or of a a fugitive from justice that's the position mr tutor the responsibility rests with you if you choose to go i shall not undeceive them if you don't well it may suit me to open their eyes there the tutor inspected his man from top to toe in a dangerous way which made the recipient of the stare decidedly uncomfortable then pulling himself together with an effort mr armstrong coolly inquired have you anything more to say that's about enough isn't it i give you a week thanks very much said mr armstrong as he turned on his heel roger after a long ramble in the park with his fair tormentor returned about noon flushed and excited armstrong old man said he what's to be done she's kind to me horribly kind but whenever i get near the subject she laughs me off it and holds me at arm's length what's the use of my name and my money and my prospects if they can't win her if i jest she's serious and if i'm serious she jests we can't hit it what's to be done i say patience said the tutor it took several years to capture troy all very well for an old bachelor like you i expected you'd say something like that i know i could make her happy if she'd let me try but she won't even let me tell her i love her what should you do yourself mr armstrong coloured up at the bare notion of such a dilemma i think i might come to you and ask your advice said he roger laughed rather sadly i know said he of course it's a thing one has to play off one's own bat but i sometimes wish i were anything but the heir of maxfield she might care for me then you can disinherit yourself by becoming a criminal or marrying under age or dying thank you said the boy you are something like a consoler i know it's a shame to bore you about it but i've no one else to talk to i'd give my right hand to help you old fellow said the tutor but as you say i'm absolutely no use in a case like this i know come upstairs and play something by the way said the tutor as they reached the study i've something to give you you may as well have it now and he went to his desk and took out an envelope it will explain itself said he handing it to the boy he sat down at the piano and wandered over the keys while roger too full of his own cares to give much heed to the missive in his hands walked over to the window and looked out across the park the afternoon sun was glancing across the woods and gleaming far away on the sea if only she would share it with me thought he to himself how proud i should be of the dear old place but what good is it all to me if she condemns me to possess it all myself then with a sigh he turned his back on the scene and let his eyes fall on the letter he started as he recognised the dead hand of his father in the inscription to be given unopened into the hands of roger ingleton junior on his twentieth birthday his breath came fast as he broke the seal and looked within the envelope contained two enclosures a document and a letter the latter which he examined first was dated scarcely a fortnight before the old man's death written in the same trembling hand as the words on the envelope my dear son it said this will reach you long after the hand that writes it is still and cold my days are numbered and for better or worse are rapidly flying to their account but before i go i have something to say to you read this and the paper i enclose herewith if after reading them you choose to destroy them no one will blame you no one will know you will do no one an injury you are free to act as you choose what follows is not a request from me still less a command it is a confidence no more roger put down the letter his head was in a whirl he only half heard the notes of the tutor's sonata as they rose and fell on his ear presently with beating heart he read on you had a brother once a namesake whom you never saw and perhaps never heard of you never mourned his loss for he was gone before you were born twenty two years ago he was a boy of a fine high spirited ingleton like a fool i thought i could bring him up to be a fine man but i failed i only spoiled him he grew up wild self willed obstinate a sorrow to his mother an enemy to his father the day came when we quarrelled i accused him unjustly of fraud he retorted insolently in my passion i struck him and he struck back i fought my own boy and beat him but my victory was the evil crisis of my life for he left home vowing he would die sooner than return his mother died of a broken heart i had to live with mine too proud to repent or admit my fault then came a rumour that the boy was dead i never believed it yet wrote him off as dead now as i near my end i still discredit the story i am convinced he still lives in that conviction i have made a new will which is the paper enclosed as you will see it provides that if he should return before you attain your majority he becomes sole heir to the property if not found before that time the will under which you inherit all remains valid you are at liberty to keep or destroy this new will as you choose nor if you keep it are you bound to do anything towards finding your lost brother but should you desire to make inquiries i am able to give you this feeble clue that after leaving home he went to the bad in london in company with a companion named fastnet but where they lived i know not also that the rumour of his death came to me from india i can say no more only that i am his and your loving father roger ingleton towards the end the writing became very weak and straggling and what to the boy was the most important passage was well nigh illegible when after reading it a second time he looked up it was hard to believe he was the same roger ingleton who a few minutes since had broken the seal of that mysterious letter the tutor lost in his music played on the sun still flashed on the distant sea the park still stretched away below him but all seemed part of another world to the heir of maxfield his brother that wild eyed fascinating defiant boy in the picture lived still and all this place was his till that moment roger had never imagined what it would be to be anything but the heir of maxfield every dream of his for the future had maxfield painted into the background he loved the place as his own as his sphere in life as his destiny was that a dream after all were all his castles in the air to vanish and leave him a mere dependant in a house not his own he took up the document and read it over it was brief and abrupt referring to the former will it enjoined that all its provisions should remain strictly in force as if no codicil or later will had been executed until the th of october on which day roger ingleton the younger should attain his majority but if on or before that day the elder son whom the testator still believed to be living should be found and identified the former will on that day was to become null and void and the elder son was to become sole possessor of the entire property if on the contrary he should not be found or have proved his identity by that day then the former will was to hold good absolutely and the codicil became null and void such shorn of its legal verbiage was the document which roger by the same hand that executed it was invited if he wished to destroy perhaps for a moment as his eyes glanced once more across the park and a vision of rosalind flitted across his mind he was tempted to avail himself of his liberty but if the idea endured a moment it had vanished a moment after he went up to the piano where mr armstrong still in the clouds was roaming at will over the chords and laid his father's letter on the keyboard read that please armstrong the tutor wheeled round on his stool and put up his glass something in the boy's voice arrested him he glanced first at his pupil then at the paper a private letter said he i want your help please read it the tutor's inscrutable face as he perused the letter carefully from beginning to end afforded very little direction to the boy who sat and watched him anxiously having read it once mr armstrong turned back to the first page and read it again and then with equal care perused the codicil when all was done he returned them slowly to the envelope and handed it back well said roger rather impatiently it is a strange birthday greeting said mr armstrong and comes i fear from a mind unhinged your father had more than one delusion near the end but on the night before he died he told me this elder son of his was dead this was written before that tell me exactly what he said the tutor repeated as nearly as he could the conversation of that memorable night is it not more probable that a fortnight earlier his mind might be clearer than at the very moment of his death it is possible of course but the letter does not seem to show it besides the inscription at the back of the portrait which you have forgotten is a distinct record of the boy's death i wish you had not shown me the letter because the only advice i have to give you is that you do with it what he invites you to do look here armstrong said roger getting up and walking restlessly up and down the room you mean kindly i know you always do but you don't seem to realise that you are tempting me to be a cad and a coward the tutor looked up and his eyebrow twitched uncomfortably roger had never spoken like this before and the heat of the words took even him aback you asked my advice unfortunately and i gave it said he rather drily do you think i should have an hour's peace if i didn't do everything in my power to find my brother now retorted the boy you're not obliged to help me i know i am i am bound to help you not because i am your tutor or your guardian but because i love you then help me in this my father i feel sure was right whether he was or not and whether i have to do it single handed or not i mean to find my brother certainly you may count on me old fellow said the tutor but be quite sure first that you know what you are undertaking if it is not a wild goose chase it is something uncommonly like it you resolve to waste a whole year you are not strong your future is all in maxfield the happiness of your mother your hopes of winning the object of your affections are involved in the step you take even if this brother of yours be living of which the chances seem to be a hundred to one he is not he is as your father says a man who has gone to the bad not the boy of the picture but a man twice your age of the ratman order let us say probably the worst possible companion for yourself and a bad friend to the people who already count you as their master had he been living with any desire or intention of claiming his title he would certainly have come forward months ago i know all that armstrong said the boy i know perfectly well you are bringing up all these points as a friend to prevent my taking a rash step of which i shall afterwards be sorry i don't care how bad he is or what it costs i mean to find him and if you help me i'm confident i shall only said he regretfully i certainly wish it was the boy in the picture and not a middle aged person who is to be looked for here tom broke in upon the conference hullo roger here you are what are you up to you and armstrong look as blue as if you'd swallowed live eels i say you're a nice chap rosalind has been waiting half an hour she says for that ride you were to go with her and if you don't look sharp she'll give ratman the mount and jockey you my boy poor old ratty didn't jill drop on him like a sack of coals at breakfast jolly rough on the governor having to stroke him down after it i say mind you're in in time to receive the deputation they're all going to turn up and old hodder's to make a speech i wouldn't miss it for a half sov all i know is i'm jolly glad i'm not an heir it's far jollier to be an ordinary chap isn't it mr armstrong decidedly said the tutor demurely but we can't all be what we like tell rosalind i'll be down in a second i'm awfully sorry to have kept her said roger by the way said the tutor when tom had gone about this letter the communication is evidently made to you by your father as a secret i am sorry on that account you showed it to me because i object to secrets not meant for me but if you take my advice you will not let it go further it would be clearly contrary to the wishes of your father i see that lock the will up in your desk again i'll take care of the letter nobody but you and i shall know of their existence and now i must go to rosalind chapter fourteen what a horsewhip discovered mr ratman's business interview with his friend was short and stormy when captain oliphant produced the hundred pound note and requested his creditor to accept a fresh bill for the balance that injured gentleman broke out into very emphatic abuse likely is it not laughed he you a common thief bring me who've saved you from a convict's cell here to be insulted and made a fool of by your miserable brats and servants and then have the calmness to ask me to lend you a hundred pounds i admire your impudence sir and that's all i admire about you my dear fellow how can you blame me blame you you don't suppose i'm going to take the trouble to do that come hand over the other hundred sharp i've nothing to say to you till that's done and mr ratman digging his hands in his pockets got up and walked to the fireplace captain oliphant's face fell he knew his man by this time and had sense enough at least to know that this was no time for argument yet he could not help snarling i can only do part the whole in five minutes or there'll be interest to add retorted mr ratman with a groan captain oliphant flung down the second bank note on the table take it you coward and may it help you to perdition thanks very much said ratman carefully putting away the money i'm not going to ask you where the money came from that would be painful ah teddy my boy what a nice respectable family man you are to be sure with which acknowledgment mr ratman in capital spirits returned to his room on the way he encountered tom who being of a forgiving disposition owed him no grudge for the trouble that had occurred at breakfast time hullo mr ratty said the boy going out aren't you looking forward to the party to night i am only i'm afraid they'll make a mess of it among them auntie's ill and in bed rosalind and roger are spooning about in the grounds armstrong's got the dismals and the governor's not to be disturbed i've got to look after everything the spread will be good enough only i think they ought to have roasted an ox whole in the hall don't you that's the proper way to do things instead of kickshaws and things with french names that one can swallow at a gulp i say there's to be a dance first i'll introduce you to some of the old girls if you like it won't be much fun for me for jill has made me promise to dance every dance with her for fear you should want one but i know a chap or two that will take her off my hands i say would you like to see my den added he as they passed the door in question mr ratman being of an inquiring turn of mind accepted the invitation and gave a cursory glance at the chaos which formed the leading feature of the apartment it's not such a swagger crib as roger's said tom but it's snug enough that's roger's opposite like to look once more mr ratman allowed himself to be escorted on a tour of discovery who is that a portrait of asked he looking at the lost roger's picture oh that's what's his name the fellow who would have been heir if he hadn't died he looks rather a tough customer doesn't he that's the picture rosalind painted for roger's birthday a view of the park from her window with the sea beyond not so bad is it rosalind thinks she's no end of an artist but i when did he die inquired mr ratman still examining the picture oh ever so long ago before the old squire married auntie i say come and have a punt about with my new football will you go and get it i'll be down presently i like pictures and shall just take a look at these first tom bustled off wondering what mr ratman could see in the pictures to allure him from the joys of football to tell the truth mr ratman was not a great artist but the portrait of the lost roger appeared to interest him as did also the sight of an open letter hastily laid down by the owner on the writing table something in the handwriting of the letter particularly aroused the curiosity of the trespasser who being as has been said of an inquiring disposition ventured to look at it more closely to be given unopened into the hands of roger ingleton junior on his twentieth birthday the coast was conveniently clear for mr ratman as fired with a zeal for information he slipped the letter from the envelope and with half an eye on the door hastily read it as he did so he flushed a little and having read the letter once read it again then he quickly replaced it in its cover and laying it where he had discovered it beat a rapid retreat he played football badly that afternoon so that his young companion's opinion of him lowered considerably nor was either sorry when the ceremony was over and the bell warned them to return to their quarters and prepare for the evening's festivities mr ratman dressed with special care spending some time before the mirror in an endeavour to set off his person to the best advantage as the reader has already been told mr ratman retained some of the traces of a handsome youth the fires of honour and sobriety were extinguished but his well shaped head and clear cut features still weathered the storm and suggested that if their owner was not good looking now he might once have been perhaps it was a lingering impression of the lost roger's portrait which made this vain gentleman adjust his curly locks and pose his head before the glass in a style not unlike his model whether that was so or not the result appeared to satisfy him and in due time and not till after several of the guests had already arrived he descended in state to the drawing room it was the first festive gathering at maxfield since the death of the late squire and a good deal of curiosity was manifest on the part of some of the guests both as to the heir and his new guardian roger nerved up to the occasion by his own spirit and the encouragement of his tutor bore his inspection well and won golden opinions from his future comrades and neighbours captain oliphant also acquitted himself well and anything lacking in him was amply forgiven for the sake of his charming daughters the elder of whom fairly took the county by storm quite unconscious of the broken hearts which strewed her way rosalind with the duties of hostess unexpectedly cast upon her by mrs ingleton's illness exerted herself for the general happiness and enjoyed herself in the task despite tom's forebodings the evening went off brilliantly the music was excellent the amateur theatricals highly appreciated and the dance all that could be desired the loyal youth found no difficulty in palming his young sister off on half a dozen partners delighted to have the opportunity and his head was fairly turned by the sudden popularity in which he found himself with visitors anxious for an introduction to the fair rosalind oh all serene said he confidentially to one of those glowing youths she's booked six or seven deep but i'll work it for you if i can you hang about here and i'll fetch her up but the luckless ones hung about in vain for tom's progress was intercepted by other candidates for the same favour amidst whom the young diplomatist played fast and loose in a reprehensible manner promised you did i demanded he of one well you'll have to square it up with that sandy haired chap at the door he says i promised him but he's all wrong for the one i did promise is that little dapper chap there in the window he's been waiting on and off since eight o'clock never you mind you hang about here and i'll work it if i hullo here's another one i didn't promise you did i all right old chappie you lean up there against the wall and i'll engineer it for you somehow she's owing me a dance about eight down the list you can have a quarter of it if you like and the other two chaps can go halves in the rest with which the unprincipled youth absconded into the supper room and who is that talking to your charming cousin asked a dowager who had succeeded in capturing roger for five minutes in a corner oh that's my tutor armstrong the best fellow in the world evidently a great admirer of miss oliphant no doubt the attraction is mutual roger laughed and speculated on armstrong's horror were he to hear of such a suggestion and that gentleman talking to captain oliphant what relation is he he none at all he's a mr ratman an indian friend of my guardian's dear me i quite thought he was an ingleton by his face but i'm glad he is not i dislike his appearance besides he has already had more than is good for him he's no great favourite said roger shortly presently captain oliphant and his companion stepped up to where rosalind and her partner stood mr armstrong said the former will you kindly see that the band gets supper after the next dance the words were spoken politely and mr armstrong although he knew that the speaker's solicitude on behalf of the band was by no means as great as his desire to see the tutor's back felt he could hardly refuse rosalind said the captain looking significantly at his daughter mr ratman desires the pleasure of a dance and will take you into the next room rosalind tossed her head and flushed thank you i am tired said she i prefer not to dance at present you are keeping mr ratman waiting my dear the colour died out of the girl's face as with a little shiver she laid the tips of her fingers on her partner's arm that's right said that genial individual do as you are told you don't fancy it but pa's word is law isn't it she said nothing but the colour shot back ominously into her cheeks and so you've run off and left us pursued her partner who rather enjoyed the situation and was vain enough to appreciate the distinction of dancing with the belle of the evening so sorry i quite envy the little vicar boys and girls upon my honour i do very unkind of you to go just as i came never mind not far away is it we shall see lots of one another at this moment just as the band was striking up for a quadrille jill came up have you seen dear mr arm o rosalind how can you dance with that man mr ratman laughed very well missy i'll pay you out you shall dance with me see if you don't before the evening is out before which awful threat jill fled headlong to seek the tutor fact is pursued mr ratman reverting to his previous topic ever since i saw you miss rosalind i said to myself robert ratman you have found the right article at last you don't suppose i'd come all the way here from india do you if there weren't attractions she kept a rigid silence and went through the steps of the quadrille without so much as a look at the talker ratman was sober enough to be annoyed at this chilly disdain don't you know it's rude not to speak when you're spoken to miss rosalind said he if you choose to be friends with me we shall get on very well but you mustn't be rude she turned her head away you aren't deaf are you said he becoming still more nettled i suppose if it was the heir of maxfield that was talking to you you'd hear wouldn't you you'd be all smiles and nods to the owner of ten thousand a year eh do you suppose we can't see through your little game you artful little schemer now will you speak or not her cheeks gave the only indication that she had heard this last polished speech as she gathered up her dress and swept out of the quadrille wait said he losing his temper the dance is not over she stepped quickly to a chair and sat there at bay come back said he following her or i will make you i won't be insulted like this before the whole room come back do you hear and he snatched her hand rosalind looked up and as she did so she caught a distant vision of an eye glass dropping from a gentleman's eye to the length of its cord a moment after mr ratman felt a hand close like a vice on his collar and himself almost lifted from the room it was all done so quickly that the quadrille party were only just becoming aware that a couple had dropped out and the non dancers were beginning to wonder if miss oliphant had been taken poorly when robert ratman was writhing in the clutches of his chastiser in the hall mr armstrong marched straight with his prey to the kitchen raffles said he to the footman get me a horsewhip raffles took in the situation at once and in half a minute was across at the stable as he returned with the whip he met mr armstrong in the yard holding his victim much as a cat would hold a rat utterly indifferent to his oaths his kicks or his threats thanks said the tutor as he took the whip go in and shut the door now sir for you touch me if you dare growled ratman it will be the worse for you and every one do you know who i am i'm i'm here he pulled himself up and glared his enemy in the face i'm roger ingleton it spoke worlds for the tutor's self possession that in the start produced by this announcement he did not let his victim escape it spoke still more for his resolution that having heard it he continued his horsewhipping to the bitter end before he replied whoever you are sir that will teach you how to behave to a lady you fool hissed ratman with an oath getting up from the ground you'll be sorry for this i'll be even with you i'll ruin you i'll turn your precious ward out of the place i'll teach that girl an ominous crack of the tutor's whip cut short the end of the sentence and mr ratman left the remainder of his threats to the imagination of his audience when ten minutes later the tutor with eye glass erect strolled back into the drawing room no one would have supposed that he had been horsewhipping an enemy or making a discovery on which the fate of a whole household depended his thin compressed lips wore their usual enigmatic lines his brow was as unruffled as his shirt front dear mr armstrong where have you been cried jill pouncing on him at the door i've been hunting for you everywhere you promised me you know and the little lady towed off her captive in triumph the remainder of the evening passed uneventfully until at eleven o'clock the festivities in the drawing room gave place to the more serious business of the county supper at which in a specially erected tent about one hundred guests sat down tom had taken care to procure an early and advantageous seat for the occasion and with one of the vicar's daughters under his patronage and control prepared to enjoy himself at last he had had a bad time of it so far for he was in the black books of almost every youth in the room and had been posted as a defaulter in whatever corner he had tried to hide from his creditors it's awful having a pretty sister said he confidentially to his companion gets a fellow into no end of a mess i wish i was your brother instead thank you said the young lady laughing oh i didn't mean that said tom you're good enough looking i think but i don't see why rosalind can't pick her own partners instead of me having to manage it for her look out if that chap opposite sees me he'll kick put the ferns between there she is next to roger like her cheek bagging the best place do you see that kid there grinning at the fellow with the eye glass that's my young sister ought to be in bed instead of fooling about here ah i knew it she's planted herself opposite the grapes if we don't look out we shan't get one that's my governor coming in looks rather chippy don't he i say lean forward or he'll see me he's caught me in the supper room five or six times already this evening by the way where's old ratty do you know ratty miss isabel no end of a scorch just the chap for you i'll introduce you hullo where is he added he looking up and down the table cautiously surely he's not going to shirk the feed never mind miss isabel i'll work it round for you if i can miss isabel expressed her gratitude with a smile and asked tom how he liked living at maxfield oh all right now i've got a football and can go shooting in the woods i have to pay up for it though with lessons and thanks all right just a little more won't you have some yourself while it's here armstrong makes us stick at it i say by the way do you remember that fellow who died don't take any of that it's no good wire in to a wing of the partridge instead eh do you whom what are you talking about asked she bewildered ah it doesn't matter he died twenty one years ago before roger was born i thought you might have known him really tom you are not complimentary you can't expect me to remember before i was born what aren't you twenty one asked tom staring round at her go on you're joking no why you look twice the age this chap you know would have been the heir if he'd lived there's a picture of him upstairs and he died did he rather but old hodder know old hodder hush said his companion the speeches are beginning what a hung nuisance said tom the oratorical interruption was a brief one the duke of somewhere as the big man of the county rose to propose the health of the heir of maxfield they were glad to make their young neighbour's acquaintance and looked forward that day year to welcoming him to his own they hoped he'd be a credit to his name and keep up the traditions of maxfield he understood mr ingleton was pretty strictly tied up in the matter of guardians laughter but from what he could see he might be worse off in that respect and the county would owe their thanks to those gentlemen if they turned out among them the right sort of man to be squire of maxfield he wished his young friend joy and long life and many happy returns of the day roger rather pale and nervous replied very briefly he thanked them for their good wishes and said he hoped he might take these as given not to the heir of maxfield but to plain roger ingleton he was still an infant hear hear from tom and was in no hurry to get out of the charge of his guardians whatever his other expectations might be he felt that his best heritage was the name he bore and he hoped as his noble neighbour had said he should turn out worthy of that as he sat down flushed with his effort and wondering what two persons there would think of his feeble performance his eye fell on the form of dr brandram who at that moment hurriedly entered the room he saw him whisper something to armstrong who changed colour and rose from his seat an intuition quicker than a flash of lightning revealed to the boy that something was wrong something in which he was concerned in a moment he stood with his two friends in the hall roger my brave fellow your mother has been taken seriously worse within the last hour come and see her the boy staggered away dazed he was conscious of the hum of voices with tom's laugh above all in the room behind of the long curve of carriage lights waiting in the garden without of the trophy of flowers and pampas on either side of the staircase then as the doctor stepped forward and softly opened a door he followed like one in a dream for an hour the dull roll of carriages came and went on the drive and the cheery babel of departing voices broke the still morning air but two guests left maxfield that night unexpectedly one was the soul of a good lady the other was the horsewhipped body of a bad man chapter fifteen strong hearts and weak tempers in the sad confusion which followed upon mrs ingleton's sudden death no one appeared to remark the abrupt departure of mr robert ratman roger certainly never bestowed a thought on the occurrence and if any of the other members of the household thought twice about it they all even jill kept their ideas on the subject to themselves to roger the week that followed his twentieth birthday was the most dismal of his life when a similar blow had fallen months ago he had been too bewildered and benumbed to realise fully his own loss now he realised everything only too vividly his own trouble the loss of the last near relative he had in the world his own sickly health chaining him down when he would fain seek comfort in action the uncertainty of his position as heir of maxfield the hopeless task before him of finding his lost brother rosalind's indifference to his affection all seemed now to pile up in one great mountain to oppress him and he half envied the gentle dead her quiet resting place it was in the second week after the funeral when maxfield once more began to assume its normal aspect and captain oliphant was allowing himself to hope that notwithstanding the removal of his latest dear departed things were likely to shape themselves a trifle more comfortably for his own designs in her absence it was in the middle of november that a letter was handed to roger as he dressed one morning in his room it bore the london post mark and looked mysterious enough to induce roger to lay down his brushes and open it there and then this is what it said dear roger you'll have been expecting to hear from me as no doubt your moral friend mr armstrong has told you who i am i don't fancy you are specially pleased with the discovery and it may suit you to turn up your nose at your affectionate brother you may turn up what you like but it doesn't alter the fact i am your brother when i heard of my father's death i was in india and made up my mind to come home on the chance the old boy had forgiven me and left me some of the needful in his will your guardian oliphant had little idea that the indian chum who made such a long journey to pay him a visit at maxfield was really the man to whom the place ought to have belonged if every one had his rights of course i soon found out my mistake the old man kept up his grudge to the end and cut me out of his will without even a shilling so you've nothing to be afraid of i dare say when you come into the property you will do something for your big brother meanwhile i don't expect much out of the pair of hypocrites my father chose to leave as your guardians but as i am hard up and you can probably do what you like with your pocket money let me have a l note once and again say fortnightly addressed to robert ratman to be called for at the general post office if i don't get this i shall conclude the ingletons are true to their reputation of being a good deal fonder of their money than their flesh and blood i don't know whether i shall turn up again or not it will depend pretty much on what i hear no doubt you've set me down as a cad and a blackleg perhaps i am i've not had the advantages you have but cad or no cad i've a right to sign myself your brother roger ingleton alias robert ratman roger read this remarkable epistle once or twice in a state of mind bordering on stupefaction robert ratman cad sharper blasphemer insolent profligate his brother the notion was ludicrous and yet when he tried to laugh the laugh died on his lips he walked over to the portrait on the wall and looked at the wild mocking boy's face there for a moment as he met its gaze it seemed to grow older and coarser the light died out of the eyes the mouth lost its strength the lines of shame and vice came out on the brow then the old face looked out again the face of the lost roger ingleton ratman my brother he groaned to himself then of a sudden he seemed to see it all it was a fraud an imposition an impudent plot to extort money but no as he read the letter again that hope vanished this was not the letter of an impostor had it been there would have been more about his rights more brotherly affection a greater anxiety to appear in good colours as it was the writer wrote in the reckless vein of a man who knows he is detested and expects little who owes a grudge to fortune for his bad luck and being hard up for money appeals not to his rights but to the good nature of his more lucky younger brother what a sad letter it seemed read in that light and how every word drove the unhappy heir of maxfield deeper and deeper into the slough of perplexity three weeks ago when his dead father's letter had come into his hands he had not hesitated for a moment as to his duty or his desire in the matter he had cheerfully accepted the task of finding that lost aggrieved perhaps hardly used brother to whom his heart went out as he gazed on the likeness of what he once had been but now to abdicate in favour of this blackguard to look for him to tell him that maxfield was his to have to depend on his generosity for a livelihood to see the good name of ingleton represented in the county by a drunken profligate what a task was that the writer evidently did not know of the second will or suspect that after all maxfield was his own no one knew of that document but roger and armstrong for a moment there returned to the boy's mind the words of his father's letter if after reading the papers you choose to destroy them no one will blame you no one will know you will do no one an injury you are free to act as you choose and armstrong the only other being who had seen the papers had urged him to avail himself of the permission thus accorded why not take the advice and save maxfield and the family name and himself ay and rosalind from the discredit that threatened he could yet be generous beyond his hopes to the prodigal he would pay to get him abroad to to a flush of shame mounted to the boy's cheeks as he suddenly discovered himself listening to these unworthy suggestions heaven help me he said to be a man it was a brief inward fight though a sore one roger ingleton weak in body often dull of wit and infirm of temper had yet certain old fashioned ideas of his own as to how it behoves a gentleman to act he cherished too certain still older fashioned ideas as to how when a christian gentleman wants help and courage he may obtain it and he was endowed with that glorious obstinacy which when it once satisfies itself on a question of right and wrong declines to listen to argument therefore when later than usual he joined the family party at breakfast it was with a grim sense of a misery ahead to be faced but by no manner of means to be avoided for fear the reader should be disposed to rank roger at once among the saints let it be added that he took his place in as genuine a bad temper as a strong mind and a weak body between them are capable of generating roger my dear boy said the captain mournfully as became the weeds he wore you are looking poorly you need a change we both need one after the trouble we have been through i think a run up to london would brace us up would you like it i don't know said roger shortly i don't think so it is trying to you i am sure to remain here in your delicate health among so many sad associations i'm quite well thank you said the boy tom how does the football get on oh said tom rather taken aback by the introduction of so congenial a theme from so unexpected a quarter i've not played very much lately jill and i had a little punt about yesterday but we did it quite slowly you know and i had my crape on my arm jill flushed up guiltily the housekeeper who since mrs ingleton's death had assumed the moral direction of the young lady had expostulated with her in no mild terms on the iniquity of young ladies playing football even of a funereal order and she felt it very treacherous on the part of the faithless tom to divulge her ill doings now she felt reassured however when mr armstrong smiled grimly nobody could see said she and tom did want a game so dreadfully we played association said tom jill got two goals and i got fifty six no i got three said jill oh that first wasn't a goal said tom you see she got past me with a neat bit of dribbling but she ran and the rule was only to walk you know because of being in mourning i really didn't run i only walked very fast said jill i should think you might allow her the goal said mr armstrong mr armstrong was always coming to jill's rescue and if any of her heart had been left to win he would have won it now tom gave in and said he supposed he would have to let her count it and was vastly consoled for his self denial by roger's proposal to join him in a game that very day before that important function came off however roger and his tutor had a somewhat uncomfortable talk in the library you are feeling out of sorts old fellow said the latter when they were left alone i've had a letter said roger another read it please if you wish it i will last time however it wasn't a success consulting me i want you to read this the tutor took the letter and turned to the signature his brow knitted as he did so and the lines grew deeper and more scornful as he turned to the beginning and read through if i were you said he returning it i would frame this letter as a good specimen of a barefaced fraud it irritated roger considerably in his present over wrought frame of mind and particularly after the memorable inward struggle of that morning to have what seemed so serious a matter to him regarded by any one else as a jest for once in a way the tutor failed to understand his ward it does not seem to be a fraud at all said roger why didn't you tell me of it before i did not regard the statement seriously nor do i now there is lie written in every line of the letter a clumsy attempt to extort money which ought not to be allowed to succeed he gives not a single proof of his identity i horsewhipped him on the night of your birthday for insulting a lady and what lady asked roger miss oliphant said the tutor flushing a little he then as a desperate expedient for getting off the punishment he deserved blurted out this preposterous story and having once published it it appears he means to make capital out of it roger old fellow you are no fool i am fool enough to believe there is something in the story said roger at any rate i must follow it up if this ratman is my brother the tutor who himself was showing signs of irritation laughed abruptly it may be a joke to you but it is none to me said roger angrily it may not concern you it concerns me very much said the tutor i am your guardian and it is my duty to protect you from schemers the two stood looking at one another and in that moment each relented a little of his anger i know old fellow said roger you think you are doing me a kindness but pardon me kindness is not the word i appeal to your common sense unlucky speech roger who was painfully aware that he was not clever was naturally touchy at any reference to his common sense it doesn't seem much use discussing said he i made a mistake in showing you the letter i heartily regret you did i hoped you would have helped me in my difficulty i will do anything for you except believe without proof and in spite of every probability that ratman is your brother he is just the age my brother would have been now so is george the coachman so am i so are half a dozen men in the village he certainly has some resemblance to the portrait i could find you a score more like it in london the long and short of it is armstrong i cannot look to you to back me up in this to make robert ratman into roger ingleton i fear not to back you up in all else and be at your call whether you think well or ill of me certainly they parted angrily though without a quarrel mr armstrong had rarely felt himself so put out and crashed away ruthlessly at his piano all the morning roger perhaps conscious that logic was not on his side whatever instinct and feeling might be retired disappointed and miserable to the park and never remembered his appointment with the eager tom at lunch time he said to captain oliphant when did you think of going to town at the end of the week my boy what do you say to coming yes i'll come the captain darted a triumphant glance in the direction of the tutor but the tutor was investigating the contents of a game pie in the endeavour to discover a piece of egg for miss jill after a pause that young lady took up her discourse if father and roger go to town tom we shall have dear mr armstrong all to ourselves hooroo said tom that is if it's holidays i am thinking of going to oxford next week said the tutor elaborately folding up his napkin addressing his co trustee have you any message i can give to any of your acquaintances there i think it would be a pity for you to leave maxfield just now one of us should remain yes do stay we'll have such larks said tom we'll get rosalind to come and stay and then we shall be able to play regular matches ladies against gentlemen you know no mr armstrong and i will stand rosalind and you suggested jill even these allurements failed i shall make my visit as short as possible i have as you know a few creditors in oxford on whom i am anxious to call let me give you a little cheese roger that evening when as usual the tutor looked in to say good night to his ward roger said rather gloomily i suppose you object to my going to london on the contrary i rather envy you of course you understand i am going up to make inquiries naturally with captain oliphant's assistance no i'm not inclined to tell him anything at present he has no idea that ratman is anything but an indian acquaintance my address will be green dragon oxford' said the tutor by the way said roger both men were talking in the forced tones which belong to an unacknowledged estrangement whether this matter is right or not i propose to write to ratman and enclose him l naturally said the tutor i am tied down as you know in the matter of my pocket money and can't well spare it out of my present allowance i want the trustees to give me an extra allowance in other words you want your trustees to keep mr robert ratman at the rate of l a year i shall agree to that the day that he satisfies me he is roger ingleton i expected you would refuse i must ask captain oliphant i'm afraid he will require my sanction to any such arrangement what do you mean to say that i am at your mercy in a matter like this i fear that is unhappily the case i can resolve the matter by resigning my tutorship had it come to that roger glanced up with a scared look which for the moment clouded out the vexation in his face excuse me armstrong all this worry is bad for my temper i'm afraid i lost it i can sympathise said the tutor for i have lost mine good night chapter sixteen roger sees a little too much life captain oliphant's motive for going to london was primarily to escape for a while from the unearthly dullness of maxfield as long as the prospect of a matrimonial alliance with mrs ingleton had been in view it had seemed to him good policy to submit to the infliction and remain at his post that vision was now unhappily past and the good man felt he deserved a change of scene and amusement a further motive was to evade a possible return of his dear friend mr ratman whose abrupt departure from maxfield had both perplexed and relieved him the second of that gentleman's uncomfortable bills was falling due in a few days and as on the present occasion no lucky windfall had dropped in from an american mayor it seemed altogether a fitting occasion for dropping for a season below the horizon when however roger unexpectedly consented to accompany his guardian the visit assumed an altogether different aspect the captain had long desired to have his dear ward to himself and the opportunity now presented was certainly one not to be neglected my dear boy said he as the two took their places in the london train i hope you are well protected against the weather change seats with me you are so liable to cold you know that it is really hardly safe for you to face the engine we must take great care of you now greater than ever and he sighed pathetically roger was getting accustomed to and a little tired of these demonstrative outbursts and quietly took the seat in order to spare discussion he was already repenting of his journey no one seemed to commend it armstrong made no reference to it dr brandram stoutly disapproved of it rosalind tossed her head when she heard of it and hoped he might enjoy himself tom failed to see why when there was football in the air at maxfield any one could be bothered to travel up to london for pleasure unless indeed he intended to take a season ticket for christy's minstrels altogether roger did not feel elated at the prospect of this visit for all that he persuaded himself that duty called him thither even if it was bad temper which drove him from maxfield what has become of ratman he inquired of his guardian casually during the journey captain oliphant looked up from his paper sharply mr ratman's whereabouts had been occupying his thoughts that very moment i really do not know my boy said he he left very suddenly and in the sad trouble through which we have passed i have hardly had time to think about him there was a pause then roger said is he an old friend of yours cousin edward cousin edward was a little perplexed by this curiosity i have known him a year or so the friendship however is chiefly on his side i thought he came all the way from india on purpose to visit you the captain laughed uncomfortably at this very correct representation of the facts that is the version he likes to give the fact is that business brought him home and as he knew i was at maxfield he wrote and proposed the visit he is no great favourite of yours i suspect roger no said roger shortly and relapsed again into silence but before the journey's end he once more returned to the charge was he in the army in india once i believe but i have never heard much of his antecedents latterly i believe he called himself a financial agent a very vague profession he was in our station before our regiment went there i suppose he had lived in india all his life he had certainly been in england when a young man said the captain and from some of his reminiscences appears not to have led a very profitable life there but how comes it you are so interested in him i have only been wondering what he was that's all said roger feeling he had been on the topic long enough roger had already written a letter to ratman addressed to that gentleman at the general post office london your letter it said has perplexed me greatly if you are my brother as you say you are why do you not give some proof that should be easy there must be some people who can identify you or some means of satisfying us all about your claim to be the elder son i should not resist you if it were so only my guardians would require clear proof before recognising you as to whether i think well or ill of you that has nothing to do with the matter if you are really and truly my elder brother i enclose ten pounds in this not to show you that i am myself fully satisfied but to let you see that the bare chance of your being an ingleton makes me feel anxious you should not think we as a family do not stand by one another i do not expect to be able to repeat it as my allowance is limited and my guardians are not likely to consent to hand over any money for you till you can prove your claim write and give me more particulars and i promise you i shall not shirk my duty to you or the name i bear at any other time roger would have shown this epistle the writing of which cost him many anxious hours to armstrong now however that help was denied him the tutor he knew would have screwed his eye glass into his eye and ruthlessly pulled the document to pieces no he must play this game off his own bat and keep his own counsel captain oliphant who had a good notion of doing things comfortably with other people's money had selected a fashionable hotel at the west end we must see you have every comfort dear boy said he in your state of health we cannot afford to rough it i have ordered a private sitting room and fires in the bedroom when you feel strong enough we will do a little sight seeing but meanwhile your first consideration must be to recover lost tone and spirits by means of rest and care these constant reminders of his poor health were very unwelcome to the unlucky roger who protested that he was in perfect health and to prove it went out next day in a cold november fog with no overcoat the consequence was he caught a severe cold and had the mortification of listening to a severe lecture from his solicitous guardian on the iniquity of trifling with his precious health roger too proud to admit that he could not take care of himself declined to treat himself as an invalid and insisted on claiming his guardian's promise to show him a little life in the great city it was surprising how many acquaintances rosalind's father had in london some were pleasant enough military men on leave and here and there a civilian's family who remembered the captain and his charming family in the hills roger accepted their hospitality and listened to their indian small talk with great good humour and when now and then some sympathetic soul guessing as a good many did one of the lad's secrets talked admiringly of rosalind he felt himself rewarded for a good deal of long suffering had he heard some of the jokes passed behind his back his satisfaction might have been considerably tempered i always said observed one shrewd dowager that oliphant would make a catch with that daughter of his he has done it evidently this boy will be worth five or ten thousand a year i hear poor fellow he looks as if it will be a battle with him to reach it what a cough i can't understand oliphant not taking better care of him he drags him about all over town as if the boy were cast iron i met them out twice this week certainly one cannot afford to play fast and loose with the goose that lays the golden eggs the goose in question made other acquaintances than these in his bachelor days captain oliphant had knocked about in london pretty considerably and had a notion now that he was a bachelor again to repeat the process roger a raw country boy as the reader by this time will admit found himself entered upon a gay round of club and bohemian life which to an old stager like the captain may have seemed a little slow but to a susceptible youth was decidedly attractive the guardian's fast acquaintances made the young heir of maxfield welcome and might have proceeded to pluck him had his protector permitted roger speedily discovered what hundreds of locks there are which the mere rumour of money will unlock he had never had such an idea of his own importance before and for a short time he deluded himself into the belief that his popularity was due wholly and solely to his personal merits captain oliphant fostered this delusion carefully i hope you are enjoying yourself my dear boy he would say after a particularly festive evening it's an excellent rule to make oneself agreeable in all circumstances i envy you your facility you see how it is appreciated it does an old fogey like me good to see you enjoy yourself it was a pleasant enough evening said roger not quite without misgivings on the subject however by the way who was the man older than the others who talked loudest and not always in the most classical english the captain laughed pleasantly no i should have been better pleased if he had not been of our party he never was select even in my young days when i met him once or twice there used to be a saying among us that fastnet if he gave his mind to it fastnet the cab was dark and the boy's pale face was invisible to his guardian but the tone with which he caught at the name struck that good gentleman yes what about it only said roger after half a minute and he spoke with an unusual effort it seems a good name for him alone in his room that night roger came to himself a week or two ago he had hugged himself into the notion he was resolved to do his duty at all costs and in spite of all discouragement here had he been wasting a fortnight forgetting duty forgetting that he had a mission posing as the heir and accepting the compliments of a lot of time servers who now that he thought about them valued him for nothing but his name and expectations and one of these the least desirable of the lot had been this fastnet the companion in profligacy of his lost brother the one man perhaps from whom he might hope to obtain a clue as to the fate or whereabouts of the man whose rights he roger was usurping he was tempted to telegraph to armstrong to come to his help but he dismissed the thought in this quest armstrong was not with him he shrank from making a confidant of the captain there was no one else to help him he must play the game single handed or not at all once more his courage failed ratman his brother fastnet his brother's friend at what a cost to the good name of his house was this wrong to be put right this self sacrifice to be accomplished but ere he slept the honest man gained a victory over the poltroon providence had sent him stumbling into the track it was not for him to draw back next morning both he and his guardian found letters on the breakfast table re directed in rosalind's hand from maxfield the latter as he glanced at his scowled and crushed the missive angrily into his pocket it was a letter from ratman reminding him that a certain bill was falling due on the following day and requiring him on pain of exposure to honour it roger's letter was in the same hand it was dated london a day or two back ratman said dear brother i received your letter and enclosure it is what i expected from you but i hope it is not to be the last i don't wonder at your suspecting my story i don't particularly care whether you believe it or not no doubt with your respectable surroundings and the prospect before you you are not over anxious to claim brotherhood with a fellow of my sort as long as you believe in me sufficiently not to leave me in the lurch i shall be fairly content but i cannot live on air and have little else to support me don't be afraid i shall turn up again now until you want me if i did it would be not so much to see you as to see some one else to whom rake as i am i have lost my heart and to whom i look to you to put in a good word on my behalf you ask for proofs i can't give you any that i know of everything is changed at maxfield since i was there even the old hands like dr brandram or hodder would not recognise me after all these years in fact they have seen me and have not done so they think i'm dead that's my fault for when i was ill in india goodness knows how many years ago with as i thought not a day more to live i told a comrade to send home news of my death and they all believed it so you see it is easier to talk about proof than give it the only person who might be able to remember me after i left home i had a hideous row with my father at the time was a man called fastnet with whom i lodged in london and who helped to make me the respectable specimen of humanity i have become i lost sight of him long since and for all i know he has joined the majority with all the others i merely mention this to show you how hopeless it is of me to attempt to prove what i say you may make your mind quite easy on that score i shall probably return to india as soon as i am in funds except for the one reason i have named i don't want to see maxfield again i've had enough of it nor do i see any advantage in meeting you so i give no address but any letters addressed to the gpo i shall receive your brother roger ingleton this letter dispelled any lingering doubt or perhaps hope in roger's mind that he was on a wrong scent the writer in protesting his inability to give any proof of his identity had mentioned the two very circumstances which the old squire had referred to in his posthumous letter he had admitted that he had gone to the bad in london in company with a youth named fastnet the news of his death had reached england from abroad besides the reckless devil may care tone of the epistle more than ever convinced the younger brother that this was no fraudulent claimant but the honest growl of an outcast who little guessed what his name was worth to him otherwise why should he keep out of the way captain oliphant came to his room while these reflections were occupying his mind he was too much preoccupied by the unpleasant contents of his own letter to notice the trouble of his ward roger said he business calls me away from town for a day or two i am sorry to interrupt our pleasant time together but i hope it will not be long make yourself comfortable here and take care of yourself are you going to maxfield inquired roger no but an old comrade i find is in trouble and wants my advice it is a call i can hardly turn a deaf ear to had roger guessed that the friend on whom so much devotion was to be expended was mr robert ratman he would have displayed a good deal more curiosity than he did as to his guardian's business as it was he was not sorry to be left thus to his own devices you know your way to the club by this time said the captain make yourself at home there and keep out of mischief that evening roger went somewhat nervously to his guardian's club since last night he had grown to detest the place and the company but just now it was the one place where he might expect to hear something of his lost brother his new friends greeted him boisterously and relieved of the restraint of his guardian's presence made more than usually merry in his honour they chaffed him about his expectations and quizzed him about rosalind they laughed at his rustic simplicity and amused themselves by putting him to the blush they plied him with wine and cigars and rallied him on his pure demure face one or two toadies sidled up and professed a sympathy which was more offensive than the badinage he endured all as best he could for one reason and one only the loudest and coarsest of his tormentors was mr fastnet at last however when not for the first time rosalind's name had been dragged into the conversation the blood of the ingletons rose the man who had spoken was a young roue little more than roger's own age and reputed to be a great man in the circles of the fast excuse me said roger abruptly interrupting the laugh that followed this hero's jest do you call yourself a gentleman a bombshell on the floor could hardly have made a greater sensation what do you mean i mean sir that you're not a gentleman the young gentleman staggered back as if he had been shot and gaped round the audience speechless hullo hullo said some one this is getting lively another of the party walked to the door and turned the key and several others hastily finished up the contents of their glasses roger needed all his nerve to keep cool under the circumstances but he succeeded all eyes were turned to the young gentleman whose move it clearly was next he was very red in his face and threatening in his demeanour but when it came to giving his feelings utterance his courage dwindled down into a bah sanctimonious young prig the astonishment was now transferred to the onlookers hullo compton i say said fastnet did you hear what he called you is that all you've got to say the honourable mr compton's face gradually bleached as he looked from one to the other he said you were no gentleman repeated fastnet determined there should be no mistake about the matter isn't that so youngster appealing to roger that is what i said said roger the lily livered hero was hanging out his true colours at last it's lucky for him snarled he he is only a visitor in this house fastnet and one or two of the others laughed disagreeably ingleton said the former taking control of the proceedings generally are you willing to repeat what you said outside certainly said roger anywhere you like and i shall be delighted to add that he is a coward there compton surely that satisfies you mr compton very white and downcast took up his hat thank you said he with a pitiful affectation of superciliousness i take no notice of young bumpkins like him and he turned on his heel fastnet stepped before him to the door look here compton said he you're a member of this club do we understand you funk this affair i've something better to do than bother my head about him understand what you like let me go fastnet opened the door clear out said he with an oath and don't show your face here again unless you want to be kicked what do you mean by that what i say be off or i won't wait till you come again whereupon exit the honourable mr compton with colours dipped now said fastnet when he had gone it is only fair to the youngster here to say that we agree with him in his opinion of our late member eh you men general assent greeted the question upon which mr fastnet suggested that as the evening had been spoiled the house do adjourn you'd better come and have supper with me said he to roger and roger feeling his chance had come accepted chapter seventeen when the cat's away maxfield manor however cheery a place in summer time with its household in full swing was decidedly desolate in dark november weather with only a housekeeper in charge that is to say to any one but the two young persons on whom the honours of the house devolved it would have appeared dull mr armstrong delayed his visit to oxford for some days after the departure of the captain and roger there was a good deal of business to be done in connection with the estate and as mr pottinger discovered when the second trustee did take it into his head to look into things it was no child's play he had an uncomfortable manner this tutor of demanding explanations and particulars with all the air of the proprietor himself and was not to be put off by any dilatory tactics on the part of the official with whom the explanation lay as in the present case the business transacted was chiefly in connection with leases and conveyances the unfortunate lawyer had a rough week of it and felt at the end very much like one of his own clients after a year in chancery however the inquisitor appeared to be fairly well satisfied when all was done so that mr pottinger who all along had on his mind the uncomfortable consciousness of a few well hidden irregularities was doubly relieved when the tutor dropped his glass finally from his eye and observed i need not trouble you further at present sir it was after this final interview that mr armstrong looked in on his friend the doctor i'm off to oxford for a day or two said he no attractions here asked the doctor yes you among others and who's to wash and dress the babies at maxfield and who is to keep the wolf from the fold at the vicarage and who is to keep an eye on the man of the law across the way the babes are well qualified to nurture one another the man of the law is under closer observation than he imagines as to the wolf i came to speak to you about that he may make a descent on the fold in which case dr brandram must go out with swords and staves and give him battle the doctor laughed i like your ideas of the medical profession its duties are variegated and lively however make yourself easy this time i hear to day that the young ladies at the vicarage with their governess are to go on monday to devonshire good said mr armstrong decidedly relieved when does your ward return said the doctor i dislike this london business altogether oliphant is not to be trusted with a boy of his delicate make you should have stopped it the tutor said nothing but looked decidedly dejected he was greatly tempted to confide the difficulties of the situation to his friend but the dead squire's secret was not his to give away unless they come home soon said he i have a notion of returning from oxford by way of london do the sooner the better when on the next day miss rosalind sailed up to maxfield to bid her brother and sister farewell it fell to the tutor's lot to escort her back to the vicarage mr armstrong said she abruptly as they went why have you and roger quarrelled mr armstrong looked round uncomfortably quarrelled yes do you suppose he would go away like this for any other reason won't you tell me what it is about roger and i have agreed to differ on a certain point miss oliphant we have not quarrelled you cannot trust me i see or you would tell me what the trouble is i trust you completely miss oliphant i will gladly tell you five minutes ago wild horses would not have extorted the confession from him but somehow or other as he looked at her standing there he could not help himself roger has got an impression that his elder brother is still living and is to be found and if found that he ought to be made possessor of maxfield i am unable to sympathise in what i look upon as an unprofitable quest that is the whole story why cannot you back him up mr armstrong i believe his fancy is utterly groundless besides which if the person he believes to be the missing brother is really roger ingleton to discover him would mean disgrace to maxfield and an injury to the name of ingleton what mr armstrong do you mean to say i mean to say that mr robert ratman claims to be the lost elder brother and that roger credits the story miss oliphant i am grateful to you for sharing this confidence with me you can help roger in this matter better than i can she looked at him with a flush in her face and then replied rather dismally i fear not for to be as frank with you as you are with me i am dreadfully afraid roger is right the same fancy passed through my mind when first i saw mr ratman i had recently been studying the lost brother's portrait you know and was struck and horrified by the resemblance mr armstrong added she after a pause if i were roger's guardian and tutor i would stand by him all the more that his duty is an unpleasant one thank you here we are at the gate good bye i hope you will have a pleasant time at oxford and she passed in leaving the good man in a sad state of bewilderment and perplexity he started a day or two later in a somewhat depressed frame of mind for oxford where he astonished and delighted most of his old creditors by calling and paying off a further instalment of his debts to them but his satisfaction in this act of restitution was sadly tempered by the sense of coercion put upon him by the doctor and rosalind and the conviction that wise or foolish pleasant or unpleasant his place was at his young pupil's side no excuse or pleadings of a false pride could dispel the feeling no he must climb down own himself wrong and sue for permission to assist in a quest in which he had little faith and still less inclination while he is making up his mind it may be worth the reader's while to remark what was happening at maxfield tom and jill woke one morning to discover themselves lord and lady of the situation in their lamentations not unmingled with a sense of injury at the desertion of which they were the victims it had not occurred to them to realise that there were alleviating circumstances in their forlorn condition the great manor house was theirs library dining hall corridors haunted chamber roof cellars all except the servant's hall and the room where mrs parker the housekeeper held austere sway the park was theirs the woods the stream the paddocks and the live stock nay when they came to reckon all up half the county was theirs and a mile or so of sea beach into the bargain they were absolutely free to roam where they liked do what they liked eat what they liked and sit up at night to any hour that pleased them mrs parker good soul though excellent in academic exhortations and prohibitions was too infirm to put her laws into active practice and when a day or two after the place had been left in her charge she succumbed to a touch of her enemy the lumbago and had to take to her bed these two young persons though extremely sorry for her misfortune felt that the whole world lay like a glorious football at their feet good old jilly exclaimed tom in his balmiest mood one morning when these two young prodigals assembled for breakfast in the big dining room at the fashionable hour of eleven with raffles in full livery to attend upon them this is what i call a lark and a half raffles pass miss jill the honey and walk about and make yourself useful i tell you what we'll go and have a snap at the pheasants and try a few drop kicks over the martyr's oak what do you say i can't shoot awfully well said jill apologetically i'd sooner if you don't mind tom walk about on the roof or help you let the water out of the big pond raffles old chappie more toast a lot more toast for miss jill i'll have a wing of something myself the fact is jilly said he when raffles had departed on his quest i wanted to get the beast out of the way while i told you i'd got an idea oh what tom asked jill in tones of surprised pleasure tom glanced round cautiously and then whispered you and i'll give a small kick up here on our own hooks what do you say a party oh tom how clever of you to think of that you see said tom accepting the homage meekly the other day in the library when we were turning out all the drawers i found a whole lot of at home' cards and the list of fellows that were asked to roger's birthday party how lovely exclaimed jill we'll just but here the return of raffles and a significant scowl from tom warned her to defer her suggestion the meal over the conspirators met in the library and put their heads together over tom's documents that's about the ticket isn't it said he displaying one of the invitation cards which he had experimentally filled up dr brandram mr and miss oliphant at home on wednesday december at o'clock music dancing fireworks etcetera rsvp but we haven't got any fireworks suggested jill we'll have to get some and what about the band i shall write to the colonel of the grenadiers and order it anyhow you can play the goblin polka if we get stuck up jill wondered whether after an hour or two her one piece even though dear mr armstrong liked it might not pall on a large assembly and she devoutly hoped the grenadiers would accept there's a hundred and fifty names down said tom may as well have the lot while we're about it isn't two days rather a short invitation asked jill bless you no you see we're not out of mourning besides mother parker may be well again if we don't look sharp or armstrong may turn up how i wish he would he'd spoil everything look here jill look alive and write the cards i'll call out the two spent a most industrious morning so much so that the household marvelled at their goodness and remarked to one another the children are no trouble at all towards the end of the sitting tom flung down his paper with a whistle of dismay i say jill they ought to be black edged jill turned pale what is to be done she gasped we'll have to doctor them with pen and ink said tom so for another hour or so they occupied themselves painfully in putting their invitations into mourning the result was not wholly satisfactory for a card dipped edgeways into a shallow plate of ink is apt to take on its black unevenly so that while some of the guests were invited with signs of the slightest sorrow the company of others was requested with tokens of the deepest bereavement however on the whole the result was passable and that evening tom slunk down to yeld post office with a bundle under his arm at the last moment a difficulty had arisen with regard to postage as between them the two could not raise the thirteen shillings required to stamp the lot however by a lucky accident tom discovered a bundle of halfpenny wrappers the property of the estate which after scrupulously writing an iou for the amount he borrowed saved a clean six and six by that he remarked when the last was licked up that'll go into the fireworks jill whose admiration for her brother's genius knew no bounds felt almost happy it was monday evening when the yeld post master was exercised in his mind by hearing a loud rap down stairs which on inquiry he found to have proceeded from the discharge of mysterious looking halfpenny missives written in a very round hand into his box being an active and intelligent person he felt it his duty to examine one addressed as it happened to the duke of somewhere after some consideration and a study of his rules and regulations he came to the conclusion that the enclosure was of the nature of a letter and thereupon proceeded to mark each with a claim for a penny excess postage which done he retired to his parlour relieved in his mind tom and jill had more to do than to speculate on the adventures of their carefully written cards now about grub said tom that evening once more jill turned a little pale she had been dreading this fateful question all along what do you think said she diplomatically tom of course had thought the problem out we must keep it dark from the slaveys said he at least till everybody comes then they're bound to give us a leg up i fancy we can scrape a thing or two up from what's in the house and i've called in at one or two of the shops at yeld and told them to send up some things addressed to miss j oliphant private' there was rather a nice lot of herrings just in so i got three dozen of them cheap then i told them at the confectioner's to send up all the strawberry ices they could in the time and buns you see everybody is sure not to come so there'll be plenty to go round didn't mr rusk ask what they were for inquired jill i said mr oliphant presented his kind regards and would be glad to have the things sharp next morning greatly to the delight of the hospitable pair the herrings came up in a basket addressed privately to miss jill later in the day tradesmen's carts rattled up the back drive with similar missives not a little to the bewilderment of the servants of the house who shook their heads and wished mrs parker would make a speedy recovery tom adroitly captured the booty and half won over raffles to aid and abet in the great undertaking good old raffy said he as the two staggered across the hall with one of miss jill's private boxes between them would you like a threepenny bit raffles whose ideas of a tip were elastic admitted that he was open to receive even the smallest coin all right mum's the word jill and i have a thing on and we don't want it spoiled by the slaveys raffles said that as far as he knew the slaveys were thinking about anything else than the proceedings of the two young oliphants besides said he being 'olidays there's only me and the cook and a maid and she's took up with nursing mrs parker poor old parker how is she pretty chippy sorry she's laid up all serene raff keep it mum and you shall have the threepenny jolly heavy box that that's the cocoa nuts oh you're going to have a feast are you said raffles getting on that way said tom we can't ask you you know because you'll have to wait but you shall have some of the leavings if you back us up with locked doors that night tom and jill unpacked and took stock of their commissariat thirty six herrings cut up in four said tom with an arithmetical precision which would have gratified mr armstrong makes goes of herring if every man jack turns up that'll only be six goes short and if you and i sit out of it only four we might cheek in a head or two by accident to make that up who will cook them asked jill oh we can do that i fancy on a tray or something then six cocoa nuts into will be twenty five you'll have to cut each one into twenty five bits jill then one bun apiece and oh the ice how on earth are we to slice that up there's about a soup plate full couldn't get strawberry so he's sent coffee ugh said jill i'll give up my share i did my best said tom it's not my fault strawberries are out of season of course not you're awfully clever tom what should i have done without you good old jilly what about plates the consultation lasted far into the night next morning the post brought a dozen or so of polite notes which sent the hearts of the hospitable pair into their mouths the first they opened was from the duke of somewhere who gravely accepted with pleasure mr and miss oliphant's polite invitation several of the others were acceptances one or two refusals five scratched already said tom that'll make it all right for the herrings in the afternoon dr brandram called he carried his invitation card in his hand what game are you at now he demanded oh i say doctor keep it quiet you'll come won't you there'll be a tidy spread enough to go all round and the duke and his lot are coming and we expect the grenadiers doctor said jill we shall depend on you so much do come early dr brandram drove back to yeld in a dazed condition of mind he was tempted to telegraph to the duke and the county generally to set a body of police to prevent any one entering the maxfield gates to shut the two miscreants up in the coal cellar to run away and not return till next week but after an hysterical consultation with himself he decided that it was too late to do anything but cast in his lot with the other victims and go dressed in all his best to miss oliphant's at home and do what he could to steer her and her graceless brother out of their predicament as the fateful hour approached tom began to be a little nervous he had not anticipated the vast number of small details demanding his personal attention for instance there was the cooking of the herrings jill had nobly undertaken that task at the drawing room fire which was the most capacious but then if they ran it too fine the guests might arrive while the fish were still fizzling on the tray if on the other hand they were cooked too soon they would be lukewarm by the time the guests came to sit down to them again there were the starlights and roman candles to get into position outside and arrangements had to be made for their protection from the damp november mist then too the faithless grenadiers had not turned up which necessitated jill deserting her herrings and privately practising the goblin polka in view of possible emergencies further the table had to be laid and every guest's go of buns and cocoa nut and coffee ice doled out in readiness and at the last moment there arose a difficulty in raising the requisite number of knives forks spoons and plates then he discovered that the covers were still on the drawing room chairs and the dust cloth on the floor and much time and trouble was necessary for their removal finally he and jill had to dress to receive their guests i think it will be a jolly evening said he somewhat doubtfully as they hurried to their rooms i'm sure it will said jill whose mind had not once been clouded by a doubt the herrings will be cold that's the only thing but they may think that's the newest fashion look sharp and dress anyhow said tom because you've got to cut them in fours and stick them round on the plates and it's half past six already half an hour later a grand carriage and pair drove up to the door and raffles solemnly announced his grace the duke of somewhere and the ladies marigold miss oliphant's evening party had begun chapter eighteen miss jill oliphant at home when his grace who had been a good deal puzzled by his abrupt under stamped invitation stepped head in air into the drawing room he was somewhat taken aback to discover neither the captain nor his charming elder daughter but instead to be greeted by a little girl nervously put forward by a small boy and saying oh duke do you mind coming i hope you'll enjoy the party so much there'll be some dancing presently and supper as soon as all the others come you're the first said tom never mind the others won't be long like to read the newspaper or take a turn round mentally he was calculating how he should manage to squeeze in the duke's two daughters who hadn't been invited at his hospitable board the duke smiled affably we are rather early but miss rosalind will excuse oh she's away so is father this is my party and tom's oh duke do try and like it said jill taking the great man's hand the duke cast a scared look over his shoulder at his daughters who were staring in a somewhat awestruck manner at their two small hosts if the girls would like to begin dancing suggested tom jill can play her piece now and you can take one and i'll take the other it'll keep the things going you know till the rest turn up at this juncture dr brandram was announced greatly to tom's delight who among so many strangers was beginning to feel a little shy that's all right said he good old brandy you lead off with one of the marigold girls while i stop here and do the how d'ye do's the doctor with a serious face led his grace aside this appears to be a freak of the two young people said he they are the only members of the family at home i am very sorry you have been victimised tut tut said the duke recovering his good humour rapidly i don't mean to be a victim at all i mean to enjoy myself so do you doctor girls said he to his daughters you must see the youngsters through this ha ha what is the rising generation coming to to be sure arrivals now began to drop in smartly and as tom looked round on the gradually filling drawing room a mild perspiration broke out on his ingenious brow jill had gallantly struck up her polka on the piano but as no one listened and no one danced she gave it up and returned to the support of her brother it's going splendidly said tom in a stage whisper they all seem to be enjoying it they certainly were for as each gradually took in the situation and received his cue from his neighbour an unwonted air of humour permeated the room a few hoity toity persons of course felt outraged and would have ordered their carriages had there been any one to order them from the honest raffles was to tell the truth secretly busy on a signal from tom preparing for the banquet in the dining room and no other servant was to be seen my dear said mrs pottinger in a severely audible voice to her husband i wish to return home will you get our carriage my ideas of amusement do not correspond with those of the young people oh don't go yet said tom with beaming face for he had caught sight of raffles' powdered wig at the door there's some grub ready in the next room it would have been ready before only the herrings tom said jill there's the bishop just come he couldn't come for roger's birthday you know how do you do bishop said tom grasping the new arrival by the hand jolly you could come this time i was just saying there's some grub in the next room jill raff had better ring up on the gong tell him raffles accordingly sounded an alarm on the gong which brought the company to attention supper cried tom encouragingly and led the way allowing the company generally to sort themselves the duke behaved nobly that night he gallantly gave his arm to jill and asked the bishop to bring in one of his daughters this saved miss oliphant's party from the collapse which threatened it every one took the cue from the great people even mrs pottinger accepted the arm of the curate and the ardent youths who had all arrived under the delusion that miss rosalind was the hostess forgot their disappointment and vowed to see the youngsters through with it oh duke said jill hanging affectionately on her noble escort's arm are you liking it do try and like it it's tom's and my first party and we want it to be a jolly one i never enjoyed a party half so much said his grace jill thought him at that moment almost as nice as dear mr armstrong jill said tom waylaying his sister at the door we might have cut the herrings in three after all never mind some of them will be able to have two goes i'll see you do good old jilly isn't it going off prime and you know the fireworks are still to come it was too severe a strain on the gravity of some of the guests when they beheld each his go of lukewarm herring cocoa nut coffee ice and penny bun with a single plate to accommodate the whole on the board before him but the laughter if it reached the ears of the genial host and hostess was taken by them as a symptom of delight in which they heartily shared tom as he cast his eye down the festive board object of so much solicitude and physical exertion never felt happier in his life more than half of the company would be able to get a second helping of fish and bun wire in said he to his guests generally and to the younger lady marigold his next neighbour in particular before it gets cold awfully sorry the cocoa nut milk wasn't enough to go round so jill and i thought here a guilty look from jill pulled him up dear old jilly he wouldn't let out on her for worlds a good many eyes turned curiously to where the duke sat with his go before him those who were quick at observing details noticed that he had ranged his cocoa nut and ice on the edge of his plate and was beginning to attack his herring with every sign of relish his portion consisted mostly of hard roe for which he had no natural predilection but this evening he seemed to enjoy it helping it down with occasional bites at the bun and keeping up a cheerful conversation the while the bishop too who had a tail was making a capital meal as were also several other of the guests near him capital fish said the duke presently then beckoning to raffles can you get me a little more yes your grace tom felt a little anxious lest raffles should select from out of the surplus goes one of those with the heads which were to eke out in a last emergency but when he saw that the duke's second helping consisted of a prime waist he rejoiced with all his heart isn't it nice asked jill who had been busily at work under the shadow of his ducal wing my dear little lady i never tasted such a meal in my life in due time the cocoa nut and coffee ice were attacked with quite as much relish as the first course after which tom looking a little warm rose and made a little speech i hope you've all liked it said he i was afraid there wouldn't be enough but some of them didn't turn up so it was all right after all jill that's my young sister here cut the goes' up and i don't know anybody more fair all round than her she and i are awfully glad you came and hope you'll have a good old time please don't tell the governor or rosalind we gave this party i beg to propose the health of my young sister good old jilly she's a regular brick and has backed up no end in this do no heel taps a good many healths had been drunk in the county during the year but few of them were more genuinely responded to than this and no queen ever bore her honours more delightfully than the little heroine of the evening i suppose we'd better cut into the next room now suggested tom when this function was over there'll be some fireworks by and by but any one who likes a hop meanwhile can have one jill knows a ripping piece to play the invitation was cordially responded to and when after sundry repetitions of the ripping piece the eldest miss marigold offered to play a waltz and after her miss shafto relieved duty with a polka and after her one of the ardent youths actually condescended to perform a set of quadrilles in which his grace the duke with jill as his partner led off vis a vis with the bishop and the sister of the member for the county there was no room to doubt the glorious success of miss oliphant's party tom meanwhile joyous at heart warm in temperature and excited in mind was groping on his knees on the damp grass outside the drawing room window fixing his two threepenny roman candles in reversed flower pots and planting his starlights crackers and catherine wheels in advantageous positions in the vicinity casting now and again a delighted glance at the animated scene within and wondering if he had ever spent a jollier evening anywhere it disturbed him to hear a vehicle rattle up the drive and to argue therefrom that some belated guest had missed the feast never mind he shouldn't be quite out of it raffles called he as he caught sight of that hardworking functionary through the dining room window removing the debris of the banquet leave a few goes' out on the table for any chaps who come late and then go and tell jill i'm ready and turn down the gas in the drawing room in due time raffles delivered his momentous message oh the fireworks cried miss jill clapping her hands the fireworks are to begin aren't you glad duke do get a good seat before the gas is turned down the company crowded into the big bay window and endured the extinction of the light with great good humour indeed a certain gentleman who entered the room at this particular juncture seeing nothing but hearing the laughter and talk said to himself that this was as merry an occasion as it had been his lot to participate in the dim form of tom might be seen hovering without armed with a bull's eye lantern at which he diligently kindling matches which refused to stay in long enough to ignite the refractory fireworks never mind said he to himself they'll like it when they do go off so they did after a quarter of an hour's waiting one of the roman candles went off with vast eclat and after it two crackers simultaneously gave chase to the operator half way round the lawn one of the catherine wheels was also prevailed upon to give a few languid rotations on its axis and some of the squibs which had unfortunately got damp condescended after being inserted bodily into the lantern to go off presently however the wind got into the lantern and the matches being by this time exhausted and the starlights refusing to depart from their usual abhorrence for spontaneous combustion the judicious tom deemed it prudent to pronounce this part of the entertainment at an end all over he shouted through the window turn up the light when after the applause which greeted this imposing display the gas was turned up the first sight which met miss jill's eyes was the form of mr robert ratman in travelling costume nodding familiarly across the room at the sight the little lady's face blanched and the joy of the evening vanished like smoke oh duke she exclaimed clinging to her guest's arm do please turn that wicked man there out of the house we didn't invite him and he's no right really if dear mr armstrong was only here please put him out the duke looked a little blank at this appeal why child really who is he he asked a wicked bad man that i hate and i did think you would be kind enough to what is his name mr ratman he hurt me awfully once the duke feeling that miss oliphant's party was taking rather a serious turn walked across the room to where mr ratman was already engaged in an uncomfortable colloquy with dr brandram what are you doing here the doctor had asked that's my business said mr ratman for the matter of that what are you doing here among other things i am here to see that the young people of the house are not annoyed by the intrusion of a person called ratman and i said the duke coming up am here to advise you to save trouble by leaving the house and who are you sir i am the duke of somewhere proud to renew my acquaintance sir may i ask if you have quite forgotten me sir you have the advantage of me i never saw you before pardon me my lord you saw me a month ago at a birthday party in this very house if so i was not sufficiently impressed sir to remember you now i repeat my request as the friend of the young lady ah indeed said ratman i am not aware your grace of your right to speak to me in the name of miss oliphant or anybody else oh said tom arriving on the scene at this juncture you there ratty you'd better clear out all the grub's done and you're not wanted here we didn't ask you took care not to rosalind's not here this is jilly's and my party isn't it you chaps the chaps appealed to his grace the doctor and one or two of the other guests corroborated this statement mr ratman leant comfortably against the wall flattering reception said he i am inclined to take your lordship's advice and go but before i do may i ask your lordship again if you really do not remember me i never saw you before sir said his grace and allow me to add i have no desire to see you again dear duke whispered jill encouragingly putting her hand in his odd the changes a few years make rejoined mr ratman i presume your lordship's memory can carry you back a little time say twenty years what of that sir merely that if that is so you probably can remember a lad named roger ingleton who lived in this house son of the old squire there was a dead silence now and the duke looked in a startled way at the speaker i see you remember that boy said the intruder and you probably heard the story of my i mean his quarrel with his father and also heard of his supposed death now your grace put twenty years on to that boy and suppose the story of his death was a myth then say again you don't remember me what you mean to say you are young roger ingleton at your grace's service tom gave a whistle half dismay half amusement the doctor smiled contemptuously the duke bit his lip and gazed stolidly at the speaker you are not obliged to believe me said the latter jauntily only you wanted to know my business in maxfield and i have told you i don't say i'm the heir for i understand my father was good enough to cut me out of every penny of his estate and as for being a paragon of virtue or the opposite that's my affair and no one else's eh your grace his grace was much disturbed he had once seen young roger ingleton at that time a mere boy but retained no distinct memory of him at the time of the quarrel between father and son he had been abroad and the news of the lad's death had been formally communicated as a matter beyond question recognition as far as he was concerned was impossible you choose a strange time sir said he for coming here with this story when the heir and his guardians are both away i supposed my brother was here said ratman in any case he knows who i am so does your friend the tutor dr brandram oh why do you stop talking to that hateful man instead of coming and enjoying the party pleaded jill ah my little lady is that you said ratman advancing but his passage was intercepted by the doctor gently my friend said he now that you have relieved yourself of your pretty story let me suggest that the easiest way out of this house is by the door who are you sir blustered ratman dr brandram laughed i must have changed in twenty years as much as you said he i am not going to ask your leave to be in my father's house i am not going to ask your leave to put you out of it tom's spirits rose there seemed every promise of an unrehearsed entertainment for the delectation of his guests i caution you sir i will take all responsibility said the doctor anything more you have to say can just as well be said in mr pottinger's office to morrow morning as here thank you sir said mr ratman with a snarl it is never pleasant to have to introduce oneself but i am glad to have had the opportunity before this distinguished company it is now the turn of the other side to move if they want me they must find me good night your grace you are a nice loyal neighbour to an old comrade's boy good night you sir take as much responsibility as you like if it is any satisfaction to you good bye my pretty little jill some day you'll have to call me cousin roger and then we'll be quits good night gentlemen and ladies all the prodigal's return has not been a success i own but it's a fact all the same au revoir and he bowed himself out this fellow is either the most impudent villain i ever met said the duke or there is something in his story this seemed to be the general impression a few dr brandram among them scoffed irreverently at the whole affair but the majority of those present felt decidedly disturbed by the incident and poor miss jill oliphant had the mortification of seeing her party drop flat after all tom and she made herculean efforts to rehabilitate it jill played her polka till she was tired and tom after setting out all the duplicate goes in the hall retired to grope in the wet grass for a few of the unexploded squibs some of the guests did what they could to back their hosts up and made great show of enjoying themselves but the duke was preoccupied and the bishop was pensive the marigold girls talked in a corner and mr pottinger was out in the hall calling for his carriage odious man said the poor little hostess he's spoiled all our fun no one likes our party now they'll all be glad to get away and we did try so hard to make it jolly never mind said tom cheerfully it would have been worse if he had turned up before the grub and the fireworks they didn't miss them keep it up jilly i say it's going off all right when it came to saying good night every one remembered their genial entertainers and jill was a little consoled by the assurances she received on all hands that the evening had been a delightful one try to think it was nice said she and don't go saying it was horrid as soon as you get outside it's tom's and my first party you know and she kissed all the gentlemen from the duke downward and tom hovering in the hall pressed his farewell refreshments as far as they would go upon them and gave them a leg up into their carriages dr brandram stayed till the end i should have to come and see mrs parker in the morning in any case said he so i have told raffles to make me a shake down in armstrong's room to night i may as well stay here the precaution however was unnecessary mr ratman had vanished he did not call on mr pottinger next morning nor was he to be found at the hotel he had returned by the early morning train to london chapter nineteen a feeble clue mr fastnet's lodgings were a good deal less imposing than roger who had hitherto only met the owner at the club had pictured to himself in fact the small sitting room with bedroom to match commonly furnished reeking of tobacco and hung all round with sporting and dramatic prints was quite as likely a refuge for an unfledged medical student as for a person of the swagger and presence of mr felix fastnet no use to me he explained interpreting his young guest's thought except as a dog kennel i live at the club breakfast lunch dinner everything but i was so disgusted with the performance of that young cad to night that i even prefer the dog kennel have a soda roger accepted and sat down by the fire yes growled on his host i'm father of that club and i don't like to see it degraded if he'd gone for you and kicked you into the street i shouldn't have lifted a finger to stop him he could have made hay of you if i'd chosen a sickly youngster like you i wonder he did not said roger but mr fastnet now i have met you i want to ask you a question ask away my name as you know is roger ingleton have you never met any one of my name before bless me no why should i i had a namesake once who came to london and i wondered if you possibly knew him my dear sir i don't know quite all the young men who have come to london during the last twenty years what makes you think it my namesake was a brother son of my father's first wife he left home and disappeared rumour says he went to london where he was last heard of in company of a companion named fastnet mr fastnet put down his glass eh said he the fastnets are not a big clan are you sure that was the name it was certainly the name that reached me must refer to some one else then i never knew or heard of any one of the name of ingleton in my life roger's countenance fell the new scent appeared likely to be a false one after all how long ago is all this asked his host more than twenty years my brother left home in a pique and i'm afraid went to the bad in twenty years said mr fastnet putting down his cigar beside the glass what sort of fellow was he a harum scarum young dog with impudent eyes and a toss of his head that would have defied the bench of bishops that is he said roger excitedly sit down continued fastnet curly hair arms like a young hercules as obstinate as a bulldog with a temper like a tiger yes yes that must be the same left his mother and father in a furious tantrum with a vow to cut off his head before he showed face at home again a regular young demon as honest as the bank of england no taste for vice in any shape or form but plunged into it just to spite his friends civil enough when you got him on the weather side and no fool was that the fellow i'm sure you describe the very man said roger man he was a boy a raw boned green boy smarting under a sense of injustice a regular thorough paced young ishmaelite as you ever saw i should fancy i did know him but his name was not ingleton what was it jack rogers no doubt he adopted his own christian name as a disguise very likely i could never get him to talk about his people his one object was to lose himself body and soul it seemed to me bless you i had little enough voice in his proceedings i was wild enough but i promise you i was a milksop to him neck or nothing was his motto and he lived up to it the one drawback to success in his particular line was that he would insist on being a gentleman fatal complaint to any one who wants to go to the bad have you any idea what became of my brother not in the least he knocked about with me for about a year till he suddenly discovered he was living on me not that i minded i had pots of money it's been my curse never had to do a day's work in my life he pulled up short at that pawned his watch and refused to take another crust of bread and left me without a penny in his pocket i only heard once of him afterwards he wrote to enclose a five pound note have you got his letter can you remember where he wrote from asked roger excitedly i don't believe there was a letter the note was wrapped up in an old play bill of some strolling company of actors i remember it now added fastnet laughing and re lighting his cigar yes it was hamlet rogers was cast for the ghost in one act polonius in another and the grave digger in another i remember how i roared when i read it fancy that fellow as polonius can't you remember the town not a ghost of an idea some little village in the midlands probably where hamlet would be appreciated i remember by the way the bill pity i didn't keep it mentioned that this enterprising company was going to give a performance in boulogne of all places it occurred to me it would be a source of great consolation to our fellow countrymen in that dismal colony to witness jack rogers in the ghost for one night only that would be eighteen or nineteen years ago said roger with a sigh at the hopelessness of his quest you have heard nothing since not a syllable have some more sherry roger reached his hotel that night in more than mental distress the fatigue and anxiety of the last few days had had their inevitable result on his health and though the penalty had been postponed it was coming to account at last when his worthy guardian returned on the following day he was much shocked to find his ward really ill he did his best he tried to induce the patient to make an effort to shake off his ailments he sat up late in his room at night talking and attempting to amuse him he even purchased a few amateur specifics and finally when the boy was as ill as ill could be called in a pettifogging practitioner who might be trusted to bungle the case regular bad case said that learned gentleman after the third or fourth visit may last a week with care the good captain naturally grew concerned matters seemed to be progressing beyond even his expectations the practitioner's verdict speedily got wind in the hotel visitors came anxiously to inquire after the young gentleman's condition and urged a second opinion and one or two were inconsiderate enough to suggest that the patient was not having fair play under these distressing circumstances captain oliphant decided to write a line to dr brandram roger has unfortunately taken a chill will you kindly forward me the prescription which benefited him so much last summer as i am naturally anxious to omit no precaution for the dear fellow's good he is being well cared for and will i trust be all right in a day or two dr brandram's reply to this transparent communication was to order his dogcart and take the first train to london before starting he had time to send a telegram to armstrong to meet him at the hotel the same evening little dreaming of the effect of his message captain oliphant was spending a resigned afternoon in the sick room fate was working on his side once more mr ratman had apparently vanished into space mr armstrong was out of the way the practitioner's face had been longer than ever when he took his leave a few hours ago the difficulties and disappointments of the past few months were giving way to better prospects the good man's conscience accused him of no actual injury to his ward on the contrary he could honestly say he had devoted time money personal fatigue to tending him he had secured him medical attendance he had advised the family doctor of his indisposition he had sat up with him day and night was it his fault if the illness took a bad turn and the maxfield property changed its owner he should like to meet the man who could lay anything at his door roger turned on his pillow and began to wander tell him i believe it i'll go and find the grave digger ask fastnet and compton and all of them no more sherry thanks yes sir i said you were no gentleman i repeat it you have no right to mention her name shut the door rosalind there's only eleven months to do it in he is waiting at the general post office armstrong has gone away they expelled him from the club poor fellow sighed the captain as he smoothed the sufferer's pillow poor fellow how absurdly he talks so engrossed was he in his ministrations that he failed to perceive the door behind him softly open and a gentleman enter mr armstrong had outstripped the doctor in the race to town without a word the tutor walked to the bed and bent over the troubled form of his pupil then with face almost as white as that of his enemy he turned what brings you here gasped the captain how long has he been like this demanded the tutor do you hear my question do you hear mine the weaker man capitulated with a malediction to the stronger since yesterday he is being carefully tended by whom you alone by a doctor what doctor when i know your right to catechise me i will answer snarled the captain mr armstrong rang the bell light the fire here at once said he to the maid and then send the messenger up in the interval the two men stood eyeing one another while the patient from time to time tossed on his pillow and muttered to himself mr armstrong hurriedly scrawled two notes take a cab and leave this note at hospital let the nurse i have asked for come back in the cab at once then go on with this note to sir william dove and bring word from him the earliest moment he can be here don't lose an instant captain oliphant said he as soon as the messenger had gone three is too many for this room i am here to relieve guard you need rest dr brandram will be here any moment bring him up directly he comes captain oliphant was certainly deserving of a little sympathy he had borne the burden and heat of the day and now another was entering into his labour but the tutor's tone had an ugly ring about it which for the moment cowed the injured gentleman and constrained him after glowering for a moment or two and trying to articulate a protest meekly to withdraw my responsibility ends where yours begins said he with his best sneer i grudge none of the trouble i have taken for the dear boy but i must decline to remain here as the assistant of signor francisco the music hall cad i can imagine it might be painful said mr armstrong drily but the immediate thing to be desired is that you should not consume the oxygen in this room explanations will do later captain oliphant was not at hand that evening to meet the doctors a business engagement had summoned him to maxfield where he rejoiced the hearts of his two children by a sudden arrival at breakfast time a curt note from armstrong the same afternoon apprised him that his movements had been anticipated doctors not without hope admirable nurse secured brandram and i remain here captain oliphant derived scant consolation from this announcement and quite forgot his business engagement in his mortification and ill temper he dropped in during the day to see mr pottinger to discuss his grievance with that legal luminary but mr pottinger as the reader is aware had complications of another kind to disclose he astonished his visitor with an account of the surprise visit of mr ratman a few days previously and of that gentleman's astounding claims to the name of ingleton what exclaimed the captain you mean to say that scoundrel actually claimed to be the lost son i always had a high opinion of his impudence but i never imagined it capable of that why my dear sir i have known him as a pettifogging money lender in india for years quite so but did you know why and when he came to india i can't say i did surely you don't credit his story well not exactly but it strikes me the gentleman will give us some difficulty why what good can it do him even if he is what he claims he cannot upset the will which emphatically cuts him out of every possibility of benefit no that leaves him no loophole certainly but he may calculate on working on the chivalry of his younger brother or if that fails on blackmailing him if so he will have us to deal with for once in a way armstrong and i are likely to be of the same opinion surely there is evidence enough to prosecute for conspiracy hardly he claims nothing but the name he admits he has no rights my opinion captain oliphant is that we have not heard the end of him very likely not especially as i unluckily owe him money that is awkward the sooner you square accounts and get rid of him the better easier said than done remarked the captain and returned with a decided headache to maxfield roger with armstrong to nurse him with dr brandram to attend him with his own strong bias towards life to buoy him up emerged slowly from the valley of the shadow of death and in due time stood once more on his feet weeks before that happened he had told and heard all that was to be said about his lost brother dr brandram had recounted the incident at miss jill's party and he in turn had confided to his tutor his meeting with fastnet and the feeble clue in which that conference had resulted armstrong old fellow said he one day at the close of the year won't you help me in this i know you hate the business and think me a fool for my pains i must do it with you or without you and would sooner do it with you in ten months it will be too late i hate the business as you say but you may count on me only don't ask me to hail mr ratman as squire of maxfield or subscribe a penny to his maintenance a day before his claim is proved you are a brick i was a cad ever to doubt it let us start next week for boulogne quite so said the tutor screwing his glass viciously into his eye let us go to boulogne by all means chapter twenty the ghost of hamlet it is possible to conceive of a more hopeful task than hunting up and down a large french town for tidings of a strolling player who for one night only played the ghost in hamlet twenty years ago but roger as early in the year he stepped ashore at boulogne with armstrong at his side felt sanguine and of good cheer his recovery had been slow and not without interruption as soon as he could be moved he had returned to maxfield only to find rosalind still away and his guardian obdurate to any suggestion for expediting her return as to the proposed journey to boulogne the gallant captain looked upon that as a symptom of serious mental exhaustion on the part of the invalid roger however was in a mood impervious to argument when the time actually came the captain surprised every one by giving in more readily than any one had expected the truth was mr ratman though lost to sight contrived to make himself very dear to his debtor's memory and already a legal document had reached maxfield demanding the payment in full of a certain bill within a certain date on pain of certain consequences and captain oliphant felt it would be distinctly convenient for a while to be relieved of the presence both of his co trustee and his ward he felt himself quite competent to deal with the trust moneys which were shortly about to come in without assistance when therefore roger with some hesitation returned to the charge he said somewhat severely you are old enough to decide for yourself my boy you know my view of the matter i conclude you are not going alone no armstrong is coming naturally i wish you joy on your return i shall be happy to resume my responsibility for your welfare i cannot profess to feel oppressed by it in your absence this was enough true the captain contrived to get in a parting shot by announcing that rosalind was likely to return shortly to maxfield but even that did not suffice to change the lad's purpose don't be very long away said jill to mr armstrong you are always going and leaving us rosalind will be very very sorry to find you are away she likes you she told me so but she doesn't like you half as much as i do the tutor flushed uncomfortably oh said tom you're always spoons on somebody jill i heard you tell that duke chap you liked him better than anybody in the world o tom how dare you tell such a wicked falsehood i told him i liked him nearly as much as mr armstrong but not quite really i did mr armstrong i am very jealous of the duke said mr armstrong gravely once across the channel roger's spirits rose he had a presentiment he was on the right track like a knight of old set down to a desperate task the fighting blood rose joyously within him whatever it cost whoever deserted him whoever opposed him he would find his brother and give to him his own for days they went hither and thither inquiring at cafes theatres cabarets custom houses police stations and even cemeteries without success most of the persons accosted laughed and shrugged their shoulders to be asked if they remembered the visit of strolling players to the town as far back as twenty years others bridled up suspiciously as if the question were a preliminary to their detection in some old evil deed others utterly failed to comprehend the question and a few pityingly tapped their own foreheads and shook their heads at the two half witted english holiday makers but no one could tell a word about rogers a fortnight passed and the thoughts of both dispirited and worn turned homeward rosalind a letter had informed them was back at maxfield of the two perhaps mr armstrong displayed less disposition to own himself beaten he had worked like a horse all the time roger had been compelled to own that without him his mission would have been a feeble farce not a stone did the dogged tutor leave unturned not a difficulty did he shirk not a man or woman however forbidding did he hesitate to tackle who in the remotest degree might be suspected of being likely to give information now that it came to giving in he hung back reluctant to dip his colours to day's thursday said he let's give ourselves till saturday if nothing turns up by then i am your man to slink home roger a little ashamed to find the first last and the last first in the race after all readily assented and the two worked unflagging for two days longer friday evening came and the two sat dismally down to table d'hote with defeat staring them in the face they said very little but each knew the mortification in the other's breast at last when the meal was over mr armstrong said i suppose we had better go and get our tickets i suppose so but the bureau was closed for the night and the two took a solitary walk along the beach they walked on further than usual in the clear moonlight till at last the tutor looked at his watch it's nine o'clock said he we must go back let's take the country road back it is a mile longer never mind it is our last night so they struck up by the cliffs and followed the chalky country road back to boulogne about two miles from the town the cheery lights of a wayside auberge attracted their attention let us get some coffee here said armstrong this solitary tavern rejoiced in the name of cafe d'angleterre but if its owner expected thereby to attract the custom of mr john bull he was singularly mistaken the chief customers of the place were labourers and navvies who by their noisy jargon were evidently innocent of all pretensions to a foreign tongue seeing two strangers presumably able to pay ready money for what they consumed the old landlord invited his visitors into the bar parlour where at his own table he set before them that delightful concoction of chicory and sifted earth which certain provincial frenchmen call cafe and being a gregarious and inquisitive old man and withal proud of his tolerable stock of english he took the liberty of joining them inglese inquired he with a pantomimic shrug quite so said the tutor putting up his glass and inspecting the fellow carefully this is the cafe d'angleterre' said the landlord but helas it is long since the inglese gentleman come here they like too well the great town ah boulogne has grown can you remember the place twenty years ago can i i can remember forty years i wonder broke in roger too impatient to allow his tutor to lead up gradually to the inevitable question if you can remember some english players coming over here about eighteen years ago and acting a play called hamlet in english the landlord blew a cloud of smoke from his lips and stared round at the speaker as if he had been a ghost why do you ask me that 'amlet can i forget it here was a bolt out of the blue the tutor's eye glass dropped with a clatter against his cup and roger fetched a breath half gasp half sigh you remember it exclaimed he seizing the man's hand do you know we have been a fortnight in boulogne trying to find some one who did would not you remember it replied the frenchman with a gesticulation if 'amlet had put up at your inn and gone away without paying his bill did one of the actors stay here then one there was twenty 'amlets and miladi 'amlets and mademoiselle 'amlets they all stay here en famille the house is full of 'amlets the stable is full they bring with them a castle of 'amlet and a grave of 'amlet my poor house was all 'amlet and inquired mr armstrong flushed with the sudden discovery but as cool as ever you had a pass to see the play of course mon dieu it was all the pay i got 'amlet come to my house with his twenty hungry mouth and eat me up flesh and bone he sleep in my beds he sleep on my roof he sleep in my stable the place is 'amlet's and all my pay is one piece of card bidding me see him play himself and was it well played asked mr armstrong well played how do i know but six persons came to see it i one and in six minutes it is all done your english 'amlet will not play to the empty bench he call down the curtain and bid us go where we please not even will he pay us back our money then when he come to leave the hall himself voila he has no money to pay his rent his baggage is seized and 'amlet fights mon dieu there was une emeute in boulogne that night and before day 'amlet has vanish like his own ghost and i am a robbed man voila very rough on you said the tutor so there was a ghost among the players why no it would not be 'amlet without did the ghost stay here too helas yes he eat and drink and sleep and forgets to pay like the rest what did you lose by him asked roger with parched lips ah monsieur i was a napoleon poorer for every 'amlet in my house that night roger put down two sovereigns on the table that is to pay for the ghost said he flushing he was my brother the landlord stared in blank amazement your brother monsieur le ghost of 'amlet was pardieu exclaimed he looking hard at his guest and he was like you it was no fault of his 'amlet did not take the favour for he play in the first act and make us all laugh if the other 'amlets had been so amusing as him the house would have been full packed ha now you say it he was a gentleman this poor monsieur le ghost he held himself apart from the noisy company and sulk in a corner while they laugh and drink and sing the song they were afraid of him and mon dieu they might be for once when monsieur rosencrantz as i remember came and threw some absinthe my absinthe messieurs in his face monsieur le ghost he knocked him down with a blow that sounded oh like a clap of the thunder and this pauvre ghost added the man was monsieur's brother helas he was come down very poor his coat was rags and his boots were open to the water of heaven he eat little ah monsieur i have deceived you he cost me not five franc for when i remember he ate nothings he starve himself was he ill asked armstrong worse said the landlord lowering his voice he was in love i could see it she laugh and make the mock at him and play coquet with the others before his face it nearly killed him this pauvre ghost he would have give his hand for a kind glance but he got it never who was the girl asked roger but a child the minx fifteen perhaps sixteen years no more she played the part of a page boy and only so because monsieur her father was manage the play he was frenchman this monsieur but mademoiselle was english like her mother helas monsieur your brother was deep in love but there was no hope for him a fool could see that this was all the host could tell them he had never heard since of any member of the ill fated company he could introduce them to no one who remembered their visit a few there might be who when appealed to might have recalled the disturbance on the night of the performance and the absconding of the players but who they were and what became of them no one could say on their return to the hotel at boulogne at midnight they found a telegram and a letter awaiting them the former was from dr brandram to mr armstrong come at once the letter was a missive addressed to roger at maxfield from london and forwarded back to boulogne it was from mr fastnet dear ingleton oddly enough i stumbled yesterday across the very piece of paper i spoke to you of here it is for what it was worth roger eagerly opened the yellow sheet it announced a performance of hamlet at folkestone by a celebrated company of stars under the direction of a monsieur callot among the actors was a mr john rogers who took the part of the ghost in the first act further down was mentioned a miss callot who acted the part of a page and the bill announced that after the performance in folkestone the company would perform for two nights only in boulogne more important however than any other particular was a footnote that monsieur callot was happy to receive pupils for instruction in the dramatic art at his address long street london w terms moderate singing and dancing taught by madame callot here at last seemed a clue the pulses of the two friends quickened as they read and re read the time worn document the boat sails in two hours said mr armstrong i must leave you in town brandram would not telegraph for me like this unless he meant it i suppose it means my bro ratman has turned up again if so armstrong well inquired the tutor digging his glass deep into his eye roger said nothing on the following afternoon mr armstrong had a pleasant game of association football with tom on the maxfield lawn and miss jill who volunteered as umpire gave every point in favour of the tutor just about the time when he kicked his final goal roger ingleton minor in london arrived at the dreary conclusion after an hour's painful study of directories and maps that there was no such street as long street london w chapter twenty one sharks by land and water mr brandram's abrupt summons to mr armstrong was not due to the reappearance on the scene of the mysterious robert ratman it was in fact at the instance of miss rosalind oliphant that the doctor sent his message that young lady had returned a week ago to find everything at maxfield awry her father was gloomy mysterious and haggard the rumour of mr ratman's extraordinary claims had become the common property of the village roger and his tutor were away no one exactly knew where or on what errand on the day following her return she walked across from the vicarage to visit her father he sat in the library abstracted pale and limp the jaunty anglo indian veneer had for the time being dropped off unmasking the worried exterior of a chicken hearted man at the sight of his daughter he pulled himself together and crushed in his hand the letter which he had been reading why my child said he with unusual cordiality this is a pleasant apparition cruel girl to desert us for so long we have hardly existed without you roger and his tutor are away in france holiday making while i remain here on duty with no one to cheer me up dear father said rosalind kissing him how worried you look what is the matter won't you tell me the father's eyes dwelt for a moment on her fair earnest face so like her mother's so unlike a daughter of his then they fell miserably worried said he do i show it as plainly as all that i flattered myself i kept it to myself any one can see you are unhappy father why i am in difficulties my child which you could not understand i could do tell me the fact is said the captain taking up his pen and dotting the blotting pad as he spoke that when on former occasions i have tried to claim your sympathy i well i was not quite successful i do not want the pain of a similar failure again i would do anything anything to help you if i could he took her hand and held it in his i am in great straits said he an old indian debt has followed me here i cannot meet it and ruin stares me in the face you know i am a poor man that i am living on other people you have reminded me of that often enough that of all the money which passes my hands scarcely enough to live on belongs by right to me you know all that yes i know that we are poor how much do you owe she asked i cannot say not long ago it was some hundreds but by this time it is nearer thousands nothing grows so rapidly as a debt my child even added he with an unctuous drop of his voice a debt of honour and will not your creditor wait my creditor has waited but refuses to do so any longer in a month from now my child your father and those he loves best will be paupers is there no way of meeting it none whatever i cannot pay i shrink from borrowing the trust funds in my charge are sacred of course said she astonished that he should name them in such a connection is there nothing else my creditor is robert ratman or as he calls himself and possibly is roger ingleton as you know he claims to be the elder brother of our roger and i yes yes said she roger told me about that he is your creditor he is i got into his clutches in india little guessing who he was and he is crushing me now there is but one way and one only of escaping him and that way is i fear impossible rosalind what is it said she with pale face knowing what was to come he loves you as my son in law he would be no longer my creditor she drew away her hand with a shudder father said she in a dry hard voice which startled him do you really mean this is it a time for jesting said he i ask nothing of you i merely state facts you dislike him there is an end of it only remember we are not now dealing with robert ratman but with an injured man who has not had a fair chance the good in him continued the father deluded by the passive look on his daughter's face and becoming suddenly warm in his championship of the absent creditor has been smothered but for aught we know it may still be there a wife she stopped him with a peremptory motion of her hand please do not say anything more your debt when does it fall due in a week or ten days my child consider she interrupted again no more please she said almost imploringly i will think what can be done to help you in a week good bye dear father she stooped with face as white as marble and touched his forehead with her cold lips loyal girl said the father when the door had closed behind her she will stand by me yet after all ratman has his good points clever cheerful good man of business here abruptly the soliloquy ended and captain oliphant buried his face in his hands a miserable man to rosalind as she walked rapidly across the park there came but one thought her father how could she help him how could she save him not so much from his debts as from the depths into which they were plunging him my poor father said she only a man in desperate plight could think of such a remedy he never meant it he does not really suppose no no he said he did not ask anything he told me because i asked poor darling father and with something very like a sob she hurried on to yeld she went straight to dr brandram's well my dear young lady it does one good to see you back said he but bless me how pale you look do i i'm quite well thank you dr brandram said she do you know anything about this mr ratman the doctor stared at this abrupt inquiry nothing more than you and every one else does that he is a rank impostor i don't mean that i mean where is he i want to see him very much you want to see him he has vanished and left no track is it nothing i can help you in no said she looking very miserable i hoped you could have told me where to find him good bye and thank you she departed leaving the doctor sorely disturbed and bewildered he stood watching her slight figure till it disappeared in the vicarage garden and then shrugging his shoulders said something wrong somewhere evidently not a case for me to be trusted with it's about time armstrong came home whereupon he walked over to the post office and dispatched the telegram which as the reader knows procured tom oliphant the unspeakable pleasure of a game of football on the following afternoon well said the tutor to his friend in the doctor's parlour that evening what's all this about that's what i'm not likely to know myself said the doctor and he narrated the circumstances of miss oliphant's mysterious call humph said the tutor she wants to see him in his capacity of robert ratman evidently and not of roger ingleton major so it seemed to me and you say she had just come from visiting her father at maxfield yes on the principle that two and two make four i suppose we may conclude that my co trustee is on toast at present said the tutor and further that that co trustee being somebody's father you are the man to get him off it the tutor's face clouded and his glass dropped with a twang from his eye don't make that mistake again brandram unless and here his lips relaxed into a quiet smile you mean by somebody miss jill dr brandram read a good deal in this short sentence and like a good friend let the subject drop as tom has gone to the rectory to dinner said the tutor i take it the neighbourhood for twenty miles round will know of my return by this time meanwhile i must go back and possibly find out some thing from oliphant himself captain oliphant however was in no mood for confidences the sudden return of his co trustee was extremely unwelcome at this juncture indeed so manifestly unwelcome that mr armstrong was convinced he had come back not a day too soon the captain professed great annoyance and indignation at what he termed the desertion of his ward and demanded to know when the tutor proposed to return to his duties in fact sir said he i desire to know what brings you here in this uncalled for manner business my dear sir replied the tutor it need not incommode you your proper place is with your pupil where have you left him in london prosecuting a search which neither you nor i consider to be very hopeful i should not be surprised to see him back any day and may i ask the nature of the very pressing business which forms the pretext of this abrupt return am i to understand you and my ward have quarrelled no sir we are excellent friends it's getting late i'll say good night by the way said he at the door while i am here there are a few small matters connected with the accounts which seemed to my unpractised eye when i went through pottinger's books to require some little elucidation if you have an hour or so to spare to morrow i should like to go through them with you good night he did not stay to notice the sudden pallor of his colleague's face nor did he overhear the gasp which greeted the closing of the door the captain did not go to bed that night for an hour he sat motionless in his chair staring blankly into the fire then with a sudden access of industry he went to the safe and producing account books bank books cheques and other documents spent some troubled hours over their contents that done for another hour he paced the floor dismally smoking a cigar finally when the early march dawn filtered through the blinds he quitted the house and surprised mr pottinger by an unexpected visit at breakfast time thence he proceeded to the bank and after transacting his business there returned easier in mind but exhausted in body to the seclusion of his room at maxfield the tutor meanwhile was abroad on horseback with tom and jill the three took a scamper over the downs and returned by way of the shore biding with tom and jill as may be imagined was a series of competitive exercises rather than a straightforward promenade tom was an excellent rough horseman and jill when mr armstrong was at hand was not the young lady to stick at anything they had tried handicaps water jumps hurdles and were about to start for a ding dong gallop along the mile of hard strand which divided them from maxfield when the tutor's eye detected perched a little way up the cliff the figure of a young lady sketching i'll start you two said he i scratch for this race ride fair tom and jill give the mare her head when you get past the boulders i shall go back by the downs are you ready now pull in a bit tom now off you go not waiting to watch the issue of this momentous contest he turned to where rosalind sat and reining up at the foot of her perch dismounted she came down to meet him palette in hand mr armstrong i am so glad to see you i want to speak to you dreadfully are you in a great hurry not at all brandram told me you were in trouble and i was wondering when and where i should have the opportunity of asking how i can help you he tied his horse to a stake and helped her back to her seat on the cliff there was an awkward pause which he occupied by examining her picture with a critical air do you like it said she i don't know i'm no great judge do you i did before you came i'm not so sure now do sit down and let me say what i want to say the tutor with a flutter at his breast sat meekly keeping his eyes still on the picture mr armstrong it's about mr ratman so brandram said what of him rosalind told her father's story except that she omitted any reference to the desperate proposition for satisfying his claims i am sure it is a fraud or blackmail or something of the sort for all that he threatens to ruin father what does the debt amount to father spoke of thousands does the creditor offer no terms rosalind flushed and looked round none that is none that can be thought of for a moment i understand said the tutor to whom the reservation was explicit enough the difficulty is that he has disappeared if we could find him i would you would allow me to go to him said the tutor no doubt the opportunity will soon come he wants money he is bound to turn up but why should you be mixed up in father's troubles asked rosalind after a pause your father's troubles are yours your troubles are shall we say roger's roger's troubles are mine there was another long silence during which rosalind took up her brushes and began work again on the picture mr armstrong critically looking on have you no troubles of your own then that you have so much room in you for those of other people she said at last i have had my share perhaps your picture with its wide expanse of calm sea was just reminding me of one of them tell me about it it was years ago when before i was a singer in london you knew i followed that honourable vocation once don't you i have heard father speak of it why not no reason at all but before that i worked at the equally honourable profession of a common sailor on a ship between new york and ceylon at that time i was about as wild and reckless as they make them and deluded myself into the foolish belief that i enjoyed it how i had come to that pass i needn't tell you it wasn't all of a sudden or without the assistance of other people i had a comrade on board a man who had once been a gentleman but had come down in the world who was nearly as bad as i but not quite for he sometimes talked of his home and his mother and wished himself dead which i never had the grace to do are you making this all up for my benefit asked rosalind or is it true the story would not be worth telling if it were not true said mr armstrong screwing his glass into his eye and taking a fresh survey of the picture one very hot summer we were becalmed off colombo and lay for days with nothing to do but whistle for a wind and quarrel among ourselves my mate and i kept the peace for a couple of days but then we fell out like the rest i forget what it was about a trifle probably a word we didn't fight on deck it was too hot but jumped overboard and fought in the water i remember as i plunged i caught sight a hundred yards away of an ugly grey fin lying motionless on the water and knew it belonged to a shark but i didn't care well we two fought in the water partly in spite partly to pass the time suddenly i could see my opponent's swarthy face become livid good god' he gasped a shark' and quick as thought he caught me by the shoulders and pushed me between him and the brute i heard it swish up and saw it half turn with gaping jaws in that moment i lived over my life again with all its folly and crime and for the first time for years i prayed how it happened i cannot tell the shark must either have made a bad shot at me or else i must have ducked instinctively for i remember feeling the scrape of his fin across my cheek and being pushed aside by his great tail next moment my mate's hands let go their grip of me and there was a yell such as i pray i may never hear again when at last they hauled me on board i was not the same man who three minutes before had dived into the water that was the scene your picture reminded me of miss oliphant you have told me one of your troubles and i have told you one of mine which makes us quits but my horse is getting fidgety down there i must look after him good bye mr armstrong was a little surprised when he came to go through the accounts with his co trustee that afternoon to find that he must have been mistaken in his previous supposition that they were not all correct and straightforward everything appeared quite plain and properly accounted for and he agreed with the figures rather abashed to feel that after all he was not as acute a man of business as he had flattered himself mr pottinger and the captain rallied him about his deserted mares' nest and bored him with invitations to go through all the items again to give him a chance of proving them wrong he declined with thanks and signed the balance with the best grace he could summon odd said he to himself as he strode home after the interview either you must be very clever or i must be very stupid i should greatly like to know which it is chapter twenty two mr ratman visits his property dear armstrong wrote roger from london about a week after the tutor's return to maxfield you will be surprised to hear i am just off to paris to look for a mr pantalzar this is how it comes about long street does not exist as i told you nor any trace of the family callot but old directories are still available and in one of these i found that fifteen years ago there was a long street and that number was then occupied by a person of the uncommon name i have mentioned the name seemed too promising a one to be let drop so i tracked it down to the year before last when i found a pantalzar was proprietor of a cook shop in shoreditch of course when i went to inquire my gentleman had vanished i'm sick of asking the interminable question does so and so live here' the present cook man however remembered the queer name as that belonging to his predecessor and informed me that not having made the business pay over here he had decamped two years ago without saying good bye to his creditors and announced his intention of starting a cafe in paris this then is my off chance unless he has changed his name i should be able to discover him in paris and if he turns out to be the man who once lived at number long street he may be able to tell me something about the callots and the callots if by a miracle i can find them may be able to tell me something about rogers the ghost in hamlet i only wish you were coming to back me up but from what you say i would ever so much rather you remained on the spot at maxfield i hope it will be possible to help oliphant out of his fix try you'd better write to the poste restante at paris remember me at home yours ever r ingleton the tutor read this letter with a somewhat troubled countenance it proved to him that his ward was desperately in earnest in his uphill quest and it filled him with some concern to feel that he himself was not where he should have liked to be at the boy's side but to leave maxfield at present seemed impossible rosalind claimed his help on behalf of her father and the possibility that any day mr ratman might turn up and court exposure decided the tutor to remain where he was another motive for this step was a haunting perplexity as to the hallucination under which he had apparently laboured with regard to the estate accounts he never flattered himself he was a particularly good man of business but it puzzled him to explain why a few weeks ago there should have appeared to be discrepancies and irregularities to the tune of several hundred pounds whereas now everything was in startling apple pie order much to mr pottinger's annoyance he took to visiting the honest lawyer's office every other day and spent hours in trying to discover where it was he had made his great mistake mr pottinger was unable to render him any assistance and the captain when once he referred to the subject only smiled pityingly and advised him to take a few lessons in the elements of finance which advice to do him justice the tutor humbly proceeded to take the result was to deepen his perplexity and cause him to regret that he had so compliantly countersigned an account which every time he studied it in the light of his new wisdom appeared to bristle with problems faithful to her promise at the end of a week rosalind presented herself at maxfield well my child said the parent blandly laying down his newspaper i said i would come and speak again about what you were saying the other day have you heard any more from your creditor things remain as far as he is concerned in statu quo and i am no nearer being able to satisfy him to day than i was a week ago unless indeed all i have to say said rosalind nervously is that i would work like a slave to help you if i could is that all asked the captain with falling face you know it is father you knew it a week ago you knew i would even go to this man and on my knees beg him to be merciful her father laughed dismally in other words said he you can do nothing i do not complain i expected nothing and i have not been disappointed i was foolish to think such a thing possible heaven knows i have been punished for my folly she tried hard to keep back the tears and rose to go stay said he sternly i have a question to ask you a week ago you seemed to hold a different mind to this what has changed it no said she it was out of the question you said so yourself i ask you repeated he sternly and not heeding her protest what has changed it have you taken counsel with any one on the subject have you spoken to any one of this wretched business yes i have spoken to mr armstrong exactly i thought as much i understand leave me rosalind father you are wrong oh but you must hear me she said as he raised his hand deprecatingly and took up his newspaper you must not misunderstand i told mr armstrong of your difficulties and who your creditor was i told him no more my only object was to see if there was any way to help you you mean to tell me said he interrupting in an angry voice that you considered it consistent with your duty as a daughter to gossip about my private affairs with a scoundrel who no father she said mr armstrong is a gentleman naturally you say so but enough of this i forbid you as i have already done to hold any communication with mr armstrong know that of the two men the man you affect to scorn is infinitely less a villain than this smug hypocrite go she made no reply but went choking with misery and a smarting sense of injustice no longer was it easy to hug herself into the delusion that this was all a horrid dream her father stood on the brink of ruin and she could not help him if only said she it had been anything else o god pity my poor father the captain's thoughts were of a very different kind he had clung to the hope that rosalind would after all solve his difficulties by undertaking the venture he had set before her he had already in imagination soothed his own conscience and smoothed away all the difficulties which beset the undertaking it might be for her good after all dear girl she will reclaim him a fortune lies before them for roger will be easily convinced and will surrender his claim to them ratman is too long sighted not to see that i can help him in the matter and that on my own terms we shall start fresh with a clear balance sheet and live in comfort now however these bright hopes were dashed and to the captain's mind he owed his failure first and last to mr frank armstrong had he not come home he said to himself rosalind would have yielded with him still at maxfield everything came to a dead lock ratman could not be propitiated still less satisfied the accounts would be restlessly scrutinised rosalind and in less degree tom and jill would be mutinous roger at home or abroad would be beyond reach all the grudges of the past months seemed to culminate in this crowning injury and if to wish ill to one's fellow is to be a murderer captain oliphant had already come perilously near to adding one new sin to his record but where all this while was the ingenuous mr ratman why had he not true to his word come to claim his own if not the maxfield estate at any rate the little balance due to him from his old indian crony the captain after a week or two of disappointed dread was beginning to recover a little of his ease of mind and flattering himself that after all his creditor's bark was worse than his bite when the blow abruptly fell mr armstrong had gone for the day to visit one of his very few old college friends on the other side of the county and tom released from his lessons the captain's animosity for the tutor by the way stopped short at withdrawing his son from the benefit of the gratuitous education of which for the last year that youth had been the recipient was trundling a boneshaker bicycle along the yeld lanes when he perceived the jaunty form of mr ratman bag in hand and cigar in mouth strolling leisurely in the direction of maxfield tom who was only a beginner in the art of cycling was so taken aback by this apparition that after one or two furious lurches from one side of the road to the other and a frantic effort to keep his balance he came ignominiously to the ground at the very feet of the visitor hullo said that worthy as full of fun as ever i see hullo ratty said tom picking himself up got over your kicking this genial reference to the circumstances under which the so called lost heir had last quitted maxfield grated somewhat harshly on the feelings of the gentleman to whom it was addressed look here young fellow said he you'd better keep a civil tongue in your head or i shall have to pull your ear try it retorted tom mr ratman seemed inclined to accept the invitation but as he was anxious for information just now he decided to forego the experiment is your father at home he demanded rather you'd better go back the way you came we know all about you up there said tom that's all right and how are your pretty sisters tommy if any insult more than another could disturb the temper of master oliphant it was to be called tommy as many of the rustic youths of the neighbourhood knew to their cost he therefore replied shortly find out and proceeded to address himself to the task of remounting his machine that's what i'm going to do here let me hold it for you or you'll break your neck look here said the outraged tom thoroughly roused by this crowning indignity i don't want to be seen out here talking to cads i don't mind fighting you if you don't care for that keep your cheek to yourself and go and talk to somebody who's fond of rot i'm not and the young bruiser who had an uncommonly broad pair of shoulders looked so threatening that mr ratman began to feel a little concerned ha ha said he how well you do it i always liked you tommy my boy i'll let your tutor know what a credit you are to him i wish to goodness armstrong was at home growled tom he'd make you sit up this was just the information mr ratman had been anxious to get the prospect of encountering mr armstrong had interfered considerably with his pleasure in arranging this visit but if he was out of the way well so much more the luck of mr ratman therefore without wasting time in further parley with this possible brother in law he proceeded jauntily on his way you won't fight then said tom by way of farewell some day all right coward good bye mr roger ingleton major having relieved himself of which appropriate sentiment tom felt decidedly better and walked his bicycle down the hill determined to keep clear of maxfield till the evening mr ratman somewhat ruffled but on the whole cheerful swaggered on to his destination the captain was luxuriously smoking a cigar and solacing himself with a sporting paper when raffles sent his heart to his mouth by announcing mr ingleton sir to see you ah ratman said he with a forced air of welcome as his creditor entered i didn't recognise you by your new name you're keeping it up then what do you mean demanded mr ratman taking an easy chair and helping himself to a cigar from the captain's box it's you who are keeping it up i fancy i'll trouble you to drop the ratman the captain laughed unpleasantly as you like said he now to business of course you're ready to make good these little bills and he pulled four or five blue slips from his pocket no i'm not you may as well know it at once hum what do you propose then do you know there's a writ out i propose nothing i want to know what you propose the two men regarded one another in silence one insolent and sneering the other desperate and scowling what do i propose said ratman puffing away cheerfully scarcely anything only to make a little communication to the war office give a few instructions to the sheriff write a paragraph or two to the county papers and tell a few interesting anecdotes to your charming daughters captain oliphant started to his feet with a smothered exclamation not the last ratman i'm in your clutches but for heaven's sake don't bring them into it ratman laughed you will insist on forgetting my name my dear fellow yes that's my little programme i fancy i may as well begin at the end look here pleaded the victim i know it's no use appealing to your pity for you have none or your honesty for you've less of that than i have but doesn't it occur to you that it would be decidedly against your interest to ruin me just now what do you mean said ratman with a yawn why you claim a certain name and you have to prove your claim roger has got the romantic notion into his head that if his elder brother can be found that brother shall have the property he is more than half inclined to credit your story already you have to satisfy two other persons of whom i am one do you understand perfectly said mr ratman who began to be interested i anticipate no difficulty there you forget that at present only a sickly boy stands between myself and the property it would surely mean something on my part for me to admit a second life between what is the use of talking nonsense said ratman even if you did for the sake of a little longer credit i might give you own my right to my own name what's the use of that when this man armstrong has to be satisfied too if you could crack that nut there might be something in it the captain groaned he knew that every project would be pulled up short at this sticking point come said ratman encouragingly if you could work things in that direction it might be worth my while to give you time i can do nothing the fellow is immovable in six months in six months everything will be too late and now what about the other matter is that all right once more the captain groaned i can say nothing about it yet she knows my wishes but as robert ratman she will not hear a word of it as roger ingleton the elder you may depend on it the matter will take another view all depends on your success there when that's achieved the rest will come if you give her time mr ratman sneered you are a glib talker oliphant i admire you now listen you want credit and you know how to buy it one way or another this business must come to an end i'll take new bills with interest at three months by that time everything must be square and smooth otherwise you'll be sorry you and your children were born my boy order dinner i'm going back by the six train pass me that paper and don't disturb me any more by your talking as mr ratman very well satisfied with his day's business strolled serenely back through the park that afternoon he was surprised to hear light footsteps behind him and on turning to discover that his pursuer of all people was miss rosalind oliphant hullo said he this is flattering with a vengeance mr ratman i want to speak to you please said rosalind very pale and nervous excuse me said he that's not my name my name is roger ingleton what's the matter it's about my father have you seen him just left the dear man he says he owes you money and that you threaten to ruin him is that so upon my word if you want to know it is how much is it please ratman laughed nothing a trifle fifteen hundred pounds or thereabouts fifteen hundred faltered she does he owe you all that the little she had to offer was a drop in the bucket only look here said he miss rosy your father's in a fix i don't want to be hard on him but i must have my money or its equivalent now i should consider it a very fair equivalent to be allowed to call him father in law i may not be up to your mark in some things miss rosalind but i've a good name and i flatter myself i know beauty when i see it now think over it it's the only chance your father's got and you might do worse for yourself than become the mistress of maxfield good bye shake hands she drew herself up with an air and a flush of colour which redoubled his admiration and without a word turned away with rapid steps mr ratman was sorely tempted to follow this beautiful creature who in all his chequered career had been the only human being to discover the few last dregs of affection in his nature as much as it was possible in such a man he was in love with this debtor's daughter the sensation was novel and exhilarating enough to afford him food for cheerful reflection as he walked on towards the station so engrossed was he in his day dreams that he forgot that even country trains are occasionally punctual and that at least he had not much time left him to catch the one he aimed at indeed it was not till within a few minutes of the station he caught sight of the train already standing at the platform that it occurred to him to bestir himself he ran shouted and waved his arm all at the same time but to no effect the whistle blew as he entered the yard and as he reached the platform the guard's van was gliding out of the station thoroughly ruffled for this was the last train to town mr ratman vented his wrath on the world in general and the railway officials in particular even including in his objurgations an unlucky passenger who had arrived by the train and shared with him the uninterrupted possession of the platform easy young man said the latter a substantial looking bony individual with a wrinkled face and speaking with a decided american twang you'll hurt yourself i reckon if you talk like that it's bad for the jaws mr ratman took a contemptuous survey of the stranger and quitted the platform his first idea was to return to maxfield and demand entertainment there for the night but since he would have to walk all the way and the first train in the morning left yeld at eight he decided to put up at the little hotel of the village instead and with that object threw himself and his bag into the omnibus of that establishment which waited on the trains somewhat to his disgust the stranger after collecting his baggage entered the same vehicle and took a seat opposite him wal said he you'll have time to cool down before the next train young man putting up at the hotel where else should i put up growled ratman what business is it of yours i guess it's my business to get all the information i can on this trip i came over this side to learn you've come to a queer hole to do it said ratman beginning to feel he might as well resign himself to circumstances just so it's changed a bit since i was here last we had to drive from barbeck then so you know the place do you inquired ratman that's so was the laconic rejoinder a resident likely well not at present or i shouldn't be going to the inn down here on business i reckon i was a bagman myself once you're wrong again i've been down to see my property if you want to know large estate no doubt anywhere near my friend ingleton's plot now mr ratman stared at the stranger with something like consternation ingleton he exclaimed what do you know of ingleton here the omnibus pulled up wal i reckon i should know something of my own family drawled the stranger as he alighted what say shall we have a snack of something in the parlour come along the landlord led the way into the coffee room he knew mr ratman by this time sorry we can't give you and your friend the private room sir but there's only one other gentleman in the coffee room and he's going directly as they entered the other gentleman who was drying his boots at the fire turned round and mr ratman had the rapture of finding himself face to face with mr armstrong chapter twenty three captain oliphant pays one of his debts mr ratman's natural modesty prompted a precipitate retreat from the embarrassing vicinity of the gentleman whom he had last seen with a horsewhip in his hand but prudence and the presence of the stranger and the lack of any other place to go to prevailed upon him to remain the stranger apparently unaware of the presence of a third party continued his conversation where it had been interrupted yes said he i reckon i should know something of my own family although it's a generation since i set foot in these parts yes all right said ratman uncomfortably i'll go and order dinner but the entrance of the landlord prevented this manoeuvre the gig from maxfield is in the village mr armstrong said he addressing the tutor i've sent word to robbins to call for you in half an hour maybe if mr ratman is going up you could give him a lift mr ratman is not going up said mr armstrong the stranger here took notice of the tutor friend of my friend eh said he pleased to know you sir resident in these parts i presume what quite so said mr armstrong putting up his glass and honouring the speaker with a minute survey as i was saying to our young friend here there's been changes in this locality since i was here about the time of noah you named maxfield just now sir likely you know squire ingleton my relative at the manor house there the tutor's glass dropped abruptly your relative what relation were you to the old squire was i is he dead then more than a year ago sir said the stranger with some excitement that man was my sister's husband i guess i've come here a trifle late dead he didn't look to have it in him what say it said a good deal for mr ratman's nerve that in the tutor's presence he took upon himself to reply boldly my father died rather suddenly a year since so you are my uncle the american mayor stared at the speaker in bewilderment which was not lessened by an abrupt laugh from the gentleman at the fireplace i guess i'll take a seat and work this out said he i'm your uncle am i i never should have known it if you hadn't been so obliging as to tell me young man which branch of the family tree do you hang on to your sister had a son roger ingleton that's my name is that so and you're the present squire of maxfield well well when did you come to life again there was a false report of my death said ratman glancing a little nervously at the tutor who was diligently removing the mud from his riding boots wal it's singular i never expected to see a nephew of mine again why how long is it now since i went over thirty seven years if it's a day i can't remember that said ratman tentatively seeing you weren't born you'd find it hard said mr headland but say by all accounts you were a troublesome boy i was not all i might have been replied mr ratman beginning to wish this cross examination was over put it that way certainly you ran away and left your mother my sister with a broken heart i've heard say my father and i quarrelled and i left home yes here the tutor quitted the fire and came to where the two men sat excuse my interrupting you sir said he to the stranger but your conversation interests me the fact is the squire married a second time and left a son whose guardian i happen to be by the old man's will my ward is the heir you will allow i have a right to feel interested in this gentleman who only discovered six months ago that he was the lost elder brother the good american sat back in his chair and looked from ratman to armstrong and from armstrong back to ratman in a state of painful bewilderment now said the tutor my ward feels a little curiosity about his elder brother only natural is it not and i as his legal guardian naturally share that curiosity why certainly said the mayor beginning to be interested mr ratman began to lose countenance and fidgeted uncomfortably with the forks and spoons i have heard a little of this gentleman's romantic career continued the tutor with his half drawl he has been good enough to tell us in fact that when he left home by the way when was that ratman when i know your right to ask me questions growled ratman i'll see about answering them seems to me said the mayor assuming judicial functions for the time being unless you've disgraced yourself you can't hurt much by saying you say you're the squire's son this gentleman i didn't catch your name sir armstrong mr armstrong says he's not as sure as you are seems to me if you tell one thing you may as well tell another it's all one story and if it's true it's a good one mr ratman did not like the turn affairs were taking if he refused to reply to the questions put to him he was aware that he was damaging his own claim if he answered how was he to know if the risk was not even greater and yet what more was armstrong likely to know about the lost son than he himself he might as well go through with it so he replied sullenly i left home a year before my mother died he can get the date of that from the tombstone if he wants it thanks i'll look at it said the tutor with aggravating cheerfulness you went up to london didn't you i've told you so and that i lived there with a man called fastnet and then you went abroad i think you said yes to india just so that's where you died is it not you stayed in london long enough to go to the dogs i understood you to say that didn't take long i spent all my money in six months and then enlisted said ratman feeling fairly launched by this time quite so and you died i believe in india i was supposed to have died in a skirmish and they sent news home that i had i never corrected it whereabouts was the skirmish if it's a fair question on the frontier i forget the name that's unfortunate by the way to go back to london do you recollect where mr fastnet lived i should like to call on him you won't find him he died before i went abroad drank himself to death i'm sorry to hear that and you enlisted under your present name of ratman of course my present name is ingleton if i called myself ratman that was because i didn't want my father to hear of me i never told any one my real name seems to me said the mayor it's odd how your medical adviser on the field of battle found out where to write home to say you were dead it is still more odd sir said the tutor fixing the claimant with his glass that this mr fastnet who you will be glad to hear has also come to life again was still in good health when my ward saw him a few weeks ago retains a vivid recollection of the runaway son having entertained him for a year at his own lodgings at the end of which time the prodigal so far from enlisting took to the stage and spent another year at least with a company of strolling players we have your unfortunate's nephew's story proceeded the tutor carefully traced up to a certain point and if either you or mr ratman are interested in the matter we can produce our witnesses your memory is a treacherous one robert ratman it is no use asking you i fear what became of you after a certain riot in boulogne when you as the ghost in hamlet' and your fellow tragedians were mobbed for not paying the rent of your hall mr ratman who during this cross examination had passed through all the stages from blustering rage to abject discomfiture sank back on his chair and turned a livid face to his questioner he had sense enough to see that the game was up and not being an actor himself he was at a loss to conceal his defeat the tutor's cold keen gaze took the heart out of him lying dog snarled he i've had enough of your questions you think yourself clever but i'll be even with you yet i'll ruin the lot of you you and your fellow scoundrel and his brats who don't know yet what it is to have a felon for a father you'll be sorry for this so saying he took up his bag and with the best swagger he could assume slunk from the room see stay here young man said the mayor excitedly there's something else but he was gone the outer door slammed to and his footsteps died gradually away down the street mr armstrong and the stranger exchanged glances in silence then the mayor turned to mr armstrong with a stern face seems to me sir said he that if that young man's the knave you're uncommon like the fool you'll excuse me mentioning it after the service you have just rendered to the cause of veracity but it's a solemn fact i have heard the same opinion expressed by other authorities and i have no doubt it is true you mean to tell me i should have extorted from him a written recantation of his claim that's so you guess right consequence is i'm bound to stay now as a witness to see this quarrel through here have i come on a pleasure trip to see my relatives and it seems i've got to combine business and pleasure after all you forget i've no hold over this man he does not claim the property although he guesses that my ward will hand it over to him if he proves his identity i can only show him to be a liar you seem pretty sure of that i am myself and i hope for everybody's sake that your nephew if he should turn up will be a better credit to the name than this land shark well sir i don't thank you for dragging me into the business but since i am here i stay to see it out i am relieved to hear you say so tell me now said the mayor what the story is and what does our young friend mean by his farewell threats thereupon mr armstrong gave his new ally a faithful account of the family difficulty of captain oliphant's embarrassing relations to the claimant of miss rosalind's dilemma of roger's quixotic determination to find his lost brother and of his own the tutor's conviction of the hopelessness of the quest the visitor by no means shared the last conclusion i rather calculate that lost young man ain't as dead as you think said he by all accounts he wasn't born to be drowned and he's not hung yet you bet the young brother will come up with him before time's called well by the last accounts he seems to have a vague clue as to his whereabouts fifteen years ago said the tutor we shall hear what he makes of it to morrow you must come up to maxfield and see my co trustee the presence of this unexpected friend of the family in the capacity of impartial umpire struck the tutor as particularly opportune at this juncture he had been a witness to ratman's virtual admission to his imposture and his natural interest in the discovery of his own nephew was not likely to warp his determination to see fair play for roger captain oliphant when he heard next morning of the new arrival by no means shared his co trustee's satisfaction the news indeed agitated him to a remarkable degree and he astonished the tutor by his ill concealed reluctance to meet him it is important that you should see him remarked the tutor as the uncle of the lost elder brother he is entitled i think to our confidence i can imagine no reason why you should be afraid to see him afraid who says i am afraid to see him i can think of no other explanation of your reluctance please sir mr headland to see you announced raffles captain oliphant changed colour as he turned to greet the visitor you'll pardon the early call said the latter but they gave me such a shocking supper at the inn that i resolved to try my luck up here for breakfast captain oliphant i presume friend of my friend armstrong pleased to know you sir pity you weren't with us last night to see the decline and fall of your ingenious friend r ratman your colleague sir put that young man to bed in a way that would have made you enjoy yourself seems to me captain you are well rid of him i fail to understand all this said the captain if you refer to mr ratman's claims to be the lost roger ingleton my nephew interposed the american all i can say is that i am not at all satisfied the claim is not a just one well sir said mr headland if that's your opinion it's more than that young man thinks himself by this time but never mind that i do mind it sir and i should like to know what right any one has to decide the matter for me i would suggest that though we are pleased to see you you should allow us to attend to our own business i not only allow you sir but i expect it of you and that reminds me of a question that has been puzzling me ever since i heard of the squire's death i wrote him a letter in the fall of last year the captain was seized with a sudden impulse to stir the fire and as he stood thus with his back turned mr armstrong could not help wondering what there was in the operation so violently to agitate the operator's frame yes sir a letter dated november th which must have been delivered as i have made inquiries and find it was not returned it contained money and as it was never acknowledged i had fears it was lost any letters for the squire have been opened by his executors i recollect none from abroad do you captain oliphant said the tutor the captain still with his back turned said no it never came into my hands mrs ingleton would hardly be likely to have opened it it would be only a short time before her death it's singular said the mayor my clerk posted it he should have registered it but omitted how was it directed asked the captain turning at last and pale after his exertions roger ingleton senior maxfield england hum did your clerk know it contained money which means did he purloin it well sir we shall see an english bank note can be traced that's one advantage you have over us on the other side mr armstrong during this short colloquy experienced a curious depression of spirits he was thinking not of the bank notes or the american mayor or even of captain oliphant but of rosalind and jill and tom and the thought of them just at this moment made him feel very melancholy as for the captain if his thoughts for a moment turned in the same direction they came back instantly with a strong revulsion of hate against the man who stood in his way at every turn who seemed to read him through to unmask him silently whenever he sought to take refuge in a lie to pin him ruthlessly down to the consequences of his own delinquencies but for armstrong he might have been a free man free of his debts free of his frauds clear in his children's eyes able to hold up his head to all the world as it was everything seemed to conspire with his enemy to pinion him and hold him fast a prey to the nemesis that was on its way what would he not give to have this stumbling block out of the path and feel himself free to breathe and hope once more in such a mood he spent the morning and about midday shaking off his visitor wandered out into the park for fresh air and space to think as he paced there returned to him memories of old half forgotten days of faces that once looked into his trustfully voices that once made his heart glad children that once ran to welcome him visions of vanished hopes ambitions ideals where were they all now who believed in him to day who would believe in him a week hence what voices rejoiced him now into whose life did he carry strength and cheer the park stretched bleak and desolate before him the earth lay sullen under his feet the very trees drooped around him and the great restless ocean beyond moaned at his coming it was nothing to him that the smell of spring was in the air that the lark was carolling high overhead that the declining sun was darting his rays through the trees near at hand rose a sound of laughter he durst not turn that way lest he should meet his own children far away through a break in the trees he could catch a glimpse of the old church at yeld with the vicarage beside it where dwelt the one being he dreaded most his own daughter from behind wafted a sound of music through an open window where sat the man who had found him out and could ruin him by a word which way was he to turn which way shall a man turn who would escape from himself for two long hours he wandered on caring not which way he took and feeling himself step by step closer beset by his dismal forebodings presently he found himself beyond the park boundaries on the open downs which stretched to the edge of the cliff the touch of the salt sea breeze on his fevered brow startled him and made him shiver the last gleam of daylight was fading in the west and when presently it flickered out and left him in the dark he felt that the last ray of his own hope had vanished too and yet strange as it may seem this man had never been quite as honest with himself as he was now the game was fairly up he had long since given up deluding himself that he was better than he seemed now the time was come when it hardly seemed worth while to delude other people it was no use nor to such a pass had he come did it seem much use to be a coward the dog whose last hope has gone will gather himself together for a final fling at his persecutors the poltroon driven back against the wall unable to retreat farther will sometimes turn and make a stand such as he never deemed himself capable of before and so captain oliphant because he could do nothing else plucked up a little courage and groped about in the dark for some new fragments of his lost manhood he would go back and face the worst if he was to be ruined he would pull the mask off himself and not leave it to armstrong or any one else to do it whatever befell nothing could well be more wretched than the plight in which he now stood he had no amends to make but he could at least simplify the labours of those whose business it was to expose and punish him with which poor spark of resolution he turned dismally to go back to maxfield as he did so he became aware of footsteps close at hand on the cliff path whoever the passenger might be at such an hour and place it was not likely to be any one but a coastguard or a fisherman captain oliphant was in no mood for company he therefore stepped off the path and sat down on a seat on the edge of the cliff till the intruder had passed it was not so dark but that the latter perceived the movement and halting suddenly said who's that the voice was that of mr ratman what brought him here at this moment to extinguish perhaps the little gleam of courage that flickered in the breast of his wretched dupe for a moment the captain was tempted to run like a thief from a policeman but his very desperation came to his rescue what do you want here ratman hullo it's oliphant here's a piece of luck you're the very man i wanted to see i've changed my mind since i said good bye yesterday my boy and mean to remain here on the spot and see the end of this business i was on my way to see you come along you'd better say what you want to say here you won't find any admirers of yours up at the house ah then you've heard of last night's business what on earth brings this yankee idiot here at this time to spoil everything now teddy the long and short of this business is that you must stir yourself you've shuffled long enough first of all you were going to marry the widow you boggled that then you were going to succeed to the property you've boggled that then you were to clear the tutor out of the way you've boggled that then you were to raise the wind and pay me off and you've boggled that i've given you long enough rope goodness knows i mean to haul in now captain oliphant rose from his seat with a dismal laugh i'm tired of hearing you say that ratman i wish you'd do it and be done with it ratman peered through the gloom at the speaker in surprise hullo said he that's a new tune for you now look here i suppose you've not forgotten our talk yesterday well you've two things to do you've to recognise me as roger ingleton when the time comes there'll be proofs and witnesses they must satisfy you mind make no mistake of that then i must have rosalind i love her on the day i'm your son in law you shall have back every bill i hold against you now is it a bargain it's a cheap one for you i can tell you the blood rose to captain oliphant's brow a few hours ago he would have faltered and evaded half whined half promised now sheer desperation made him reckless he laughed bitterly recognise you you shark never and if you ever dare to speak of my daughter i'll shake you like a cur there now do as you like you've got my answer ratman dropped his jaw in utter amazement for a minute the words would not come then with a face so livid that oliphant could see its whiteness through the night he hissed you mean it you defy me me with these papers in my hand and the whole story of your villainy in my keeping you as he held up the bills a wild impulse prompted the wretched captain to make a grab at them there was a short struggle oliphant with his back to the cliff kept his hold for a moment then a fierce blow sent him reeling backwards to the edge with the torn half of the documents in his hand there was a gasp a half cry and next moment only one man stood in the place peering with ashen face into the black darkness below chapter twenty four the billiard marker at l'hotel soult in the salon of a small dilapidated hotel in one of the southern suburbs of paris sat roger three weeks after the event recorded in the last chapter he had the dull place apparently to himself the billiard room visible through the folding doors was deserted in the dining room the waiter dozed undisturbed by a single guest the landlady in her bureau yawned and hummed and had not even a bill to make out she had already made out that of the young english gentleman and a pretty one it was a guest such as he was worth a season to the landlady of l'hotel soult three weeks ago half dead with cold and weariness he had come and asked for a bed and in that bed till yesterday he had remained feverish coughing sometimes gasping for breath compared with the attack he had had in london in the winter this was a mild one but in this dreary place with not a friend at hand with a doctor who could not understand a word he said with a voluble landlady who when she visited him never gave him a chance of getting in a word and with a few servants who stared at him blankly whenever he attempted to lift his voice it was the most miserable of all his illnesses he was as close a prisoner as if he had been in jail the doctor who took apartments at his expense in the hotel would not allow him to move no one to whom he appealed could be made to understand that he had friends in england with whom he desired to communicate one letter to armstrong which he had tried to write the landlady impounded and destroyed as waste paper perhaps not quite by accident this well to do young guest was worth nursing his friends would only come and fetch him away whereas she motherly soul was prepared to take him in and do for him the pocket of the coat which on the day of his arrival she had carried off to her kitchen to dry contained satisfactory proof that monsieur was a young gentleman who could pay and although she was too honest to recoup herself for her services in advance she had kept the coat hanging up in her room for a week as a pleasant reminder of the joys of hospitality only yesterday the invalid had recovered sufficiently to rout the doctor and stagger down to the telegraph office and to day propped up with pillows on the uncomfortable stuff sofa he was expiating his rashness with a day of miserable coughing at the sound of his handbell the landlady a buxom dame of forty five autumns hastened to the couch of her profitable visitor roger was too weak to oppose the flood of her congratulations and compliments on his recovery and allowed her to talk herself breathless before he put in his word madame has not been many years in these parts he inquired in his best french madame threw up her shoulders and protested she had lived in those parts from a child when the dull suburb was once a festive little rustic village and the great city now gobbling it up once loomed mysteriously in the north with acres and miles of green fields and woods between but this hotel said roger has not stood here so long ma foi said she since i can remember when i used to visit my good uncle here every sunday i remember l'hotel soult' why when i married my cousin and became madame l'hotesse it was all fields between us and paris yes and little enough change about the house we cannot afford monsieur to build and decorate by a miracle we escaped the german shells ah a merry time was the year of the war france suffered alas but the l'hotel soult' prospered 'twas the year i was left a widow i had ten waiters then monsieur and two billiard markers a chef from the best kitchen in paris and stables and chambrieres and why monsieur the wages of one week were twenty twenty five napoleons that was after the war asked roger yes before that i had more but alas they left me for the field and came no more were all your waiters frenchmen asked roger madame stared curiously at the questioner why do you ask i have had many kinds some english like monsieur a year or two after the war said roger there was an englishman a relation of mine who was a waiter in an hotel in one of the suburbs south of paris i want to hear of him i have hunted for weeks i could hear nothing of him i came here before i gave it up as a hopeless search and as you know i've been laid up ever since you have been kind to me madame something makes me think i was not kept here for nothing can you help me to find my friend the landlady began to have inward misgivings that she had not behaved to this pleasant spoken young guest of hers as nicely as she might have done and she secretly resolved to revise the bill in his favour before presenting it why monsieur i had plenty english in my time the year after the war i had let me think two or three your friend was he the little lame one who waited beautiful at table but that he cough cough till i must send him away no that's not the one then it was the fat one john bull we call him who eat more than he served never used a fork when he had his fingers ah he was a dirty one was your friend no said roger that's not he my friend was not much older than i am and a gentleman a gentleman and a waiter laughed the landlady but tell me what was his name he used to call himself rogers she shook her head no one of that name was here i had english one or two bardsley and jackson and smith he was a gentleman but he was not young he was fifty years mr smith a good servant also there was monsieur callow callot exclaimed roger starting at the familiar name was he an englishman surely c a l l o w callow ah he was a droll one was monsieur callow and a gentleman too i never had a billiard marker like him he could play any man and lose by one point and he could recite and sing and oh he eat so little every one laughed at him but he laughed little himself and thought himself too good for his fellow waiters what was he like asked roger flushing with excitement a fine young man with long curly hair and whiskers and a beard he was afraid of nothing tall and strong ah me i have seen him knock a man down at a blow he was a wild reckless man was monsieur callow but a good servant and oh a beautiful billiard player he always knew how to lose a game and oh it made my table so popular had he any friends in paris yes he went often to see his father so he told me an actor who gave lessons i never saw monsieur le pere how long did he stay with you callow for five years he served me well then there was a fracas a quarrel i remember it now an english officer was here and played with him and was beaten 'twas the only time i ever knew callow win a game but he lost his temper this time and won then milord called him a cheat and without a word monsieur callow knocked him down the police came and monsieur callow knocked him down then he put on his hat and walked and i never saw him more he always said he would go to sea and i think he would keep his word ah a telegram 'tis long since telegrams came to my hotel helas not for me for you monsieur it was from armstrong shall be with you ten to morrow morning the three weeks which had passed at maxfield had been terrible the discovery of captain oliphant's body at the foot of the cliff with the clear traces of a struggle on the brink above had created a profound sensation at maxfield and the country round for a day the air was full of wild conjectures of suicide incident foul play until the last named theory was finally confirmed by the discovery in the tightly clenched hand of the dead man of a fragment of a promissory note bearing the signature of robert ratman to the tutor as he held the paper in his hand everything became startlingly clear this was the last act of a tragedy which had been going on for months and now that the curtain had abruptly fallen he could not help in the midst of this horror owning to a sense of thankfulness for the sake of others that the troubled career of his rival and enemy had stopped short at a point beyond which nothing but disgrace and scandal and misery awaited it from that disgrace it was his business now by every means in his power to shield the innocent brother and sisters who still honoured the dead man as their father many a grievous task had been thrown upon the tutor in his day but none cost him more effort than this of breaking to the children of his enemy the news of their father's death but he went through it manfully and ably rosalind on whom the blow fell hardest because on her spirit the burden of her father's cares had lain heaviest rose with a heroine's courage to the occasion and earned the tutor's boundless gratitude by making his task easy she said little she understood everything she remembered nothing but the father's love his old caresses and confidences and kindnesses the tears she shed blotted out all the anxieties and misgivings and heart sinkings of recent weeks all that remained was crowded with love tom dulled and stunned took the story in gradually and got used to it as he went along he came and slept at night in the tutor's room and felt how much worse things might have been had it not been for the stalwart protector who put hope and cheer into him and filled the blank in his heart with sturdier views of life than the boy had ever harboured there before as for jill for a week all was blackness and darkness to her she felt deserted lost she cried herself to sleep at night and by day wandered over the house peeping into her father's room and half expecting to see him back then her gentle spirit took courage and she looked up and her eyes lit with comfort and hope on mr armstrong everything could not be lost if he was there and when he sometimes came and took her little hand in his and invited her to be his companion in his rides or sought her out in her lonely walks and made her teach him the haunts of her favourite flowers or read to him from her favourite books she began to think there was still some joy left on earth dear mr armstrong she said one day when by invitation she came to make afternoon tea for him in his room you are so awfully kind to me if i was only as old as rosalind i would marry you this rather startling declaration took the tutor considerably aback he laughed and said you are very nice as you are jill you think i'm silly i know said she but i'm not would you hate me if i was older i don't think i could hate you not even if you were a hundred i love you ever so much said she please don't believe what tom said about the duke i don't like him a millionth part as much as you poor duke said the tutor really and truly and oh mr armstrong if you would only wait i would love to marry you some day how soon shall i be big enough this was getting embarrassing but the tutor was in a tender mood and had it not in his heart to thwart the little leap year maid time flies fast said he you'll be grown up before we know where we all are she sighed i know you'd sooner have rosalind but she doesn't care for you as much as i do she likes roger best but i don't i like you fifty thousand times better would it be an awful bother mr armstrong what to have jill for my little wife said he not a bit if ever i want one she's the first person i mean to ask with this declaration jill had to rest content it solaced her sorrow vastly and even though rosalind to whom she confided the compact under a pledge of secrecy scolded and laughed at her alternately she felt a new prospect open before her and set herself resolutely to the task of growing up worthy of mr armstrong's affection but amid all these troubles and hopes at maxfield two questions were on every one's lips where was roger where was robert ratman roger had written once after reaching paris a letter full of hope which had arrived a few days before captain oliphant's death he had succeeded at last in tracking the man pantalzar to a low lodging in the city and from him had ascertained somewhat of the history of the callot family they had lodged with him at long street in london where they had given lessons in acting elocution and music and pantalzar clearly remembered the lad rogers as a constant visitor at the house partly in the capacity of a promising student of the dramatic art and partly as a hopeless lover of his preceptor's wayward daughter after a year his troubles in the latter capacity were abruptly cut short by the illness and death of the young lady a blow which staggered the parents and broke up the establishment at long street it failed however to drive rogers from the party who with a romantic loyalty attached himself to the fortunes of the old people and became like a son to them in their distresses eventually the bereaved family migrated to paris whence pantalzar had once heard from the father who had found employment as stall manager of a third rate theatre in one of the fauxbourg hither roger tracked him and after dogged search often baffled sometimes apparently hopeless discovered some one who remembered the reputed son of the old couple who as far as this witness could remember was thought to have hired himself out as billiard marker in an hotel in one of the southern suburbs of the city thus far he had succeeded when he wrote home what transpired subsequently and how he dropped for a season out of all knowledge the reader already knows the suspense occasioned by his sudden disappearance as may be imagined added a new element of wretchedness to the situation at maxfield telegrams letters inquiries alike failed to discover his whereabouts or the secret of his silence as post after post came and brought neither message nor tidings the hearts of the watchers grew sick to the tutor especially tied as he was to the scene of the tragedy those three weeks were a period of torture he urged dr brandram to go over to paris to make inquiries but the doctor after a fortnight of fruitless search returned empty handed mr armstrong thereupon resolved at all hazards to quit his post and go himself he knew something of paris he had old associations with the city and once as the reader has heard possessed acquaintances there if any one could find the boy he thought he could and with such trusty substitutes as the doctor and mr headland who remained at yeld to leave behind he felt that he might nay rather that he must venture on the journey it was on the morning of his departure as he was waiting for the trap to carry him to the station that roger's telegram was put in his hand come have been ill better now hotel soult no news twenty four hours later the tutor was at his pupil's side with a heavy weight lifted from his heart and resolved come what would not to quit his post till he had the truant safe back at maxfield the news he brought with him served to drive from roger's mind all thoughts of continuing his sojourn a day longer than was necessary to recover his strength it seems pretty certain said he that my brother when he left here returned to england and probably went to sea very soon after there is no object in staying here look in that room there armstrong that's the billiard room in which he spent most of his time and that's the very table on which he let himself be beaten regularly for the good of the house the tutor walked across to the folding doors and surveyed the dingy room with critical interest and that must have been little more than twelve years ago said he do you still hold to your theory that ratman is your brother i have no theory i must find my brother even if he is a a murderer said the boy with a groan but i say has nothing been heard of him the police have traced him to london there the scent ends for the present he is probably in hiding there and one may have to wait weeks or months till he gets off his guard and is caught about ten days later they started by slow stages on the homeward journey whether madame received all she expected for her hospitality is doubtful mr armstrong undertook the duties of cashier and used his eye glass considerably in scrutinising the figures he craved an interview with madame in her parlour to discuss her arithmetic and although he appeared eventually to arrive at a satisfactory understanding with the good lady so much so that she shed tears at his departure he did not complain that her charges were extortionate as french hotels go the home coming of the heir of maxfield created a welcome flutter of excitement among the desolate occupants of the manor house and their neighbours but the flutter in their hearts was nothing compared with that in the heart of the heir himself as he walked across the park on the day after his return to call at the vicarage and invite rosalind to accompany him in a ride what passed whether the flutter was contagious what brought back the deserted colour to miss rosalind's cheeks why they rode so slow and left so much of their course to the decision of their steeds all this and many other matters for wonder history recordeth not as is quite proper but it does record that when on their return mr armstrong chanced to come out on to the door step where the two stood unmounted roger said armstrong rosalind has promised to be my wife the tutor flushed a little at this not unexpected announcement then taking his pupil's arm he said it means great happiness for you both i am glad very glad but why if he was so glad did he slink off to his study forthwith and play a dirge on his piano and there sit listlessly in his chair for the rest of the morning staring out of the window through his glass till jill tripped in and fetched him down to lunch saying dear mr armstrong try not to be too awfully sorry i think no one is as nice as you chapter twenty five the heir of maxfield comes of age it wanted but a month to roger's majority that important day on which the fate of so many persons was to be decided when a letter was delivered to the heir of maxfield as he sat at breakfast the weeks that had passed since captain oliphant's sudden death had been uneventful to rosalind and roger the discovery that they loved one another went far to lighten the sorrow which had befallen both one in the death of a father the other in what appeared to be the hopeless loss of a brother roger had by no means yet abandoned his search twice already had he and armstrong been up to london to make inquiries but without avail the billiard marker of l'hotel soult had vanished as completely as well as mr ratman you know of course said the tutor once with the rather unsympathetic drawl in which he was wont to allude to the lost ingleton you know of course that if the man you want is ratman you are having the assistance of the police in your search a warrant is out against him and heaven and earth is being moved to capture him roger sighed i am looking for no one but my brother said he even if he turns out to be this miscreant i cannot help it quite so only it is right to remember that to find ratman means to hang him that at least is the object the police have in view but you need not disturb yourself on that score roger ingleton major if we find him may be a villain but he won't be the murderer of miss oliphant's father they returned presently baffled to maxfield no one at the depots or recruiting head quarters or pension offices could tell them a word of a soldier or a sailor named callot who might have enlisted or gone to sea about twelve years ago how could they expect it nor did the most careful search among the old squire's papers lead to the discovery of any record of the supposed report of the lad's death as a matter of fact if the billiard marker at l'hotel soult was the man they had already traced him down to a date long subsequent to that of his rumoured death together they ransacked the memories of dr brandram the vicar old hodder and one or two other inhabitants who might be supposed to know something of the matter very few there were who had seen the boy at all he had spent most of his time at school and during his occasional holidays had usually found all the amusement he needed in the ample confines of the park no one had seen in black and white an announcement of his death the squire had told the doctor that news of it had arrived from abroad where and when and under what circumstances he never said old hodder remembered the story of the quarrel between father and son and identified the portrait as that of the missing lad but despite his boasted threescore years and ten the old man was absolutely useless in the present inquiry and so thwarted at every turn not knowing what to hope for too proud to own himself beaten roger abandoned the search and awaited his majority very much as a debtor awaits his bankruptcy mr armstrong who chanced to look up at the moment when raffles delivered the letter concluded at once from the startled look on the lad's face that it was a missive of no common importance it was from ratman and bore on its envelope the london post mark dear brother for the last time i claim your help i know quite well that i am being hunted to death by you and those you employ without a shred of evidence you are willing to believe me a murderer i suppose i have no right to complain it would be convenient to you to have me out of the way and the best way of getting rid of me is to get up this cry against me a nice brotherly act and worthy of an ingleton it is no use my telling you that i am innocent that till i had been two days here i never so much as heard of oliphant's death you would not believe it nor i fancy is it much use telling you that the scoundrel owed me money that i was shielding him from the consequences of an old felony for which he might have had penal servitude and that the little he did pay me was stolen from your property of course you wouldn't believe it it is only about your brother who has been a slung stone all his life who never had a friend never knew a kind look from any one that you are ready to believe evil i am nearly at the end of my tether here in a day or two you will probably hear that i am arrested and then you will have your revenge on me for daring to be your flesh and blood and you will have no difficulty in convincing a judge and jury that i have committed any crime you and your saintly tutor choose to concoct between you pleasant to be rich and influential i could escape if i had money fifty pounds would rid you of me almost as effectively as the gallows but it would cost you something therefore it is absurd to imagine it possible when three days hence i make my last call at the general post office and hear once more that there is nothing for me not even a message of brotherly pity which costs nothing i shall know my last hope is gone and you in the lap of luxury counting your thousands and monarch of all you survey will be able to breathe again either you will hear of my arrest or if my courage befriends me you may read in an obscure corner of the paper of a wretch hounded to death who escaped his pursuers after all and preferred to die by his own hand rather than that of his brother good bye till then your brother roger ingleton ps the post office know me or my messenger as richard redfern' no doubt you will show this letter to your tutor who should have no difficulty in using the information i am obliged to give as to my whereabouts to run me down the flush on roger's face had died down into pallor by the time he reached the end of this savage yet dismal letter till he came to the postscript he had reckoned on demanding armstrong's advice as to its contents now somehow his hands seemed tied here was a man claiming to be his brother practically placing his life in his hands whether the story were true or false the writer had calculated astutely on the quixotic temper of his correspondent the appeal insultingly as it was made was one which roger ingleton minor could not resist i have had a letter from ratman said he when the two friends were alone together i am not surprised said the tutor he wants money of course i can't show you the letter simply because it contains a vague clue as to his whereabouts which you would feel bound to follow up i undoubtedly should said mr armstrong shall not you no he gives it in confidence in the hope i shall send him money i don't intend to do that but it would hardly be fair to use this letter against him he is captain oliphant's murderer he denies it and once more calls himself my brother the tutor shrugged his shoulders as you please burn the letter it probably does not tell more than the police know already roger dismally obeyed had he felt sure that this man was his brother he would have at all risk and in spite of all tried to help him even so to help him with one hand would mean to ruin him with the other if he found him it would be to hand him over to the police if he procured his escape it would be to oust him irrevocably from his inheritance there seemed nothing for it but to do nothing and wait in other quarters the policy of inaction found little favour mr headland called up the same evening at maxfield and demanded an interview with the tutor wal young man said he i calculate those two hundred pound notes of mine didn't travel so far astray after all you have traced them then i've been three weeks doing it but i have so and with what conclusion just this that captain e oliphant fell over that cliff just about the right time sir yes sir my notes are lying snug at the english bank at this present moment and i know their pedigree number came there from a bank in fleet street the bank in fleet street received it from a hotel the hotel received it from a gentleman who slept in bedroom number and that gentleman's name was ratman number came to the bank later from amsterdam amsterdam had it from an english diamond merchant the diamond merchant had it from a stock jobber and the stock jobber had it from a sporting club who had it from a temporary member in december last in payment of a gambling debt and that temporary member's name was ratman that's not all sir my letter was posted in america november on november the post master at yeld an intelligent man sir received a letter with an american stamp sir addressed to roger ingleton senior at maxfield a yankee stamp was a novelty to your intelligent post master and he took a note of date and sent it up here for delivery it was delivered here november and your footman remembers giving it to your colleague three days after mr ratman visited his friend captain e oliphant here two days later he reached the hotel in london with a yeld label on his trunk a week after that he passed note number to settle his bill there sir the americans are born explorers i flatter myself there's not much more to know about my two notes quite so said the tutor you have done a great deal in three weeks what reparation can be made you sir you are an honest young man you believe in shielding the memory of a dead enemy you are right continue on that tack and you'll do yourself credit as executor of my late kinsman i will trouble you to place this cheque for l to the credit of the estate and never to say a word about the sum that was lost notes get lost every day at least they do in america mr armstrong's gratitude was beyond words he had set his heart for the sake of the children of his late colleague and even for roger's sake on covering with a cloak of oblivion the crime of which chance had made him the detector this american had it in his power to aid or thwart him and had chosen the former course and a great weight was lifted off the tutor's mind in consequence on the following day he was calling at the yeld bank to transact some business part of which was to pay in mr headland's cheque when the manager invited him into his parlour this functionary was a respectable middle aged person who had held his appointment for five or six years keeping pretty much to himself and as is the lot of bank managers being made a great deal of by clients who chanced to be or desired to be under obligations to his bank mr armstrong said he you will pardon me but there's a little matter hullo thought the tutor has the bank stopped payment or the maxfield securities been robbed well sir it's a private matter and i should not mention it if it were not for the talk which is going to and fro about young mr ingleton's lost brother i understand there's a claimant for the title and not a very eligible one on the contrary most ineligible said the tutor and it seems likely that he will under present circumstances keep far enough away from these parts naturally the coroner's jury have given him a pressing invitation which he feels compelled to decline well about this lost boy you'll think me impertinent but i think i can tell you something about him the tutor started and looked hard at the speaker yes said the latter mildly as you know i've not been here long my predecessor mr morris was a friend of the family i remember his once mentioning an elder son of the squire who had been reported dead and that was all i ever heard of the matter from him or anybody else but only last week in a bundle of documents relating to mr morris's own affairs which as his executor it was my duty to examine i came upon a letter which though evidently private at the time seems as if it ought at least to be seen by you and your ward now it proves that ten years ago the elder son was alive and being in his handwriting it may be important evidence if you have to deal with the claim of an impostor the tutor expressed considerable discomfort at this new complication and regarded the document in the banker's hand as if it were an infernal machine it's private you say would it not be better to regard it as such i think it should be seen if you prefer i will submit it to mr pottinger this settled the business the tutor stretched out his hand for the letter it was dated from on board the ship cyclops off havana ten years ago and by the unsteady character of the handwriting which rendered some words almost illegible had evidently been written in a high sea mr armstrong could scarcely help smiling at the banker's naive suggestion as to the use of the document as evidence of handwriting the note was as follows dear mr morris i write to you in strictest confidence my father probably has given me up for dead i hope so on no account must he know that i have written to you my object is to enclose a twenty five dollar note which i owe him once before we quarrelled he lent me five pounds i want to pay it back without any one knowing of it because i'm determined not to owe anything to anybody especially to one who has told me i'm not honest please put it into his bank account he probably will never notice it anyhow please whatever you do don't tell him or any one alive where it came from or that you ever heard a word from me or of me i trust you as a gentleman yours truly roger ingleton well sir said the banker who had watched the reading curiously does it not seem an important letter i think so it appears to be genuine too on the face of it if you will allow me i should like my ward to see it it will interest him the tutor was not wrong with this strange missive in his hand all roger's yearnings towards his lost brother returned in full force the object of his search seemed suddenly to stand within measurable reach ten years appeared nothing beside the twenty which only a few months back had divided them if he could but postpone his majority another year then came the miserable doubt about ratman if after all his unlikely discredited story should prove to have a grain of truth at the bottom of it but he dismissed the doubt for the hope armstrong i must go to town to find out about the cyclops' come with me there's a good fellow in three weeks it will be too late the tutor was prepared for this decision by all means said he we will go to morrow to inquire after a passenger or sailor who was on board a sailing vessel nationality unknown which happened to be off havana in a heavy sea on october ten years ago i know it's absurd said roger but i can't help it i never seemed so near my brother before i should despise myself if i sat idle here so it happened that just when maxfield was preparing in a quiet way to celebrate the coming of age of the heir just as the gloom which had followed on captain oliphant's tragic death was beginning to lift a little and allow tom and jill decorously to think of football just as rosalind was beginning to make up her mind that she was not destined for ever to teach the elements of art and science to the vicarage children just when everything seemed to be settling down for the last scene of the drama roger and his tutor vanished once more on their familiar wild goose chase dr brandram grumbled the county gentry shook their heads mr pottinger breathed again no one thought well of the expedition some went so far as to make a jest of it roger cared nothing for what people thought with armstrong to back him with rosalind to bid him a brave god speed with his own stout heart to buoy him up and with his lost brother only ten years distant he could afford to start in good cheer and let the world think what it liked but the cheer was destined to failure they heard of one or two vessels called the cyclops but respecting the crew or passengers of none of them was it possible to glean a word of news the vessel in question might have been ship schooner or barque she might have been english american indian or australian she might have foundered or changed her name or been broken up for lumber lloyds knew her not west india merchants had never heard of her of all their quests this seemed the most vague and hopeless up to the last roger stuck doggedly to it even if he spent his majority in the london docks he would not turn tail the tutor backed up loyally did most of the work made most of the inquiries never grumbled or gibed or protested when roger looked most like giving in it was the tutor who put fresh heart into him to morrow said roger on the eve of his birthday i will give it up but there is a day yet and sure enough on the last day a vague ray of light came in the shape of a telegram from the port master at havana to whom at the tutor's suggestion a message of inquiry had been sent cyclops known writing writing a letter would take weeks to come and they had but a day they hurried to the telegraph office and sent an urgent message begging particulars by wire whatever the cost late that day indeed it was nearly midnight the reply came sailed ceylon west indies name ingleton unknown ship now here roger staggered from the office a beaten man through the deserted city streets the clocks were booming the hour of midnight and ushering in his majority his brother all along he had persuaded himself this quest was to end in victory that before now he should have met his brother face to face and given him what was his to day it was no longer his to give the race was already over and the clock had won his brother was not there take my arm dear old fellow said mr armstrong and cheer up chapter twenty six missing links for three hours that night the two friends arm in arm paced the empty streets saying little brooding much yet gaining courage at every step the touch of his guardian's arm thrilled roger now and again with a sensation of hope and relief in the midst of his dejection which almost surprised him he had lost his brother but was not this man as good as a brother to him would life be quite brotherless as long as he remained at his side the tutor for his part experienced a strange emotion too the opening day had brought a crisis in his life as well as in that of his ward it was a day to which he had long looked forward partly with the dread of separation partly with the joy of a man who has honestly done his work and is about to render up his trust but was it all over now no longer now was he a guardian or governor was he therefore to lose this gallant comrade to whom all the brotherhood in his nature went out with reflections such as these it is scarcely to be wondered at that little was said during that long aimless walk at last roger shivered let's turn in said mr armstrong they were in a street off the strand a long way from their hotel and no cab in sight any place will do said roger why not this and he pointed to the door of a seedy looking private hotel over which a lamp burned with the legend night porter in attendance the tutor surveyed the house curiously through his and then said quite so i stayed here once before and rang the bell the door was opened by a person of whose nationality there could be little doubt particularly when after a momentary inspection of his belated guests he uttered an exclamation of joy and accosted the tutor mon ami oh i am glad to see you my good friend friend of my pauvre pere friend of my youth it is you ah monsieur added he addressing roger for your friend's sake you are welcome entrez be quiet now gustav said the tutor bring us come coffee in the coffee room if you can get it made and light a fire in the bedroom we will talk in the morning gustav gesticulated delighted acquiescence in any demand his hero made and ushered them into the coffee room what a queer fellow said roger when he had vanished in search of the coffee queer but good hearted fellow is gustav said the tutor i have known him a long time to morrow i'll tell you hullo there was but a single candle in the room and by its dim light and that of the half expired fire they had not at first been able to see that they were not the sole occupants of the apartment on the sofa lay curled the figure of a man breathing heavily and to judge by the spirit bottle and glasses on the table at his hand expiating a carouse by a disturbed and feverished slumber the tutor raised the candle so that the light fell more clearly on the sleeper something in the figure had struck him the man lay with his face turned towards them he was stylishly though cheaply dressed his age may have been forty and his features were half obscured by a profuse and unkempt sandy beard this was not what had struck the tutor in his frequent turnings and tossings the sleeper had contrived to betray the fact that his hirsute appearance was due not to nature but to art a wire hook had been displaced from the ear leaving one side of the wig tilted so as to disclose underneath the smooth cheek of a clean shaven man the examination was still in process when gustav re entered the room the clatter with which he put down the cups on the table aided by the glare of the candle and the tutor's sharp ejaculation wakened the sleeper with a start he was sober enough as he raised his head sharply and sprang to his feet in doing this the treacherous wig slipped still farther before he could raise his hand to replace it mr armstrong had stepped forward and torn the mask from his face disclosing the livid countenance of mr robert ratman the surprise on either side was at first beyond reach of words the miscreant stood staring in a dazed way first at armstrong then at roger then at gustav who being a frenchman was the first to come to his use of his tongue mon dieu monsieur this is no bedroom for the gentleman it is forbidden to sleep all night in the salle a manger silence gustav go for a policeman said armstrong in a tone so strange that the faithful gustav slunk away like a dog with his tail between his legs now sir said the tutor as the door closed the wretch made one wild effort at escape he might have known by this time with whom he had to deal mr armstrong held him by the wrist as in a vice it won't do ratman said he the game is up the best thing you can do is to stand quietly here till the police come the prisoner sullenly abandoned his struggle and turned with a bitter sneer to roger so you've run me down have you you've found your lost brother at last i expected it i was a fool to suppose you would lift a finger for me there's some chance of escaping from an enemy but from a brother who has set himself to hound a brother to death never never mind your money's safe now have me hung as soon as you like the sooner the better for me roger stupefied and stung to the quick by these taunts winced as though he and not the speaker were the miscreant he looked almost appealingly at his accuser and tried to speak to justify himself but the words refused to come suddenly he seemed to detect in the prisoner's eye some new sinister purpose take care armstrong take care he cried and flung himself between the two it was not an instant too soon with his free hand ratman had contrived while talking to reach unheeded a pocket from which he suddenly whipped a pistol and pounding on his captor fired the shot was badly and wildly aimed at the tutor's face even at so short a distance it might have missed its mark altogether roger's sudden intervention however found it an unexpected target the lad's up flung hand caught the pistol at the moment it went off and received in its palm the ball which had been intended for his friend the sight of this untoward accident completely unnerved the prisoner he sullenly let the weapon drop from his fingers and with the air of a gambler who has played and lost his last stake sank listlessly on the sofa on which not ten minutes before he had been sleeping luck's against me he said with an oath look to the boy i shan't trouble you any more i've done him harm enough without this i wish i'd never heard of his elder brother the tutor busy binding up his ward's hand only half heard the words but roger amidst all his pain heard it and looked up then you are not my brother he said faintly brother no and if you hadn't left the papers about in your room a year ago i should never have known it was worth my while to pretend it when a few moments later gustav entered with two constables mr ratman welcomed the visitors with a sigh almost of relief and placed himself quietly in their hands as he passed the chair where roger sat half faint with pain and loss of blood he stopped a moment and said your brother no if i had been i shouldn't have come to this about ten days later a small party was gathered in roger's cosy den at maxfield the young squire was there with his hand in a sling still pale and weak but able to sit up on the sofa and enjoy for the first time the society of a few choice friends among those friends it was not surprising to find rosalind that young lady had recently exchanged the duties of governess at the vicarage for those of temporary sick nurse at the manor house and to night in her simple mourning with a flush of pleasure on her cheek as now and again she turned her eyes to the patient whose recovery did her care such credit she looked at least roger an impartial witness thought so more beautiful than ever but as roger made the same discovery every time he and his nurse met the opinion may be regarded as of relative value tom was there enjoying himself as usual indeed rather more than usual because in the stable hard by munching his oats was a horse the gift of the squire who owned him tom as lord and master jill was there too a little pensive as she looked round for some one who was not there but trying hard to enjoy herself and seem glad besides these intimates there was mr headland feeling like a father to everybody dr brandram in professional attendance and the vicar himself accidentally present to congratulate his young parishioner on his recovery the absentee of the evening was mr armstrong who had gone to london the previous day on matters connected with the approaching assizes i wish armstrong was here said tom won't he open his eye when he sees crocodile' crocodile was the name of the horse before mentioned it hardly seems like a party without him said jill blushing a little you were telling us about the letter written at sea said the vicar of course you heard nothing of the ship in london yes i did said roger after no end of disappointment armstrong suggested telegraphing to the post master at havana off which the letter was written you know and we heard that there had been a ship called the cyclops' ten years ago trading between the west indies and ceylon but that nothing was known of any one of the name of ingleton rosalind looked up suddenly ceylon and the west indies exclaimed she roger did mr armstrong never tell you a story he once told me of a shark adventure which happened to him when he was a sailor on a ship trading between ceylon and the west indies the sudden silence which followed this inquiry was only broken by a low whistle of wonder from tom roger with a flush of colour on his pale cheeks sat up and said what is the story rosalind told it as nearly as possible in the tutor's own words he did not tell you the name of the ship asked the doctor no or the name of the man who was killed no there was another silence it seemed as if they were sitting as witnesses to the completion of some curious tunnelling operation when the party on one side suddenly catches sound of the pick axe stroke of the party on the other step by step the lost roger ingleton had been tracked forward to the deck of this west india trading ship and backward step by step the tutor's history went till it almost touched the same point i expect said tom with a cheerfulness hardly in accord with the spirits of the company generally the fellow who was had by the shark was the one and armstrong never knew it the profound young man had dropped on the very idea which was present in the minds of each one wal said the american mayor it may be so but the question i'm asking myself is this if so it's singular mr armstrong did not mention the coincidence when you got the cablegram oh said roger at the time i was so cut up to find i'd failed after all that i didn't care to talk and directly after that we met ratman he had no chance i calculate i'd like to ask your tutor one or two pertinent questions said the mayor the meeting was fully with him when tom broke out again i say i know let's ask gustav he's no end chummy with armstrong he might know a thing or two he's the chap i told you about at christy's minstrels continued master tom warming up at the genial reminiscence is that the french waiter down stairs who helped bring you down from london asked the doctor yes i'm keeping him here as valet for the present armstrong mentioned i remember that he knew him ring him up said tom gustav appeared all smiles and shrugs and compliments eh bien my good gentleman said he i am 'appy to see you well i was mortifie for your mishap but mademoiselle ah mademoiselle here he raised his fingers gracefully to his lips ze angel step in where ze pauvre garcon may not walk you could not but be well with a nurse so charmante ah my friend 'ow 'appy will be my good kind friend when he return you mean mr armstrong have you known him long asked roger pardieu ten fifteen twenty year i know not how long he is brother to me your kind governor he is to the pauvre pere a son and to the petite francoise ah quelle est morte what was the name of your father demanded roger his hand tightening on rosalind's as he spoke ah monsieur a poor name he is called like me gustav callot the poor valet was thunderstruck by the sensation which his simple words caused surely the english gentlemen and ladies are beautiful listeners no one ever paid him so much attention in his own country the american mayor took up the examination i reckon drawled he that young man did not go by the name of armstrong when you knew him ah no he has many names my good kind friend it was monsieur rogers when we knew his finest ah he act the comedy beautiful then when to came to cherish the pauvre pere in paris and mourn with him the death of la petite francoise he call himself by our poor name ah gentlemen he was good to us all he save at l'hotel soult' he share with us and apres from the sea he even send us pay what was his ship do you remember shall i forget he told us it had but one eye and called itself cyclops' ah mes amis continued gustav delighted with his audience and amazed at his own oratorical gifts he was much changed when i saw him next 'tis six seven eight years since the beard is all shorn the curl is cut off the eye looks through a glass and the laugh helas gentlemen the gay laugh of the boy rogers is turned to the knit brow of the great man armstrong the company had had enough of elocution for one evening and dismissed the orator with flattering marks of consideration the doctor and the vicar rose to go close friends of the family as they were even they were superfluous at a time like this but the american mayor remained i guess said he my nephew oh cried jill then you are his uncle dear dear mr headland and the little maid flung herself into the astonished gentleman's arms and relieved her emotions with a flood of tears seems to me said he looking down and kindly patting the fair head my nephew's a hundred miles too far away at this minute american mayors are not as a rule endowed with gifts of prophecy but it seemed as if there was an exception to the rule in the case of mr headland for a moment later the door opened and the tutor eye glass erect and blissfully unconscious of the interest which his entry excited strolled jauntily in ah said he you're still up then i just caught the last he stopped short and the glass dropped abruptly from his eye roger had staggered to his feet and was standing with face aglow stretching out his hand the tutor comprehended all he advanced and placed his arm in that of his brother you have found him at last then old fellow yes and without your help the end
