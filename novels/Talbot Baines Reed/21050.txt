the master of the shell by talbot baines reed i did find the start of this book to be rather annoying for it can never have been realistic that a school would advertise for a formmaster and housemaster even in those days it would have been absolutely normal that a housemaster would undergo a long period as a junior master before even being asked to take a house at some time in the future this would be something like five years on the staff and then a further ten years before actually taking charge of a house as for being master of the shell again there would be a period of probation while a young man was learning the ropes about teaching before he would become head of a block such as shell in my school there was a shell but it was rather a side alley rather than the broad avenue leading to the sixth form it was usual for the head of a block to be a man who had done his fifteen years as a house master and who had therefore been on the staff for thirty years or more one last point about appointing a young master to a school he would be expected to play a full part in sport or other outdoor activities our hero had indeed been an oxford blue and he could have got a job on the basis of this and his academic record but he would never have been accepted if he mentioned that he was planning soon to marry for the school needed him heart and soul as a bachelor for at least five years on the other hand it was quite desirable that he should marry before becoming a house master though on the whole the most excellent house masters are the unmarried ones it takes quite a few chapters to get past the welter of nineteenth century schoolboy slang before we get to any decisive fresh action there was another housemaster who was an exceedingly nasty man some of the boys lay a trap for him catch him tie him up with a rope and leave him for the night in the boot box after which none of the boys will admit to this misdemeanour by chance the hero mr railsford finds out who did it but under circumstances which make it impossible for him to tell anyone the nasty man tries to pin the deed on him and it comes to the point where he has to resign rather than tell luckily he is saved at the very last moment so late that his cab has arrived to take him to the station when all is revealed it is the nasty man that has to resign we are left to presume that the school continued harmoniously for many a year with railsford still a house master and master of the shell nh the master of the shell by talbot baines reed chapter one twice accepted the reader is requested kindly to glance through the following batch of letters which oddly enough are all dated september th number william grover ma grandcourt school to mark railsford ma lucerne grandcourt september th dear railsfordi suppose this will catch you at lucerne on your way back to england i was sorry to hear you had been seedy before you left london your trip is sure to have done you good and if you only fell in with pleasant people i expect you will have enjoyed yourself considerably what are you going to do when you get homestill follow the profession of a gentleman at large or what term opened here again last week and the sixth came back today im getting more reconciled to the place by this time indeed there is no work i like better than teaching and if i was as certain it was as good for the boys as it is congenial to me i should be perfectly contented my fellowmasters with an exception or two are good fellows and let me alone the exceptions are harder to get on with as for the boys i have a really nice lot in my house one or two rowdies who give me some bother and one or two cads with whom i am at war but the rest are a festive jovial crew who tolerate their master when he lets them have their own way and growl when he doesnt who work when they are so disposed and drop idle with the least provocation who lead me many a weary dance through the lobbies after the gas is out and now and then come and make themselves agreeable in my rooms when i invite them i fancied when i came here i should get lots of time to myselfenough perhaps to write my book on comparative political economy vain hope i havent time to turn round if my days were twentysix hours i should scarcely then do all i ought to do here ponsford is getting old and leaves the executive to his lieutenants he sits aloft like zeus hurls a thunderbolt now and then and for the rest acts as a supreme court of appeal bickers my opposite neighbour is still a thorn in my side i dont know how it is i try all i know but i cant get on with him and have given him up moss i believe who is master of the shell and head of a house has come to the end of his endurance and there is some talk of his throwing up his place here it would be a pity in many ways and it might be hard to get a good man in his place by the way if there is a vacancy why should not you enter the lists i see you smile at the idea of anyone exchanging the profession of gentleman at large for that of master of the shell but its worth a thought any how let us know where and how you are and if you can run down this way for a sunday do and make glad the heart of your friend w grover no arthur herapath esquire lucerne to sir digby oakshott baronet grandcourt dear digheres a game the govs been and lost a lot of the luggage and ma wont go

holiday i am longing to get home travelling abroad is all very nice but one gets tired of it i feel i shall like to settle down in town once more poor papa has had so much trouble with the boxes and must have spent pounds in telegrams it was really arthurs fault he sent the porter who was booking the luggage for us to get him some chocolate from the buffet and the consequence was the train went off before all the boxes were put in the van dear milly never travel abroad with your young brother i have been quite lazy about sketching the last few days i cant tell you how lovely some of the sunsets have been it is the regular thing to sit out in the hotel grounds and watch them i wish so often you could be here to share my pleasure for papa and mamma are afraid to sit out and arthur is so unpoetical there are a great many americans here the fashion of short steeves seems quite to be coming in again i shall have to get mine altered as soon as i come home some of our party went up the rigi today the view from the top was beautiful but the place is spoiled by the crowds of people who go up i so much prefer the quieter excursions i must go to bed now dearest milly it will be lovely to see you soon when one is away from home one feels more than ever how nice it would be to have ones friends always about one what a lot of ones ever your very loving friend daisy pswe met the thompsons at como did you know edith was to be married this autumn quite quietly in the country the walkleys are here and one or two other people we know arthur has struck up with a cambridge fellow named railsford whom we met on the saint gothard and who took so much trouble about the luggage it is so nice for arthur to have a companion dearest milly he mr was one of the party who went up the rigi today he speaks german so well and is so attentive to mamma dont be too horribly curious darling ill tell you everything when i get home he is so good and handsome number francis herapath esquire merchant to james blake esquire solicitor private and confidential dear blakebeing detained here owing to a miscarriage of some of our luggage i write this instead of waiting till i see you as it may be another week before we are home during our travels my daughter has become engaged to a mr mark railsford apparently a very desirable and respectable young man you will wonder why i trouble you about such a very domestic detail the young gentleman was very frank and straightforward in making his proposal and volunteered that if i desired to make any inquiries he was quite sure that you his late fathers solicitor would answer any questions i have no doubt from the readiness with which he invited the inquiry and his satisfaction in hearing that you and i were old friends that you will have nothing to say which will alter my favourable impression still as my childs happiness is at stake i have no right to omit any opportunity of satisfying myself anything you may have to say i shall value and treat as confidential i understand mr r under his fathers will has a small property but of course it will be necessary for him now to find some occupation which with his abilities i have no doubt he will easily do as usual the young people are in a hurry to know their fate so it will be a charity to them to reply as soon as convenient excuse the trouble i am giving you and with kind regards to mrs b and your sister believe me yours faithfully fras herapath number mark railsford to william grover grandcourt lucerne september th dear groveryou have often in your lighter moods laughed at the humble individual who addresses you laugh once again the fact is i am engaged i can fancy i see you reeling under this blow i have been reeling under it for thirtysix hours its partly your fault coming over the saint gothard a week ago i fell in with a family party herapath by name father mother boy and girl they had come part of the way by train and were driving over the top the boy and i walked and i discovered he was at grandcourt and of course knew you though hes not in your house but mosss thats how you come to be mixed up in it during the last hour or so miss h walked with us and before we reached the devils bridge my fate was sealed the ladies were in great distress about some lost luggagelost by the kind offices of the boyand i went back to como to look for it it lost me two days and i never found it however i found the brightest pair of blue eyes when i got back i will draw you no portraits you old scoffer but i challenge you to produce out of your own imagination anything to match it i dont mind confessing to you that i feel half dazed by it all at present and have to kick myself pretty often to make sure it is not a dream the father whom i bearded yesterday nods his head and will say yes as soon as hes looked into my credentials meanwhile i am tolerated and dread nothing except the premature turning up of the lost luggage but to be practical for once in my life amongst much that is delightfully vague and dreamy one thing stands out very clear in my own mind at present i must do something my loafing days are over the profession of a gentleman at large with which you twit me i hereby renounce she will back me up in any honest workshe says so ive confessed the way i wasted the last three years she said she is glad she did not know me then oh my william it is all very well for you to scoff im not ashamed to tell you what it is that has brought me to my senses dont scoff but help a lame dog over a stile my object in life is to have an object in life at present give me your counsel and deserve the benediction of someone besides your friend mr the patient reader must infer what he can from these five letters they are copied word for word from the original documents and speak for themselves i am unable to say whether the luggage was foundwhether miss daisy got her sleeves altered to her likingwhether arthur found any fun left on his arrival a fortnight late at grandcourt or how soon mr blakes reply to the fathers letter reached lucerne all these momentous questions the reader can settle for himself as well as i can for him he will at any rate be able to understand that when one day in october a telegram reached railsford from grandcourt with the brief announcementvacancy here see advertisement athenaeum am writingit created no small stir in the manly breast of the worthy to whom it was directed he went at once to westbourne park and held a cabinet council with his chief adviser and again on returning home called his sisters into consultation he wrote to his college tutor drew up a most elegant letter to the governors read a few chapters of tom browns schooldays and then waited impatiently for grovers promised letter you will have guessed said that letter when it arrived from my telegram that moss has resigned and that there will be a vacancy for a housemaster and master of the shell here at christmas you know how i would like to see you appointed but but what inquired someone who read the letter over the readers shoulder i should not be your friend if i represented this place as a bed of roses especially mosss house youll have hard work to hold your own with the boys and harder still with some of the masters you will get more criticism than backingup from headquarters still it is a splendid opening for a man of courage like you and all the school would profit by your success talk to podmore about it hell give you good advice so will weston of course i can do nothing at all but look on sympathetically and if you try for the place and succeed promise you at least one hearty welcome it seems pretty clear it wont be childs play said railsford folding up the letter it would not suit you if it was replied his adviser this brave speech went far to make up railsfords mind in the house at westbourne park particularly the career opening before our hero was hailed with eager enthusiasm dear arthur was in mosss house and at christmas he would get his remove to the shell in both capacities he would have the protecting interest of his prospective brotherinlaw spread like an aegis over his innocent head it really seems almost a providential arrangement said mrs herapath i am sure it will be a great thing for arthur said daisy it makes one believe theres some truth in the saying that every man has his niche waiting for him somewhere in life moralised mr herapath that evening a letter came from arthur to daisy the boy of course knew nothing of railsfords candidature such a flareup wrote the youth moss has got kicked out hes jacked it up and is going at christmas jolly good job he shouldnt have stopped the roast potatoes in the dormitories bickerss fellows have them they can do what they like dig and i did the two mile spin in but there was too much slush to put it on all i can say is i hope well get a fellow who is not a cad after moss especially as he will be master of the shell and ill get a dose of him both ways after christmas we mean not to let him get his head up like moss did were going to take it out of him at first and then hell cave in and let us do as we like afterwards dig and i will get a study after christmas i wish youd see about a carpet and get the gov to give us a picture or two and weve got to get a rigout of saucepans and kettles and a barometer and a canary and all that the rooms feet by so see the carpets the right size gedge says turkey carpets are the best so well have a turkey hows railsford are you and he spoons still dig and the fellows roared when i told them about catching you two that time at lucerne in the garden you know when i thought the window was being smashed could you lend me a bobs worth of stamps till christmas ill pay you back dig says he once had a cousin who went spoons on a chap he says it was an awful game to catch them at it so you see weve lots to sympathise about love to all i am yours truly arthur psdont forget the stamps two bobs worth will do as well daisy laughed and cried over this outrageous epistle and hesitated about showing it to mark however that happy youth only laughed and produced half a crown which he begged daisy to add to her own contribution thats the sort of young england i like said he it will be like a canter on a breezy moor to come in contact with fresh life and spirit like this after wasting my time here for three years i expect you will find it breezy said daisy recovering her smiles arthur is a dreadful boy it will be so good for him to have you at the end of a fortnight came a summons to railsford as one of six selected candidates to appear and show himself to the governors he had expected thus much of success but the thought of the other five rendered him uncomfortable as he leaned back in the railway carriage and hardened himself for the ordeal before him grover had deemed it prudent not to display any particular interest in his arrival but he contrived to pay a flying visit to his hotel that evening theres only one fellow likely to run you closean oxford man first class in classics and a good runningman in his day i think when they see you theyll prefer you they will have the six up in alphabetical order so youll come last thats a mercy take a tip from me and dont seem too anxious for the place it doesnt pay and keep in with ponsford will he be there oh of course what sort of men are the governors very harmless theyll want to know your character and your creed and that sort of thing and will leave all the rest to ponsford next morning at railsford sat with his five fellowmartyrs in the anteroom of the governors hall at grandcourt they talked to one another these six unfortunates about the weather about the midland railway about the picture on the wall they watched one another as in obedience to the summons from within they disappeared one by one through the green baize door and emerged a quarter or half an hour later with tinged cheeks and taking up their hats vanished into the openair railsford was the only one left to witness the exit of the fifth candidate then the voice from within called come in mr railsford and he knew his turn was come it was less terrible than he expected half a score of middleaged gentlemen round a table some looking at him some reading his testimonials and one or two putting questions most of them indulgent to his embarrassment and even sharing it dr ponsford however massive stern with his shaggy eyebrows and pursed mouth was above any such weakness what have you been doing since you left college demanded he presently fixing the candidate with his eyes it was a home question railsford answered it honestly if hesitatingly i was unfortunately not under the necessity of working he added after going through the catalogue of his abortive studies that is not for my livelihood some of the governors nodded their heads a little as though they recognised the misfortune of such a position and what places you under that necessity now i do not expect to remain a bachelor always sir here a governor chuckled ha ha hymen comes to the rescue wonderful the revolutions he makes in young fellows lives the governor had left school fiftyfive years ago and was rather proud to have remembered who hymen was the doctor waited with chilling patience till the interruption was over you feel yourself competent to take charge of a house of forty to fifty boys do you as well as to conduct a class of seventy i have thought over the matter and tried to realise the duties and think i can succeed quite right i like that no brag said another of the governors in an aside your temper is good is it you are not likely to fall out with your fellowmasters are you yes thats important interjected a governor i believe i am goodtempered and patient well mr railsford you may retire if you are not busy elsewhere you can remain a short time in the outer room railsford retired and for an interminable halfhour kicked his heels in the antechamber he got to hate the picture on the wall and the ruthless ticking of the clock in the hall outside presently the door opened and his name was called this time the spokesman was the chairman of the governors we have been through your testimonials a second time mr railsford and are satisfied with them both those which refer to your scholarship and those which relate to your character and other qualifications we are also glad to know from you that you have fully considered the responsibilities of this very important post and are prepared to enter upon them in a firm yet conciliatory spirit the governors and head master agree with me in considering that taken as a whole your qualifications are higher than those of the other candidates and they therefore have agreed to appoint you to the vacant post i trust it may result in our mutual satisfaction and the good of the school chapter two veni vidi if a light heart and faith in ones own good luck are omens of success mark railsford undoubtedly entered on his new duties at grandcourt under the most favourable of auspices it would not have been to his discredit if his light heart had acknowledged even slightly the weight of the responsibility it was undertaking but as a matter of fact it was all the lighter for that very responsibility the greater the task he argued the greater the achievement and the greater the achievement the greater the triumph a less sanguine hero might have been daunted by the pictures with which his nervous friends did their best to damp his ardour grover delighted as he was at the success of his friends application took care to keep the rocks ahead well above the surface in all his letters and conversations railsford laughed him pleasantly to scorn grovers was not the only attempt made to intimidate our hero a week or so before he entered upon his duties a nervouslooking man called to see him it was mr moss the late master i hear you have been appointed to my house he said by way of explanation and i thought it would be only friendly to call and tell you the sort of thing you are to expect when you go there thanks very much said railsford with a smile of the corner of his mouth you may be made of cast iron or be possessed of the patience of a job began this cheery adviser if so youre all right i wasnt either did you find the boys unmanageable nonot more than other boysall boys of course are the sworn foes of law and order and nobody imagines anything else no your difficulties if you have anything like my luck will be more with your colleagues than your subjects and how do they make themselves objectionable asked the new master rather contemptuously mr moss did not miss the tone of this question and fired up himself of course if you dont mind being systematically snubbed at head quartersthwarted and slandered by your fellowmastersbaulked in every attempt to improve the condition either of your house or the schooland misrepresented and undermined in your influence among your boys you may go up and enjoy it i didnt thats why i left at any rate i have one friend among the mastersgrover oh poor grover he is the only master who can get on at all and he does so by effacing himself on every possible occasion and agreeing with everybody not a very noble character to hear of ones friend said railsford who was beginning to get tired of this jeremiad i dont blame him he can stand more than you or i can that i suppose is meant for a compliment to me said railsford laughing you think then i would be wise to back out before it is too late i dont say that only only you pity me thanks very much that evening railsford sent a line to grover tell me in two words why moss left grandcourt a telegram came next morning incompatibility of temper whereat the new master chuckled and dismissed the lugubrious exmaster and his friendly warnings from his mind but although the gloomy prognostications of his jobs comforters failed in the least to depress his spirits one very small cloud hovered occasionally on the horizon this was the attitude of his worthy and respected prospective pupil and brotherinlaw arthur herapath that young gentleman who had been prudently kept in the dark while term lasted was as may be imagined considerably astounded on arriving home to be met with the news that the new master of the shell at grandcourt was to be mark railsford what a lark he exclaimed now genial as the remark was the tone in which it was uttered was not calculated to inspire confidence in the breasts of those to whom it was addressed there was more of enjoyment in it than respect yet boys will be boys and who can gauge the depths of a nature below the smiles that ripple on the surface it was little incidents like these which occasionally suggested to railsford far more forcibly than the lugubrious warnings of his officious friends that the task before him at grandcourt would tax his powers considerably but on the whole he rejoiced that all would not be plainsailing at first and that there was no chance of his relapsing immediately into the condition of a humdrum pedagogue the christmas holidays slipped away only too fast for arthur and for daisy mark much as he felt the approaching separation from his betrothed could not suppress a slight feeling of exultation as the day drew near when he was to go see and conquer at grandcourt his three idle years made the prospect of hard work now welcome and the importance which everyone else attached to his new duties made him doubly keen for a fray on which so many eyes were turned dr ponsford had suggested in terms which amounted to a mandate that the new master might find it convenient to arrive at grandcourt a day before the school returned in order to take possession of his quarters and acquaint himself with the details of his coming duties this arrangement was not altogether satisfactory for it deprived mark of the pleasure of his future brotherinlaws escort which was a great loss and also of the prospect of finding grover at his journeys end on which he had reckoned with some confidence however it was only the difference of a day and during that day he would at least do his utmost to make a favourable impression on his chief so with a heart full of confidence and a cab full of luggage he set out gaily on his new career goodbye mark youll be good to my son i know said mrs herapath goodbye my boy take care of your health said mr herapath goodbye mark said daisy tata old man called arthur see you tomorrow this last greeting strange as it may seem recurred to railsfords memory more frequently than any of the others during the course of the long railway journey to grandcourt it took all sorts of forms as the day wore on at first it seemed only a fraternal au revoir then it became a rather serious promise and finally sounded in his ears rather like a menace here was he going down like a prince to his coronation and his subjects would see him tomorrow it had never occurred to him before that these subjects might have something to say to the ordering of the new kingdom and that he should have to reckon with them as well as they with him the idea was not altogether comfortable and he tried to shelve it of course he would get on with them they would look up to him and they would discover that his interests and theirs were the same he was prepared to go some way to meet them it would be odd if they would not come the rest to meet him he turned his mind to other subjects still he wished he could be quite sure that arthurs innocent see you again tomorrow had no double meaning for him the railway took him as far as blankington junction about five miles from grandcourt and as it would be some time before a grandcourt train came up he decided after seeing his effects into a cab to take advantage of the fine frosty afternoon and complete his journey on foot he was in fact beginning to grow a little depressed and the exercise would brace him up he had foolishly enough looked forward to a somewhat different kind of advent dropping perhaps with some little eclat on a school where arthur had already proclaimed his fame among the boys and where grover had prepared him a welcome among the masters compared with that this solitary backstairs arrival seemed tame and dispiriting and he half regretted that he had not postponed his coming till tomorrow even in the face of dr ponsfords suggestion a mile from grandcourt he caught sight of the square red ivycovered brick tower of the school among the trees even in winter it looked warm and picturesque it was growing dark when he passed the lodge and crossed the playingfield towards the schoolhouse the cabman was awaiting him in the square never gave me your name explained he and nobody knows nothink about you here five miles is sevenandsix and luggage is two bob more and waiting another alfhours a crownnamely twelve shillings and thank you mister railsford rang the bell at the porters lodge a small child of eight appeared wheres your father asked the new master yout replied the girl well your mother please shesshes in the churchyard along of my aunt sally well run and you mean shes dea the child nodded before he had finished his sentence is there anyone about inquired the perplexed newcomer theres mrs astings doing the floors in bickerss mrs hastings was duly summoned and arrived with her broom and kneelingpad my good woman can you tell me the fare from blankington here the lady looked perplexed then embarrassed then angry and you fetched me over from bickerssme with my lame foot over the cobblesto ask me that you oughter be ashamed of yerself young man ask the cabman he knows it was hopeless railsford assisted to unload the cab and meekly gave the cabman the fare demanded i am mr railsford the new master said he presently overtaking mrs hastings as she hobbled back in dudgeon to her work which are my rooms im sure i dont know youre a day too early all the rooms is up and it will take us all our times to get them done against the school comes back tomorrow it is an extraordinary thing said railsford who began to feel his dignity somewhat put upon that dr ponsford should tell me to come to day and that no preparations taint got to do with me youd best go to the doctors house out of that gate across the little square the house on the far side of the chapel railsford leaving his luggage stacked on the pavement outside the porters lodge started off with flushed cheeks to the lions den the doctor said the maid was in but was at dinner the gentleman had better call again in half an hour so railsford in the closing twilight took a savage walk round the school precincts in no mood to admire the natural beauties of the place or to indulge in any rhapsodies at this near view of the scene of his coming triumphs in half an hour he returned and was shown into the doctors study how do you do mr here the doctor took up his visitors card to refresh his memorymr railsford i was afraid sir said mark i had mistaken your letter about coming today there appears to be no oneno one who cani have been unable to ascertain where i am to go the doctor waited patiently for the end of this lucid explanation i rather wonder it did not suggest itself to you to call on me for information railsford wondered so too and felt rather sheepish your train must have been late i expected you an hour ago i think we were up to time i walked from blankington here reallyi wish i had known of your intention i trust said railsford struck by a horrible suspicion you were not waiting dinner for me not in the least said the doctor with a grim smile but i had calculated on taking you round before nightfall we must defer our visit till the morning talking of dinner he added you will be ready for something after your journey will you not as railsford was nearly famishing he could only colour up and reply thank you the doctor rang the bell see that mr railsford gets dinner i have to go out he added but you will no doubt make yourself at home and the great man withdrew leaving the new master in a very crestfallen and disturbed state of mind if this was a sample of the sympathy he might expect at headquarters mosss prognostications after all were not quite baseless he made the best of his solitary dinner and then sallied out in the dark to try to find the porters lodge once more and rescue his luggage that functionary was still absent and mark was compelled himself to haul his belongings in under cover and leave word with the little girl that they were to be taken over to mr railsfords rooms as soon as her father came in then taking with him a bag which contained what he wanted for the night he returned to the headmasters house and made a point of retiring to rest before his host reappeared on the scene once more luck was against him you vanished early last night said the doctor blandly at breakfast next morning i brought mr roe in to supper thinking you and he might like a chat about the work in the shell about which he could have given you some useful hints however early hours are very commendable i am extremely sorry faltered railsford i had no idea you would be home so early i should have liked to meet mr roe so much take some more coffee said the doctor after breakfast mark was conducted in state to his house the floors were all damp and the carpets up beds and washstands were piled up in the passages and nowhere was a fire to be seen there are your rooms said the doctor pointing out a suite of three apartments opening one into the other at the present time reeking of softsoap and absolutely destitute of furniture you will find them comfortable and central the inner room is the bedroom the middle your private sittingroom and this larger one the houseparlour now we will go to the dormitories and studies you understand your head boys those in the sixth and fifthhave a study to themselves the shell have studies in pairs and the junior schoolwork in the common room but all these points you will make yourself familiar with very shortly as a housemaster you will of course be responsible for everything that takes place in the housethe morals work and play of the boys are under your supervision you have four sixthform boys in the house who are prefects under you and in certain matters exercise an authority of their own without appeal to you but you quite understand that you must watch that this is not abused the house dame mrs farthing superintends everything connected with the boys wardrobes but is under your direction in other matters i shall introduce you to her as we go down i refer you to the school timetable for particulars as to rising chapel preparation and lights out and so forth discipline on all these points is essential cases of difficulty may be referred to a session of the other masters or in extreme cases to me but please remember i do not invite consultation in matters of detail a house master may use the cane in special cases which must be reported through the masters session to me so much for your house duties as master of the shell you preside at morning school there every day and as you know have to teach classics english and divinity in the afternoon the boys are taken by the french mathematical and chemical masters but you are nominally responsible for the whole and any case of insubordination or idleness during afternoon school will be reported to you by the master in charge and you must deal with it as though you had been in charge at the time now come and make mrs farthings acquaintance mrs farthing a lean wrathfullooking personage stood in the midst of a wilderness of sheets and blankets and received her new superior with a very bad grace she looked him up and looked him down and then sniffed very good mr railsford we shall become better acquainted ive no doubt railsford shuddered at the prospect and finding that his luggage was still knocking about at the porters lodge he made further expedition in search of it and at last with superhuman efforts succeeded in getting it transferred to his quarters greatly to the disgust of mrs hastings who remarked in an audible aside to her fellowscrubber mrs willis that people ought to keep their dirty traps to themselves till the place is ready for them after which railsford deemed it prudent to take openair exercise and await patiently the hour when his carpets should be laid and grandcourt should wake up into life for the new term chapter three opening day the combined labours of mesdames farthing hastings wilson and their myrmidons had barely reached a successful climax that afternoon in the rescue of order out of the chaos which had reigned in railsfords house when the first contingent of the grandcourtiers arrived in the great square railsford who had at last been permitted to take possession of his rooms and to unstrap his boxes looked down from his window with some little curiosity at the scene below the solemn quadrangle which an hour ago had looked so ghostly and dreary was now alive with a crowd of boys descending headlong from the inside and outside of four big omnibuses hailing one another boisterously scrambling for their luggage scrimmaging for the possession of mrs farthings or the porters services indulging in horseplay with the drivers singing hooting challenging rejoicing stamping running jumping kickinganything in fact but standing still in their own opinion evidently they were the lords and masters of grandcourt they strutted about with the airs of proprietors and railsford began to grow half uneasy lest any of them should detect him at the window and demand what right he had there the scene grew more and more lively a new cavalcade discharged its contents on the heels of the first and upon them came cabs topheavy with luggage and a stampede of pedestrians who had quitted the omnibuses a mile from home and run in and one or two on tricycles and one hero in great state on horseback cheers sometimes yells greeted each arrival and when presently there lumbered up some staid old four wheeler with a luckless new boy on board the demonstration became most imposing see you tomorrow thought railsford to himself as he peered down suddenly an unwonted excitement manifested itself this was occasioned by an impromptu race between two omnibuses and a hansom cab which having been all temporarily deserted by their rightful jehus had been boarded by three amateur charioteers and set in motion the hero in charge of the hansom cab generously gave his more heavilyweighted competitors a start of fifty yards and standing up in his perch shook his reins defiantly and smacked his whip to the infinite delight of everyone but the licenced gentleman who was the nominal proprietor of the vehicle of the omnibuses one got speedily into difficulties owing to the charioteer getting the reins a trifle mixed and thereby spinning his vehicle round in a semicircle and bringing it up finally in the middle of the lawn where he abruptly vacated his post and retired into private life the other omnibuses had a more glorious career the horses were spirited and entered into the fun of the thing almost as much as their driver railsford long remembered the picture which this youthful hero presented with his face flushed his head bare his sandy hair waving in the breeze his body laid back at an obtuse angle as he tugged with both hands at the reins the cab behind came on apace its jaunty jehu flourishing his whip and shouting loudly to his opponent to keep his right side the crowd forgot everything else and flocked across the grass with loud cheers for the champions wire in hansom shouted some stick to it dig cried others how the mad career might have ended no one could tell but at each corner the cab closed in ominously with its clumsy competitor whose horses were fast getting beyond the control of their driver while the vehicle they were dragging rocked and yawed behind them like a tug in a gale railsford was meditating a descent on to the scene with a view to prevent a catastrophe if possible when a shout of laughter greeted the appearance on the scene of the lawful master of the omnibus in headlong pursuit of his property by an adroit cut across the grass this outraged gentleman succeeded in overtaking the vehicle and boarding it by the step behind and then amid delighted shouts of whip behind dig the spectators watched the owner skip up the steps and along the top just as dig having received timely warning of his peril dropped the reins and skipped the contrary way along the top and down the back stairs depositing himself neatly on terra firma where with admirable sangfroid he joined the spectators and triumphed in the final pulling up of the omnibus and the consequent abandonment of the race by the indignant hero of the hansom cab who protested in mock heroics that he was winning hand over hand and would have licked the bus to fits if dig hadnt funked it in the altercation which ensued the company generally took no part and returned braced up and fortified by their few minutes sport to the serious business of identifying and extricating their luggage from the general melee and conveying themselves and their belongings into winter quarters the new master was impressed by what he had seennot altogether unfavourably true it upset in a moment all his dreams of carrying grandcourt by the quiet magic of his own influence to the high level he had arranged for it still the race had been a pretty one while it lasted and both competitors had handled the ribbons well they would be the sort of boys to take to himan old varsity blue and he would meet them halfway railsfords house should get a name for pluck and esprit de corps and railsford and his boys should show the way to grandcourt how dr ponsford and the session of masters would follow their lead it did not at present enter into the head of the vain young man to settle a knock came at his door as he stood lost in these pleasing reflections and grover entered here you are then old man said hean old stager already it was a great disappointment i could not be here when you got down i wish you had i have had not exactly a gay time of it and he related his experiences grover laughed thats ponsford all over said he hes a fine fellow but a bear how do you like your quarters ive only just got into them and really havent had time to look round and to tell the truth for the last ten minutes or so ive been so interested in the scene below that i had forgotten what i was doing there was a most amusing chariot race between a cab and an omnibus grover looked serious i know said he im afraid there will be trouble about that its as well perhaps you are not expected to know the chief offenders one or two of them belong to your house railsford looked uncomfortable it had not occurred to him till now that the proceeding which had so moved his interest and amusement was a breach of discipline i hope i shall not be called upon to deal with it said he no i hear ponsford has the matter in hand himself and the friends went on to talk of other matters after a while grover hastened away to his own house leaving railsford somewhat uneasy in his mind if dr ponsford were to question him on the subject of the chariot race he felt that he would be seriously compromised at the outset of his career he knew at least the nickname of one of the delinquents and had actually by standing and watching the contest without protest been an accessory to the offence he busied himself forthwith in his unpacking and studiously avoided the window until daylight departed and the court below became silent and deserted just about four oclock another knock sounded at his door and arthur herapath presented himself leading by the arm the tawnyhaired hero of the chariot race what cheer marky cried the brotherinlaw to be here we are had a spiffing spin up from the station hadnt we dig this it dig you know sir digby oakshott baronet mp ass and nobody knows what else he and i have bagged sykes old room just over here railsford in his shirtsleeves and hemmed round by his luggage looked up rather blankly at this friendly oration however his dignity came to his rescue how are you both i hope were to have a good steady term my boys go to your study nowlater on we must have a talk arthur looked at his friend and winked sir digby was visibly agitated and grinned vehemently at a cobweb in the corner of the ceiling all serene said the former by the way daisy was all right when i left her and sent her love and a do you hear me arthur go to your study oh all rightbut there was a message from the gov i was to be sure and give you directly i saw you he says i can have a bob a week pocketmoney and youre to give it to me and hell owe it to you at the end of the term id like the first now please go immediately to your room shouted railsford as near to losing his temper as his future brotherinlaw had ever seen him how dare you disobey me well but it was a message from the gov andi say dig added he turning to his friend with a nudge you cut when mark tells you dig departed and railsford weakly fell in with the arrangement of the junior and allowed him to remain and deliver the rest of his domestic messages now look here arthur said the master closing the door and facing his unabashed future kinsman we must come to an understanding at once during term time i forbid you to mention daisys name either to me or anybody else unless i wish it the boy whistled what have you had a row then is it all broken off my eye what will rubbish said mark scarcely able to keep grave its neither one nor the other but i dont choose you should talk of her and i insist on being obeyed jolly rough not to be able to talk about ones own sister interposed the innocent of course i mean not in connection with me said railsford and another thing you must not call me mark but mr railsford while term lasts all serene mr railsford old man jolly stiff though between brothers isnt it you must treat me as if i were merely your master and no other relative how queer maynt i even be fond of you yes as your master i count on you mind to set a specially good example to the other boys and back me up in every way you can you will be able to do a great deal if you only try im game am i to be made a prefect i say markmr railsford i mean and remember said mark ignoring the question that we are here to work and not toto drive omnibuses arthur brightened up suddenly you saw the race then stunning spurt round the last lap only dig hadnt any stay in him and the cab had the inside berth i say dont let anybody know it was dig will you hed get in rather a mess and hes going to put it on hard this term to make up could anything be more hopeless than the task of impressing this simple minded youth with a sense of his duty and deportment towards the new master of the shell railsford gave the attempt up and the schoolbell happily intervened to make a diversion thats for dinner its generally at two you know but on opening day its said the boy we shall have to cut or we shall be gated i say well you must show me the way said mark im ready youll have to wear your cap and gown though replied arthur or youll get in a row railsford hastened to rectify the omission and next moment was standing in the great square beside his lively young pilot amid a crowd of boys hastening towards the school hall wed better do a trot said the boy we shall do it all right i think said the master whose dignity revolted against any motion more rapid than quick walking arthur trotting at his side and encouraging him from time to time to put it on detracted a little from the solemnity of the procession the bell was just ceasing to ring as they entered the hall and for the first time railsford found himself in the presence of the assembled school arthur had darted off to his own table leaving his companion to find his way to the masters table at the head of the hall where all his colleagues were already in their places standing for grace railsford considerably flurried slipped into the place which grover had reserved for him just as the head boy present began to recite the latin collect and became painfully aware that his already damaged character for punctuality was by no means enhanced in the severe eyes of dr ponsford the new master glanced round a little nervously at his colleagues grover introduced him to a few of the nearest some of whom received him with a friendly greeting others eyed him doubtfully and one or two bristled up grimly the eclat of his first appearance at grandcourt had paled somewhat and he was thankful to have grover to talk to and keep him in countenance tell me who some of these men are he whispered which is roe on the other side of me he has the house next to mine you i roe and bickers have the four sides of the big square which is bickers the man with the black beardlast but one on the other side railsford gave a furtive look down the table and encountered the eyes of mr bickers fixed discontentedly on him a lightning flash at midnight will often reveal minute details of a scene or landscape which in the ordinary glare of day might pass unnoticed by the observer so it was in this sudden chance encounter of glances it lasted not a moment but it was a declaration of war to the knife on one side hurled back defiantly on the other not a bad fellow if you dont stroke him the wrong way said grover oh said railsford in a tone which made his friend start who is beyond him lablache the french master not very popular i fancy and so on one master after another was pointed out and railsford formed his own opinions of each and began to feel at home with several of them already but whenever his eyes turned towards the end of the table they invariably encountered those of bickers there was not much general conversation at the masters table dr ponsford rarely encouraged it and resented it when it arose without his initiative the buzz and clatter at the boys tables however growing occasionally to a hubbub amply made up for any sombreness in the meal elsewhere and railsford having exhausted his inquiries and having failed to engage one of his neighbours in conversation resigned himself to the enjoyment of the animated scene he was not long in discovering the whereabouts of his youthful kinsman whose beaming face shone out from the midst of a bevy of particular friends while ever and again above the turmoil like a banner in the breeze waved the tawny mane of sir digby oakshott it amused railsford to watch the group and when now and then they looked his way to speculate on what was the subject of their conversation perhaps arthur had been telling them of the new masters athletic achievements at cambridge and how he had rowed his boat to the head of the river or possibly he had been describing to them some of the big footballmatches which he mark had taken his young friend to see during the holidays or maybe they were laying down some patriotic plan for the future good of railsfords house his heart warmed to the boys as he watched them it was a pity perhaps he could not catch their actual words seems jolly green said dig so he is blushes like a turkeycock when you talk about spoons never mind hes bound to be civil to us this term eh dig weve got the whip hand of him i guess over that summerhouse business at lucerne here dig laughed shut up hell hear whats the joke demanded a bulletheaded blackeyed boy who sat near what didnt i tell you dimsdale keep it close wont you you see that chap with the eyeglass next to grover thats railsford our new mastermarky i call him hes engaged to daisy you know my sister regular soupladles they are here dig once more laughed beyond the bounds of discretion what an ass you are dig expostulated arthur youll get us in no end of a mess awfully sorryi cant help tell dimsdale aboutyou know dont go spreading it though said arthur shutting his eyes to the fact that he was confiding his secret to the greatest gossip in grandcourt and that one or two other heads were also craned forward to hear the joke i caught them going it like one oclock in the hotel garden at lucerneit was the first time i twigged what was up and what do you think he called my sister what they all demanded keep it close i say ha hagive you a guess all round dig knows pussy cat suggested one jumbo suggested another cherubim suggested a third arthur shook his head triumphantly out of it all of you you can tell em dig dig composed his features once or twice to utter the word but as many times broke down at last in high falsetto he got it out chuckey the laugh which greeted this revelation penetrated to the upper region and caused dr ponsford to rise on his seat and look in the direction of the uproar at the same moment the sixthform boy at the head of the table left his place and bore down on the offenders cave muttered arthur purple in the face heres ainger instantly the party was thoroughly buried in its bread and cheese was that you oakshott making that row i was only saying something to herapath replied the innocent im sure i didnt make a row dont tell falsehoods do fifty lines and next time youll be sent up thats a nice lark muttered the baronet as the senior retired it was you chaps made the row and i get potted for it but i say added he as if such a mishap were the most common of incidents that isnt a bad joke is it fancy calling herapaths sister cave shut up exclaimed arthur dealing his friend a ferocious kick under the table theyve got their eyes on us dont play the fool dig railsford was aroused from the pleasant contemplation of this little comedy by a general rising in the midst of which the doctor followed by his staff filed out of the hall into the governors room adjoining which was ordinarily used as a masters withdrawingroom here railsford underwent the ordeal of a series of introductions some of which gave him pleasure some disappointment some misgivings and one at least roused his anger mr bickers said dr ponsford let me introduce mr railsford you will be neighbours and ought to be friends i am proud to know mr railsford said mr bickers holding out his hand grandcourt i am sure is fortunate railsford flushed up at the tone in which this greeting was offered and touching the proffered hand hurriedly said with more point than prudence i heard of mr bickers from my predecessor mr moss it was some satisfaction to see mr bickers flush in his turn as he replied with a hardly concealed sneer ah poor moss he was a great flatterer you must not believe half he says about his absent friends railsford said grover taking his friend by the arm and anxious to interrupt what promised to be an uncomfortable dialogue i must introduce you to roe he had charge of the shell for some years and can give you some hints which will be useful to you youll like him railsford did like him mr roe was one of the best masters at grandcourt and his university career had been as brilliant in athletics and more brilliant in scholarship than his younger colleagues he had a quiet voice and manly bearing which bespoke a vast fund of power latent beneath the surface and railsford for once in his life experienced the novel sensation of standing in the presence of a superior mr roe accepted marks apologies for his nonappearance the evening before with great goodhumour and invited him to his rooms to spend an evening and talk over schoolwork you are not likely to have much leisure at first i wish you had a quieter house but a little good government and sympathy will go a long way towards bringing it up to the mark as to the shell you will find that pretty easy it wants more management than teachingat least i found so if once the boys can be put on the right track they will go pretty much of their own accord its easier to guide them than drive them dont you think so i have no experience yet but that is my idea certainly then youll succeed have you been introduced to monsieur lablache this is mr railsford the new master of the shell monsieur monsieur shrugged himself ceremoniously he had a big moustache which curled up in an enigmatical way when he smiled and railsford was at a loss whether to like him or dislike him we shall be friends meester railsford i hope said the foreigner i have much to do wiz ze young gentlemen of the sell helas they try my patience but i like them meester railsford i like them i only wish i knew whether i liked you inwardly ejaculated the new master as he smiled in response to the confession a bell put an end to further conference and mark went off in a somewhat excited state of mind to his own house mr roes few words stuck in his mindespecially one of them what did he mean by classing sympathy and good government together in the way he had how can you reduce a disorderly house to order by sympathy however he had no leisure for guessing riddles that night chapter four a friendly chat if mark railsford had been left with no better guide to his new duties and responsibilities than the few hurried utterances given by dr ponsford during their tour through the premises that morning his progress would have been very slow and unsatisfactory it was part of the doctors method never to do for anyone colleague or boy what they could possibly do for themselves he believed in piling up difficulties at the beginning of an enterprise instead of making smooth the start and saving up the hard things for later on if a master of his got through his first term well he would be pretty sure to turn out well in future but meanwhile he got as little help from headquarters as possible and had to make all his discoveries arrange his own methods reap his own experiences for himself grover had good reason to know the doctors peculiarity in this respect and took care to give his friend a few hints about starting work which otherwise he might never have evolved out of his own consciousness amongst other things he advised that he should as soon as possible make the acquaintance of the head boys of his house and try to come to a good understanding with them as to the work and conduct of the term accordingly four polite notes were that evening handed by the house messenger to messrs ainger barnworth stafford and felgate requesting the pleasure of their company at in the new masters rooms the messenger had an easy task for oddly enough he found the four gentlemen in question assembled in aingers study they were in fact discussing their new housemaster when his four little missives were placed in their hands whats the joke now mercury asked barnworth the messenger who certainly was not nicknamed mercury on account of the rapidity of his motions or the volatility of his spirits replied i dunno but i dont see why one letter shouldnt have done for the lot of yer hes flush with his writingpaper if he isnt with his pounds shillings and pence oh hes not tipped you then never mind im sure it wasnt your fault mercury in private turned this little sally over in his mind and came to the conclusion that mr barnworth was not yet a finished pupil in manners meanwhile the four letters were being opened and perused critically dear aingerone would think hed known me all my life said ainger i shall be so glad if you will look in at my rooms read barnworth he evidently wants my opinion on his wallpaper at for a few minutes chatnothing about tea and toast though said stafford believe me yours very truly m railsford so i do believe you my boy said felgate are you going you fellows must said ainger its a mandate and theres no time to get a doctors certificate what does he want to chat about i wonder said stafford the weather of course growled barnworth what else is there stafford coloured up as usual when anyone laughed at him he wants to get us to take the oath of allegiance you fellows said felgate will you walk into my parlour said the spider to the fly thats what he means i think wed better not go ainger laughed rather spitefully it strikes me hell find us four fairly tough flies i mean to go i want to see what hes like im not at all sure that i like him poor beggar murmured barnworth now my doubt is whether he likes me he ought to oughtnt he staff why yes replied that amiable youth he doesnt look as if he was very particular oh thanks awfully replied barnworth the amiable coloured up more than ever i really didnt mean that he said horrified at his unconscious joke i mean he doesnt seem strict or as if hed be hard to get on with i hope hes not said ainger with a frown we had enough of that with moss well said felgate if you are going i suppose i must come too only take my advice and dont promise him too much railsford meanwhile had transacted a good deal of business of a small kind on his own account he had quelled a small riot in the junior preparation room and intercepted one or two deserters in the act of quitting the house after hours he had also gone up to inspect the dormitories lavatories and other domestic offices and on his way down he had made glad the hearts of his coming kinsman and the baronet by a surprise visit in their study he found them actively unpacking a few home treasures including a small hamper full of ham a pistol some boxinggloves and a particularly fiendishlooking bulldog the last named luxury was the baronets contribution to the common store and having been forgotten for some hours in the bustle of arrival was now removed from his bandbox in a semicomatose state hullo said railsford whose arrival coincided with the unpacking of this natural history curiosity what have you got there oakshotts impulse on hearing this challenge had been to huddle his unhappy booty back into the bandbox but on second thoughts he set it down on the mat and gazing at it attentively so as not to commit himself to a too hasty opinion observed submissively that it was a dog it is melancholy to have to record failure in whatever sphere or form but truth compels us to state that at this particular moment mark railsford blundered grievously instead of deciding definitely there and then on his own authority whether dogs were or were not en regle in railsfords house he halted and hesitated thats against rules isnt it said he against rules said arthur crimson in the faceagainst rules why dig and i had one a year ago only he died poor beast he had a mill with a rat and the rat got on to his nose and punished him before yes said the master but i shall have to see whether its allowed to keep a dog meanwhile you must see he does not make a noise or become a nuisance all serene replied dig who had already almost come to regard the new master as a sort of brotherinlaw of his own hes a great protection against rats and thieves my mother gave him to medidnt she smiley smiley was at that moment lying on his back all of a heap with his limp legs lifted appealingly in the air and too much occupied in gasping to vouchsafe any corroboration of his young masters depositions railsford departed leaving the whole question in an unsettled condition and not altogether satisfied with himself he knew the moment he was outside the door what he ought to have said but that was very little consolation to him nor was it till he was back in his own room that he remembered he had not taken exception to the pistol of course having looked at it and said nothing its owner would assume that he did not disapprove of it and yet he really could not sit down and write dear groverplease say by bearer if pistols and bulldogs are allowed yours truly mr it looked too foolish of course when he saw them written down on paper he knew they were not allowed and yet it would be equally foolish now to go back to the study and say he had decided without inquiry that they were against rules he was still debating this knotty point when a knock at the door apprised him that his expected guests had arrived alas blunder number two trod hard on the heels of number one he had no tea or coffee not even a box of biscuits to take off the edge of the interview and offer a retreat for his own inevitable embarrassment and the possible shyness of his visitors the arrangements for that reception were as formal as the invitations had been was it much wonder if the conference turned out stiff and awkward in the first place as all four entered together and none of them were labelled he was quite at a loss to know their names and it is a chilling beginning to a friendly chat to have to inquire the names of your guests he shook hands rather nervously all round and then with an heroic effort at ease and freedom said singling out felgate for the experiment let me see you are ainger are you not it was a most unfortunate shot for nothing could have been less complimentary to the jealous and quicktempered captain of the house than to be mistaken for his selfconceited and unstable inferior with whom he was in the habit of congratulating himself he had little or nothing in common no sir said felgate omitting however to confess his own name or point out the lawful owner of the name of ainger the master tried to smile at his own dilemma and had the presence of mind not to plunge further into the quicksands which of you is ainger he inquired i am sir replied the captain haughtily thank you said mark and could have eaten the word and his tongue into the bargain the moment he had spoken this was blunder number three and the worst yet for so anxious was he to clear himself of the reproach of abasing himself before his head boys that his next inquiries were made brusquely and snappishly and barnworth i am sir and stafford i am sir and felgate i am sir that was all over the master smiled the boys looked grave wont you sit down said the former drawing his own chair up to the hearth and poking the fire ainger and felgate dropped into two seats and stafford after a short excursion to a distant corner deposited himself on another barnworththere being no more chairs in the roomsat as gracefully as he could on the corner of the table i thought it would be well began railsford still dallying with the pokerwont you bring your chair in nearer stafford stafford manoeuvred his chair in between ainger and felgate i thought it would not be a bad thinghavent you a chair barnworth dear me ill get one out of the bedroom and in his flurry he went off poker in hand to the cubicle what a day were having murmured barnworth stafford giggled just as railsford reentered it was awkward and gave the new master a very unfavourable impression of the most harmless boy in his house now said he beginning on a new tack i am anxious to hear from you something about the state of the house youre my police you know he added with a friendly smile stafford was the only one who smiled in response and then ensued a dead silence what do you think ainger do things seem pretty right yes said ainger laconically have you noticed anything barnworth theres a draught in the big dormitory sir replied barnworth seriously indeed we must have that seen to of course what i mean is as to the conduct of the boys and so on are the rules pretty generally obeyed it was staffords turn and his report was disconcerting too no sir not very much the new master put down the poker i am sorry to hear that for discipline must be maintained can you suggest anything to improve the state of the house no sir replied felgate this was getting intolerable the new masters patience was oozing away and his wits strange to say were coming in this is rather damping he said things seem pretty right theres a draught in the big dormitory the rules are not very much obeyed and nothing can be suggested to improve matters the four sat silentthe situation was quite as painful to them as to mark the latter grew desperate now said he raising his voice in a way which put up aingers back you four boys are in the sixth and i understand that the discipline of the house is pretty much in your hands i shall have to depend on you and if things go wrong of course i shall naturally hold you responsible ainger flushed up at this while stafford on whom the masters eyes were fixed vaguely nodded his head i am very anxious for the house to get a good name for order and workand added he i hope we shall be able to do something at sports too here at least the master expected he would meet with a response but ainger the boy chiefly interested in sports was sulking and barnworth who also was an athlete was too absorbed in speculating what remark was maturing itself in felgates mind to heed what was being said i suppose the house has an elevenfor instance yes generally said stafford felgate now came in with his remark something ought to be done to prevent our house being interfered with by mr bickers said he there are sure to be rows while that lasts oh said railsford who had heard rumours of this feud already how are we interfered with oh every way replied ainger but we neednt trouble you about that sir we can take care of ourselves but i should certainly wish to have any difficulty put right said the new master especially if it interferes with the discipline of the house it will never be right as long as mr bickers stays at grandcourt blurted stafford he has a spite against everyone of our fellows you forget you are talking of a colleague of mine stafford said railsford whom a sense of duty compelled to stand up even for a master whom he felt to be an enemy i cant suppose one master would willingly do anything to injure the house of another ainger smiled in a manner which offended railsford considerably i am sorry to find he said rather more severely that my head boys who ought to aim at the good of their house are parties to a feud which i am sure can do nobody any good i must say i had hoped better things ainger looked up quickly i am quite willing to resign the captaincy sir if you wish it by no means said railsford a little alarmed at the length to which his protest had carried him and becoming more conciliatory all i request is that you will do your best to heal the feud so that we may have no obstacle in the way of the order of our own house you may depend on me to cooperate in whatever tends in that direction and i look to you to take the lead in bringing the house up to the mark and keeping it there at this particular juncture further conference was entirely suspended by a most alarming and fiendish disturbance in the room above it was not an earthquake for the ground beneath them neither shook nor trembled it was not a dynamite explosion for the sounds were dull and prolonged it was not a chimneystack fallen for the room above was two storeys from the roof besides above the uproar rose now and then the shrill yapping of a dog and sometimes human voices mingled with the din railsford looked inquiringly at his prefects what is that he said some one in the room above sir replied barnworth it was sykes study last term added he consulting ainger whos got it this time nobody said anything to me about it said the housecaptain the room above this is occupied by herapath and oakshott interposed railsford the captain made an exclamation did they get your leave sir not exactly they told me they were going to have the study this term and i concluded it was all right is it not so they are shell boys and have no business on that floor all the shell boys keep on the second floor of course theyll say theyve got leave im afraid they will think so is there any other claimant to the study no not that i know of perhaps they had better remain for the present said the master but i cannot imagine what the noise is about will you see ainger as you go up this was a broad hint that the merry party was at an end and no one was particularly sorry wait a second in my room you fellows said ainger on the stairs while i go and shut up this row the mystery of this disorder was apparent as soon as he opened the door the double study measuring fifteen feet by nine was temporarily converted into a football field the tables and chairs were piled on one side in touch one goal was formed by the towelhorse the other drawn in chalk on the door the ball was a disused pothat of the baronets and the combatants were the two owners of the study versus their cronies and fellow shellfishtilbury of the second eleven and dimsdale the gossip there had been some very fine play on both sides and a maul in goal at the towelhorse end in which the dog had participated and been for a considerable period mistaken for the ball hinc illae lacrymae at the moment when ainger looked in herapaths side had scored goals against their adversaries the rules were strict rugby and nothing was wanted to complete the sport but an umpire the captain arrived in the nick of time offside dimwasnt he ainger thats a placekick for us hang the dog get out smiley go and keep goal see fair play wont you ainger to this impudent request ainger replied by impounding the ball stop this row he said peremptorily tilbury and dimsdale you get out of here and write fifty lines each for being off your floor after eight we only came to ask herapath what latin weve to do this term and theres no preparation for tomorrow well if this is your way of finding out about your latin you know just as much upstairs as down here be off and mind i have the lines before dinner tomorrow the two champions retired disconcerted leaving the captain to deal with the arch offenders first of all said he what business have you in this study oh railsford knows were here we told him and he didnt object dont you know you ought to come to the prefects about it oddly enough both the boys had completely forgotten besides explained dig as railsford and herapath are sort of brotherinlaws you know we thought it was all right the reason did not appear very obvious but the information was interesting oh thats it is it asked the captain what relation is he to you hes spoons on my sister daisy the captain laughed i hope shes like her brother said he the two culprits laughed vociferously it was worth anything to them to get the captain in a goodhumour well if thats the case said ainger i shant have anything to do with you youve no right on this floor you know that if he chooses to let you be hell have to keep you in order i dont pity him in the room underneath i say do you think he could hear us easilywhen we were playing oh no not at all said the captain laughing really i say ainger perhaps wed better have a study upstairs after all thanks not if i know it you might pitch over my head instead of his i suppose too hes allowed you to set up that dog yes its a present from digs mother i say hes not a badlooking beast is he who dig not so very said the captain quite relieved to be able to wash his hands of this precious couple he departed leaving the two worthies in a state of bewildered jubilation what a splendid lark exclaimed arthur we shall be able to do just what we like all the term there were in luck mark thinks aingers looking after us and ainger will think marks looking after us and diggy my boy nobody will look after us except smileyeh old dog smiley who had wonderfully recovered since an hour ago here made a playful run at the speakers heels under the belief that the football had recommenced and the heartrending yelps which railsford heard in the room below a few moments later were occasioned by an endeavour to detach the playful pets teeth from the trouserends of his owners friend the master of the shell retired to bed that night doubtful about his boys and doubtful about himself he was excellent at shutting stable doors after the abstraction of the horses and could see a blunder clearly after it had been committed still hope sprang eternal in the breast of mark railsford he would return to the charge tomorrow and the next day and the next meanwhile he would go to sleep the discussion in the captains room had not been unanimous well said felgate when ainger returned how do you like him i dont fancy i shall get on with him poor beggar drawled barnworth i thought he might have been a good deal worse myself so did i said stafford he was quite shy no wonder considering who his visitors were we were all shy for the matter of that and i said felgate intend to remain shy i dont like the animal hes too fussy for me just what he ought to be but isnt hell let things go on and make us responsible cool cheek said ainger however the row overhead will wake him up now and then fancy young herapath unless hes making a joke which isnt much in his line says railsfords engaged to his sister and on that account the young beggar and his precious chum get leave to have sykes study and do what they like they may for all i shall interfere if its a family affair you dont catch me poking my nose into it engaged is he cried felgate laughing what a joke its nothing to do with us said barnworth whether he is or not unless he goes in for favouritism which it seems he is doing said ainger well even so youve washed your hands of young herapath and hes a lucky chap but having done so i dont see what it matters to us how many wives or sweethearts he has it seems to me said ainger who was still discontented we shall get no more backing from him than we did from moss i dont care twopence about that young ass herapath but if the house is to go on as it was last term and we are to be interfered with by bickers and nobody to stand up for us we may as well shut up at once and let him appoint new prefects yes but are you sure he wont back us up drawled barnworth im not a betting man like stafford but i have a notion hell come out on our side ainger grunted sceptically and announced that he had to unpack whereat his comrades left him few persons at grandcourt gave the captain of railsfords house credit for being as honest as he was shorttempered and as jealous for the honour of his house as he was shortsighted as to the best means of securing it and yet ainger was all this and when he went to bed that night railsford himself did not look forward more anxiously to the opening term than did his first lieutenant chapter five arthur and the baronet settle down for the term the reader is not to imagine that railsfords house contained nobody but the four prefects of the sixthform and the sedate tenants of the study immediately over the masters head who belonged to the shell on the contrary the fifty boys who made up the little community were fully representative of all grades and classes of grandcourt life there was a considerable substratum of babies belonging to the junior forms who herded together noisily and buzzed like midges in every hole and corner of the house nor were herapath and oakshott with their two cronies by any means the sole representatives of that honourable fraternity known as the shell too mature for the junior school and yet too juvenile for the upper forms a score at least of railsfords subjects belonged to this noble army and were ready to wage war with anybody or anythingfor a consideration still ascending in the scale came a compact phalanx of fifthform heroes counting some of the best athletes of the second eleven and fifteen and yet not falling in with the spirited foreign policy so prevalent in the rest of the house on an emergency they could and would turn out and their broad backs and sturdy arms generally gave a good account of themselves but as a general rule they grieved their friends by an eccentric habit of mugging which as anybody knows is a most uncomfortable and alarming symptom in a boy of a house such as railsfords true there were among them a few noble spirits who never did a stroke of work unless under compulsion but as a rule the fifth form fellows in railsfords lay under the imputation of being studious and took very little trouble to clear their characters only when the school sports came round or the house matches their detractors used to forgive them the four prefects to whom the reader has been already introduced divided among them the merits and shortcomings of their juniors ainger and felgate though antagonistic by nature were agreed as to an aggressive foreign policy while barnworth and of course the amiable stafford considered there was quite enough work to do at home without going afield yet up to the present these four heroes had been popular in their housebarnworth was the best high jumper grandcourt had had for years and ainger was as steady as a rock at the wickets of the first eleven and was reported to be about to run smedley the school captain very close for the mile at the spring sports stafford dear fellow that he was was not a particularly hot man at anything but he would hold the coat of anyone who asked him and backed everybody up in turn and always cheered the winner as heartily as he condoled with the loser felgate was one of those boys who could do better than they do and whose unsteadiness is no ones fault but their own his ways were sometimes crooked and his professions often exceeded his practice he meant well sometimes and did ill very often and in short was just the kind of fellow for the shorttempered honest ainger cordially to dislike such was the miscellaneous community which mark railsford found himself called upon to govern it was not worse than a good many masters houses and had even its good points and yet just now it was admitted to be in a bad way the doctor had his eye on it and there is nothing more adverse to reform than the consciousness that one has a bad name the late master mr moss moreover had notoriously found the place too hot for him and had given it up that again tells against the reputation of a house and lastly although it had a few good scholars and athletes who won laurels for the school there seemed not enough of them to do anything for the house which had steadily remained at the bottom of the list for general proficiency for several terms if you inquired how all this came about you would hear all sorts of explanations but the one which found most favour in the delinquent house itself was summed up in the single word bickers the origin of the deadly feud between the boys of railsfords and the master of the adjoining house was a mystery passing the comprehension even of such as professed to understand the ins and outs of juvenile human nature it had grown up like a mushroom and no one exactly remembered how it began mr bickers some years ago had been a candidate for the mastership of the shell but had been passed over in favour of mr roe and ever since so report went he had been actuated by a fiendish antipathy to the boys who kept in the house of his rival he had worried mr moss out of the place and the boys of the two houses quick to take up the feuds of their chiefs had been in a state of war for months not that mr bickers was a favourite in his own house he was not any more than mr moss had been in his but any stick is good enough to beat a dog with and when mr bickerss boys had a mind to go for mosss boys they espoused the cause of bickers and when mr mosss boys went out to battle against those of bickerss house their warcry was moss much legend had grown up round the feud but if anyone had had patience to examine it to the bottom he would probably have found the long and short to be that mr bickers being unhappily endowed with a fussy disposition and a sour and vindictive temper had incurred the displeasure of the boys of his rivals house and not being the man to smooth away a bad impression had aggravated it by resenting keenly what he considered to be an unjust prejudice against himself this little digression may enable the reader if he has had the patience to wade through it to form an idea of the state of parties in that particular section of grandcourt which chiefly came under railsfords observation with roes and grovers houses on the other side of the big square his boys had comparatively little to do as a house while with the remote communities in the little square they had still less in common but to return to our story the first week of the next term was one of the busiest mark railsford ever spent his duties in the shell began on the second day and the opening performance was not calculated to elate his spirit the sixty or seventy prodigies of learning who assembled there came from all houses a few were bent seriously on work and promotion the majority were equally in different about the one and the other and the remainder were professional idlersmost successful in their profession such were the hopeful materials which railsford was expected to inspire with a noble zeal in the pursuit of classics history and divinity it would have bets as easyat least so it seemed to the masterto instruct he monkeyhouse at the zoological gardens the few workers scarcely one of whom by the way was in his own house formed a little coterie apart and grabbed up whatever morsels of wisdom and learning their master could afford to let drop in the midst of his handtohand combat with the forces of anarchy and lethargy but he had little to say to them his appeals were addressed to the body of gaping half amused halfbored loungers in the middle of the room who listened pleasantly and forgot instantaneously who never knew where to go on and had an inveterate knack of misunderstanding the instructions for next days work they endured their few morning hours in the shell patiently resignedly and were polite enough to yawn behind their books they were rarely put out by their own mistakes and when occasionally the master dropped upon them with some penalty or remonstrance they deemed it a pity that anyone should put himself so much about on their account railsford was baffled there seemed more hope in the turbulent skirmishers at the back of the room who at least could now and then be worked upon by thunder and always in theory acknowledged that lessons were things to be learned on the first day the muggers knew their task well and railsford glowed with hope as he expressed his approbation but when he came to the gapers his spirits sunk to zero they had unfortunately mistaken the passage or else the page was torn out of their book or else they had been prevented by colds or sprained wrists or chilblains from learning it when told to construe a passage read out not two minutes before by one of the upper boys they knew nothing about it and feared it was too hard for their overwrought capacities and when pinned down where they sat to the acquirement of some short rule or passage they explained sorrowfully that that had not been mr mosss method in divinity they raised discussions on questions of dogma and so subtly evaded challenge on questions of greek testament construction and various readings in history they fell back on a few stock answers which rarely possessed the merit of having any connection with the questions which they pretended to satisfy but the gapers were men of peace after all they rarely insisted upon their own opinion nor did it offend them to be told they were wrong the noisier element were less complacent it is true they never did a lesson through or construed a sentence from one end to the other still when they took the trouble to mug a question up they expected to be believed it hurt them a good deal to be informed that they knew nothing and to detain them or set them impositions because of a difference of opinion on an historical classical or theological question seemed grossly unjust when for instance sir digby oakshott baronet on an early day of the term publicly stated that the chief features of cromwells character was a large mouth and a wart on the nose he was both hurt and annoyed to be ordered peremptorily to remain for an hour after class and write out pages to inclusive of the school history he had no objection as he confided to his friend and comforter arthur herapath esquire to the master of the shell entertaining his own opinions as to the character of the personage in question but he believed in the maxim give and take and just as he would cheerfully have received anything mr railsford might have to say on the subject he at least expected that his own statement should be received in an equally candid spirit particularly as he was anxious to point out since he had personally inspected a portrait of cromwell not long ago and verified the existence of the two features alleged sir digby indeed deserved some little commiseration he had come up to grandcourt this term pledged to the hilt to work hard and live virtuously he had produced and proudly hung in a conspicuous place in his study a timetable beautifully ruled and written in red and black ink showing how each hour of every day in the week was to be spent in honest toil and wellearned sport he had explained to his friend the interesting fact that a duplicate of this table had been presented to his mother who thereby would be able to tell at any moment how her dear son was occupied lets see said he proudly taking out his watch now what am i doing at on thursdays french preparation there you are so if shes thinking about me now she knows what im up to but youre not doing french preparation suggested arthur of course im not you ass how could i when i lent dimsdale my book besides weve not started yet ive got about a million lines to write do you know im certain it was bickers got me into that row about the omnibus i saw him looking on i say that was a stunning lark wasnt it id have won too if riggles had kept his right side look here i say id better do some lines now lend us a hand theres a good chap wouldnt it be a tip if old smiley could write we could keep him going all day long master oakshott had in fact become considerably embarrassed at the beginning of the term by one or two accidents which conspired to put off the operation of the timetable for a short period the doctor had received information through some channel of the famous chariot race on opening day and had solaced the defeated champion with a caning which he did not mind and five hundred lines of virgil which he greatly disliked in addition to that digby had received fifty lines from ainger for peashooting which not being handed in by the required time had doubled and trebled and bade fair to become another five hundred before they were done and now he had received from railsfordfrom his beloved friends future brotherinlawseven pages of school history to write out of which he had accomplished one during the detention hour and had solemnly undertaken to complete the other six before tomorrow it spoke a good deal for the forbearance and good spirits of the unfortunate baronet that he was not depressed by his misfortunes arthur too had come up with every idea of conducting himself as a model boy and becoming a great moral support to his future brotherin law it had pained him somewhat to find that relative was not always as grateful for his countenance as he should have been still he bore him no malice the time would come when the elder would cry aloud to the younger for aid and he should get it meanwhile on this particular evening arthur found himself too busy getting the new study into what he termed shipshape order to be able to adopt his friends suggestion about the lines his idea of ship shape did not in every particular correspond with the ordinary acceptation of the term he had brought down in his trunk several fine works of art selected chiefly from the sporting papers and representing stirring incidents in the lives of the chief prize fighters these after endeavouring to take out a few of the creases contracted in the journey he displayed over the fireplace and above the door attaching them to the wall by means of garden nails which had an awkward way of digging prodigious holes in the plaster and never properly reaching the laths behind most of the pictures consequently required frequent rehanging and by the end of the evening looked as if they like the shady characters painted on them had been in the wars then arthur had produced with some pride a small set of bookshelves which packed away into a wonderfully small space but which when fitted together were large enough to accommodate as many books as he possessed the fitting together however was not very successful some of the screws were lost and had to be replaced by nails and having used the sidepieces for the shelves and the shelves for the sides he and dig had a good deal of trouble with a saw and a cunningly constructed arrangement of strings to reduce the fabric into the similitude of a bookcase when at last it was done and nailed to the wall it exhibited a tendency to tilt forward the moment anything touched it and pitch its contents on to the floor after much thought it occurred to herapath that if they turned it upside down this defect would operate in the other direction and hold the books securely against the wall so having wrenched the nails out and been fortunate enough to find a space on the wall not gaping with wounds in the plaster they reerected it inversely but alas although the top shelf now tilted back at the wall the bottom shelf swung forward an inch or two and let its contents out behind with the same regularity and punctuality with which it had previously ejected them in front dig pronounced it a rotten concern and voted for smashing it up but herapath more dauntless determined on one further effort he began to drive a large nail vehemently into the floor immediately under the refractory bookcase and then tying a string round the bottom shelf he hitched the other end round the nail and drew the fabric triumphantly into the wall it was a complete success even dig applauded and cried out to his friend that another inch would make a job of it another inch did make a job of it for just as the bottom shelf closed in the top gave a spring forward pulling the nail along with it and burying the two mechanics under a cascade of books plaster and shattered timber arthur and dig sat on the floor and surveyed the ruin stolidly while smiley evidently under the delusion that the whole entertainment had been got up for his amusement barked vociferously and seizing a students gibbon in his teeth worried it in the lightness of his heart like a rat at this juncture the door opened and railsford with alarm in his face entered whatever is the matter he exclaimed it was an excellent cue for the two boys who forthwith began to rub their arms and shoulders and make a demonstration of quiet suffering this horrid bookcase wont stick up said arthur we were trying to put the things tidy and it came down its a pretty good weight on a fellows arm said the baronet rubbing his limb which had really been grazed in the downfall it is a very great noise on the top of my head said the master i dare say it was an accident but you two will have to be a great deal quieter up here or i shall have to interfere we really couldnt help it marki mean railsi mean mr railsford said arthur in an injured tone theres dig will get into no end of a row as it is he was writing out that imposition for you and now hes hurt his arm through helping mebrick that he is i suppose you wont mind if i finish the lines for him arthur was staking high and would have been sadly disconcerted had his kinsman taken him at his word is your arm really hurt oakshott inquired the master oh no not much said digby wincing dramatically and putting on an air of determined defiance to an inward agony i dare say i can manage after a rest we had taken some of the books out so i only had the bookcase and three shelfloads of books on the top of me that wasnt so much how much have you written demanded the master two pages please sir this time i will let that do thanks awfully broke in arthur youre a brick digll never do it again will you dig i could do it you know if you really wanted said dig feeling up and down his wounded limb that will do said mark who had already begun to have a suspicion that he had been done clear up this mess and dont let me hear any more noise overhead when he had gone the friends embraced in a gust of jubilation no end of a notion of yours said dig that leaves the lines for the doctor and the others for ainger hell keep well have him in to tea and dose him with marmalade and square him up but there i must do the doctors lines or i shall catch it and so despite his wounded arm he set to work aided by his friend and worked off about half the penalty by which time his arm and elbow were very sore indeed dimsdale who came in later was bribed with an invitation to jam breakfast in the morning to help with the remainder and the same inducement prevailed upon tilbury so that by a fine co operative effort dig stood clear with the doctor before night was over and considered himself entitled to a little rest which he forthwith proceeded to take the breakfastparty next morning was a great success on the whole it was a little marred by the fact that whereas covers were laid for four just fourteen guests turned up this was partly arthurs fault for having sallied forth with an invitation in his pocket to anyone who would help his friend out with a few lines he had dropped them about in a good many other quarters he had secured the attendance of simson and maple of the shell and of bateson and jukes of the babies and with a view to ingratiate himself with some of his neighbours on the first floor he had bidden to the banquet wake ranger wignet and sherriff of the fifth and actually prevailed upon stafford to lend the dignity of a sixthform patronage to the reunion these heroes were naturally a little disgusted on turning up at the rendezvous to find the room crowded with scarcely standing space to space by a troop of hungry and noisy juniors the good hosts perspired with the heat of the room and as guest after guest crowded in began to look a little anxious at the modest fare on the table and speculate mentally on how far one loaf one pot of jam four pats of butter a pint coffeepot and threeandahalf teacups would go round the lot at length when stafford arrived and could not get in at the door for the crush despair seized them you kids had better hook it said arthur to half a dozen of the juniors who had squeezed themselves into a front rank near the table theres not room today come tomorrow loud were the complaints not unmingled with threatenings and gibes of these disappointed babies what a horrible shame exclaimed jukes in a very audible voice we were here first do you hearcut repeated the host come along said bateson whats the use of bothering about a crumb and a half apiece i never saw such a skinny spread in all my days and in the ten years which comprehended master batesons days he had had a little experience of that sort of thing the company being now reduced to eight to wit stafford the four fifthform boys the two hosts and dimsdale assumed more manageable proportions there was room at least to move an arm or a leg and even to shut the door but when it came to taking seats it still became evident that the table could by no possibility hold more than six another crisis thereupon arose dimsdale was regretfully dismissed and departed scarlet in the face promising as he slammed the door to show up his hosts these amiable worthies much distressed and not a whit cooler that the room was now comparatively empty smiled feebly at this threat and arranged to sit on one anothers laps so as to bring the company finally down to the capabilities of the table but at this juncture stafford who had grown tired of waiting and evidently saw little prospect of conviviality in the entertainment remembered that he had some work to do before morning school and rose to leave why weve not begun yet gasped his hosts i really must go thanks for asking me ive enjoyed it so much said the amiable prefect departing look here i say expostulated arthur you might stay ill get some eggs or a herring if youll stop but the guest of the morning was beyond reach of these blandishments and with muttered reflections on human depravity generally the hosts took a seat at each end of the festive board and bade the four fifth form fellows fall to they had already done so one had cut the loaf another had meted out the jam another had poured out the coffee and another had distributed the butter have some coffee said wake pleasantly to dig very good stuff thanks said dig trying to look grateful ill wait till theres a cup to spare if youre putting on the eggs said ranger confidentially to arthur keep mine on an extra fifteen seconds please i like them a little hardish awfully sorry said arthur with a quaver in his voice jolly unlucky but were out of eggs got none in the place oh never mind said ranger reassuringly the herrings will do quite as well stafford may not fancy them but we do dont we you chaps rather said sheriff thoughtfully scooping out the last remnants of the jam from the pot arthur looked at the baronet and the baronet looked at arthur things were growing desperate and at all risks a diversion must be made what could they do dig had a vague idea of creating a scare that smiley had gone mad but as the animal in question was at that moment peacefully reposing on the hearth there seemed little probability of this panic taking then he calculated the possibilities of secretly cutting away one leg of the table and so covering the defects of the meal by an unavoidable catastrophe but he had not his penknife about him and the two tableknives were in use arthur at this point came gallantly and desperately to the rescue i say you fellows began he ignoring the hint about the herrings do you want to know a regular lark ha ha laughed oakshott not having the least idea what his friend was going to say but anxious to impress upon his guests that the joke was to be a good one what is it asked wignet who never believed in anyone elses capacities for storytelling why said arthur getting up a boisterous giggle you know railsford the new master of course what about him wellkeep it dark you know shut up dig and dont make me laugh i saytheres such a grand joke about him out with it said the guests who were beginning to think again about the herrings well this fellowi call him marky you knowmarks engaged to my sister and ha ha ha chimed in dig andhe calls her chuckey i heard him oh my wig this last exclamation was caused by his looking up and catching sight of railsford standing at the door the master of the shell had in fact called up in a friendly way to ask how sir digby oakshotts arm was after the accident of the previous night chapter six when the cats away the mice will play if railsford had entertained any lurking hope that his private affairs were sacred in the hands of his prospective kinsman the little incident recorded at the close of the last chapter did away with the last remnant of any such delusion he did not say anything about it he was punctilious to a degree in anything which affected his honour and as what he had overheard on the occasion in question had been part of a private conversation not intended for his ears he felt himself unable to take any notice of it still it was impossible for him to regard the faithless arthur with quite as brotherly an eye as before and the manner in which that young gentleman avoided him for the next few days and hung out signals of distress in his presence showed pretty plainly that these silent reproaches were not being thrown away of course arthur did every imaginable thing to make matters worse in the house by way of proving his contrition he besought wake not to let the story go about greatly to the amusement of that young humourist who had already heard it from half a dozen sources since the beginning of the term he threatened dimsdale with all sorts of penalties if he spread the secret any further dimsdale who had long ago informed everyone of his acquaintance cheerfully promised it should go no further so anxious was arthur to make up for his offence that when one or two fellows spoke to him about it and asked him if it was true that railsford and his sister were going to be married he prevaricated and hedged till he got hopelessly out of his depth married he would reply scornfully fiddlesticks i tell you theres nothing in itall jaw who told you they were going to be married from utterances like these an impression got abroad in some quarters that railsford wanted to marry chuckey but chuckey wouldnt have him so the last end of the story was worse than the first railsford however did not hear this latest version of his own romance and indeed had plenty of other things just at this time to occupy his attention much to his own satisfaction he received a polite note from smedley the captain of the school to inform him that he had been elected a vicepresident of the athletic union and expressing a hope that he would favour the treasurer with the annual subscription now due and attend a committee on saturday evening in mr roes house to arrange about the spring sports both requests he gladly complied with previous to the meeting he had been present as umpire at a footballmatch in the meadows between the first twelve against the next twenty it was a finelycontested battle and his opinion of grandcourt rose as he stood and looked on it had not occurred to him till he was about to start that his two principal prefects would of course be members of the committee in whose deliberations he was to take part but he considered he might safely leave the control of the house during his short absence to the keeping of stafford and felgate who though neither of them the kind of boy to inspire much confidence had at least the title to be considered equal to the task after all it was only for an hour possibly no one would know of his absence and on this the first occasion of his being present at a meeting in whose objects he had so much interest he felt that his duty to the school had as much claim on him as his duty to his house so he ran the risk and went quietly out at the appointed time in the comfortable assurance that his house was absorbed in preparation and would never miss him the meeting came up to his expectations he was the only master present and as such was voted to the chair he made a little speech he had got ready in case of need lauding up athletics to the skies and confessing his own sympathy and enthusiasm for whatever tended towards the physical improvement of grandcourt the boys cheered him at every sentence and when smedley afterwards welcomed him in the name of the boys and said they were all proud to have an old blue among their masters he received quite a small ovation then the meeting went heartily to work over the business of the sports after an hour and a halfs steady work the programme was arranged the date was fixed the expenses were estimated and the vote of thanks was given to the chairman would you mind umpiring again next saturday sir asked smedley as they parted with all the pleasure in the worldany time said the master only wishing he could play in the fifteen himself railsfords house meanwhile had celebrated the temporary absence of its ruler in strictly orthodox fashion scarcely had he departed flattering himself that the deluded mice were still under the spell of the cats presence in their neighbourhood when the word went round like wildfire coasts clear arthur and the baronet heard it in their study and flung their books to the four winds and rushed howling down to the common room the babies heard it and kicked over their forms and executed wardances in the passages the fifthform muggers heard it and barricaded their doors and put cottonwool in their ears stafford and felgate heard it and shrugged their shoulders and wondered when the other prefects would be back theres nobody about come on we can kick up as much row as we like shouted the highprincipled arthur who cares for my spooney old brotherinlaw marky the shout of laughter which followed this noble appeal suddenly dropped into a deadly silence as the lank form of mr bickers appeared in the doorway arthur rapidly lost himself in the crowd the two prefects with flushed faces elbowed their way into the room as though just arrived to quell the uproar a few boys snatched up books and flopped down at their desks but mr bickers had too keen an eye to let himself be imposed upon he had witnessed the scene from a window in his own house and surmising by the noise that no authority was present to deal with the disorder had taken upon himself to look in in a friendly way and set things right silence he cried closing the door behind him and walking two steps into the room where is mr railsford out sir said stafford and the prefects felgate and i are prefects sir the other two are out and you two have allowed this noise and disorder to go on for half an hour we were going to stop it said felgate faltering by looking on and applauding responded the master you forget that from one of my windows everything that goes on here is plainly visible including those who stand at the door and look on when they ought to know better go to your rooms you two we are in charge of the house sir mildly protested felgate i am in charge of the house thundered mr bickers obey me and go they withdrew chafing crestfallen and very uncomfortable now said mr bickers when the door was again closed arthur herapath come here mr bickerss knowledge of the names of the boys in other houses was quite phenomenal arthur with hanging head and thumping heart slunk forward so sir said mr bickers fixing him with his eye you are the model boy whom i heard proclaiming as i came in that you could make as much noise as you liked and called your absent master by an insulting name please sir pleaded the unlucky arthur i didnt mean it to be insulting i only called him marky because hes my brotherinlawi mean hes going to be thats right mr bickers said the baronet nobly backing up his friend hes spoo i mean hes engaged to daisy herapaths sister silence sir said the master with a curl of his lips herapath come here and hold out your hand so saying he took up a ruler from a desk close at hand please sir expostulated arthurhe didnt mind a cane but had a rooted objection to rulersi really didnt hold out your hand sir there was no denying mr bickers arthur held out his hand and was there and then before half his house admonished six times consecutively with an emphasis which brought the tears fairly into his hardened eyes now go all of you to your studies and continue your preparation i shall remain in the house till mr railsford returns and report what has occurred to him when half an hour later the master of the shell full of his athletic prospects returned to his quarters he was gratified as well as surprised by the dead silence which reigned his astonishment was by no means diminished when on entering the common room he encountered mr bickers pacing up and down the floor amidst the scared juniors there assembled railsford with all his follies was a man of quick perception and took in the whole situation at a glance he understood why mr bickers was there and why the place was so silent still more he perceived that his own authority in the house had suffered a shock and that a lesson was being read him by the man whom of all his colleagues he disliked the most goodevening said mr bickers with a show of friendliness mark nodded i am glad to be able to render up your house to you in rather better order than i found it if youll take my advice railsford you will not venture out in the evening specially leaving no one in authority it is sure to be taken advantage of railsford bit his lips i ought to be much obliged to you said he coldly as it happens i did not venture out without leaving anyone in authority if you mean stafford andwhat is his namefelgatei cant congratulate you on your deputies they were in fact aiding and abetting the disorder and i have sent them to their rooms as incompetent i would advise you to relieve them of their office as soon as you can thank you for your advice said railsford whose blood was getting up i will make my own arrangements in my own house of course my dear fellow replied bickers blandly but you should really find two better men than those there was no attempt to stop the disorder which had been going on for half an hour when i arrived i had to castigate one of the ringleaders myselfherapath by name claiming kinship with you by the way im not sure that you ought not to report him to dr ponsford it was all railsford could do to listen quietly to this speech drawled out slowly and cuttingly by his rival he made a desperate effort to control himself as he replied dont you think mr bickers you might with advantage go and see how your own house is getting on in your absence mr bickers smiled happily i have responsible prefects however now you are backand if you are not going out againi will say goodnight railsford said goodnight and disregarding the proffered hand of his colleague walked moodily up to his own room he may be excused if he was put out and miserable he was in the wrong and he knew it and yet the manner in which the rebuke had been administered was such as no man of spirit could cheerfully endure the one idea in his mind was not how to punish the house for its disorder but how to settle scores with bickers for restoring order not how to admonish the incompetent prefects but how to justify them against their accuser he sent for the four prefects to his room before bed hour ainger and barnworth it was plain to see had been informed of all that had happened and were in a more warlike mood even than their two companions i hear said railsford that there was a disturbance in the house while i was away for a short time this evening ainger and barnworth of course were out too but i should like to hear from you stafford and felgate what it was all about stafford allowed felgate to give his version which was like most of felgates versions decidedly apocryphal there was rather a row sir said he among some of the juniors some of them were wrestling i fancy as soon as we saw what was going on stafford and i came to stop it when mr bickers turned up and sent us to our rooms we told him we had been left in charge by you but he would not listen very annoying said the master its rather humiliating to our house sir said ainger if our prefects are not to be allowed to deal with our own fellows i agree with you said mark warmly i have no reason whatever for doubting that they can and will do their duty when he had intended to say when they are not interfered with but deemed it more prudent to say when occasion requires we could easily have stopped the row sir said stafford if we had been allowed to do so i have no doubt of it said the master i am glad to have had this little explanation the honour of our house is of common interest to all of us a week ago this speech would have seemed a mere commonplace exhortation but under present circumstances it had a double meaning for those present hes a brick said ainger as they returned to their studies he means to back us up after all and pay bickers out what surprises me said barnworth is that stafford the bulldog did not invite the intruder out into the square and impress the honour of our house with two black marks on each of his eyes im just as glad said felgate its all happened we shouldnt have got railsford with us if if youd done your duty and stopped the row the moment it began said ainger who with all his jealousy for his house had no toleration for humbug even in a prefect whose cause he espoused so railsfords house went to bed that night in a warlike mood chapter seven the session of masters and an outrage it is to be feared that mark railsford moral science man though he was had yet to learn the art of applying his philosophy to his own circumstances or he would never have committed the serious error on the day following the event recorded in the last chapter of writing the following foolish note to mr bickers february sirreferring to the unpleasant topic of our conversation last night i have since consulted my prefects on the matter and made other inquiries as to what took place here during my temporary absence at the athletic meeting the report i have received and which i am disposed to credit differs materially from your own version in any case allow me to say that i require no assistance in the management of my house when i do i shall ask for it meanwhile i shall continue to consider the interference of anyone whatever his motives as an impertinence which i although the junior master at grandcourt shall have no hesitation in resenting to the utmost of my power i trust these few lines may obviate any future misunderstanding on a point about which i feel very strongly yours etcetera m railsford mr bickers was hardly the man to neglect the opportunity afforded by this letter for a crushing reply and accordingly he spend a pleasant hour that same afternoon in concocting the following polite rejoinder february dear railsfordmany thanks for your note just to hand i can quite believe that the version of yesterdays proceedings which you are disposed to credit given by your prefects two of whom were absent and the other two participators in the disturbance differs materially from my own such diversities of opinion are not uncommon in my experience as to the management of your house i assure you in what i did yesterday i had no intention of assisting you in fact you were not there to assist it was because you were not that my duty to the school suggested that i should attempt to do what you would have done infinitely better i am aware had you been on the spot under similar circumstances i should do the same again in face of the uncomfortable knowledge that thereby i should be guilty of an impertinence to the junior master at grandcourt it is kind of you to take steps to make your meaning quite clear on this matter may i suggest that we refer the matter to the session of masters or if you prefer it to dr ponsford i believe the masters meet tonight unless i hear from you i shall conclude you are as anxious as i am to have the matter thoroughly gone into by a competent tribunal to obviate any future misunderstanding on a point on which you naturally feel strongly believe me my dear railsford yours very truly t bickers mark was entertaining company when this uncomfortable letter arrived in the person of monsieur lablache the french master it would be difficult to say what there was in the unpopular foreigner which attracted the master of the shell it may have been a touch of quixotic chivalry which led him to defy all the traditions of the place and offer his friendship to the besthated person in grandcourt or it may have been a feeling that monsieur was hardly judged by his colleagues and pupils however it was during the short time the term had run the two men had struck up an acquaintance which perplexed a great many spectators and displeased a great many more i think you should be careful with lablache said grover to his friend not that i know anything against him but his reputation in the school is rather doubtful i suppose the reputation of all detention masters is doubtful said railsford laughing yours or mine would be if we had his work to do but a man is innocent till he is proved guilty in england isnt he quite so said grover i dont want to set you against him for as i say i know nothing of him all i mean is that you must be prepared to share a little of his unpopularity if you take up with him thats all ill take my chance of that said railsford the first time monsieur lablache appeared in railsfords house in response to an invitation from the new master to come and take coffee there was considerable excitement in the house the juniors considered their liberty was at stake and hissed their masters guest down the corridors the shell boys presumed still further and raised a cry of turn him out and some even attempted to hustle him and trip him upon the stairs but the most curious incident of that untriumphal progress was when munger the cad of the fifth confronted monsieur in the lobby outside railsfords room with the shout hes going to raise money on his old clothes at last the brutal words for monsieur was very shabbily attired were scarcely uttered when railsfords door suddenly opened and munger was sent reeling across the lobby under a blow which echoed through the house the master of the shell white with rage stood there with a look on his face which sent the few loiterers packing to their dens and made munger only sorry the wall against which he staggered did not open and let him through come here youyou boy munger advanced scarcely less pale than his master apologise to monsieur lablachehere down on your kneesfor behaving like a blackguard and saying what you did no it is no matter began monsieur with a shrug when mark checked him by a gesture almost as intimidating as that by which he had just summoned the offender you hear me he said to the boy munger went down on his knees and repeated whatever he was told and would have called himself by still worse names had he been requested it didnt matter much to munger now tell me your name munger your form fifth the master turned on his heel and ushered his guest into the room leaving munger to rub his cheek and wonder to himself how he ever came to stand being knocked about in the way he had been that afternoon this had happened a day or two ago since then whatever the house thought no one was bold enough to molest the french master publicly in railsfords unless it was perfectly certain mr railsford was out of the way it would be a mistake to say the two masters had become devoted friends monsieur lablaches chief attraction in railsfords eyes was that he was looked down upon by the other masters and persecuted by the boys while the french master was so unused to notice of any kind that he felt a trifle suspicious that the kindness of his new acquaintance might be in some way a snare however a little mutual mistrust sometimes paves the way to a good deal of mutual confidence and after a few days the two men had risen considerably in one anothers esteem when railsford on the evening in question crushed mr bickerss note up in his hand with an angry exclamation monsieur said voila mon cher railsford you do not get always billetsdoux monsieur had heard of course as everyone else had of the new masters matrimonial prospects no said railsford gloomily not always and he pitched mr bickerss letter into the grate as he spoke perhaps said monsieur you do not always write them i advise you to not answer that letter why said railsford how do you know what that letter is i do not know but i think that it does need no answer railsford laughed you are setting up as a soothsayer monsieur suppose i tell you that letter does need an answer quickly then i say somebody else will answer it better than you will railsford picked the crushedup letter off the coals just in time to save it from the flames how should you answer it monsieur monsieur slowly unfolded the paper and smoothed it out meester beekaire said he with a twist of his moustache as he recognised the writing you mean that i read it certainly if you like the frenchman read the document through and then pitched it back into the fire well said railsford well my good friend it seems you do not know meester beekaire as well as others is that all said railsford a little nettled the masters meeting is tonight is it not so he says you shall go of course it will not be pleasant times for you for you will need to make speeches my good friend look here said railsford who was getting a little impatient of these enigmatical utterances i fancied you could give me some advice if you cant let us talk about something more pleasant i do give you advice i say to you go to the meeting and say you did wrong and will not do it again what thundered mark in a voice which made arthur and the baronet in the room overhead jump out of their chairs my kind railsford it is only my advice you have been in the wrong i say to you as a brave man do not make yourself more wrong meester beekaire would help you very much to make yourself more wrong do not let him help you i say unpalatable as it was there was some force in his visitors advice which railsford was bound to admit poor monsieur was not a shining example of successful dealing with his fellowmasters still out of the mouth of the simple one may sometimes hear a home truth the masters session was a periodical conference of the grandcourt masters half social half business for the purpose of talking over matters of common school interest discussing points of management and generally exchanging ideas on what was passing in the little world of which they were the controllers dr ponsford rarely if ever put in an appearance on such occasions he had the greatest faith in holding himself aloof from detail and not making himself too accessible either to master or boy only when the boys could not settle a matter for themselves or the masters could not settle it for them he interfered and settled it without argument and without appeal it was never pleasant when the doctor had to be called in and the feeling against such a step contributed very largely to the success of the schools selfgovernment railsford by this time knew most of his fellowmasters to speak to but this was the first occasion on which he had met them in their corporate capacity and had he not been personally interested in the proceedings he would felt a pleasant curiosity in the deliberations of this august body mr bickers was already there and nodded in a most friendly way to the master of the shell on his arrival grover and mr roe welcomed their new colleague warmly and began at once to compare notes as to school work a few minutes later monsieur lablache a little smarter than usual came in and having bowed to the company generallya salute which no one seemed to observesubsided on a retired seat railsford to the regret perhaps of some of his friends presently walked across and took a seat beside him and the meeting began before we come to business began mr roe who by virtue of his seniority occupied the chair i am sure the meeting would wish me to express their pleasure at seeing mr railsford among us for the first time and to offer him a hearty welcome to grandcourt hear hear said grover and others amongst whom mr bickerss voice was conspicuous railsford felt uncomfortable thus to become an object of general notice and coloured up as he nodded his acknowledgments to the chairman they do not know of your scrape said monsieur cheerfully i would tell them about it my good friend before meester beekaire makes his little speech railsford glared round at his companion and felt his heart thumping at the prospect of the task before him there are one or two matters began mr roe to bring before railsford rose to his feet and said mr roe and gentlemen there was a dead silence at this unexpected interruption broken only by an encouraging cheer from mr bickers supposing the new master was about to acknowledge the compliment just paid him by a set speech mr roe put down his agenda paper and said mr railsford if you will allow me began mark rather breathlessly i would like to refer to a matter which personally concerns myself i should not venture to do it in this way immediately after your kind welcome if i did not feel it to be my duty yesterday gentlemen an unfortunate incident occurred in my househear hear and a smile from mr bickers i went excuse me said the chairman may i explain to mr railsford as he is a new member here that our practice is invariably to take up any questions in order of the seniority of the masters present mr smith i believe has a motion on the paper poor railsford subsided full of confusion stripped of his good resolutions abusing himself for his folly and wishing monsieur lablache and his advice at the bottom of the sea what mr smith and the other masters who followed had to say he neither heard nor cared his determination to admit his own error had oozed away and he resolved that if his story was to be kept waiting it should be none the sweeter when it did come for the delay several topics were discussed pleasantly with a view to elicit the opinion of the meeting on small questions of policy and discipline presently mr roe turned to bickers i think you said you had some question to ask mr bickers oh well yes mines quite a hypothetical point though began mr bickers airily i just wanted to ask supposing one of us becomes aware of a riot in a neighbouring house during the absence of the master of that house and ascertains moreover that the prefects on duty so far from making any attempt to control the disorder are participating in it i presume there can be no question that it would be the duty of anyone of us to interfere in such a case its quite a hypothetical case mind but it might occur certainly i should say if you were quite sure the proper house authorities were not there to enforce order said mr roe of course said grover but its rather an unlikely case isnt it it occurred in my house last night broke in railsford hotly i was at the athletic union and two of my prefects the other two were left in charge mr bickers took upon himself to interfere in my absence and i have written to tell him that i consider his action impertinent and resent it in reply he writes a private letter interposed mr bickers hurriedly evidently not relishing the prospect of having his effusion read it was not marked private but i can quite understand the writer would not like to hear it read aloud here all i wish to say is that his hypothetical case is no more hypothetical than his interference was in the affairs of my house and that if he asks my opinion on the matter i shall tell him he would do better to mind his own business railsford sat down very hot and painfully conscious that he had not exhibited the moderation and temper which he had promised himself to observe an embarrassed silence ensued mr roe a man of peace frowned and turned inquiringly to bickers bickers stroked his beard and smiled and said nothing do you wish to say anything asked the chairman by no means mr railsford has said all i could wish said far more eloquently than i could shall we go on to the next business mr chairman as for railsford the further proceeding had no interest for him and he vanished the moment the meeting was over without speaking to anyone as mr bickers walked off towards his house he really felt a little sorry for his fellowmaster who had let himself down by so paltry an exhibition of temper thus early in his career however no doubt he would take to heart tonights lesson and do himself more justice in future mr bickers in the fulness of his heart took a little round of the big square on his way home with the double intent of giving himself the air and perchance intercepting for the good of the school one or more youthful nightbirds in their truant excursions this was a kind of sport in which mr bickers was particularly successful and which therefore as became a successful sportsman he rather enjoyed to his credit be it said he was strictly impartial in his dealings whether the culprit belonged to his own house as often happened or to anothers he was equally down upon him and was never known to relax his penalties for the most plausible excuse set up by his ingenious victims tonight it seemed as if he would return without a bag at all and he was about to resign himself to his disappointment when his quick eyes detected in the darkness a hovering shadow moving ahead of him in the direction of railsfords house it vanished almost immediately but not before the master had caught a faintly uttered hist which betrayed that he had to deal with more than one truant he quickened his pace a little and came once more in view of the phantom slinking along by the wall at a pace which was not quite a run rather to mr bickerss surprise the fugitive passed the door of railsfords and made straight on towards the chapel slackening pace as he did so a decoy said the knowing master to himself employed to draw me on while the rest make good their retreat there is a touch of generosity in the decoy which one is bound to admire but on this occasion my young friend you are dealing with rather too aged a bird to be caught at this moment he had come up to the door of railsfords and before his soliloquy had been able to advance by another word he seemed to see sparks before his eyes while at the same moment his feet went from under him and something was drawn over his head the bag or whatever it was was capacious for the neck of it descended to his waist and closed by the magic of a slipknot round his mouth and elbows before he had the presence of mind to shout or throw out his arms to complete his misfortune as he tried to raise himself another noose was snugly cast around his feet and thus gagged and pinioned silently rapidly and dexterously mr bickers found himself in a situation in which he could positively aver he had never stoodor lainbefore the thought did flash through his sackenveloped head that his assailants whoever they were must have rehearsed this little comedy carefully and diligently for a day or two in order to arrive at the perfection displayed in the present performance he also made a mental calculation that three possibly four fellowbeings were engaged on the job of whom two were strong and two were small one of the latter possibly being the decoy whom he had so lately apostrophised not a syllable was uttered during the ceremony and the victim recognising his position had the good sense to remain cool and not waste his time and dignity in a fruitless struggle the pinioning being complete and a small hole being considerately opened in the sack in the region of the nose for purposes of respiration he was hauled up one or two steps dragged one or two feet deposited on the board floor of the shoecupboard and after a few mild and irresolute kicks left to his own meditations the last sound which penetrated into the sack being the sharp turning of a key on the outside of his dungeon door so soliloquised mr bickers after discovering that he was unhurt though uncomfortably cramped our friend railsford is having one lodger more than the regulation number tonight this will make another hypothetical case for the next session of masters chapter eight the doctor has a word or two with railsfords house railsfords house was not famous for early risers the chapelbell in winter began to ring at and callover was at between these two periods but chiefly at the end most of the rising in the house was accomplished master simson the shellfish was in for the hundred yards under fourteen at the sports and being a shy youth who did not like to practise in public he had determined to rise before the lark and take a furtive spin round the school track while his schoolfellows and enemies slept it was a cold raw morning and before he was fully arrayed in his flannels he had had more than one serious idea of relapsing into bed be it said to his credit he resisted the temptation and gallantly finished his toilet putting on an extra sweater and peajacket to bootfor he had seven pounds to run off between now and the sports he peered out of the window it was dark but a patter on the panes showed him that a light sleet was falling outside if so being of a frugal mind he would not run in his new shoes but in his old boots now his old boots were in the cupboard under the staircase by the front door and the reader understands at last why it is i have taken so much trouble to describe master simsons movements on this particular morning it was so rare an event for any boy to be up at six oclock on a winter morning in railsfords that no one had ever thought about making a rule to prevent the early birds leaving the house at that hour if they could succeed in getting out simson who had interest with the cook believed he could get an exeat through the kitchen window meanwhile he must get his boots he armed himself with a matchthe last one in the boxand quietly felt his way along the corridor and down the stairs there was a glimmer of light from under the maids door as he passed which told him they were up and that he would not have long to wait downstairs at the foot of the stairs he turned sharp round and following the wall with his hand came at length on the familiar handle of the bootbox to his surprise the door was locked but the key was on the outside a sell if i hadnt been able to get in said he to himself opening the door now simson like a cautious youth aware of the frailty of matches wisely resolved to penetrate as far as possible into the interior of the cupboard in the direction in which he knew his particular boots to be before striking a light but at the first step he tripped on something and fell prostrate over a human carcase which emitted a muffled gasp and moved heavily as he tumbled upon it then there went up a yell such as curdled the blood of half railsfords as they lay in their beds and made the domestics up stairs cling to one another in terror as if their last moment had come simson with every hair on his head erect made a frantic dive out of that awful den banging the door and locking it behind him in a frenzy of fright then he dashed upstairs and plunged as white as his shirt into the dormitory another yell signalised his arrival not his this time but the joint performance of the other occupants of the room who sitting up with their chins on their knees half petrified by the horror of the first shriek now gave themselves up for lost when the door broke open in the dark and a gasping something staggered into the room theres somebody been murdered gasped simson in the boot box everybody was on his feet in a moment murdered yes said simson wonderfully comforted by the noise and general panic i got up early you know to have a grind on the track and went to get my boots andii fell over it over what the boody whispered simson has anybody got a light shouted arthur but at that moment a light appeared at the door and ainger came in whats all this rowwhats the matter simson says somebodys been murdered in the bootbox replied arthur i say hadnt we better go and see it was a practical suggestion the corridor was already full of half dressed inquirers and a moment later mr railsfords door opened the story was repeated to him come with me ainger said he quietly the rest of you return to your dormitories and remain there arthur seized by a noble desire not to leave his future kinsman unprotected in such an hour of peril elected to disregard this last order and accompanied by his henchman followed the candle at a respectful distance down the stairs theres no blood on the stairs observed the baronet in a whisper theyve left the key in the door muttered arthur hold the light said railsford turning the key and entering prostrate on the ground bound hand and foot and enveloped down to the waist in a sack lay the figure of a man motionless but certainly not dead for sounds proceeded from the depths of the canvas in a moment railsford had knelt and cut the cords round the prisoners feet and hands while ainger drew the sack from the head arthur gave a whistle of consternation as the features of mr bickers came to light pale and stern the sudden sight of medusas head could hardly have had a more petrifying effect the victim himself was the first to recover stretching his arms and legs in relief he sat up and coolly said thank you whatever does all this mean exclaimed railsford helping him to rise for he was very stiff and cramped that i cannot say kindly reach my hat ainger who has done this that too i cannot say i can walk thank you wont you come to my room and have something you really must said railsford taking his arm mr bickers disengaged his arm and said coldly thank you no i will go to my own if you will open the door arthur at this moment came up officiously with a glass of water which mr bickers drank eagerly and then declining one last offer of assistance went slowly out towards his own house railsford retired to his room and threw himself into his chair in a state of profound dejection mysterious as the whole affair was one or two things were clear the one was that his house was disgraced by this criminal and cowardly outrage the other was that the situation was made ten times more difficult on account of the already notorious feud between himself and the injured master his high hopes were once more dashed to the ground and this time it almost seemed finally mark railsford was no coward yet for half an hour that morning he wished he might be well out of grandcourt for ever then having admitted cooler counsels he dressed and went to the captains study call the other prefects here ainger i want to talk to you the seniors were not far off and speedily assembled first of all said the master who perceived at a glance that it was not necessary for him to explain the gravity of the situation can any of you give me any information about this disgraceful affair none sir said ainger a little nettled at the masters tone we have talked it over and as far as we are concerned its a complete mystery have you any reason to suspect anybody none at all sir you know all of you i neednt tell you that the credit of the house is at stakein fact its gone till we find the offenders mr bickers will naturally report the matter to dr ponsford and i am going to the doctor for the same purpose i wished to consult you before taking any step because this is a matter in which we must work together certainly sir said ainger speaking for the rest what i mean is that no personal feeling must come between us and the duty we all owe to grandcourt to see this wrong put right you understand me yes said the downright ainger we none of us like mr bickers but we must find out the fellows who scragged him all the same exactly and i am glad to hear you say that there is one other matter two of you stafford and felgate recently felt specially aggrieved by something which mr bickers said to you you must forget all that now and remember only that your duty to the whole school requires that you should do everything in your power to help to put an end to this scandal of course we shall said felgate curtly in a tone which railsford did not consider particularly encouraging however having opened his mind to his lieutenants he went away straight to the doctors mr bickers was leaving just as he entered and railsford read in his looks as he brushed past no great encouragement to hope that things would soon be made right mr bickers said he advancing almost in front of his colleague i must tell you how distressed i am at what has occurred i yes it is trying for you said the injured master drily excuse me though i want my breakfast it was not easy to feel cordial sympathy with a man like this however there was nothing for it but to go and lay his case before the doctor and railsford entered accordingly dr ponsford was at breakfast and asked his visitor to take a seat you have come to tell me that mr bickerss assailants are discovered said he i wish i could said railsford i have only had time to speak to my prefects two of whom are not to be trusted and profess a personal spite against mr bickers this was just like the doctor he gave other people information and never wanted any himself i know of course what you refer to i have not myself found any reason to consider felgate or stafford untrustworthy mr bickers says i know what mr bickers says but what do you say well sir frankly i do not feel quite sure of felgate and stafford is too amiable to say no to anybody now let me hear about the affair this morning railsford gave a careful account of the discovery of mr bickers in the bootbox and was conscious that the doctor although he gave little sign of it was not quite blind to the unfortunate position in which he as the new master of the offending house was placed have a callover of your house at ten oclock mr railsford i will come this announcement was about as cheerful a one in grandcourt as an appointment made by the court of the inquisition would have been once upon a time in spain railsford rose to go you had better stop and have breakfast here said the doctor ringing the bell for another cup during the meal no further reference was made to the event of the morning but railsford was drawn out as to his work and the condition of his house generally and was painfully aware that the doctor was making the best of his time to reckon him up he only wished he could guess the verdict but on this point he received no light and went off presently charged with the unpleasant task of summoning his house to answer for themselves at the bar of the head master it was a curious spectacle the crowd of boys which assembled in the common room that morning at railsfords some were sulky and resented this jumbling of the innocent and guilty some were so anxious to appear guileless and gay that they overdid it and compromised themselves in consequence some were a little frightened lest an all round flogging should be proposed some whispered mysteriously and looked askance at one or two fellows who had been mentioned as possibly implicated some like arthur and the baronet with simson squeezed in between them looked knowing and important as though horses and chariots would not drag their secret out of them ainger looked pale and his big chest went up and down in a manner which those who knew him felt to be ominous stafford looked alternately solemn and sneering according as he turned to the captain or felgate and barnworth alone looked comfortable and apparently had not an idea what all the excitement was about at ten oclock railsford entered in his cap and gown and ainger immediately began to call over the roll every one answered to his name except maple of the shell who was away at his fathers funeral and tomkins the baby who had been so scared by the whole affair that he had turned sick during breakfast and retiredwith the dames permissionto bed during the callover the doctor had entered and seated himself at the masters desk his quick eye took in each boy as he uttered his adsum dwelling longer on some than on others and now and then turning his glance to the master and senior prefect when it was all over and ainger had handed in the list the headmaster took his eyeglass from his eye laid the list on the desk before him and said boys this is an unusual and unpleasant visit you know the object of it you know the discredit which at present lies on your house and on grandcourt and you know what your duty is in the matter if any boy here does not know what i mean let him stand up it was as much as the life of anybody present was worth to respond to this challenge one or two who could never hear a good story too often would not have objected if somebody else had demanded further information but for their own part their discretion outdid their curiosity and they retained their seats amidst a dead silence very well now i will put a question to you as a body it is a very serious question and one which no honest boy here if he is able to answer it can afford to evade a great deal more depends on your answer than the mere expulsion of one or more wrongdoers you boys are the guardians of the honour of your house the only honourable thing at a time like this is to speak the truth whatever the consequences the question i ask is this was any boy here concerned in the outrage on mr bickers or does any boy know who was i will wait for two minutes that you may understand the importance of the question before i call for an answer dead silence the boys for the most part looked straight before them with heightened colour and watched the slow progress of the minutehand of the clock i repeat the question now said the doctor when the allotted time had runwas any boy here concerned in the outrage on mr bickers or does any boy know who was if so let him stand up the silence which followed was broken to some by the thumping of their own hearts but no one rose and a sense of relief came to all but railsford who felt his spirits sink as the prospect of a near end to his trouble receded every boy here said the doctor slowly denies all knowledge of the affair silence gave consent then continued the headmaster more severely putting up his eyeglass and handing the list to ainger i shall put the question to each boy separately call over the list and let each boy come up and answer ainger began by calling out his own name and forthwith walked up to the masters desk do you know anything whatever of this affair asked the doctor looking him full in the face no sir said ainger returning the look after his fashion half defiantly the next name was called and its owner marched up to the desk and uttered his denial railsford as he stood scanning keenly the face of each boy in turn felt that he was watching the action of some strange machine first aingers clear voice then the short adsum and the footsteps up to the desk then the doctors stern question then the quick lookup and the halfdefiant no sir for they all caught up the captains tone and finally the retreating footsteps and the silence preceding the next name there was no sign of faltering and wherever the secret lurked railsford saw little chance of it leaking out a few boys indeed as was natural gave their replies after their own fashion barnworth looked bored and answered as though the whole performance was a waste of time arthur herapath was particularly knowing in his tone and accompanied his disclaimer with an embarrassing halfwink at his future kinsman felgate said no without the sir and swaggered back to his place with an ostentatious indifference which did not go unnoted the baronet who was nothing if not original said nothing but shook his head reply to the question sir thundered the doctor ominously whereat sir digby losing his head said no thank you sir and retired amid some confusion simson when interrogated mildly added to his no sir the explanatory sentence except finding him there when i went for my boots and munger the cad added to his answer but ill try to find out with a leer and an oily smile which ainger felt strongly tempted to acknowledge by a kick as he passed back to his place stafford painfully aware that he was one of the mentioned ones looked horribly confused and red as he answered to his name and satisfied several of the inexpert ones present that it was hardly necessary to look further for one of the culprits so the callover passed and when once more ainger handed in the list railsford seemed further than ever from seeing light through the cloud which enveloped it the doctors brow darkened as he took once more his glass from his eye this is very serious said he slowly when i came here it was with the painful feeling that the house contained boys so cowardly and unprincipled as to waylay a defenceless man in the dark and to treat him as mr bickers has been treated but it is tenfold worse to believe that it contains boys cowardly enough to involve the whole house in their own disgrace and punishment sensation i will not mince matters your house is deeply disgraced and cannot pretend to rank any longer with the other houses who at least have a good name until you have yourselves made this matter right it rests with you to retrieve your credit meanwhile everybody took a long breath the occasion was as when the judge puts on the black cap before passing sentence of death meanwhile the house will cease to dine in hall but will dine in this room at one oclock daily and on saturdays instead of taking the half holiday in the afternoon you will take it in the morning and assemble for school at twelve oclock i still trust that there may be sufficient selfrespect among you to make this change only of slight duration or that and here the doctors tone grew bitter and his mouth gathered sarcasticallyat least selfinterest may come to your assistance and make it possible to return to the old order and he stalked from the room let us off easy eh said the baronet easy fumed arthur he might as well have given us a bit of rope a piece and told us to go and hang ourselves look at ainger do you suppose he thinks weve been let off easy the captains face left no doubt on that question chapter nine ainger has a crumpet for tea and smedley sings a song railsford for a brief moment had shared the opinion of his distinguished pupil that the doctor had let the house off easily but two minutes reflection sufficed to undeceive him the house was to dine daily at one oclock in railsfords that meant that they were to be cut off from all association with the rest of the school out of school hours and that just when all the rest turned out into the playingfields they were to sit down at their disgraced board the halfholiday regulation was still worse for that meant nothing short of the compulsory retirement of his boys from all the clubs and as far as athletics went their total exclusion from every match or contest open to the whole school the house was slower at taking in the situation of affairs than the master with the exception of ainger on whom the full significance of the doctors sentence had flashed from the first there was a general feeling of surprise that so big a row should be followed by so insignificant a retribution who cares what time we have dinner said munger to some of his admirers as long as we get it after all now if old punch this was an irreverent corruption of the headmasters name current in certain sets at grandcourtif old punch had stopped our grub one day a week besides broke in another well get things hotter than when we dined in hall a precious sight hotter said arthur wrathfully what are we to do at beagletime tomorrow just when the hounds start weve got to turn in to dinner bah this was the first practical illustration of the inconvenience of the new regime and it instantly suggested others well be stumped said tilbury if this goes on after cricket startsitll be all up with any of us getting into one of the school matches i suppose said ranger of the fifth this will knock all of us out of the sports too fellows looked blank at the suggestion yet a moments reflection showed that ranger was right one oclock was the daily training hour in the playingfields and saturday afternoon four weeks hence was the date fixed for the school sports it took some days for railsfords house to accommodate itself to the new order of things imposed upon it indeed it took twentyfour hours for grandcourt generally to comprehend the calamity which had befallen the disgraced house when one oclock arrived on the first afternoon and neither ainger wake wignet tilbury herapath nor the other familiar frequenters of the playingfield put in an appearance speculation began to pass about as to the cause of their absence some of bickerss boys knew there had been a howling shine about something but it was not till smedley impatient to settle some question relating to the sports sent his fag to fetch ainger that it became generally known what had happened the fag returned with an important face such a go said he in reply to his chiefs inquiry theres a feast going on at railsfords smelt fine i saw them through the door but couldnt go in because railsford was there ainger and all the lot were tucking in the beef was just going in so theyve only just started jolly shame said someone who overheard this announcement we never get feasts in our house i suppose railsford thinks hell get his chaps in a goodhumour by it its not fair unless everybody does it itll be halltime before theyve done wed better not wait said one of the sixth i wonder what it all means i heard ponsford had been down rowing them about something this morningsomething some of them had been doing to bickers i believe very likely bickers looked as green as a toad this morning didnt he branscombe he did look fishy said branscombe shortly but i say smedley hadnt we better measure off without ainger and get him to see if he approves afterwards so the work went on without the representatives of railsfords house and the bell rang for schooldinner before any of the missing ones had put in an appearance the mystery was heightened when in hall the fifty seats usually occupied by railsfords boys stood empty and no inquiry was made from the masters table as to the cause of the defection it was noticed that mr railsford himself was not present and that mr bickers still looked upset and out of sorts have you any idea what the row is said smedley to branscombe as the company stood round the tables waiting for the doctor how should i know youd better go and ask up there smedley did as the doctor entered he marched up to meet him and said none of mr railsfords house are here yet sir quite right call silence for grace and begin said the doctor slowly for the rest of the day railsfords seemed to be playing hide and seek with the rest of the school and it was not till late in the evening that the mystery was cleared up come and lets see what its all about said smedley to branscombe both the seniors had been fretting all the afternoon with a sense of something gone wrong at grandcourt the former with just a little indignation that he the captain of the school should be kept in the dark along with everybody else on the subject i ought to work said branscombe you go and tell me whats up why i thought you were as anxious as anyone to know so i am said branscombe who to do him justice looked thoroughly worried but you know while theres this row on between the two houses ii dont care to go over there without being asked i asked you didnt i said smedley youre not afraid of being eaten up are you never mind ill brave the wild beasts myself and let you know how i get on it was the rule at grandcourt that after dark no boy from one house might enter another without permission smedley therefore went straight to railsford may i go and see ainger please sir certainly and smedley said the master as the captain retired look in here for a moment as you go out i want to see you about the sports smedley found ainger alone and heard from him a full true and particular account of the days events the captains wrath was unbounded what he exclaimed cut all of you out of the sports and everything i say ainger it must be stopped i tell you ill go to the doctor might as well go to the unicorn over the gate said ainger cant you find the fellows thats just it theres not even a fellow in the house i can suspect so far you feel sure its one of your fellows it couldnt be anyone else roes and grovers fellows never come over our side and never have anything to do with bickers and its hardly likely any of bickerss fellows would have done it in fact ever since bickers came in here the other night and thrashed one of our fellows the two houses have been at daggers drawn so branscombe said he didnt seem to care about coming in with me i asked him i dont wonder some of the young fools down there would give him a hot reception for no other reason than that he belongs to bickerss house i dont fancy hes proud of that distinction said smedley laughing but i say cant anything be done nothing unless railsford can do anything railsford asked me to go in and see him come too old man but railsford had nothing to suggest he explained dejectedly the effect of the doctors sentence it meant that his house was out of everything in the playingfields and that as for himself he was as much excluded as his boys and he confirmed aingers opinion that it was utterly useless to appeal further to the doctor it would be only fair sir said smedley for you to take back the prize and subscription you offered for the sports certainly not my dear fellow said the master if i cannot take part in the sports in person at least i would like to have some finger in the pie that was all that passed i like railsford said smedley hes genuinely cut up its awfully rough on him replied ainger the two friends said goodbye by the way smedley said ainger calling the captain back i may as well tell you we are going to have our revenge for all this what said smedley rather alarmed surely youre not going to to roast the doctor no but were going to make this the crack house of the school in spite of him smedley laughed good youve a busy time before you old man ill promise to keep it darkha ha you may think it a joke dear old chap said ainger standing at the door and watching his retreating figure but even the captain of grandcourt will have to sit up byandby smedley the brave and impetuous walked straight from railsfords to the doctors he knew his was a useless mission but he wasnt going to shirk it the doctor would snub him and tell him to mind his own affairs butso said the hero to himselfwhat do i care ill tell him a piece of my mind and if he like to tell me a piece of his thats only fair here goes the doctor was engaged in his study said the servant but if mr smedley would step into the drawingroom he would come in a few minutes smedley stepped into the dimlylighted drawingroom accordingly which to his consternation he found already had an occupant the doctors niece was at the piano smedley for once in a way behaved like a coward and having advanced a step or two into the room suddenly turned tail and retreated dont go mr smedley said a pleasant voice behind him uncle will be here in a minute oh igoodevening miss violet im afraid of not of me are you ill go if you like said she laughing and then youll have the room to yourself oh no please i didnt mean that wont you play or sing something miss violet so miss violet sang cherry ripe and then the doctor not having yet put in an appearance smedley asked if she would mind playing the accompaniment of down among the dead men as he would like to try it over the young lady cheerfully complied and when presently the headmaster stalked into the room he was startled and possibly a little amused to be met with the defiant shout of his head boy and he that will this health deny down among the dead mendown among the he was shaking his fist above his head after the fashion of the song at the school suppers when he suddenly stopped short at the sight of the doctor and realised the horror of the situation go on mr smedley said miss violet finish the verse we shant be a moment uncle but smedley could as soon have finished that verse as fly up the chimney so the doctors niece finished it for him and then with a goodnight mr smedley thank you very much for the song she tripped out of the room leaving the hero to his fate it was not a very terrible fate after all you and my niece have been having quite a concert said the doctor i hope i did not disturb you sir miss violet was so kind as to play some accompaniments for me while i was waiting for you you want to see me what is it smedley smedley till this moment had forgotten the object of his delicate mission and now suddenly recalled to business felt less taste than ever for his task still he must go through with it it was about mr railsfords house sir that smedley is not a subject for discussion i know sir all i mean is that the whole school will suffer that increases the responsibility of those who can rectify all by owning their misconduct wont it be possible to make some exceptions sir our school sports will go all to pieces without ainger and barnworth and some of their fellows you must see they do not go to pieces smedley said the doctor it would be unworthy of the school if they did as for mr railsfords boys i have said what i had to say to them and have nothing more to add but mr railsford himself sir began the captain desperately playing his last card we hoped he it is a most unfortunate thing for everyone said the doctori include myself and you and mr railsford we are called upon to make a sacrifice and there should be no question about our being willing all of us to make it for the good of the school goodnight smedley goodnight smedley walked back humming cherry ripe to himself and feeling decidedly depressed about things in general chapter ten arthur puts two and two together sir digby oakshott of oakshott park baronet was down on his luck his heart had been set on saving his house singlehanded by a brilliant discovery of the miscreants to whom it owed its present disgrace it had been a busy week for him he had had three or four fights a day with outraged suspects and had not invariably got the best of them besides in his devotion to the public service his private duties had been neglected and the pile of impositions had grown with compound interest worst of all his own familiar friend had lifted up his heel against him and had openly gibed at his efforts this was the most unkindest cut of all and sir digby felt it deeply whats the use of going on fooling said arthur one evening when the tension was becoming acute why cant you shut up making an ass of yourself look here arthur old man said the baronet deprecatingly i dont want to be jawed by you its no business of yours what i cant make out pursued his friend sarcastically is why you havent tried to smell the chaps out by means of smiley now if you let smiley have a good sniff of that bit of rope on your watchchain and then turn him out into the square hed ferret them out for you i tell you what old man if its coming to a regular row between us two hadnt you better say so at once and get done with it who says anything about a row all i say is youre in a precious good way of getting yourself kicked round the house the way youre going on and i dont much mind if im asked to lead off youd better try to kick me thats all said dig ill see what i can do for you some day but i say dig cant you see what a howling ass youre making of yourself no i dont know so much about asses as you do responded dig daresay not if you were in the company of one all day long as i am youd soon throw it up i tell you my here the speaker suddenly broke off and looked affectionately at the troubled face of his old chum look here dig old man i dont want to have a row with you no more do you i vote we dont hang a row said dig but it seems to me arthur you dont care twopence whether the chaps found out or not arthurs face clouded over perhaps i do perhaps i dont i dont see were called upon to show them up but look what a mess the house is in till theyre bowled out well never get hold of a bat all the season jolly bad luck i know but we must lump it dig you must drop fooling about with your clues dont get in a wax now ive got my reasons whatever do you mean do you know who it was then come in whos there the intruder was the baby jukes who carried half a dozen letters in his hand one of which he presented to the two chums one for you said he theyre all the same wake gave bateson and me a penny apiece for writing them out and we knocked off twenty he says hed have sent you one apiece only he knows youve not two ideas between you catch hold and he departed smiling sweetly with his tongue in his cheek just in time to avoid a caesar flung by the indignant baronet at his head those kids are getting a drop too much said dig theyve no more respect for their betters than smiley has whats this precious letter the letter was addressed to messrs herapath and oakshott and was signed by wake of the fifth although written in the inelegant hand of master jukes the baby central criminal court grandcourt the assizes will open this evening in the forum at sharp you are hereby summoned on urgent business hereof fail not at your peril what do that mean again inquired dig what right has wake to threaten us dont you see wake whose father is a pettifogging lawyer is going to get up a makebelieve law courti heard him talk about it last term instead of the regular debating evening the best of it is we kids shall all be in it instead of getting stuck on the back bench to clap as we generally are hes no business to tell us to fail not at our peril growled dig what will they do try somebody for murder perhaps orwhy of course exclaimed arthur theyll have somebody tried for that bickers row by the way said dig returning to the great question on his mind you never told me if you really knew who did it arthurs face clouded again how should i know said he shortly whats the use of talking about it there was something mysterious in herapaths manner which disturbed his friend it was bad enough not to be backed up in his own schemes but to feel that his chum knew something that he did not was very hard on sir digby now he recalled it arthur had all along been somewhat reserved about the business he had made sport of other fellows theories but he had never disclosed his own yet it was evident he had his own ideas on the subject was it come to this that after all these terms of confidence and alliance a petty secret was to come between them and cloud the hitherto peaceful horizon of their fellowship digby perhaps did not exactly put the idea into these poetical words but the matter troubled him quite as much now it is my intention at this place generously to disclose to the reader what was hidden from sir digby oakshott baronet and from everyone else at grandcourtnamely that arthur herapath was fully persuaded in his own mind that he knew the name of the arch offender in the recent outrage and was resolved through thick and thin to shield him from detection he was perfectly aware that in so doing he made himself an accessory after the fact but that was a risk he was prepared to run only it decided him to keep his knowledge to himself arthur was not a particularly sharp boy his qualities were chiefly of the bulldog order he did not take things in with the rapidity of some fellows but when he did get his teeth into a fact he held on like grim death so it was now in the first excitement of the discovery he had been as much at sea and as wild in his conjectures as anybody but after a little he stumbled upon a piece of evidence which gave him a serious turn and had kept him serious ever since on the morning of the discovery arthur being in the neighbourhood of the bootbox thought he would have a look round there was no fear of his mistaking the place he had been there before and seen mr bickers come out of the sack everything was pretty much as it had been left the sack lay in the corner where it had been thrown and the cord all except the piece which the baronet had secured was there too on the dusty floor could clearly be perceived the place where mr bickers had rolled about in his uncomfortable shackles during the night and on the ledge of the dim window which let light into the bootbox from the lobby still stood the tumbler which arthur himself had officiously fetched an hour or two ago one or two things occurred to arthur which had not previously struck him one was that the door of the bootbox was a very narrow one and closingto by a spring it would either have had to be held open or propped open while mr bickers was being hauled in by his captors he found that to hold it open wide he would have to get behind it and shut himself up between it and the stairs most likely all hands being required for securing the victim the captors would have taken the precaution to prop the door open by some means so as to be ready for their deeplaid and carefully prepared scheme so arthur groped about and discovered a twistedup wedge of paper which by its battered look and peculiar shape had evidently been stuck at some time under the door to keep it from closingto he quietly pocketed this prize on the chance of its being useful and after possessing himself of the sack and cord and two wax vestas lying on the floor one of which had been lit and the other had not he prepared to quit the scene as he was going upstairs he caught sight of one other objectnot however on the floor but on the ledge of the cornice above the door this was a matchbox of the kind usually sold by street arabs for a halfpenny arthur tried to reach it but could not get at it even by jumping the fellow who put that there must have been over six feet said he to himself with some trouble he got a stick and tipped the box off the ledge and as he did so it occurred to him that whereas the dust lay a quarter of an inch thick on the ledge and whereas the matchbox had no similar coating of dust but was almost clean it must have been put up there recently he opened the box and looked inside it contained wax vestas with curiously coloured purple heads which on examination corresponded exactly with the matches he had picked up on the floor of the bootbox oh said arthur to himself very red in the face heres a go and he bolted up to his room dig as it happened was out not altogether to his chums regret who set himself with somewhat curious agitation to examine his booty first of all he examined once more the matchbox and satisfied himself that there was no doubt about the identity of its contents with the stray vestas he had picked up the result was decisive the box had been placed above the door very recently by someone who unless he stood on a form or climbed on somebody elses back must have been more than six feet high no one puts matches above doors by accident whoever put it there must have meant itand more than that must have opened it and dropped one out inside the bootbox now considered the astute arthur it was pitch dark when bickers was collared lights were out and the fellows thought theyd have a glim handy in case of need they struck one and spilt one and shoved the box up there in case they should want it again i say what a clever chap i am the tall chap this box belongs to did the job eh an expert might possibly find a flaw in this clue but arthur was a little proud of himself next he spread out the sack and inspected the cord there was not much to help him here one would suppose and yet arthur being once on a good tack thought it worth his while to look closely at these two relics the sack was not the ordinary type of potatosack which most people associate with the term but more like a large canvas pillowcase such as some article of furniture might be packed in or which might be used to envelop a small bath and its contents on a railway journey arthur perceived that it had been turned inside out and took the trouble to reverse it it was riddled with holes some of them to admit the running cords which had closed round the neck and elbows of the unfortunate mr bickers and some notably that in the region of the nose made hastily with the motive of giving the captive a little ventilation arthur could not help thinking as he turned the sack outside in that it would have been nicer for mr bickers to have the comparatively clean side of the canvas next to his face instead of the very grimy and travelstained surface which had fallen to his lot but these speculations gave place to other emotions as he discovered two black initials painted on the canvas and still legible under their covering of dirt and grease there was no mistaking them and arthur gave vent to a whistle of consternation as he deciphered an mr now as arthur and everybody else knows mr may mean midland railway but the midland railway is not six feet two inches and does not carry wax vestas about him or drop them on the floor of the boot box arthur gaped at those initials for fully three minutes and then hurriedly hid the sack away in the cupboard he had still one more point to clear up he pulled the wedge of paper out of his pocket and began nervously to unroll it it was frayed and black where the door had ground it against the floor but on beginning to open it it turned out to be a portion of a torn newspaper it was a standard of february two days agoand arthur whistled again and turned pale as he saw a stamp and a postmark on the front page and read a fragment of the addressford esquire grandcourt that settles it clean he muttered to himself i say whod have thought it then he sat down and went over the incidents of the last twentyfour hours last nightit is sad to have to record itarthur had been out in the big square at halfpast nine when he should have been in bed he had been over to find a ball which he had lost during the morning while playing catch with dig out of the window on his way backhe remembered it nowhe had had rather a perilous time first of all he had nearly run into the arms of branscombe the captain of bickerss house who was inconveniently prowling about at the time probably in search of some truant of his own house then in doubling to avoid this danger he had dimly sighted mr bickers himself taking a starlight walk on railsfords side of the square finally in his last bolt home he had encountered railsford stalking moodily under the shadow of his own house and too preoccupied to notice still less to challenge the truant all this arthur remembered now and carrying his mind a day or two further back he recalled mr bickerss uninvited visit to the house arthur had painful cause to remember itand railsfords evident resentment of the intrusion and the threatenings of slaughter which had been bandied about between the two houses ever since why said arthur to himself its as clear as a pikestaff i see it all now bickers said it was about a quarter to ten when he was collared no fellows would be about then and certainly no one would know that he would be passing our door except marky marky must have been actually hanging about for him when i passed what a pity i didnt stop to see the fun yes hed got his sack ready and had jammed the door open with this paper and got his matches handy bickers would never see him till he came close up and then marky would have the sack on in two twos before he could halloa my eye i would never have believed it of marky served bickers right of course and itll be a lesson to him but itll be hot for marky if hes found out bickers says there may have been more than one fellow on the job but i dont fancy it if mark had had anybody hed have got me to help him because it would be all in the family and id be bound to keep it dark wouldnt he turn green if he knew id twigged him anyhow ill keep it as close as putty now and help him worry through very knowing of him to go with a candle and let him out this morning and look so struck all of a heap he took me in regularly arthur said this to himself in a tone which implied that if mark had been able to take him in it was little to be wondered at that all the rest of the house had been hoodwinked hard luck thought he condescendingly i darent tell dig hes such a gossip it would be all over the place in a day wonder if id best let marky know ive spotted him think not he wouldnt like it and as long as hes civil ill back him up for daisys sake then having stumbled on to the thought of home it occurred to him that since the opening day when he had sent a postcard to announce his arrival he had not yet troubled his relatives with a letter this term it was a chance while he was in the humour to polish them off now so he took up his pen and thus discoursed to his indulgent sister dear damarks all right so far he doesnt hit it with a lot of the chaps and now and then we hate him but he lets dig and me alone and doesnt interfere with smiley i hope you and he keep it up because it would make me look rather foolish if it was all off especially as dimsdale and one or two of the chaps happen to have heard about it and have bets on that it wont last over the summer holidays im getting on very well and working hard at french je suis allant a commencer translater une chose par moliere le prochain term si je suis bon theres a howling row on in the house just now bickers got nobbled and sacked the other night and shoved in the bootbox and nobody knows who did it ive a notion but im bound to keep it dark for the sake of a mutual friend it would be as rough as you like for him if it came out but i believe in assistant un boiteux chien au travers de la stile so im keeping it all dark ponsford has been down on us like a sack of coals theyve shoved forward our dinnerhour to one oclock so were regularly dished over the sports especially as saturday afternoon has been changed into morning the house will go to the dogs now mais que est les odds si longtemps que vous etes heureuses dig sends his love he and i remember the loved ones at home and try to be good by the way do you think pater could go another five bob im awfully hard up my dear daisy and should greatly like not to get into evil ways and borrow from dig can you spare me a photograph to stick up on the mantelpiece to remind me of you always you neednt send a cabinet one because they cost too much id sooner have a cartedevisite and the rest in stamps if you dont mind im doing my best to give marky a legup i could get him into a row and a half if i liked but for your sake im keeping it all dark i hope youll come down soon it will be an awful game if you do and ill promise to keep the fellows from grinning maintenant il faut que je close haut donnez mon amour a mere et pere et esperant que vous etes tout droit souvenez me votre aimant frere arthur herapath dig envoie son amour a tous daisy might have been still more affected by this brotherly effusion than she was had not she received a letter by the same post from mark himself telling her of his later troubles and containing a somewhat more explicit narrative of recent events than had been afforded in the letter of his prospective brotherinlaw i am i confess almost at a loss said he i do not like to believe that anyone in the house can have the meanness to involve us all in this misfortune by his own guilty silence much depends now on the spirit which my prefects show i believe myself that if they take a proper view of the situation we may weather the storm but the new order of things hits them harder than anyone else for it excludes them from football cricket and the sports and i fear it is too much to expect that they will even try to make the best of it i begin to feel that a master after all if he is to do any good must be a sort of head boy himself and i would be thankful if my seniors let me into their confidence and we were not always dealing with one another at arms length all this i fear is uninteresting to you but it means a good deal to me the flighty arthur does not appear to be much cast down by our troubles i wish i could help him to a little of the ballast he so greatly needs but although i am the master of this house i seem scarcely ever to see him i hear him though i hear him this minute he and his chum occupy the room over me and when they execute a war dancewhich occurs on an average six times a dayit makes me tremble for my ceiling i have a notion arthur spends his weekly allowance rather recklessly and am thinking of suggesting to your father that a reduction might be judicious etcetera etcetera had railsford guessed as he wrote these rather despondent lines that his youthful kinsman in the room above was hugging himself for his own astuteness in tracking out his railsfords villainy he might perhaps have regarded the situation of affairs as still less cheerful as it was after the first discovery the hope had begun to dawn upon the master of the shell as it had already dawned on barnworth that some good might even result from the present misfortunes of the house and as the days passed he became still more confirmed in the hope and with his usual sanguine temper thought he could see already railsfords house starting on a new career and turning its troubles to credit alas mark railsford had rough waters still to pass through and the house before it was to start on its new career had several little affairs to wind up and dispose of among others the central criminal court assizes were coming on and the boys were summoned at their peril not to fail in appearing on the occasion chapter eleven a cause celebre wake of the fifth was one of those restless vivacious spirits who with no spare time on their hands contrive to accomplish as much as any ordinary halfdozen people put together he formed part of the much despised band of fellows in his form contemptuously termed muggers in other words he read hard and took no part in the desultory amusements which consumed the odd moments of so many in the house and yet he was an excellent cricketer and runner as the school was bound to acknowledge whenever it called out its champions to do battle for it in the playingfields more than that if anyone wanted anything doing in the way of literary sportin the concoction of a squib or the sketching of a caricature wake was always ready to take the work upon himself and let who liked take the credit he had a mania for verses and epigrams he was reputed a bit of a conjuror and no one ever brought a new puzzle to grandcourt which wake of railsfords could not sooner or later find out among other occupations wake had for some time past acted as secretary for the house discussion societyan old institution which for years had droned along to the wellknown tunesthat wellington was a greater man than napoleon that shakespeare was a greater poet than homer that womens rights are not desirable that the execution of charles the first was unjustifiable etcetera etcetera but when six months ago trill of the sixth the old secretary left grandcourt and wake at the solicitation of the prefects who lacked the energy to undertake the work themselves consented to act as secretary the society entered upon a new career the new secretary alarmed his patrons by his versatility and energy the old humdrum questions vanished almost completely from the programme and were replaced by such interesting conundrums as is life worth living ought the daily news to be taken in at the school library what is a lie and so on beyond that he boldly appropriated evenings for other purposes than the traditional debate on one occasion he organised a highly successful reading of coriolanus in which the juniors to their vast delight were admitted to shout as citizens another evening was given to impromptu speeches every member who volunteered being called upon to draw a subject out of a hat and make a speech upon it there and then and more than once the order of the day was readings and recitations in which the younger members were specially encouraged to take part and stood up gallantly to be shot at by their critical seniors whatever might be said of this novel departure from old tradition no one could deny that the discussion society had looked up wonderfully during the last six months the forum was generally crowded and everyone from prefect to baby took more or less interest in the proceedings no one after the first few meetings questioned wakes liberty to arrange what programme he liked and the house was generally kept in a pleasant flutter of curiosity as to what the volatile secretary would be up to next the central criminal court was his latest invention and it need scarcely be said the idea at the present juncture was so startling that a quarter of an hour before the hour of meeting the forum was packed to its fullest extent and it was even rumoured that mr railsford had promised to look in during the evening it was evident directly to the juniors that the proceedings had been carefully thought out and settled by the secretary in consultation with some of the wise heads of the house the room was arranged in close imitation of a court of justice the bench was a chair raised on two forms at one end the witnessbox and the dock were raised spaces railed off by cord from the rest of the court rows of desks represented the seats of the counsel and two long forms slightly elevated above the level of the floor were reserved for the accommodation of the jury the general public and witnessesinwaiting were relegated to the rear of the court the question was as everyone entered who is who who is to be the judge and who is to be the prisoner and who are to be the counsel this natural inquiry was answered after the usual style of the enterprising secretary every one on entering was asked to draw out of a hat a folded slip of paper which assigned to him the part he was to play the only parts reserved from the lot being that of judge which of course was to be filled by ainger and that of senior counsels for the prosecution and defence which were undertaken respectively by barnworth and felgate it was suspected later on that a few of the other parts were also prearranged but no one could be quite sure of this what are you said dig pulling a long face over his piece of paper im junior counsel for the defence said arthur proudly what are you a wretched witness said the baronet what a spree wont i pull you inside out when i get you in the box my boy there was a call for order and ainger mounting the bench said this is quite an experiment you fellows it may be a failure or it may go off all right it depends on how we do our best the idea is that a prisoner is to be tried for murder delight among the juniors barnworth who is the counsel for the prosecution has prepared the story and felgate has been told what the line to be taken against the prisoner is so that he might prepare his defence these are the only two who know exactly what they are to do beforehand all the rest will have to act according to the papers they have drawn who has drawn prisoner amid much laughter stafford blushingly owned the soft impeachment and was called upon to enter the dock which he did looking rather uncomfortable and as if he half repented his consent to take a part in the proceedings now proceeded ainger consulting a paper the twelve jurymen are to go into the box there the twelve boys with jury on their papers obeyed they were a motley crew some being fifthform boys some shellfish and some babies and by the odd irony of fate the one who had drawn the foremans ticket was jukes the baby now the witnesses go to the back seats there youll find on each the name you will be called by and a short note of what your evidence is to be you will have to listen very carefully to barnworths story so as to know exactly what its all about there was a laugh at this some thought it a trifle queer that witnesses should have to learn what their evidence was to be from notes given them in court and from counsels speech but they were young and did not know much of law courts of course you must not show one another your notes said ainger that would spoil all tata said the baronet rather dismally to his chum they call me tomkins the junior counsel for the prosecution of course are to sit behind barnworth and for the defence behind felgate you must listen carefully as you may have to help in the crossexamination the rest of the public go to the back and now we are ready to begin usher call silence in the court tilbury whose proud office it was to act in this capacity shouted order there shut up in a loud voice wake who acted as clerk read out the name of the case regina versus bolts the jury answered to their names and promised to bring in a true verdict the prisoner was called upon to plead guilty or not guilty and answered not guilty and then barnworth rose and opened the case for the prosecution my lord and gentlemen of the jury he began the prisoner at the bar is charged with the wilful murder of john smith on the night of tuesday february this was interesting for tuesday february was the date of the bickers affair i shall as briefly as possible narrate the circumstances of this unfortunate affair the prisoner thomas bolts is a workman in the employ of a large firm of engineers in this neighbourhood in which the murdered man was also engaged as a foreman and overseer it is unnecessary gentlemen of the jury to explain to you that the works in question are divided into several distinct departments or shops i need not describe them all but two of them were the screw department and the boiler department smith was foreman and overseer of the screw department while the prisoner was one of the skilled workmen in the boiler department for some time past illfeeling had existed between the men of the boiler department and the deceased on account of his interference with them and this illfeeling appears to have culminated a few days before the murder on account of an intrusion made by smith into the boiler department and the alleged assault of one of the men there employed every one saw now what was coming and pricked up his ears in anticipation ainger who had had as little idea of the turn things were going to take as anybody else grew fidgety and wished wake had shown more discretion but it was too late to stop the case now this assault occurred i believe on the nd of february no the rdthe day before whispered ranger who acted as junior counsel for the prosecution i am obliged to my learned friend for correcting me this occurred on the rd the day before the murder now gentlemen of the jury i ask your attention to the occurrences which followed at the time of the assault the prisoner in the absence of the head foreman was acting as overseer of his shop and witnesses will prove that he protested against the behaviour of the deceased and was in consequence insulted by smith i mention this to show that a personal grudge existed between the two men stafford whose role as prisoner may or may not have been the result of mere accident began not to like the turn things were taking on the th everything went well till the evening although it is stated a formal complaint of smiths interference was made through the regular foreman of the boilershop as will appear in evidence in the evening of that daythat is about eight oclocka meeting of the heads of the various departments was held in a distant part of the works which was attended by smith as well as the other foremen the meeting lasted till and smith was last seen proceeding to his own quarters in the neighbourhood of the boilershop on the morning of the th a workman named simple on entering the coalcellar under the stairs of the boilershed stumbled against a human body and being frightened gave an alarm the foreman of the boiler department accompanied by the prisoner and one or two other men proceeded to the spot and found the body of the deceased lying on the floor among the coals enveloped in a sack and bound hand and foot he was alive at the time and on being released stated that on passing the door of the boilershed on the previous evening he had been seized from behind by some person unknown and after being bound in the sack had been dragged into the cellar and shut up there for the night he was much exhausted when found and on the evening of the th succumbed to the injuries he had received some of the juniors breathed again it was very like the story of mr bickers only mr bickers was alive and kicking still it was much more satisfactory for the present purposes to have the fellow out of the way now gentlemen of the jury proceeded barnworth putting his hands in his pockets and addressing himself particularly to jukes the baby i ask your particular attention to a few facts at the time of the murder the prisoner who is usually working in his own shop was observed to be absent and no satisfactory account can be given of his whereabouts further than that a witness will prove to you that after the quarrel on the previous day he was heard to say that he would pay the deceased out it will also be proved that on the same afternoon he procured several yards of cord from a neighbouring shop which the maker will identify as very like the cord used for binding the murdered man finally on an inquiry made by the head of the firm on a question being put to each man in the boiler department in succession it was observed that the accused gave his replies with evident confusion and alarm for these reasons gentlemen of the jury and others which will come out in evidence i shall ask you by your verdict to find the prisoner guilty of the wilful murder of john smith this seemed a very strong case and one or two of the jury rather wondered that the judge did not at once direct them to bring in a verdict of guilty however as it appeared to be the usual thing to hear evidence they waited the first witness called was job walker and in response to the call blyth of the fifth stepped into the box his evidence related to the feud between the murdered man and the men in the boilershop and he gave an account of the intrusion of smith on the night of the rd and of the quarrel which ensued blyth in fact related what had happened in the common room at railsfords that evening only changing names and places in accordance with barnworths story when his examination in chief was concluded felgate rose and said i have one or two questions to ask you mr job walker you say you were in the boilershop during the whole of the evening in question where was the proper foreman of the shop at the time he was out was work going on as usual in his absence pretty much what do you mean by pretty much were you working yourself great delight of the juniors for blyth had been one of the chief rioters well said he perhaps i was a little slack laughter who was in charge of the shop at the time the prisoner and another workman called flounders and pray were they slack too as you call it yesthey were no good at all laughter were you present when the proper foreman returned yes i was did he say anything to the prisoner he seemed in a great rage did they come to blows nobut i shouldnt have been surprised if they had that will do mr job walker barnworth asked another question before mr walker stepped down did you notice what took place between the prisoner and the deceased yes the deceased when he came in told the prisoner he was no good and sent him to his place and took charge of the shop the prisoner was very angry and said he would like to pay smith out the general opinion was that blyth had acquitted himself well and he was cheered by the public as he stood down timothy simple was next called and simson rather pale and scared looking answered to the name the examination of this witness was left to ranger who got him to narrate the circumstances of his finding the body of the deceased on the morning of the th the unfortunate youth seemed to forget that the trial was a mock one and coloured up and stammered and corrected himself as if the life of a fellowbeing actually depended on his evidence felgate after a hurried communication from his junior only asked a very few questions in crossexamination did you observe if the body was lying with its head to the door or its feet i really couldnt say it was so dark and i was so horrified was the key of the cellar always on the outside of the door yes generally it must have been because i locked it behind me when i ran out who would be the last person at night to go to the cellar would the foreman go round and lock up i dont know i suppose so you wouldnt swear that the foreman did not usually keep the key at night in his own room nothat is yes do you mean i wouldnt swear he did or didnt you would not swear he did not keep it i dont know but you wouldnt swear he didnt i couldnt because if i dont know if you dont know you couldnt swear he didnt do it come tell the jury yes or no mr simple it is an important question simson looked up and down half a dozen friends were winking at him suggestively from different parts of the court and he couldnt make out their meaning at length he perceived munger nodding his head and as munger had lent him a crib to ovid the day before he decided to refer to him yes he said i thought so said felgate why could you not say that before mr simple and simson descended from his perch amid laughter and jeers not quite sure whether he had not committed a crime beside which the offence of the prisoner at the bar was a trifle call william tomkins said barnworth william tomkins was called and dig with his tawny mane more than usually dishevelled and an excited look on his face entered the box he glared round him defiantly and then dug his hands into his pockets and waited for his questions your name is william tomkins began barnworth sir william tomkins baronet said the witness amidst laughter to be sure i beg your pardon sir william and what are you pray a baronet loud laughter a baronet in reduced circumstances i fear you work in the boiler department of this factory all right go on here the judge interposed the witness must remember that he is bound to answer questions properly unless he does so i shall order him to be removed this somewhat damped the defiant tone of digby and he answered the further questions of counsel rather more amiably these had reference to the discovery of the body on the morning of the th with the details of which the reader is already acquainted the public began to get a little tired of this constant repetition of the same story and were about to vote the proceedings generally slow when a double event served to rouse their flagging attention mr railsford entered the court as a spectator and was accommodated with a seat on the bench beside the judge at the same moment barnworth having ended his questions arthur herapath junior counsel for the defence rose to his feet and said now sir william tomkins baronet have the goodness to look at me and answer a few questions i would advise you to be careful the baronet replied by putting his tongue in his cheek and giving a pantomimic wave of his fist in the direction of the learned counsel now sir william tomkins baronet how old are you my lad find out said sir william hotly thats what i mean to do answer me sir or ill get the beak to run you in for contempt of court come and do it said the witness red in the face here the judge again interposed the learned junior must confine himself to the case before us or i shall have to ask mr felgate to conduct the crossexamination all serene my lord rejoined the learned junior who was thoroughly enjoying himself of course if your lordship think the questions not important i wont press it against your lordships desire im obliged to your lordship for your lordships advice and ill pull your nose dimsdalethis was in a parenthesisif you dont shut up now sir william tomkins baronet you say you saw the prisoner pulled out of the sack i never said anything of the sort my lord i must ask your lordship to commit this man for perjury hes telling crackers i think he said he saw the murdered man pulled out of the sack said the judge thats what i said how came you to say you didnt eh sir didnt i tell you to be careful or youd get your hair combed a way you dont fancy now what i want to know is whats the width of the door of the cellar look here said the witness if you want to make an ass of yourself youd better shut up whats that got to do with it its quite a proper question said the judge there you are said arthur delighted im obliged to your lordship for your lordships remarks now sir william thingamy what do you mean sir by refusing to answer the question ive a good mind to ask his lordship to send you to penal servitude now what about the door i dont know anything about it and i dont care ha ha youll have to care my boy could two chaps go through it together come and try said the baronet snorting with wrath you must answer the question witness said the judge no he knows two chaps couldnt he measured it himself and found it was only twentyeight inches wide who measured it asked one of the jury why herapath that idiot there arthur was somewhat sobered by this piece of evidence as well as by a significant consultation on the bench which he rather feared might relate to his conduct of the case thats what i wanted to get at said he now sir william whats the height of that door eh whats the good of asking me when you measured it yourself you duffer didnt you tell me yourself it was seven feet two to the top of the ledge there you are keep your hair on thats what i wanted seven foot two now suppose you were told a box of wax lights was found stuck upon that ledge and that two of the matches out of it were found on the floor of the bootboxcellar i meanwhat should you think it is hardly evidence is it to ask a witness what he would think suggested barnworth oh isnt it easy a bit and youll see what were driving at your lordship ill trouble your lordship to ask the learned chap not to put me off my run come mr whatsyourname what should you think dig mused a bit and then replied i should think it was a little queer of course you would so it is a little queer said arthur winking knowingly at his future brotherinlaw now could you reach up to the top of that ledge my little man you be blowed responded the baronet who resented this style of address that means you couldnt when youre about four feet higher than you are youll be able to do it now could the prisoner reach up to it no no more could you with your boots and threeandsixpenny sunday tile on order in the court really your lordship your lordship ought to sit on this chap perhaps your lordships friend on your lordships right would kindly give him a hundred lines when next he comes across him now mr baron and squire and knight of the shire and all the rest of it i want to know if theres any chap in our housei mean the boiler shopcould reach up there mind your eye now ainger could by jumping i didnt ask you anything about jumping you duffer how tall would a chap need to be to reach up there about double your measureover six foot there you are now is there any chap in our boilershop over six feet no i knew youd say that think again what about the foreman and he gave a side inclination of his head towards the unconscious railsford oh him yes hes over six foot go down two places for saying him instead of he there you are my lord weve got it at last bowled the chap out clean first ball thats our case only theres plenty more to be got out first well trouble your lordship to bring the chap in not guilty when its all done and he nodded knowingly to the jury railsford had sat and listened to all this in a state of the completest mystification not having heard barnworths opening statement he had no glimmer of a suspicion that the cause celebre occupying the attention of this august assembly was anything but a pleasant fiction from beginning to end and he had been wondering to himself whether such performances conducted in the irregular style which he had witnessed could be of any good however coming as a guest for the master of the house was always a visitor on such occasions he deemed it best not to interfere just then he would give arthur a little friendly advice as to the conduct of a junior counsel later on but he was the only unconscious person in the court the listeners had been quick to pick up the drift of barnworths opening story and equally quick to detect the line of defence taken up by felgate and his vivacious junior they kept their eyes fixed most of the time on railsford to note how he took it and when arthur reached his triumphant climax some among the juniors fully expected to see their master fall on his knees and plead guilty before the whole court instead of that he laughed and turning to the judge said in an audible voice this seems very amusing but its all hebrew to me is this the end i think weve had nearly enough for tonight said ainger who himself felt rather uneasy lest matters should go any further not that he laid any stress on arthurs wonderful discoverythat merely amused him but he foresaw a danger of the tone of the proceedings becoming offensive and considered it better to interpose while yet there was time gentlemen he said as far as the case has gone i think i may say it has been ably conducted and patiently listened to as our time is nearly up i adjourn the hearing till a future occasion jolly hard luck said arthur to his senior id got plenty more to come out youve done quite enough for one evening said felgate grinning the rest will keep chapter twelve throwing down the gauntlet arthurs great hit at the central criminal court was the topic in the junior circles at railsfords for some days it was hardly to be expected that sir digby oakshott would share in the general admiration which fell to his friends lot that young baronet had a painful sense of having come off second best at the trial and the relations between the friends became considerably strained in consequence what made it harder for dig was that arthur had suddenly gained quite a prestige among the lower boys of the house who without being too curious arrived at the conclusion that he knew a thing or two about railsford in connection with the row about bickers and was keeping it dark strangely enough from the same cause railsford himself leapt into sudden popularity with his juniors for if he argued they was the man who paid out bickers for them then although it put them to a little inconvenience they were resolved as one man to back their hero up and cover his retreat to the best of their ability the master himself was considerably surprised at the sudden outburst of affection towards himself he hoped it meant that his influence was beginning to tell home on the minds of his youthful charges and he wrote cheerfully to daisy about it and said he had scarcely hoped in so short a time to have made so many friends among his boys tell you what said arthur one evening after discussing the virtues of his future kinsman with some of the shell it wouldnt be a bad dodge to get up a testimonial for marky i know a stunning dodge for raising the wind good idea said tilbury im game lets give it him soon to get him in a goodhumour next week suggested someone no wed better do it just before the easter holidays replied arthur thatll start him well for next term that evening the differences between the two friends were patched up dig under a pledge of secrecy was initiated into the whole mystery of the sack and the wedge of paper and the wax vestas promising on his part to respect his friends reputation in the matter of the fiftysix billion snowball the baronet was fully impressed with the importance of his friends disclosures its a regular case said he i never thought it of him we must keep it dark and give him a leg out i fancy so said arthur its a sort of family affair you see its half a pity he cant know that weve bowled him out and are sticking to him but i suppose its best not to let him suspect it nobetter keep it all dark hell know all about it some day and the two confederates went to bed happy that night in the consciousness that they were restored to one anothers confidence and that they were standing between their miscreant kinsman and the punishment which properly belonged to his crime on the following morning a notice appeared on the common room door signed by ainger summoning the house to meet after tea on particular business the important business had no connection with the affaire bickers but was the captains first move towards pulling up the house to the proud position he designed for it now you fellows said he in the course of a short spirited speech i neednt tell you that our house is down on its luck this term cheers we are in the black books of the doctor as you knowand we cant well help it somebody in the house thinks fit to tell a lie and gets us all into trouble but we arent going down on our knees to that person or any other sneak to help us when we mean to help ourselves loud cheers now this is one way i propose we help ourselves we are you all know cut out of the sports and school cricket and all that sort of thing shame very well but they cant prevent our getting up house sports of our own and a house eleven and showing that we arent going to be put down applause i mean to train hard myself and run the mile if i can in quicker time than smedley or anyone else in the school sports and unless im mistaken barnworth means to show that railsfords house can jump an inch higher than any other house at grandcourt even though we dont get a prize for it tremendous cheers and i am not so sure if wake doesnt press their second man pretty close bravo wake you youngsters will have to do your share we want a railsfords fellow to lick the time of every event in the school sports loud cheers we may not be able to do it in all but well know the reason why if we dont so we will youll have to sit up some of you if youre going to do it but of course youll do that rather railsfords sports will be held this day three weeksjust a week after the school sports so we shall know what weve got to beat thats one thing ive got to say every boy here should enter for some event or other and see he wins it applause the next thing is this cricket is coming on it begins the saturday after the sports we arent going to be done out of our cricket to please anybody tremendous enthusiasm and waving of caps we intend to turn out as stiff a house eleven as ever played in the fields and some fine day you fellows will see railsfords play the school and win applause yes and well have a second eleven too rather from the juniors mr railsford is going to back us up cheers he played in his college eleven at cambridge and hes promised to give up all his saturdays to the end of the term to coach us three cheers for railsford now the last thing whatever else can there be said the baronet in a perspiration of fervour some of you may open your eyes when i mention it but i know you wont funk it we mean to get hold of all the school prizes at grandcourt this term if we can sensation yes you may gape but its a fact of course i cant beat smedley for the gold medal yes have a try rather i mean to try and smedley will have to put on steam loud cheers then stafford is going to cut out branscombeboohoofor the melton scholarship and barnworth will get the vacant cavendish scholarship and wake and ranger and sherriff and wignet are going to walk off with all the fifthform prizes and herapath will pull off the swift exhibition and sir digby oakshott baronettremendous cheerswill win the shell history medal i say said the baronet mopping his face vehemently thats the first ive heard about that yes and our babies are going to show the way too continued the captain and on prizeday well crowd up and cheer them when they toddle up to take their prizes laughter and cheers thats all i want to say laughter and applause some of you will say im cracked no im not railsfords is going in and going to win and if you all back upso we will iwe shall do it easily cheers dont let us brag too much the school will find out what we are up to soon enough without our blowing trumpets oh theres one thing more continued the captainpositively the lastlaughterabout this row were all in it was a caddish thing whoever did it to maul a man about in the dark when he couldnt defend himselfcheersand a low thing whoever did it to tell a lie about it cheers but my advice is let the beggar alone hes an enemy to our house but we arent going to make ourselves miserable on his account let him alone dont go poking and sniffing about to try to smell him out arthur blushed violently here think of something better in spite of him were going to make railsfords the cock house at grandcourt that will be the best way to pay him out and it will take us all our time to do it without dirtying our fingers over him ainger concluded amidst a burst of cheers which quite took him aback and the meeting dispersed enthusiastically to talk over the wonderful programme and take the first steps towards carrying it out the captains words came upon most of the fellows as a surprise that there could be any other way out of their present misfortunes than by submitting to them tamely and giving up the glory of their house as a bad job the audacious proposal first took their breath away and then took possession of them they would have their revenge and here was a way open to them it scarcely occurred to any but the experienced seniors that there would be any difficulty in making aingers bold predictions true arthur for instance having heard it publicly announced that he was about to win the swift exhibition thought and behaved as if the prize were already in his hands twenty pounds ayear for three years said he complacently to his ally not a bad pot tell you what dig well get a tandem tricycle my boy with the first years money hope theyll pay it in advance dont you then we can get it after breakup and have some ripping spins in the summer holidays better fun than fooling about in switzerland with marky and daisy well either get that or i know a jolly little boat punter has for sale at teddington with a towingline and double sculls and a locker under the stern seat for grub he wanted l for it but i expect hell come down the l for ready money perhaps it would be better to buy it this summer and get the tricycle with next years money ive a good mind to write to punter tonight hadnt you better get the exhibition first suggested the baronet of course i mean to get it said arthur rather nettled i fancy aingers as good a judge of what a chap can do in that line as you are i dont know replied dig he said i was going to get the history medal but im not so sure if i shall well i did think he was letting out a bit when he said that replied arthur with a chuckle never mind well go halves in the exhibition it must be admitted that the prospect of his coming academical success did not appreciably affect arthur herapaths studies during the present term fourandahalf months is a long time to look ahead in a schoolboys career and as it happened the captains speech had suggested other matters in the immediate future which for the time being absorbed not only arthurs attention but everyone elses that evening a list of events for the house sports was exhibited on the common room door with space below each for the names of intending competitors it was noticed that the list corresponded in every particular with the list of the school sports to be held a week earlier and that the compiler who was detected by the handwriting to be barnworth had already written in brackets the names of those who had entered for each of the events in the school sports every one therefore in railsfords could see not only what he was going in for but who the competitors were whom he was expected to beat a good beginning had already been made before the list came under the notice of the juniors for the high jump which this year for some reason or other had been looked forward to as one of the principal events the signature of barnworth stood boldly underneath the dreaded names of smedley and clipstone more than that wake too had entered himself in the lists against these great competitors the entries for the mile were scarcely less interesting smedley was to run for the school and still more formidable the longlegged branscombe against them now appeared the names of ainger and stafford and the plucky ranger of the fifth and so on down the list for all the big events the prefects and the redoubtable fifthform muggers of railsfords had set their challenge and the hearts of the juniors swelled big within them as they crowded round the board to write their names against the lesser contests arthur and the baronet adopted the simple and modest method of entering themselves for everything and it was not till maple hinted something about the entrance fees mounting up to about a sovereign apiece that they drew in their horns and limited their ambitions to the long jump under fifteen the junior hurdle race and the quartermile under sixteen the other shellfish followed suit tilbury of course put himself down for throwing the cricketball under fifteen indeed some of his admirers thought he might even venture to throw against the seniors only felgate already had his name down for that event dimsdale undertook the hundred yards under fifteen against several strong opponents and on the whole among them the boys of the shell contrived to make a strong show on the list for every event within their reach when the turn came for the babies they evinced equal spirit and divided the list among them with a fierceness which augured ill for the babies of the other houses whose claims they challenged ainger and barnworth strolled down later on to examine the list and now suggested a few alterations the baronet for instance was called upon to enter for the second class of kicking the football contest and arthur was moved from the quartermile to the halfmile because a good man was wanted there to beat smythe of the schoolhouse whereas sherriff could very well be trusted to take care of the quartermile for railsfords house mr railsford presently arrived on the scene and went into the whole programme enthusiastically and in a way which won him friends among the boys more even than his reputed authorship of the bickers outrage had lately done he invited any boys who chose during the next few days to try over their event in his presence and suggested that a record of the times should be carefully kept with a view to ensure that each trial should beat the last more than that he offered a prize for the best allround record in the house and proposed that although they were not rich enough to give prizes for each event any boy who beat the school record in his competition should receive back his entrance fee this practical suggestion gave much satisfaction of course said he to one or two of those round him it is harder to run against time than against another fellow you must make up your minds for that and i would advise you to try to get the two best in our house to enter for each event so as to get the spur of a close race our times are sure to be the better for it boys liked him for that word our it sounded like a common cause and they were quick to hail the first symptom of such feeling in a master the next fortnight witnessed a smart athletic fever in the house of course it soon spread abroad what railsfords was up to and the school form generally improved in consequence in fact when the day arrived for the school sports it was generally felt that grandcourt had rarely come on to the ground better up to the mark alas grandcourt came on to the ground in two halves and on two different days when the boys of the schoolhouse roes bickerss and grovers turned out to the startingpost railsfords chafing like greyhounds in the leash turned in to their penitential dinner never mind said ainger as the distant shouts were wafted from the playingfields into the common room it will be our turn today week chapter thirteen a fly in the ointment aingers prediction that the house was not likely to get much backingup in its new efforts from felgate looked likely enough to be fulfilled while everyone else was full of athletic and scholastic fervour he remained listless and even sulky some said it was because ainger had proposed the great scheme and felgate disdained to play second riddle even to the captain others said it was because he could not win anything even if he tried others darkly hinted that he was one of the authors of the houses present disgrace and others whispered that there was no love lost between railsford and his fourth prefect in this last conjecture the gossips were right felgate and the master of the shell had not hit it from the first day of their acquaintance and within the last few days an occurrence had taken place which had brought the two into violent collision railsford on leaving his room one afternoon had been attracted by the noise of groans and weeping at the far end of the passage going in the direction of the melancholy sounds he discovered bateson the baby with a face as white as a sheet huddled up all of a heap the picture of misery and tribulation what is the matter inquired the master the sufferer did not hear him at first but on a repetition of the question he looked up and groaned oh im dying im so ill oh what shall i do railsford was alarmed the boy looked so white and trembled all over he stooped down to lift him up but bateson blubbered dont touch me please oh im dying and rolled over groaning it was no time for parleying railsford lifted him up in his arms and looked at him there were beads of perspiration on his face and a flavour of strong tobacco about his jacket bateson had been smoking the master carried him downstairs and out into the square where he set him on his feet the cool air instantly revived the unhappy boy and what it left undone a short and sharp fit of sickness completed youre better now said railsford when this little ceremony was over bateson was fain to admit it how many more cigars have you got about you inquired the master as he stalked with the delinquent at his heels into his room and closed the door the baby was pale this time with terror not with tobacco he tremblingly turned out his trousers pockets and produced a big cigar of which about a quarter had been consumed thats all really sir he faltered railsford took the cigar and sniffed it in his old college days he would not like to say he had not smoked as good a one himself very well said he handing it back to the astonished baby now bateson sit down on that chair here are some matches you must finish this cigar to the end before you leave this room the wretched bateson turned green and began to howl oh no please sir dont say that sir it will kill me please mr railsford railsford quietly lit a match and handed it to the boy bateson fairly went down on his knees and grovelled at the masters feet oh mr railsford ill promise never to touch one againi really will if youll only let me off i should die if you made me oh please railsford blew out the match and told the boy to get up i never did it before whimpered batesonit was hardly necessary to say that i didnt know it was any harm felgate said it would do me good please mr railsford may i put it in the fire ill never touch such a beastly thing again and as railsford said nothing to prevent it he flung the origin of his evils into the fire now go to your room said the master and dont be so foolish again bateson departed marvelling that he had not been thrashed for his crime but pretty effectually cured of any ambition to renew his narcotic experiments railsford had he been anyone else but master of the house would have enjoyed this little adventure as it was he did not like it for it could scarcely end where it had he astonished felgate that evening by a visit to his study felgate said he i wish to know your reason for giving bateson a cigar to smoke i give bateson a cigar sir do you deny it felgate demanded the master sternly oh said the prefect with a forced laugh i believe there was some joke about a cigar he had a great fancy to try one a scornful look came into railsfords face as he said do you really suppose felgate any good is gained by not telling the truth at once the truth sir said felgate firing up as uncandid persons always do when their veracity is questioned i dont understand you sir you understand me perfectly said railsford you know that it is against rules for boys to smoke here i wasnt smoking said felgate no you encouraged another boy to do what you dared not do yourself that is hardly creditable in a prefect felgate shifted his ground theres nothing wrong in smoking said he lots of fellows do it i do it myself said railsford bluntly but what has that to do with this matter you as a monitor are on your honour to observe the rules of the school and see that others observe them you break them yourself and encourage others to break them is there nothing wrong in that felgate said nothing and jauntily took up a book put down that book and bring me all the cigars or tobacco you have at once railsford said this quietly and firmly he had lost his shy hesitating manner with his prefects and now when for the first time he was in collision with one of their number he showed himself a stronger man than felgate at any rate had given him credit for being the prefect looked for a moment as if he would resist then he sullenly went to his locker and produced a case containing four cigars these are all you have felgate nodded they are confiscated by the rules of the school said railsford they will be returned to you after breakingup i wish i were able to return them to you now and rely on your honour not to repeat your offence i dont want them back said felgate with a sneer you may smoke them yourself sir he repented of the insult before it had left his lips railsford however ignored it and quietly taking the cigars from the case took them away with him leaving the case on the table felgates impulse was to follow him and apologise for his illbred words but his evil genius kept him back and before bedtime arrived he not only repented of his repentance but reproached himself for not saying a great deal more than he had felgate had a wonderful gift of selfdelusion he knew he had acted wrongly and meanly and yet he argued smoking is no crime and if the school rules make it one it doesnt follow that im a sinner if i have a whiff now and then he admits he smokes himself he doesnt call himself a sinner easy enough for him to be high and mighty one law for him and another for me poor young bateson had a sorry time of it for the next week in his terror at the prospect of having to smoke that awful cigar to the bitter end he had scarcely known what he was saying and it was not until felgate charged him with being a sneak that he realised he had said anything to compromise his senior felgate was not one of the vulgar noisy sort of bullies but a good deal worse he made the wretched babys life miserable with all sorts of exquisite torture he hounded him on to break rules and then caught him redhanded and held over his head threats of exposure and punishment he passed the word round the house that the boy was a telltale and little was the mercy poor bateson got either from friend or foe when that became known nor did felgate in his revengeful whims omit the orthodox functions of the bully only he took care to perform such ceremonies in private for fear of a mishap but in these precautions he unluckily reckoned without his host railsford after what had happened was hardly likely to consider batesons lot a happy one and kept a sharp lookout to prevent any mischief coming to the luckless baby on account of his confessions for some days no sign of any such trouble came under the masters notice and he was beginning to congratulate himself that felgate had taken a proper view of his delinquencies and was taking the only manly course of making amends when the smouldering fires broke out unexpectedly and fiercely master bateson was one of those practical young gentlemen who believe in having a shillings worth for a shilling and when after a day or two he heard himself called a sneak from every corner of the house it occurred to him whats the use of being called a sneak if im not one whereupon he marched off to railsford and informed him that felgate had twice screwed his arm once made him catch hold of a poker at the hot endthe proof whereof he bore on his handhad once made him stand in the corner on one foot for the space of an hour by the clock and had half a dozen times threatened him that unless he did something wrong he would accuse him of theft or some other horrible crime to the doctor by reason of which illusage and threats he the deponent went in bodily fear of his life oh and please mr railsford be sure and not let him know i told you or hell kill me railsford had another uncomfortable interview with felgate after this felgate as usual began by impugning the juniors veracity but on the masters proposing to send for the boy and let him repeat his story there and then he sullenly admitted that he might have played practical jokes on his tender person of the kind suggested when railsford said the matter was a serious one the prefect smiled deprecatingly and said it was not pleasant to him to be spoken to in this manner and that if mr railsford wished to punish him he would be glad to have it over and done with railsford said that the question in his mind was whether he would allow felgate to continue a prefect of the house whereupon felgate promptly changed colour and dropped his sneer entirely im sure said he i had no intention of hurting him i may have been a trifle inconsiderate but i didnt supposehe didnt complain to me so i could hardly know he minded it i can have very little confidence in a prefect who acts as you have done felgate you may depend on me sir not to touch him again i want to depend on more than that said the master as a prefect you hold a position of influence in the house if that influence is badly used i dont think you will have to complain any more said felgate i sincerely hope notfor you may be sure another offence of this kind could not possibly be passed over for the present i shall say no more about this and shall do my best to treat you with the same confidence as heretofore just now we need all to work together for the good of our house and the school and the boys are sure to look to the prefects to help them goodnight felgate the grimace with which the prefect returned the salute after the door closed might have convinced railsford had he seen it that he had done no good either to himself the house or the prefect by his leniency as it was he was destined to make the discovery later on felgate to all appearances resumed his old ways in the house he let young bateson alone and kept to himself his feud with the master he even attempted to pretend a languid interest in the new ambitions of his fellowprefects and at aingers request entered his name for one of the events in the sports list railsford observed with some relief that he appeared to recognise the force of the rebuke which had been administered him and with characteristic hopefulness was tempted to look upon the incident as ended it was by no means ended felgate to all appearance docile and penitent nursed his wrath within him and kept his eye open with all the keenness of a sportsman to the slightest opening for a revenge in a quiet way he continued to do a great deal in the house to thwart the spirit of enterprise which was at present knitting all factions together he sneered in a superior way at the enthusiasm all round him and succeeded in making one or two of the fellows a little ashamed of their own eagerness the funds for railsfords testimonial came in slowly the result of a fortnights hard work was only four shillings and threepence and to get even that wretched sum arthur had made himself temporary enemies all over the house he wrote an urgent letter to daisy to shell out something and strove to work on the feelings of his parents to assist him to do honour to their future soninlaw meanwhile he conceived the wild project of approaching the prefects on the subject unluckily for everybody he made his first attempt with felgate a testimonial for marky inquired that worthy what for well you know hes been pretty civil since he came and hes backed us up in that row about bickers you know we thought wed get him a ring you know hes spoons on my sister daisy and dig and i thought it would fetch him if we stuck chuckeythats the pet name he calls heron it dont you think it would be a good dodge hed be sure to be pleased if he saw your name on the list of subscribers felgate im certain of that said felgate laughing and if only id got any tin id be delighted by the way i fancy i did see a sixpence kicking about somewhere thanks awfully thatll be a stunning lift hes sure to be extra civil to you after it oh i see bribery is it said felgate laughing and what particular reason have you for getting mr chuckey a testimonial ha ha said arthur who felt bound to laugh at the seniors joke jolly good name for him oh some of the fellows think hes backed us up you know about bickers and all that thanks awfully for the sixpence felgate ill be sure and stick your name at the top of the list i say whens that trial adjourned to i dont know by the way youngster what a smart barrister you made that evening where did you pick it all up oh i dont know said arthur feeling rather flattered dig and i went and heard a chap tried at the old bailey once it was rather slow but i say do you really think i doubled up dig well he was awfully wild i dont wonder you did it splendidly whatever put all the things into your head oh i dont know said arthur getting a little tilted with all this flattery from a senior it was a notion i had not half a bad notion said felgate beginning to think the game was worth following up not one fellow in a dozen would have thought about that matchbox up on the ledge thats just it it must have been a tall chap to put it up there of course unless someone got on a chair i thought of that responded arthur grandly only there were one or two other things to come out if id had time i say do you know when its adjourned to i dont know i hope not for long id like to hear what else youve got i could never make up such things to save my life perhaps i didnt make them up said arthur who felt that for once in a way thorough justice was being done to his own cleverness you dont mean you can produce the actual matchbox why you ought to be made attorneygeneral or lord chancellor cant i though i can said arthur and something else too suppose wed found the door was kept open with a wedge of paper addressed in a certain handwriting to a certain nameeh and suppose the sack had the initials on it of the same fellow that the paper and matchbox belonged toeh that would make a pretty hot case for our side wouldnt it my word youngster youre a sharp one but i suppose its all make up not a bit of it said arthur flushed by his triumph ill believe it when i see it said felgate sceptically ill show it you now said arthur if youll promise to keep it dark im not making up a bit of it if you arent all i can say iswhere are they come and see said arthur leading the way to his study dig was out on leave in the village there you are said arthur when he had opened his locker and produced the precious relics theres the matchbox have you ever seen any others of the same kind i have i fancy i saw one once said felgate belonging to a fellow six foot two who could reach up to the ledge felgate nodded now look at that papera bit of the standard theres part of the address i fancy i know my sister daisys fist when i see it there you are that was screwed up to jam open the door to keep it from slidingto six foot two again then theres the sackprecious like an m and an r those two letters arent they and m r is precious like the initials of six foot two again i dont blame him if he did scrag old bickersvery good job and as it happens it dont hurt our house very much now were going to get all the sports and im booked for the swift exhibitionl ayear for three years we mean to back him up and thats one reason why were going to give him the testimonial though none of the chaps except dig knows about these things i say be sure you keep it quiet felgate wont you i trust you not to tell anybody a word about it dont you be afraid of me youngster said felgate id advise you to take good care of those things well have some fun with them when the trial comes on again dont go saying too much about it till then did i give you the sixpence no there it is put it down from a friend i must go now young un he departed leaving arthur to pack up his treasures amid some misgivings lest the sixpence in his hand was after all hardly worth the secret he had bought it with chapter fourteen challenging the record on the monday before railsfords sports ainger and barnworth sat rather dismally conning a document which lay on the table between them it was smedleys report of the school sports held the saturday before and was sufficiently alarming to dishearten any ordinary reader the mile race smedley branscombe time minutes seconds whew said ainger i cant beat that is the shortest ive done it in and i doubt if i could do that again fiddlesticks if you dont do it in you deserve to be sent home to the nursery but do you see branscombe gave up before the end thats odd i rather thought he was the better man of the two branscombe seems to be down on his luck altogether this term said ainger i fancy he hasnt a very sweet time at bickerss but he ought to have won the mile for all that hes got the longest legs in grandcourt and used to have the best wind gone stale said ainger and growing too fast why he must be as tall as railsford already and hes good for an inch or so more poor beggar but what about the high jump high jump smedley and clipstone a tie feet thank you said barnworth i may as well scratch at once i once jumped that but that was in the days of my youth fiddlesticks if you dont clear feet you deserve to be sent home to a daily governess said ainger laughing and by the way i hear wake has been jumping finely lately mind he doesnt do it for you wake had better mind his own business responded barnworth i a prefect and a very great person in this house should greatly resent it if a fifthform fellow beat me at the jump upon my word id give him lines cricketball clipstone yards what a poor throw felgate is sure to beat that at any rate not if he can help said barnworth in fact if i were you i would either scratch him or see someone else is in too to make sure of it unless you do we lose it do you mean hed throw short on purpose my dear fellow you are just beginning to perceive what anybody who isnt a born simpleton would have seen for himself a week ago aingers brow clouded ill enter myself then said he no you wont enter stafford stafford wont get the mile which you will a little success may keep him with us otherwise the odds are he may go over to the enemyalias your friend felgate ainger wrote staffords name down there and then in this way the two friends went through the list it was a strong record to beat and if they were doubtful of themselves they were still more doubtful of some of their juniors for instance arthur if he meant to win the long jump under sixteen would have to clear feet inches and dimsdale to secure the yards under fifteen would have to do it in seconds tilbury was safe for the cricketball in his class and arthur if he took care might beat smiths record for the shell halfmile most of the other events were decidedly doubtful and it was evident the week which remained would need to be used well if the ambitious attempt of railsfords house was to succeed by no means the least interested peruser of the list when presently it was posted up on the common room door railsford himself for a week or two past he had been as nearly happy as he could be in the congenial work of training and encouraging the youthful athletes of his house he had felt drawn to them and they to him by quite a new bond of sympathy he spared himself in nothing for the common cause and his enthusiasm was as might be expected contagious there are one or two of these records we shall not beat said the master to ainger but the majority of them we should be able to manage he spoke so hopefully that aingers spirits went up decidedly a final overhaul of the list was made and the times registered compared with the times on the school list in one or two cases railsford advised that a second man should be run with a good start in order to force the pace and through one or two names belonging to hopeless triflers or malcontents he quietly passed his pencil i see stafford has entered for the cricketball said he as well as felgate how is that we should lose the cricketball otherwise said ainger felgate may do his best if someone is against him but he wont if hes the only man in for us he has no interest in sports railsfords face clouded is stafford the best man to enter should not you or barnworth go in i think not sir stafford made some good practice yesterday and can beat the school record as it is during the next few days every spare moment at railsfords house was used in preparing for the great trial of saturday nor strange to say did the schoolwork suffer in consequence the idlers in the shell being in the way of spurts took a sudden spurt of interest in class partly for fear of being excluded by detention or otherwise from saturdays celebration and partly because the healthy condition of their bodies had begotten for the time being a healthier condition of mind arthur and the baronet actually knew their syntax for two days running and the astounding phenomenon of a perfectly empty detention room occurred on both the friday and the saturday the latter event was specially satisfactory to railsford as he was able to secure the services of monsieur lablache as assistantjudgenot exactly a popular appointment but failing any better one which fellows had to make the best of the house rose that saturday morning with a full sense of the crisis which was upon it despite felgates sneers and the jealous ridicule which floated in from outside on their efforts they felt that they stood face to face with a great chance their reputation as a house was on its trial they were boycotted by the doctor and held up as a warning to evildoers they resolved to make themselves a warning to good and evildoers alike that day and show the doctor and everyone else that the spirit was not yet knocked out of them the halfholiday at railsfords as we have said began under the new regime immediately after breakfast and ended at one oclock so that the farce of morning school did not interpose to chill the ardour of the combatants the whole house assembled in flannels in honour of the occasion the weather was very much like what the school had had a week ago if anything the ground was hardly in quite as good condition at any rate it was felt that as far as externals went the test between the two days performances would be a fair one true there was something a little chilly about the empty field the usual inspiriting crowd of partisan spectators was absent and the juniors of railsford who usually had to fight for front places felt it a little dismal when they discovered that they could occupy any position they likedeven the ladies stand arthur was very angry with himself for not getting daisy down for the occasion her presence would have lent undoubted prestige both to himself and dig as well as to railsford and if she could have given the prizes afterwards it would have been a magnificent family affair he bemoaned this omission to railsford himself as he walked down with him to the fields however just before proceedings begun the wished for excitement was supplied by three most unexpected arrivals on the course the first was that of the doctors niece who having watched the school sports a week ago with great interest and being secretly rather sorry for the misfortunes which had over taken railsfords house saw no reason why she should not take her accustomed place in the stand today the boys were just in the mood to appreciate this little act of chivalry and as she shyly walked up to the pavilion they welcomed her with a cheer which brought the blushes to her cheeks and a smile of halffrightened pleasure to her lips boys who had seen her every day for the last three months in chapel suddenly discovered that she was simply charming they greeted her much as mortals in distress would greet the apparition of the good fairy and fifty champions there and then were ready to do battle for her and only wished they had the chance the excitement of this arrival was hardly passed when another figure appeared on the scene hardly less important or less popular this was no other than smedley the school captain who had asked and obtained special leave from mr roe to be present as representing the school on the occasion he was still indignant at the disabilities imposed upon the rival house and though he by no means wished it success in its ambitious project of beating the school record his sense of fair play told him that if no one was on the ground to represent the other houses they would compete at a disadvantage if it went out that the school captain had been present everyone at any rate would have to admit there had been fair play and no opening for dispute whatever the result might be so smedley although it might be to see his own record beaten came down to the fields that morning there was a little uncertainty as to his reception at first for railsfords was in an ishmaelitish mood and was ready to call everybody an enemy who wasnt on its side but when ainger was heard to say hurrah hes a regular brick to come and back us up like this everybody jumped to the correct view of smedleys motives and cheered him scarcely less enthusiastically than they had just now cheered their queen of love and beauty i only wish he was in his flannels said arthur and would run the mile against us it would be something like to lick him off his own stride arthur was rather proud of his athletic slang what he meant was that he would sooner see ainger win the mile against smedley himself than against smedleys time never mind hes going to be the judge do you see i say old man you and ill have to sit up now this was the universal effect of the captains presence perhaps he hardly realised himself what an advantage his presence was conferring on his rivals the first event on the programme was the babies hundred yards for which our friends bateson and jukes were entered with the serious record of twentytwo seconds to beat they were both a little pale and nervous with the excitement of opening the ball and looked round wistfully first at railsford then at smedley where he stood watch in hand at the winningpost and then up at the ladies stand now youngsters said railsford do your very best you ought both of you to run it under twenty seconds are you ready now off the floodgates were opened now and from this moment till the end of the sports railsfords kept up a continual roar both bateson and jukes had little difficulty in registering a double victory for their house bateson covered the ground in nineteen seconds and jukes in twentyone while the cheers for this initial victory were in full cry the third of that mornings apparitions came upon the scene this was no other than mr bickers at sight of whom a chill fell upon the assembly what did he want there hadnt he done them harm enough who asked him to come why wasnt he making his own fellows miserable instead of coming here and spoiling their fun mr bickers after looking round him and taking in the scene generally walked up to the ladies stand fellows dropped back sullenly to make room for him although one or two pretended not to notice him and continued to stand and shout bateson jukes until he pushed them aside goodmorning miss violet said he lifting his hat i did not expect to see you here didnt you mr bickers im going to see all the events they have just run the first race and bateson and jukes have both beaten the boy in your house who won last week havent you a programme mr railsford will give you one thank you im not staying long it will be rather dull for you will it not dull said miss phyllis laughing i dont think it dull thank you mr bickers walked slowly into the enclosure watched by everyone railsford greeted him with a nod and then walked off to the starting post to prepare for the next race the prefects of the house looked another way and smedley was busy comparing his watch with that of monsieur smedley said mr bickers how come you to be here you ought to be in your house i have an exeat sir said the captain from the doctor from mr roe mr roe can scarcely be aware that i have refused a similar application to boys in my own house smedley made no reply to this observation about which he had nothing to say you had better go in smedley i will explain to mr roe smedley looked at him in blank astonishment it sounded more like a jest than sober earnest i have my masters exeat he said if he or the doctor cancels it i shall go in at once sir it was mr bickerss turn to stare now he had overdone it for once in a way his genius for interference had carried him a step too far and with a very good smedley in terms which were meant to be ominous he turned away and proceeded to where railsford was it was to speak to railsford that he had come out into the fields that morning his interviews with miss violet and the captain had been by the way railsford was busy marshalling the competitors for the shell quartermile of whom there was an unusual number he was too much engrossed to notice mr bickers until that gentleman called him by name i want a word with you railsford said mr bickers now then toe the line and be ready be careful about fouling are you ready railsford i want a word with you railsford looked sharply round and perceived who the intruder was i cant speak to you now mr bickers im busy now boys are you all ready off and he started to run beside the race mr bickers put as cheerful a face on this little rebuff as he could and presently walked across to the winningpost to make another attempt the race had been well won by tilbury who had beaten the school record hollow and shown himself a long way ahead of his fellowrunners he of course came in for an ovation which included a well run from smedley and a bravo indeed from railsford which he valued specially it was while he was receiving these friendly greetings that mr bickers once more approached railsford now you have a moment or two to spare he began ive not a moment to spare said railsford irritated what do you want i want you to look at this letter it concerns you and he produced an envelope from his pocket give it to me said railsford ill read it when i have time no thank you i want you to ring the bell for the high jump said railsford turning his back at the signal the whole company closed in a solid phalanx round the poles for the high jump was one of the great events of the day mr bickers became mixed up in the crowd and saw that it was hopeless to attempt further parley he turned on his heel and the fellows made a lane for him to pass out as he got clear and began slowly to retreat to his own house the boys raised a loud defiant cheer but whether this was to hail his departure or to greet the appearance of barnworth and wake ready stripped for the fray it would be difficult to say but whichever it was mr bickers seemed by no means discomfited he turned and caught sight of the head and shoulders of his rival towering among his boys and he smiled to himself and tapped the letter in his hand not a moment to spare said he to himself good we can wait you may not be in such a hurry to get rid of me when you do read it and your dear boys may change their minds about their hero too added he as a fresh cheer mingled with a huzza for railsford was wafted across the fields chapter fifteen mr bickers prefers the door to the window the history of the great events of railsfords sports were so faithfully chronicled at the time by arthur herapath in a long letter to his sister daisy that it would be presumption on my part with that valuable document lying before me to attempt to narrate in my own words what has been so much more vivaciously described by my young friend arthur was great at letterwriting especially to his sister and there is small doubt that with the aid of a slang dictionary and a little imagination on her own part that sympathetic young person was usually able to catch the drift of her young brothers rollicking lucubrations dear da thanks awfully for the bob a good many of arthurs letters began with this curious observation whether this particular bob had reference to railsfords testimonial or not the writer cannot speak positively we had a ripping time at our sports and licked all the records but three no end of a crow for us the schools tearing its hair all over the place and our fellows have been yelling for two days without stopping its a jolly good job that row about bickers came on when it did as our chaps would never have pulled themselves together as they did without it nobody wants to find the chap out now so your particular is all serene up to now and i dont mean to drip and spoil his game we wonder what daisy made of this curious sentence when she read it dig and i were awfully riled we hadnt got you down for the sports and i wanted marky to wire up for you and put them off till you came as it was it didnt matter a bit for miss violet showed up like a trump as she is and backed us up so its just as well you hadnt come violet nodded to me shes the most beautiful girl in the world smedley turned up too brickish wasnt it bickers of course came and tried to spoil our sports but marky gave him a flea in his ear and dig and i howled so he didnt stay long bateson and jukes pulled off the kids hundred yards and jolly cocky they were i can tell you batesons the sneak i told you of tilbury won the shell quartermile dig and i were in for it but we wanted to save ourselves for the long jump and hurdles so we ran easy and tilbury did it hands down ah da really you should have been there to see the high jump smedley and clipstone tied last week for the school no end of a jump to beat and dig and i were in a blue funk about our men barnworth and wake were the only two entereddark horses both at least i didnt know what either of them could do i heard ainger tell violet he thought wed pull it off so i perked up they started at foot wake muffed his first jump and we gave ourselves up for gone coons however he hopped over second try they went up by inches to five feet my word you should have seen the way violet clapped theyd have been cads if they hadnt gone over with her backing them up like that wakes got the rummiest jump you ever saw he runs sideways at the bar and sort of lies down on his back on it as he goes over youd think hed muff it every time but just as he looks like done for he kicks up his foot and clears barnworth takes it straightskips up to the bar and goes over like a daisy without seeming to try at foot wake mulled twice and we thought he was out of it but the third time he got over finely with a good inch to spare it got precious ticklish after this and no one said a word till each jump was done and then we let out violet stood up and looked as if shed got a tenpound note on the event at foot barnworth came a cropper and i fancy he must have screwed his foot anyhow he had to sit a minute before he tried again then he went over like a shotand you may guess we yelled five foot both of them mulled the firstbut barnworth cleared easily second shot we fancied wake would too but he missed both his other chances and so got out of it awfully good jump this for a fifthform chap barnworth pulled himself together after that and cleared the foot and foot first go then came the tug the bar went up to smedleys jump and you might have heard a fly cough we were pretty nervous i can tell you and it would have done you good to see violet standing up and holding her breath barnworth was the only chap that didnt seem flurried smedley and marky both looked blue and poor froggy looked as if he was going to blubber my wig daisy if youd heard the yell when the beggar cleared the bar first shot dig and i went mad and somebody had to clout us on the head before we could take it in that the fun wasnt over of course it was not pas un morceau de ilwed tied them but wed still to lick them bravo barnworth yells violet go it old kangaroo howls dig take your time and tuck in that shoelace says marky a million to one on our man says i and then up goes the bar to foot and then you could have heard a caterpillar wink old barnworth looked a little green himself this time and didnt seem in a hurry to begin he muffed his first jump and we all thought the game was up but no the beggar hopped over second time as easily as i could hop feet my word it was a hop dig stood on his head and i could have done so too only violet was looking she was no end glad elle est une brique et une demie sos smedley for though it was his jump was beaten he cheered as loud as anybody i forgive him the licking he gave me last term marky made a regular ass of himself he was so pleased every one wanted barnworth to go on but he wouldnt as he had a race to come on then came the shell hurdles yards ten flights dig and i were in and had to beat seconds i felt jolly miserable i can tell you at the start and that ass dig made it all the worse by fooling about just to show off and making believe to spar at me when he was shaking in his shoes all the time marky wasnt much better for he came and said youll have to run your very best to win it as if we didnt know that he dont deserve a testimonial for doing a thing like that next that ass smedley went and made up to violet just when she wanted to back us up and i dont believe she saw a bit of the race till the finish it was enough to make any chap blue then monsieur started us and kept us waiting a whole minute it seemed like an hour while the second hand of his wretched watch was getting round and then he started us in such a rotten way that it wasnt till i saw dig running that i took in we were off and coming up to the first hurdle but soon the fellows began to yell and i felt better dig had the pull of me at the start but i got up to him at the third hurdle he missed a step in landing and that put him out and we went over the fourth and fifth neck and neck then i saw violet stand up out of the corner of my left eye and smedley began to look at us too after that it was all right at the sixth hurdle we both rose together and then i heard a crack and a grunt behind me and knew poor old dig had come a cropper of course i had no time to grin as i had my time to beat but it was very lonely doing those next three hurdles i didnt know how i was going only i could swear id been twenty seconds long before i got to the eighth i nearly mulled the ninth and lost a step after the jump that made me positive id not beaten my time and i had half a mind to pull up i was so jolly miserable however the fellows were still yelling so i pulled myself together and went at the last hurdle viciously and got clean over and then put it on all i could to the winningpost i guessed id done it in thirty seconds and wished there was a pit i could tumble into at the end then marky came and patted me on the back splendid old fellow said he how do you mean said i aint i licked into a cocked hat youve done it in nineteen seconds said he go on said i and then the other fellows came up and cheered and then violet called out bravo herapath and ainger said run indeed young un so i had to believe it and i can tell you i was a bit pleased jetais un morceau plaise i was sorry for old dig but he won the shell wide jump directly afterwards i made a mess of the halfmile i ought to have got it from smythe of the schoolhouse but all i could do was to dead heat his time i suppose i was fagged after the hurdles tilbury had it all his own way with the shell cricketball and stafford got the senior throw felgate was in against himrather a decent chap one of our prefects had me to tea in his room the other day he and marky dont hit it he was lazy and didnt bother himself fellows said he could easily have licked the school record if hed tried but he didnt and stafford missed it by a few inches so that event we lost jolly sell joli vendre never mind we got the mile and that was the crackest thing of all we had to beat smedley and branscombe bothonly branscombehes bickerss prefectdidnt run it out last week smedleys time was ainger and stafford ran for us and ranger was put on the track with yards start to force the pace stafford was out of it easily but ranger stuck to it like a trojan the first lap he was still a hundred yards to the good and going like steam ainger ran finely and overhauled him gradually still he had about twenty yards to the good at the beginning of the last lap then it was fine to see ainger tuck in his elbows and let himself out a quarter of a mile from home ranger was clean out of it regularly doubled up but ainger kept on steadily for a couple of hundred yards then my word he spurted right away to the finish you never saw such a rush up as it was the fellows yelled i can let you know every one knew that it was our event the second the spurt began and when he got up to the tape and was shouted out it was a sight to see the state we were in its the best mile we ever did at grandcourt and even smedley though he was a bit riled i fancy at his licking said he couldnt have done it in the time if hed tried i send you digs programme with the times all marked youll see we won them all except the senior cricketball halfmile and senior hundred its a rattling good score for us i can tell you and we cheered marky like one oclock it was an awful sell violet couldnt give away our prizes but she shied at it i suppose old pony would have gruffed at her she is the most beautiful girl in the world you neednt go telling the mater but i was off my feed a whole day after the sports how soon do fellows get money enough to marry if i get the swift scholarship i shall have l ayear for three years something to start with i wish youd come down and give me a legup im afraid that cad smedleys got his eye on her his fathers only a doctor were better off than that besides being chummy with a baronet hullo theres the bell for cubicles ta ta je suis tres miserable your aff ah little dreaming of the sad blight which had come over his future young kinsmans life railsford was sitting in his room that sunday evening feeling rather more than usually comfortable he had some cause to be pleased his house had done better than anyone expected they had beaten all the records but three and without being specially conceited railsford took to himself the credit of having done a good deal to bring about this satisfactory result curious said he to himself that in all probability if that affair of bickerss had not happened we might never have risen as a house indeed its almost a mercy the culprit has never been discovered for we should have then been plunged back into the current and the work of pulling ourselves together might never have been done its odd that as time goes on there is not even a hint or a suspicion who did it theres only one boy in the house im not sure of and he is too great a coward to be a ruffian well well we have the cricket season and the exams coming on if only we do as well in them as weve done in the sports it will not be altogether against us if the mystery remains a mystery a little longer whereupon the door opened and mr bickers stepped in railsford had completely forgotten the episode in the fields the previous day he scarcely recollected that mr bickers had been present at the sports and was delightfully oblivious to the fact that he railsford had either slighted or offended his colleague he wondered what was the occasion of the present visit and secretly resolved to keep both his temper and his head if he could goodevening said he with a friendly smile im just going to have my coffee wont you have a cup too bickers mr bickers took no notice of this hospitable invitation but closed the door behind him and said i want a few words with you mr railsford certainly ive nothing to do wont you take a seat mr bickers took a seat a little disconcerted by railsfords determined goodhumour he had not counted upon that the last time i saw you you were hardly so polite said he with a sneer when was that im very sorry if i was rude i had no intention i assure you railsford began to feel a little like the lamb in the fable this wolf had evidently come bent on a quarrel and railsford lamb and all as he was would have liked to oblige him but he was quick enough to see with the memory of more than one failure to warn himthat his only chance with mr bickers was at all costs not to quarrel you are fortunate in your short memory it is a most convenient gift its one at any rate i would like to cultivate with regard to any unpleasantness there may have been between you and me bickers said railsford this was not a happy speech and mr bickers accepted it with a laugh quite so i can understand that it happens however that i have come to assist in prolonging your memory with regard to that unpleasantness im sorry to interfere with your good intentions but it cannot be helped this time really said railsford feeling his patience considerably taxed all this is very perplexing would you mind coming to the point at once bickers not at all when i saw you yesterday i asked you to look at a letter i had with me oh yes i remember now i was greatly taken up with the sports and had no time then i felt sure you would understand i understood perfectly i have brought the letter for you now and he held it out railsford took it with some curiosity for mr bickerss manner besides being offensive was decidedly mysterious am i to read it please the letter was a short one written in an evidently disguised hand sirthe name of the person who maltreated you lately is perfectly wellknown in railsfords house no one knows his name better than mr railsford himself but as the house is thriving by what has occurred it is to nobodys interest to let out the secret the writer of this knows what he is speaking about and where to find the proofsa friend railsford read this strange communication once or twice and then laughed its amusing isnt it sneered mr bickers its absurd said railsford i thought you would say so said bickers taking back the letter and folding it up for all that i should like to know the name of the person referred to you surely do not mean bickers that you attach any importance to a ridiculous joke like that i attach just the importance it deserves railsford then i would put it in the fire bickers mr bickerss face darkened long ere now he had calculated on reducing the citadel of his adversarys goodhumour and now that it still held out he felt his own selfpossession deserting him allow me to tell you railsford that i believe what that letter states do you really i hope when i tell you that every word of it which relates to myself is a grotesque falsehood you will alter your opinion even that would not convince me said bickers railsford stared at him blankly he had surely misunderstood his words i said he repeated and there was a tremor of excitement in his voice which afforded his enemy the keenest pleasurei said that every word in that letter which refers to me is false you surely dont believe it after that i said repeated mr bickers with a fine sneer that even that would not convince me surely the longedfor explosion would come now he saw railsfords face flush and his eyes flash but before the furious retort escaped from his lips a wise whisper from somewhere fell between them and robbed the wolf of his prey then said the master of the shell forcing his lips to a smile there is not much to be gained by prolonging this interview is there mr bickers was deeply mortified there was nothing for it now but for him to assume the role of aggressor he would so much have preferred to be the aggrieved yes railsford said he rising from his chair and standing over his enemy i dare you to say that you neither know nor suspect the person who assaulted me railsford felt devoutly thankful he had kept his head he now dug his hands into his pockets stretched himself and replied you may very safely do that bickers it was hard lines for poor bickers this he had worked so hard to get himself an adversary and here was all his labour being lost youre paltering snarled he i dare you to say you did not do the cowardly deed yourself railsford could not imagine how he had ever been so foolish as to be in a rage with the fellow he laughed outright at the last piece of bluster bickers was now fairly beside himself or he would never have done what he did he struck railsford where he sat a blow on the mouth which brought blood to his lips this surely was the last card and railsford in after years never knew exactly how it came about that he did not fly there and then at his enemys throat and shake him as a big dog shakes a rat it may have been he was too much astonished to do anything of the sort or it may have been that he the stronger man of the two felt a sort of pity for the poor bully which kept him back at any rate his good genius befriended him this time and saved him both his dignity and his moral vantage he put his handkerchief to his lips for a moment and then said quietly there are two ways of leaving this room bickers the door and the window i advise you to choose the door mr bickers was too cowed by his own act to keep up the contest and hating himself at that moment almost as muchbut not quiteas he hated his enemy he slunk out of the door and departed to his own house railsford sat where he was and stared at the door by which his visitor had left in a state of bewildered astonishment the more railsford thought the matter over the less he liked it for it convinced him that there was someone desirous of doing him an injury by means of the very master who was already predisposed to believe evil of him it was rather a damper after the glorious result of the sports and railsford tried to laugh it off and dismiss the whole matter from his mind at least said he to himself if the accusation comes in no more likely a form than i have seen tonight i can afford to disregard it but though bickers made a fool of himself for once in a way it does not at all follow that he will not return to the attack and that i may actually have to answer to grandcourt the charges of that precious letter its too absurd really chapter sixteen the testimonial as the reader may suppose the sympathetic soul of miss daisy herapath was considerably moved by the contents of her brothers letter which we gave in the last chapter she naturally took an interest in the welfare and doings of railsfords house and as she heard quite as often from the master as she did from his pupil she was able to form a pretty good allround opinion on school politics arthurs lively account of the house sports had delighted her not that she understood all the obscure terms which embellished it but it was quite enough for her that the house had risen above its tribulations and rewarded its master and itself by these brilliant exploits in the fields but when arthur passed from public to personal matters his sister felt rather less at ease she much disliked the barefaced proposal for the testimonial and had told her brother as much more than once on the whole she decided to send arthurs letter and its enclosure to railsford and confide her perplexities to him railsford perused the dear boys florid effusion with considerable interest particularly i grieve to say certain portions of it which if daisy had been as wise as she was affectionate she would have kept to herself when people put notes into circulation its not the fault of those into whose hands they come if they discover in them beauties unsuspected by the person for whose benefit they were issued railsford saw a great deal more in arthurs letter than daisy had even suspected a certain passage which had seemed mere mysterious jargon to her had a pretty plain meaning for him especially after the interview last sunday with mr bickers its a jolly good job that row about bickers came on when it did nobody wants to find the chap out now so your particular is all serene up to now and i dont mean to drip and spoil his game what could this mean except that arthur somehow or other knew a secret respecting the bickers affair which he was keeping to himself presumably in the interests of railsford could this mysterious hint have any connection with the false rumour which had reached bickers and magnified itself in his mind to such an uncomfortable extent railsford resolved to delight the heart of his young relative by a friendly visit and make a reconnaissance of the position he had a very good pretext in the anxious solicitude expressed in daisys letter for the health and appetite of her lovetossed brother he would make it his business to inquire how the sufferer did waiting therefore until a preternatural stillness in the room above assured him that dig was out of the way the master of the shell went upstairs and ushered himself into arthurs study hard at work i see said railsford cheerily how are you getting on all serene thanks replied arthur that is not very well have you stuck fast in your translations let me look oh no im not doing my exercise said arthur in alarm im only looking up some words do you want to see dig hes gone to wakes room no i came to see you i heard youd been out of sorts are you all right now was it the sports knocked you up nothat is yes they did a bit i think said arthur it was the sports which had done it though not in the way marky fancied well we mustnt have you laid up must we we want you for the swift scholarship you know oh all right sir im going to mug hard for that after easter really why put it off till then you may come to my room any evening you like i shall generally have time enough this invitation did not fascinate the boy as it deserved to do i fancy id work steadier here said he besides dig and i use the same books well the first thing is to get yourself all right whats troubling you arthur this was a startling question and arthur felt himself detected i suppose youve heard keep it quiet i say what is it keep what quiet why about her you know i say markyi mean mr railsfordcould you ever give me a legup with her if you asked her to your room one day you know i could come too and do my work railsford laughed i thought you could do your work better here besides you and oakshott use the same books oakshott be hanged i meani say marky do you think ive a chance i know smedleys railsfords experience in cases of this sort was limited but he was philosopher enough to know that some distempers need to be taken seriously look here arthur said he gravely the best thing you can do is to go straight over to dr ponsfords and ask to see him and tell him exactly how matters stand remind him that youre just fifteen and in the shell and that your income is a shilling a week you need not tell him you were detained two afternoons this week because he will probably find that out for himself by looking at monsieurs books if he says he will be delighted to accept your offer then i promise to back you up let me see i know the doctors at home this evening its not yet so youll have time if you go at once to catch him before his tea ill wait here till you come back arthurs face underwent a wonderful change as the master quietly uttered these words it began by lengthening and growing a little pale then it grew troubled then bewildered then scarlet and finally when he had ended it relaxed into a very faint smile i think ill wait a bit said he gravely very well only let me hear the result when you do go i think i may as well start work for the swift tonight said he if you dont mind by all means my boy come along to my room and well look through the list of subjects arthur before the task was half over had recovered his spirits and advanced far in the esteem of his future kinsman awfully brickish of you sir he said it wouldnt be a bad score for our house if we got all the prizes at the exams would it not at all but we mustnt be too confident jolly lucky were cut off from the rest of the chaps isnt it it makes us all sit up that state of things may end any time you know said the master but we must sit up all the same oh but it wont come out till the exams are over will it how do i know arthur glanced up at his kinsman and inwardly reflected what a clever chap he was to ask such a question in such a way oh all right all i meant was it wouldnt suit our book would it to let it out just yet its not a question of what suits anyone its a question of what is right and if anybody in the house knows anything i dont he ought to speak whatever it costs theres an artful card thought arthur to himself and added aloud i dont fancy any fellow knows anything you dont markyi mean mr railsford i dont dont you do you know said the master i have sometimes had an impression you did i am quite relieved to hear it arthur oh you neednt be afraid of me said arthur lost in admiration for the cleverness of his future brotherinlaw im safe never you fear its a strange mystery said railsford but sooner or later we shall know the meaning of it later the better put in arthur with a wink i dont envy the feelings of the culprit whoever he is for he is a coward as well as a liar no more do i perhaps youre too down on him though never mind hes safe enough for you and me you have an odd way of talking arthur which doesnt do you justice as i said you have more than once made me wonder whether you were not keeping back something about this wretched affair which i ought to know honour bright i know a jolly lot less about it than you so you really neednt be afraid of me and digs safe too safe as a doornail railsford was able to write home on the following sunday that arthur had quite recovered his appetite and that the low symptoms to which dig had darkly referred had vanished altogether indeed arthur on this occasion developed that most happy of all accomplishments the power of utterly forgetting that he had done or said anything either strange in itself or offensive to others he was hailfellowwellmet with the boys he had lately kicked and made miserable he did not know what you were talking about when you reminded him that a day or two ago he had behaved like a cad to you and greatest exploit of all he had the effrontery to charge dig with being spoons on violet and to hold him up to general ridicule in consequence how much have you really got for the testimonial said dig one morning eleven and six said arthur dismally not a great lot but enough for a silver ring not with daisys name on it no well have to drop that unless we can scratch it on well have a try when shall we give it tomorrows rag sunday isnt it lets give it him tonightafter tea ill write out a list of the chaps and you can get up an address unless felgate will come and give him a speech think he will all serene well give the fellows the tip and do the thing in style hadnt you better cut and get the ring i say arthur cut armed with an exeat and made the momentous purchase the fancy stationer of whom he bought the ring assured him it was solid silver and worth a good deal more than the shillings pence he asked the other shilling arthur invested in a box wherein to put it and returned to school very well satisfied with his bargain he and dig spent an anxious hour trying to scratch the letters with a pin on the inner surface and to arthur belonged the credit of the delicate suggestion that instead of writing the term of endearment in vulgar english they should engrave it in classic greek thus chuki the result was on the whole satisfactory and when the list of contributors was emblazoned on a sheet of school paper and sir digby oakshotts address for felgate declined the invitation to make a speech had been finally revised and corrected the prospects of the ceremonial seemed very encouraging arthur and dig once more completely reconciled went through the farce of house tea that evening in the common room with considerable trepidation they had a big job on hand in which they were to be the principal actors and when the critical time comes at last we all know how devoutly we wish it had forgotten us but everything had been carefully arranged and everyone had been told what to expect it was therefore impossible to back out and highly desirable as they were in for it to do it in good style as the clock pointed to the fatal hour dig sharply rattled his spoon against the side of his empty cup at the expected signal about a dozen boys the contributors to the testimonial rose to their feet and turned their eyes on arthur railsford at the head of the table mistook the demonstration for a lapse of good manners and was about to reprimand the offenders when by a concerted movement the deputation stepped over their forms and advanced on the master in a compact phalanx arthur and dig both a little pale and dry about the lips marched at their head what is all this inquired railsford arthur and dig replied by a rather ceremonious bow in which the deputation followed them and then the latter carefully cleared his throat we the undersigned boys in your house he began reading from the paper before him in a somewhat breathless way beg to present you with a small token of our esteemgo on hand it up arthur and hope you will like it and that it will fit and trust that the name graven within will suggest pleasant memories in which we all join the letters are in the greek character we hope we shall all enjoy our holidays and come back better in mind and body you may rely on us to back you up and to keep dark things you would not like to have mentioned signed with kind regards daisy herapath a most particular friend j felgate prefect arthur herapath treasurer sir digby oakshott baronet secretary bateson and jukes babies maple simson tilbury and dimsdale shell munger fifth snape baby in bickerss house it spoke a good deal for mark railsford that under the first shock of this startling interview he did not bowl over the whole deputation like so many ninepins and explode before the assembled house as it was he was too much taken aback to realise the position for a minute or so and by that time the baronets address was half read he grimly waited for the end of it studiously ignoring the box which arthur held out opened to fascinate him with its charms when the reading was done he wheeled round abruptly in his chair in a manner which made the deputation stagger back a pace and said you mean it kindly no doubt but i dont want a present and cant take one it was foolish of you to think of such a thing dont let it occur again im vexed with you and shall have to speak to some of you privately about it go to your rooms whats to become of the ring said dig disconsolately as he and arthur sat and cooled themselves in their study mr trinket wont take it back hed no business to cut up rough like that fact is replied arthur markys got to draw the line somewhere he knows hes in a jolly row about that business you know and he doesnt want a testimonial for it i dont blame him ill get daisy to buy the ring in the holidays and we can have the fellows to a blowout next term with the money chapter seventeen the secret out if you please sir would you mind coming to see one of the young gentlemen in our house before you start he dont seem himself the speaker was mrs phillips the dame of bickerss house and the individual she addressed was mark railsford who with his portmanteau on the steps beside him was impatiently awaiting the cab which should take him from grandcourt for the easter holidays the place was as empty and deserted as on that wellremembered day when he came down could it be only the beginning of this present termto enter upon his new duties at the school the boys as was their wont had almost without exception left by the eight oclock train arthur and dig being among the foremost the few who had remained to finish their packing had followed by the ten oclock the doctor and his niece had left for town last night the other masters had made an early start that morning and railsford junior master and consequently officer of the guard for the day imagined himself as he stood there with his portmanteau about two oclock the last of the mohicans who is it he said as the cab rumbled through the gateway its mr branscombe sir he overslep hisself as the way of speaking is and as there was no callover and all the young gentlemen were in a rush nobody noticed it but when i went to make the beds i finds him still in is and dont like the looks of im anyhow sir if youd come and take a look at him railsford looked up at the school clock he could catch the train if he left in five minutes if he lost that train he would have to wait till six he told the cabman to put the portmanteau on the top and wait for him at the door of bickerss house and then walked after mrs phillips rather impatiently he had never set foot in mr bickerss house before and experienced a curious sensation as he crossed the threshold of his enemys citadel suppose mr bickers should return and find him therewhat a pretty situation upstairs sir this way said mrs phillips leading him up to the prefects cubicles she opened the door at the end and ushered him into the housecaptains study on his low narrow camp bed lay branscombe flushed with eyes closed tossing and moaning and now and then talking to himself railsford started as his eyes fell on him hes ill he whispered to mrs phillips thats what i thought observed the sagacious dame railsford knew little enough about medicine and had never been ill himself in his life but as he lifted the hot hand which lay on the coverlet and marked the dry parched lips and listened to the laboured breathing he knew that he was in the presence of a grave illness of some kind go and fetch dr clarke at once mrs phillips said he and tell the cabman on your way down not to wait branscombe opened his eyes and clutched greedily at the tumbler railsford offered but his throat was too sore to allow him to drain it and he gave it back with a moan then he dozed off fitfully and recommenced his tossing where are they all he asked again opening his eyes he scarcely seemed to take in who railsford was they went by the ten oclock train said railsford why didnt they call me wheres clipstone you werent very well you had better lie quiet a little said railsford the invalid made no attempt to get up but lay back on the pillow and moaned open the window said he the rooms so hot railsford made believe to obey him and waited anxiously for the doctor it seemed as if he would never arrive it was a strange position for the master of the shell here at the bedside of the captain of his rivals house the only occupant with him of the great deserted school he had reckoned on spending a very different day he was to have seen daisy once more that afternoon and the foolish young couple had been actually counting the minutes till the happy meeting came round by this time he would have been in the train whizzing towards her with all the troubles of the term behind him and all the solaces of the vacation ahead tomorrow moreover was the day of the university boatrace and he an old blue had in his pocket at that moment a ticket for the steamer which was to follow the race he was to have met scores of friends and fought again scores of old battles and to have dined with the crews in the evening what was to become of all these plans now he was absolutely a prisoner at this poor fellows bedside he did not know his address at home or where to send for help besides even if he could discover it it would be twentyfour hours at least before he could hand over his charge into other hands these selfish regrets however only flashed through railsfords mind to be again dismissed he was a brave man and possessed the courage which when occasion demands can accept a duty like a man after all was it not a blessing his cab had not come five minutes earlier than it had suppose this poor sufferer had been left with no better guardian than the brusque mrs phillips with her scruples about catching disorders the doctors trap rattled up to the door at last he was one of those happy sons of aesculapius who never pull long faces but always say the most alarming things in the most delightful way ah said he hardly glancing at the patient and shaking hands airily with railsford this is a case of the master being kept in and sending to the doctor for his exeat eh sorry i cant give it to you at present my dear fellow rather a bad case what is it asked railsford our old friend diphtheria knowing young dog to put it off till breakingup day what an upset for us all if hed come out with it yesterday not profitable from my point of view but i daresay the boys will have it more comfortably at home than here after all this must have been coming on for some time how long has he been feverish i dont know i only found him like this half an hour ago and want your advice what to do the doctor almost for the first time looked at the restless invalid on the bed and hummed dr ponsford has gone to the isle of wight i hear said he i really dont know where hes gone said railsford impatiently i wish i could get a holiday thats the worst of my kind of doctorpeople take ill so promiscuously as sure as we say well go off for a week some aggravating patient spits blood and says no you dont i think you should send for this boys mother do you know i dont know her address is he so very ill then well of the two i think you should telegraph rather than write it might be more satisfaction to you afterwards have you no way of finding where he lives looked in his pockets there may be a letter there it was not an occasion for standing on ceremony and railsford feeling rather like a pickpocket took down the jacket from the peg and searched it there was only one letter in the pocket written in a female hand it was dated sunday but bore no address further than london n on the postmark pity said the doctor pleasantly of course you have had diphtheria yourself no hm i can hardly advise you to leave him till somebody comes to relieve guard but its doubtful whether he will be well in time to nurse you you should send for your own folk in time if this doctor had not been railsfords only support at present he would have resented this professional flippancy more than he did im not afraid said he i shall try to find out where his people live meanwhile would it be well to send a trained nurse here or can i manage myself quite straightforward work said the doctor if you like it ive known cases no worse than this finish up in three days or turn the corner in seven you mustnt be surprised if he gets a great deal worse at night hes a bit delirious already then the doctor went into a few details as to the medicine and method of nursing the most important thing was to discover if possible the address of the patients parents and summon them he approached the bed in the vague hope that branscombe might be able to help him but the sufferer though he opened his eyes seemed not to know him and muttered to himself what sounded more like greek verse than english in desperation railsford summoned mrs phillips she cautious woman with a son of her own would by no means come into the room but stood at the door with a handkerchief to her mouth have you any idea where his home is no hasnt he labelled his box he does not seem to have begun to pack at all do you know the doctors address no he said no letters were to be forwarded youll excuse me mr railsford but as you are taking charge i should like to be spared away an hour or so i feel so upset like a bit of fresh air would be the very thing for me she was evidently in such a panic on her own account and so nervous of her proximity even to railsford that he saw it was little use to object you must be back in two hours without fail said he i may want you to go for the doctor again she went and railsford as he listened to the clatter of her boots across the quadrangle felt more than ever utterly alone he set himself to clear the room as far as possible of all unnecessary furniture the poor fellows things lay about in hopeless confusion evidently he had had it in his mind to pack up yesterday but had felt too ill to carry out his purpose and gone to bed intending to finish in the morning flannels runningshoes caps books linen and papers lay scattered over the room and railsford as he gathered them together and tried to reduce the chaos to order felt his heart sink with an undefined apprehension yesterday perhaps this little array of goods and chattels meant much to the young master who called them his today what cared he as he lay there tossing feverishly on his bed muttering his greek verses and moaning over his sore throat whose they were and who touched them and tomorrow railsford pulled himself together half angrily a nice fellow he for a sick nurse suddenly he came upon a desk with the key in the lock perhaps this might contain the longedfor address he opened it and glanced inside it was empty no there was only a paper therea drawing on a card railsford took it up and glanced at it half absent as his eyes fell on it however he started it was a curious work of art a sketch in pen and ink rather cleverly executed after the model of the old greek basreliefs shown in the classical dictionaries it represented what first appeared to be a battle scene but what railsford on closer inspection perceived was something very different the central figure was a man over whose head a sack had been cast which a tall figure behind was binding with cords round the victims neck and shoulders on the ground clutching the captives knees with his arms and preparing to bind them sat another figure while in the background a third with one finger to his lips expressive of caution pointed to an open door evidently of the dungeon intended for the prisoner it was an ordinary subject for a picture of this kind and railsford might have thought nothing of it had not his attention been attracted by some words inscribed in classic fashion against the figures of the actors in this little drama under the central figure of the captive he read in greek capitals the legend bikeros over the head of his tall assailant was written branskomos the person sitting and embracing the captives knees was labelled klipstonos while the mysterious figure in the rear pointing out the dungeon bore the name of mungeros over the door itself was written bootbox below the whole was written the first line of the iliad and in the corner in minute characters were the words s branscombe inv et del railsford stared at the strange work of art in blank amazement what could it mean at first he was disposed to smile at the performance as a harmless jest but a moments consideration convinced him that jest or not he held in his hand the longsought clue to the bickers mystery which had troubled the peace of grandcourt for the last term here in the hand of the chief offender himself was a pictorial record of that grievous outrage and here denounced by himself in letters of greek were the names for which all the school had suffered the master of the shell seemed to be in a dream branscombe and clipstone the head prefects of bickerss own house and munger the illconditioned toady of railsfords his first feelings of excitement and astonishment were succeeded by others of alarm and doubt the murder was out but how he knew the great secret at last but by what means his eyes turned to the restless sufferer on the bed and a flush of crimson came to his face as he realised that he had no more right to that secret than he had to the purse which lay on the table he had opened the desk to look for an address and nothing more if instead of that address he had accidentally found somebody elses secret what right had hea man of honour and a gentlemanto use it even if by doing so he could redress one of the greatest grievances in grandcourt he thrust the picture back into the desk and wished from the bottom of his heart he had never seen it mechanically he finished tidying the room and clearing away to the adjoining study as much as possible of the superfluous furniture then with his own hands he lit the fire and carried out the various instructions of the doctor as to the steaming of the air in the room and the preparation of the nourishment for the invalid branscombe woke once during the interval and asked hoarsely what bell was that then without waiting for an answer he said all right all right ill get up in a second and relapsed into his restless sleep mrs phillips did not return till eight oclock and the doctor arrived almost at the same time has he taken anything he inquired scarcely anything he can hardly swallow youll have a night with him i fancy keep the temperature of the room up to sixty and see he doesnt throw off his clothes how old is heeighteena great overgrown boy six feet one or two surely it goes hard with these long fellows give me your short thickset young ruffian for pulling through a bout like this have you found out where he lives no i cant discover his address anywhere look in his sunday hat i always kept mine there when i was a boy and never knew a boy who didnt branscombe however was an exception well said the doctor its a pity a mothers the proper person to be with him a time like this shell never whats this it was an envelope slipped behind the bookcase containing a bill from splicer the london cricketbatmaker dated a year ago at the foot the tradesman had written hon sir sorry we could not get bat in time to send home so forward to you direct to grandcourt school by rail there we are said the doctor putting the document in his pocket this ought to bring mamma in twentyfour hours the telegraph office is shut now but well wake mr splicer up early and have mamma under weigh by midday goodnight railsfordkeep the pot boiling my good fellowill look round early he was gone and railsford with sinking heart set himself to the task before him he long remembered that night it seemed at first as if the doctors gloomy predictions were to be falsified for branscombe continued long in a halfslumber and even appeared to be more tranquil than he had been during the afternoon railsford sat near the fire and watched him and for two hours the stillness of the room was only broken by the lively ticking of the little clock on the mantelpiece and the laboured breathing of the sufferer he was nearly asleep when a cry from the bed suddenly roused him clip called the invalid railsford went to his side and quietly replaced the covering which had been tossed aside clip look alivehes comingdont say a word hang on to his legs you knowen jam tempus eratmunger you cad why dont you come italiam fato profugus hah got you my man shove him in quick strike a light do you hear here they come what are

outnevernever he thinks it was railsford ho ho ill never do such a thing again come alongsharpcoasts clear then he began to conjugate a greek verb sometimes shouting the words and sitting up in bed and sometimes half whimpering them as railsford gently laid him back on the pillow there was not much fear of railsford dropping asleep again after this the sick lad scarcely ceased his wild talk all the night through now he was going over again in detail that dark nights work in the bootbox now he was construing homer to the doctor now he was being run down in the mile race now he was singing one of his old childs hymns now he was laughing over the downfall of mr bickers now he was making a speech at the debating society it was impossible for the listener to follow all his wild incoherent talk it was all so mixed up and jumbled but if railsford harboured any doubts as to the correctness of his surmise about the picture the circumstantial details of the outrage repeated over and over in the boys wild ravings effectually dispelled them he knew now the whole of the wretched story from beginning to end the proud boys resentment at the insult he had received in the presence of his house the angry passions which had urged him to the act of revenge the cowardly precautions suggested by his confederate to escape detection and the terrors and remorse following the execution of their deeplaid scheme yet if the listener had no right to the secret locked up in the desk still less had he the right to profit by these sad delirious confessions towards morning the poor exhausted sufferer who during the night had scarcely remained a moment motionless or abated a minute in his wild wandering talk sunk back on his pillow and closed his eyes like one in whom the flame of life had sunk almost to the socket railsford viewed the change with the utmost alarm and hastened to give the restoratives prescribed by the doctor in case of a collapse but the boy apparently had run through his strength and lacked even the power to swallow for two terrible hours it seemed to railsford as if the young life were slipping through his hands and he scarcely knew at one time if the prayer he sent up would reach its destination before the soul of him on whose behalf it rose but soon after the school clock had tolled eight and when the clear spring sun rising above the chapel tower sent its rays cheerily into the sickchamber the breathing became smoother and more regular and the hand on which that of railsford rested grew moist the doctor arrived an hour later and smiled approvingly as he glanced at the patient hes going to behave himself after all said he youll find he will wake up in an hour or two with an appetite give him an egg beaten up in milk with a spoonful of brandy what about his parents asked railsford they will be here by the fouroclock train what about your breakfast youve had nothing since midday yesterday and if youre going to have your turn at that sort of thing added he pointing to the bed youd better get yourself into good trim first get mrs phillips to cook you a steak and put yourself outside it you can leave him safely for twenty minutes or so branscombe slept steadily and quietly through the forenoon and then woke clear in mind and as the doctor anticipated with an appetite he swallowed the meal prepared for him with considerably less pain than yesterday and then for the first time recognised his nurse thank you sir said he have i been seedy long you were rather poorly yesterday old fellow said railsford and you must keep very quiet now and not talk the patient evinced no desire to disobey either of these injunctions and composed himself once more to sleep before he awoke a cab had driven into the courtyard and set down three passengers two of them were mr and mrs branscombe the third was a trained nurse from london as they appeared on the scene joined almost immediately by the doctor railsford quietly slipped away from the room and signalled to the cabman to stop and pick him up five minutes later he and his portmanteau were bowling towards the station a day late for the boatrace but in other respects mark railsford was a happy man and a better one for his nights vigil in the valley of the shadow of death chapter eighteen rods in pickle for railsford grandcourt assembled after the holidays in blissful ignorance of the episode narrated in our last chapter branscombes illness had been an isolated case and apparently not due to any defect in the sanitary arrangements of his house and as no other boy was reported to have spent his holidays in the same unsatisfactory manner and as railsford himself had managed to escape infection it was decided by the authorities not to publish the little misadventure on the housetop the captain of bickerss house was absent on sick leave and the master of the shell who had been nursing a stubborn cold during the holidays would not be in his place so it was announced for a week that was all grandcourt was told and to its credit it received the news with profound resignation true some of the more disorderly spirits in railsfords house were disposed to take advantage of his absence and lead the muchenduring monsieur lablache who officiated in his place an uncomfortable dance but any indications of mutiny were promptly stamped upon by ainger and the other prefects who because they resented monsieurs appointment were determined that come what would he should have no excuse for exercising his authority monsieur shrugged himself and had no objection to the orderly behaviour of the house whatever its motive nor had anyone else whose opinion on such a matter was worth having arthur and sir digby as usual came back brimful of lofty resolutions and ambitious schemes dig had considerably revised his timetable and was determined to adhere to it like a martyr to his stake arthur though he came armed with no timetable had his own good intentions he had had one or two painful conversations with his father who had hurt him considerably by suggesting that he wasted a great deal of time and neglected utterly those principles of self improvement which had turned out men like wellington dickens dr livingstone and mr elihu burritt arthur had seldom realised before how odious comparisons may become no doubt wellington dickens and company were good fellows in their way but he had never done them any harm why should they be trotted out to injure him he thought he was improving himself he was much better at a drop kick than he had been last year and railsford himself had said he was not as bad at his latin verses as he had been was not that improvementselfimprovement then he was conscious of having distinctly improved in morals he had once or twice done his caesar without a crib and the aggregate of lines he had had to write for impositions had been several hundred less than the corresponding term of last year thus the son gently reasoned with his parent who replied that what he would like to see in his boy was an interest in some intellectual pursuits outside the mere school routine why now did he not take up some standard book of history with which to occupy his spare time or some great poem like the paradise lost of which he might commit a few lines to memory every day and so emulate his greatuncle who used to be able to repeat the whole poem by heart both arthur and dig had landed for the term with hampers more or less replete with indigestible mementoes of domestic affection arthur had a madeira cake and a rather fine lobster besides a small box of figs some chocolate creams brazil nuts and an enforced contribution from the cook puddingraisins dig whose means were not equal to his connections produced somewhat bashfully a rather high cold chicken some gingerbread some pyretic saline and a slab or two of homemade toffee these good things when spread out on the table that evening made quite an imposing array and decidedly warmed the cockles of the hearts of their joint owners and suggested to them naturally thoughts of hospitality and revelry lets have a blowout in the dormitory proposed arthur froggy will let us alone and we can square felgate with a hunk of this toffee if he interferes felgate was the prefect charged with the oversight of the shell dormitory in railsfordsa duty he discharged by never setting foot inside their door when he could possibly get out of it from a gastronomic point of view the boys would doubtless have done better to postpone their feast till tomorrow they had munched promiscuously all dayduring the railway journey especiallyand almost needed a nights repose to enable them to attack the formidable banquet now proposed on equal terms but hospitality brooks no delays besides digs chicken was already a little over ripe and it was impossible to say how arthurs lobster might endure the night so the hearts of maple tilbury dimsdale and simson were made glad that evening by an intimation that it might be worth their while at bed time to smuggle a knife fork and plate apiece into the dormitory in case as arthur worded it there should be some fun going wonderful is the intuition of youth these four simpleminded uncultured lads knew what arthur meant even as he spoke and joyfully did him and dig homage for the rest of the evening and at bedtime tucked each his platter under his waistcoat and scaled the stairs as the curfew rang grimly accoutred with a fork in one trouser pocket and a knife in the other but whatever the cause the shellfish in railsfords presented a very green appearance when they answered to their names next morning and were in an irritable frame of mind most of the day their bad temper took the form of a dead set on the unhappy monsieur lablache who during the first day of his vicarious office led the existence of a pea on a fryingpan they went up to him with difficulties in greek prose knowing that he comprehended not a word of that language they asked his permission for what they knew he could not grant and on his refusal got up cries of tyranny and despotism wherewith to raise the lower school they whistled german war songs outside his door and asked him the date of the battle of waterloo when he demanded their names they told him ainger barnworth wake and when he ordered them to stay in an hour after school they coolly stopped work five minutes before the bell rang and walked under his very nose into the playground poor monsieur he was no disciplinarian and he knew it his backbone was limp and he never did the right thing at the right time he shrugged when he ought to have been chastising and he stormed when he ought to have held his tongue nobody cared for him everybody wondered why he of all men worked at the trade of schoolmaster perhaps if some of my lords and baronets in the shell had known that far away in a tiny cottage at boulogne this same contemptible frenchman was keeping alive from week to week with his hardearned savings a paralysed father and three motherless little girls who loved the very ground he trod on and kissed his likeness every night before they crept to their scantily covered bedsif they had known that this same poor creature said a prayer for his beloved france every day and tingled in every vein to hear her insulted even in jestperhaps they would have understood better why he flared up now and then as he did and why he clung to his unlovely calling of teaching unfeeling english boys at the rate of l a term but the grandcourt boys did not know all this and therefore they had no pity for poor monsieur however as i have said monsieur shrugged his shoulders and accepted the help of the prefects to keep his disorderly charges within bounds from one of the prefects he got very hide help felgate had no interest in the order of the house it didnt matter to him whether it was monsieur who had to deal with the rioters or ainger all he knew was he was not going to trouble his head about it in fact his sympathies were on the side of the agitators why shouldnt they enjoy themselves if they liked they didnt hurt anybodyand if they did break the rules of the house well who was to say whether they might not be right and the rules of the house wrong arthur herapath for instance had set up with a dogpuppy to his friends dog smiley everybody knew live animals were against rules and yet railsford had winked all last term at smiley why shouldnt arthur have equal liberty to enjoy the companionship of smiley minor he met master and puppy in the passage one afternoon hullo young un said he another dog how manys that two said arthur a little doubtful as to the prefects reception of the news you see it would be rough to take him from his mother while he is so young its not as if he was no relation of course not what have you been doing with marky these holidays oh he was seedysore throat i fancy he was shamming a bit to get a week extra you see hes spoons on my sister daisy i fancy ive heard that before observed felgate what i mean is he hangs about our place a lot so its a good excuse for him to be laid up you know quite so perhaps hes not in a hurry to come back here for another reason we know of eh youngster ha ha but keep that mum you know we must back him through that business its nearly blown over already has it but i say here ainger came up and detected the puppy youll have to get rid of that herapath said he what smileys pup why felgates given me leave felgate may do as he pleases i tell you you must send him home and smiley too what said arthur aghast smiley too why railsford knows all about smiley and let us have him all last term but you are not going to have them this term two other fellows have started dogs on the strength of smiley already and theres to be a clean sweep of the lot oh rot you cant interfere with fellows rights like that said felgate i tell you railsford gave us leave repeated arthur very well said ainger unless both of them are packed off home by this time tomorrow or sent down to the school farm youll go up to the doctor and settle the question with him rubbish said felgate until railsford shut up said the captain im not talking to you it was hardly to be wondered at if he was out of temper he was having any amount of extra work to do and to be thus obstructed by one of his own colleagues was a trifle too much for his limited patience felgate coloured up at the rebuff knowing well enough that the captain would be delighted to make good his words at any time and place which might be offered him he remained after he had gone and said to arthur thats what i call brutal youre not going to care two straws what he says all very well said arthur stroking his puppy if he sends me up to pony what then bless you he wont send you up to pony think not if i thought he wouldnt id hang on till marky comes back hed square the thing of course he would its a bit of spite of aingers he thinks hes not quite important enough so hes going to start bullying ill back you up thanks awfully said the ductile arthur youre a brick id take your advice he did and prevailed upon dig to do the same the consequence was that when next afternoon the captain walked into their study to see whether his order had been complied with he was met by an unceremonious yap from smiley herself echoed by an impertinent squeak from her irreverent son youve got them still then said ainger very well they can stay now till after youve been to the doctor nine oclock sharp tomorrow morning both of you the friends turned pale not really ainger you havent sent up our names have you well send them off we thought as felgate saidoh you cad this last remark was occasioned by ainger departing and shutting the door behind him without vouchsafing any further parley they felt that the game was up and that they had been done in their distress they waited upon felgate and laid their case before him he as is usual with gentlemen of his type said it was very hard and unjust and they would do quite right in resisting and defying everybody all round but he did not offer to go instead of them to the doctor so that his general observations on the situation were not particularly comforting arthur proposed telegraphing to railsford something in this form ainger says smileys against rules wire him you allow but when the form was filled up and ready to send the chance of it succeeding seemed hardly worth the cost finally they went down sadly after tea to the school farm and hired a kennel and arranged for the board and lodging of their exiled pets at so much a week next morning in doleful dumps they presented themselves before the doctor arthur could hardly help remembering how a short time ago he had pictured himself standing in that very room demanding the hand of miss violet now smiley minor squeaking and grunting as he hung by his one tooth to his mothers tail down there in the school farm was worth half a dozen miss violets to him and his once expected uncle the doctor dealt shortly and decisively with the miscreants he caned them for defying their housecaptain and reprimanded them for imagining that dogs could be permitted under the school roof on being told that mr railsford had known all about smiley last term he declined to argue the matter and concluded by a warning of the possible consequences of a repetition of the offence they went back to their place sore both in body and mind to be caned during the first week of the term was not quite in accordance with their good resolutions and to be bereft of the smileys was a cruel outrage on their natural affections they owed both to ainger and mutually resolved that he was a cad of the lowest description for all that they attended to his injunctions for the next few days with wonderful punctuality and decided to defer till railsfords return their own revenge and his consequent confusion altogether it was getting to be time for railsford to turn up the evening before the first masters session for the term had been held and the doctor for a wonder had been present towards the end of the meeting after the discussion of a great deal of general business mr bickers rose and asked leave to make a statement the reader can guess what that statement was he begged to remind the meeting that grandcourt still lay under the cloud of the mystery which enveloped the assault which had been made upon himself last term for himself it mattered very little but for the honour of the school he considered the matter should not be allowed to drop until it was properly cleared up with a view to assisting in such a result he might mention that towards the end of last term a rumour had come to his earshe was not at liberty to say through what channelthat the secret was not quite as dead as was generally supposed he had heard on what he considered reliable authority that in mr railsfords housethe house most interested in this painful questionthe name of the culprit or culprits was generally known or at least suspected and he believed he was not going too far in mentioning a rumour that no one could make a better guess as to that name than mr railsford himself here mr grover and monsieur lablache both rose to their feet monsieur of course gave way but what he had meant to say was pretty much what mr grover did say he wished to point out that in his friends absence such an insinuation as that just made by the speaker was quite unjustifiable for his own part he thought it a great pity to revive the unfortunate question at all at any rate in mr railsfords absence he should certainly oppose any further reference being made to it at this meeting that echoed monsieur is precisely my opinion very well said mr bickers pleasantly what i have to say will keep perfectly well until mr railsford comes back whereupon the meeting passed to the next order of the day chapter nineteen felgate the champion of the oppressed it spoke well for railsfords growing influence with his boys that as soon as he returned to his post every sign of mutiny disappeared and the house seemed to regain that spirit of ambition and selfreliance which had characterised the last days of the previous term a few knotty questions as the reader knows were awaiting the master of the shell on his arrival but he took them one at a time and not having been involved in the previous altercations respecting them disposed of them a great deal more easily than had been expected things had been coming to a climax rather rapidly between felgate and ainger not that felgate had committed any unusual offence or that ainger had discovered anything new about him which he had not known before but during the last few weeks of last term and the opening days of the present the two had crossed one anothers paths frequently and with increasing friction ainger was one of those fellows who when their mind is set on a thing seem to lose sight of all but two personsthe person who can help them most and the person who can hinder them most in the present case aingers heart was set on making his house the crack house of grandcourt the person who could help him most was railsford and the person who could hinder him most was felgate the captain had been shy of the new master of the shell for a long time and the mistrust had not been all on one side but as last term had worn on and a common cause had arisen in the temporary disgrace of the house master and head prefect had felt drawn together in mutual confidence and railsford now though he still did not always realise it had no more loyal adherent than ainger ainger on his part was quite ready to acknowledge that without railsford the house stood a poor chance of fulfilling the ambitious project he and barnworth had marked out for it and he only hoped now that the master might not rest on the laurels of last term but would help to carry through the still more important exploits of this the great obstacle to whatever good was going on in railsfords at present was felgate he had nearly succeeded last term in sowing discontent among the juvenile athletes and he had in the most unmistakable manner not done his best in the one competition at the sports for which he had entered that was bad enough and the quick tempered ainger wrote up a heavy score against him on those two items but now he had begun on a new line although a prefect himself he not only evinced no interest in the order of the house at a time when the prefects were specially on their mettle but he had taken pains to undermine the discipline of the place and set his authority up in antagonism to that of his own colleagues felgate laid his plans deeply and cleverly ainger as he knew was popular because he had won the mile and was upright and meant what he said and said what he meant no boy of whom the same can be said could help being popular but said felgate to himself there are other ways of being popular i havent won the mile or anything else im not particularly upright and i shouldnt like to assert i always either say what i mean or mean what i say still i can make myself pleasant to a parcel of kids when i choose i can let them off some of their little rows and i can help them to some better sport than all this tomfoolery about getting up a crack eleven and winning all the school prizes ainger wont like it but i fancy i can sail close enough to the wind not to give him a chance of being down on me and as for railsfordthe snobif he interferes well i can take it out of him in a way he dont suspect what a hypocrite the fellow must be to do a thing like that and come here smiling and talk about making this the crack house of grandcourt bah and the righteous soul of felgate waxed hot within him and he set himself to consider how with least risk to himself and most mischief to everyone else he could drive a wedge into the project of his colleagues and make to himself a party in railsfords he passed in review the various rules of the house to discover someone on which he might possibly found a grievance for your man who sets himself to make a party must have a grievance he fancied he had discovered just what he wanted in the timehonoured rule about compulsory cricket every boy was obliged to show up in the cricketfield three times a week whether he liked it or not there were very few boys in railsfords as felgate knew who did not like it but he fancied for all that he could make something out of the rule he began by breaking it himself he knew that no one would be particularly concerned on his account for he was an indifferent player and also a prefect might on a pinch excuse himself after a weeks abstention during which rather to his disappointment no notice was taken of his defection he began to talk about it to one and another of the more studious boys of the house boys very keen on winning the school prizes at the end of the term for which they were entered sherriff of the fifth was one of these and much as he liked cricket he was bemoaning one day having to turn out into the fields just when he wanted to finish a knotty problem in trigonometry dont go said felgate surely no one has a right to spoil your chance of a scholarship for a musty old school rule that ought to have been abolished a century ago its not a bad rule on the whole i fancy said sherriff but it comes a little rough on me just now my dear fellow were not quite slaves here and if it doesnt suit you to go down on your knees to an antiquated rule of this kind then youre not the fellow i take you for if you do it it hasnt suited me often enough and ive not been such a muff as to think twice about it what happened to you when you didnt turn up nothing of course i should have been rather glad if something had for the sake of fighting the thing out its enough to make some fellows loathe the very name of cricket isnt it some of the fellows who cant play dont like it certainly i dont blame them if only a few of them would stand out theyd soon break down the system but im keeping you from your work old man youll think me as bad as the rule they say youll have a jolly hard fight for your exam so youre right to waste no time the result of this conservation was that sherriff one of the steadiest secondrate bats in the house was absent from the practice and a hue andcry was made after him he was found working hard in his study i really cant come today im in for the exam you know and itll take me a tremendous grind to lick redgrave but said stafford who was the ambassador its all the same for all of us if every fellow said the same it would be all up with house cricket and we wanted to turn out such a hot team this year too come on youll do your work twice as well after it and the grounds just in perfect condition for batting today sherriff was not proof against this wily appeal it had been an effort to him to break the rule it was no effort now to decide to keep it so he jumped into his flannels and took his beloved bat and made a long score that morning against wakes bowling and was happy felgate mentally abused him for his pusillanimity but saw no reason for all that for not turning the incident to account he proclaimed poor sherriffs wrongs to a few of the other malcontents its hard lines said he that just because of this wretched rule sherriff is to lose his scholarship he cant possibly win it unless hes able to read every moment of his time and that our grave and reverend seniors dont mean to allow brutal shame said munger hounding him down like that ive half a mind to stick out thats what sherriff said sneered felgate but he had to knuckle under catch me knuckling under said munger he stayed away the next practice day and much to his mortification nobody took the slightest notice of his absence you see said felgate if only one or two of you stand steady they cant compel you to play its ridiculous next day accordingly three fellows stayed away who as they were the three premier louts in railsfords were never missed or inquired after but when the next day the number swelled to five and included simson who at least knew one end of a bat from the other and had once tipped a ball to leg for two the matter was no longer to be overlooked the captains attention was called to the fact that one fellow in the fifth three in the shell and one baby besides felgate were not down on the ground fetch them then said ainger and tell them to look sharp or theyll catch it wake was the envoy this time and duly delivered his message to the deserters whom rather suspiciously as it seemed to him he found together youd better go you youngsters said felgate with a sneer youll have to do it sooner or lateryoud better cave in at once im hanged if i go said munger i fancy thats a safe fixture whether you go or not drily observed wake look sharp are you coming or not im not coming i tell you said munger no more am i said simson no more am i said each of the others are you coming felgate demanded wake this was an irreverent question for a fifthform boy to ask a prefect and felgate naturally rebuked it its no business of yours and youd better not be impudent i can tell you as it happens ive got some work to do and cant come cut away you neednt stay wake departed cheerfully and announced that the whole thing was a put up job as arthur would have called it and that felgate was at the bottom of it whereupon aingers face grew dark and he walked bat in hand to the house the mutineers with the exception of felgate who with the usual prudence of a professional patriot had retired to his study were loafing about the common room just where wake had interviewed them whats the meaning of all this demanded the captain what do you mean by not turning up to cricket and sending word you werent coming when wake came for you it was much easier defying ainger in his absence than in his presence and now that he stood there and confronted them the delinquents did not quite feel the hardy men of war they had been five minutes ago munger however tried to carry the thing off with a bluster we dont see the fun of being compelled to go every time we dont care about cricket besideswe dont mean to go felgate doesnt go why dont you make him the captain put down his bat munger go and put on your flannels at once what if i dont asked munger ainger replied by giving him a thrashing there and then despite his howls and protests that he had just been going and would never do it again the captain replied that he didnt fancy he would do it again in a hurry and as the remainder of the company expressed positive impatience to go to the cricketfield he let them of with a caution and after seeing them started walked moodily up to felgates study felgate was comfortably stretched on two chairs reading a novel but as he held the book upside down ainger concluded that he could not be very deeply engrossed in its contents youre working i hear said the captain is that all youve come to tell me replied felgate no only most fellows when theyre readingeven if its novels read the right way up its bad for the eyes to do it upside down felgate looked a little disconcerted and shut up his book youve missed the last two weeks at cricket said the captain we have managed to get on without you though and one of the things i looked in to say now was that if you choose to stay away always you are welcome dont think it will put us out this was unexpected felgate was prepared to hear a peremptory order to go to the field and had laid his plans for resisting it ive just been seeing one or two other louts down below who hadnt turned up im glad to hear you advised them to go when i sent wake to fetch them its a pity they didnt take your advice for ive had to thrash munger and if you happen to know where i can find the coward who put him and the rest up to breaking the rule and didnt dare to show face himself ill thrash him too felgate was completely disconcerted by this speech and gnashed his teeth to find himself made a fool of after all why on earth cant you get out of my study and go down to your cricket i dont want you here he snarled i dare say not but i thought you ought to know what i have been doing to enforce the rule and what i mean to do i hope you will tell that coward i spoke of what he may expect look here said felgate firing upfor a baulked bully rarely talks in a whisperyou may think yourself a very important person but i dont this was the speech felgate had prepared in case he had been ordered down to cricket i consider the cricket rule is a bad one and im not surprised if fellows kick against it ive something better to do than to go down to the field three times a week and i shall certainly sympathise with any fellows who complain of it and try to get it abolished and ive told them so you can do what you like with me ive told you what i shall do and i said the captain whose temper was extinguished have told you what i shall do is this room large enough or shall we come outside felgate stared at him in consternation whatever do you mean to fight rot im not going to fight very well then i give you your choicea thrashing like that i gave munger just now or you can go and put on your flannels and come down to the field felgate hesitated he had rarely been in such an awkward fix he knew that a thrashing from the captain besides being painful would mean the extinction of any influence he ever had at grandcourt on the other hand but he had not time to argue it out ainger had already laid down his bat you shall have it your own way snarled he ill come to the field chapter twenty the little sweep aingers victory over the rebels had a great moral effect on the house there was no further question as to the hardship of compulsory cricket indeed everyone became so keen on the prospect of turning out a crack eleven that if the rule had required the attendance of every boy daily instead of thrice a week the fellows would have turned up the prospects brightened rapidly after a week or twos practice railsford put his shoulder to the wheel with his usual energy he would bowl or bat or field with equal cheerfulness if thereby he might smarten up the form of any player however indifferent who really wanted to improve he specially devoted himself to the candidates for a place in the second eleven and it presently began to be rumoured that railsfords would be able to put two elevens in the field able to hold their own against any other two in grandcourt it was rather a big boast but after the exploits of the house at the sports nobody could afford to make too little of its ambitious projects arthur dig and their coteriemost of them safely housed already in the second elevencaught a regular cricket fever they lived in an atmosphere of cricket they thought in cricket and dreamed of nothing else any question which arose resolved itself into a cricket match in their minds and was mentally played out to bring it to a decision their ordinary talk betrayed their mania and even their work was solaced by the importation of cricket into its deepest problems here for instance is an illustration of the kind of talk which might been have overheard one evening during the first part of the term in the study over railsfords head arthur was groaning over his euclid im clean bowled by this blessed proposition said he here have i been slogging away at it all the evening and never got my bat properly under it yet you might give us a legup dig bless you said dig im no good at that sort of yorker im bad enough stumped as it is by this horace he gets an awful screw on now and then and just when you think youve scored off him there you are in among the slips caught out low down i vote we go and ask marky dont like it said arthur marky served us scurvily over poor old smiley and i dont mean to go over his poppingcrease if i can help it any more that was an underhand twist altogether said dig bad enough for ainger to bowl us out without him giving it out too the way he did you know i really think we ought to tell him what a nice way we can stump him out if we like he just thinks weve caved in and put off our pads i dont like it dig it would be an awfully bad swipe and daisy would be knocked over as much as he would were not forced to play up to him any more but i dont like running him out youre a jolly decent brotherinlaw you are said dig admiringly and its a pity marky dont know what he owes you at this point tilbury burst into the room if dig and arthur were a little crazed about cricket tilbury was positively off his head hows that umpires cried he as he entered did you see me playing this afternoon went in second man with wake and sherriff bowling my boys i knocked up thirtytwo off my own bat and would have been not out only mills saw where i placed my smacks in between the two legs and slipped up and got hold of me low down with his left all right said arthur why dont you put on side i was watching you and saw you give three awfully bad chances in your first over never mind stick to it and well make a tidy player of you some day i hear theyre going to get up a third eleven i dare say ainger will stick you in it if we ask him tilbury laughed goodhumouredly for it was all on the cards that he might get a place in the first eleven before very long i fancied ainger had knocked you two over the boundary a little while ago i heard someone say by the way if you two could be thrown into one and taught to hold your bat straight and not hit everything across the wicket you could be spared to play substitute in wickford infant school eleven at their next treat i said i fancied not but theyre going to try you for the sake of getting rid of you for half a day get along you neednt bowl any of your mild lobs down to us by the way is it true youve been stuck in the choir yes awful sell i tried to scratch but parks said they were hard up for a good contralto so i had to go in the team im to be third man up in the anthem tomorrowgot half a line of solo all serene said arthur well look out for squalls tip us one of your low as and well sky it from our pew whos there it was simson also infected with the fever although with him being of the weakminded order it took the form of a craze for sport generally for simson as we have mentioned once tipped a ball to leg for two and consequently was entitled to be regarded as an authority on every subject pertaining to the turf generally he looked very important at present as he began i say you chaps ive got something to tell youprivate you know you know mills his fathers brotherinlaw lives at epsom and so gets all the tips for the races and mills says hes put his father up to no end of a straight tip for the derby and mills says he wants to get up a little sweep on the quiet no blanks you know each fellow draws one horse and the one that wins gets the lot jolly good score too oh yes said arthur i know all about that i once put a sixpence in a sweep and never saw it again catch me fielding in that little game oh but mills says its not to be for money for thats not allowed he suggested postagestamps and then whoever won would be able to write lots of letters home you know who wants to write lots of letters home said dig whose correspondence rarely exceeded two letters a term well of course youre not obliged explained simson seriously if i drew roaring tommyi mean said he correcting himself with a blush if i drew the favourite you know and potted the sweep i should turn the stamps into tin is roaring tommy the favourite then asked tilbury yes i oughtnt to have let it out i told mills i wouldnt because it might get his father into a row mills says hes dead certain to win i say shall you fellows go in i dont mind said tilbury as its not money any fellow sell me six stamps yes for sevenpence said arthur im not going in young simson my governor said to me the chances were some young blackleg or other would be on to me to shell out something for a swindle of the kind and he said dont you do it besides ive not got the money i could lend you six stamps said simson who was very keen on the scheme and failed to see any point in arthurs other remarks not good enough said arthur not much chance of scoring either said dig if theres about twenty go in and only one wins just as likely you win it as anybody else said simson come on you neednt funk it lots of fellows are infelgates in arthur whistled hes a prefect said he of course he is and he doesnt see any harm in it who else asked arthur rogers and munger and sherriff a first eleven chap ejaculated dig lots of others theres twelve names already out of twentyone no thirteen counting tilbury itll be too late to do it tomorrow arthur looked at dig and dig looked at arthur twentyone sixpences were ten shillings and sixpence and ten shillings and sixpence would buy a new batat a cost of six stamps his father had warned him against gambling with money but had said nothing about postagestamps and the cautions dig had received against all evil ways did not even specify gambling at all simson took out his list and wrote tilburys name and then waited for arthurs decision may as well said dig wait till tomorrow said arthur who still felt qualms youll be too late then said simson all rightthatll settle it then said arthur felgate said he thought youd be sure to go in urged the tempter did he said arthur a good deal impressed yes said dig jocularly already fumbling the tenandsix in anticipation in his pocket any muff can get round arthur it was an unlucky jest if the baronets object was to decide his friend in favour of the proposal for arthur coloured up and took his hand out of his pocket wait till tomorrow said he again dig youll give your name now wont you said simson dont know said dig evasively better not stick it down that is not unless the list gets full up you know simson treated this evasive reply as a consent and wrote digs name down there and then in his presence come on herapath said he making a last appeal dont desert your old friends i tell you i cant say anything till tomorrow said arthur a little crusty simson gave it up and departed felgate seems to be bowling wide just now observed dig i shouldnt have fancied hed have gone in for this sort of thing why shouldnt he just as much as you growled arthur i i havent gone in for it yet oh yes you have your names down only as last man in though in case he should get filled up doesnt matter whether you go in first or last youre in the game well said dig resignedly i dont think i am really but if i am i hope i get roaring tommy simson had not much difficulty in filling up his list the specious pretext of the postagestamps did not delude many but felgates name worked wonders felgate had had no intention of allowing his name to be used and was indeed in blissful ignorance that his support was generally known he had in a reckless way expressed his sympathy with what he chose to term a very innocent round game and had given practical proof of his sympathy by buying a ticket that was yesterday and he had since forgotten the whole affair and was quietly looking about him for some new way of wiping off the rapidlyaccumulating score against railsford and his lieutenant ainger after his rebuff about the compulsory cricketwhich fortunately no one but the captain who was not the man to say much about it had witnessedfelgate had retired for a time into comparative seclusion he believed in his lucky star and hoped there was a good time coming he still had his trump card in hand but if he could win his trick without it he would be so much to the good arthur when on the day after simsons visit he heard that the list was closed without him kicked simson and felt on the whole rather glad he had thought the matter over and did not like breaking his promise to the people at home besides he still felt sore at the loss of his former sixpence in a similar venture and looked upon the whole business as more or less of a plant further than that he now had a delightful opportunity of tormenting sir digby who had weakly yielded to the tempter albeit with a few qualms and prickings of conscience just like you bragged arthur anybody can do you a precious lot of your six stamps youll see back i know millsa regular sharkand if theres a row hell back out and leave you and the rest of them to catch it then wholl be roaring tommy eh digby did not like this sort of talk it offended himbesides it frightened him stuff and nonsense said he whos to care about a few postage stamps i wouldnt gamble with money not if i was paid for it why i should fancy if felgate goes in for it its not much harm felgate knows what hes up to and can look after himself said arthur you cant you swallow everything any ass tells you i dont swallow all you tell me for one retorted dig arthur coloured he did not like being pulled up short like that especially when he was doing the high moral business all serene said he testily do as you please ive warned you to keep out of it young oakshott dont blame me if you burn your fingers thus said his prigship and undid all the credit his little act of self denial had earned him he is not the only boy who gets his head turned now and then by the unexpected discovery that he is virtuous is he reader but without being a prophet his prigship managed on the present occasion to make a pretty near prediction for sir digby oakshott did burn his fingers he was summoned one evening to millss study to draw his horse the twentyone names were shaken up in a hat and those present each drew out one to digs disgust he drew blazera horse whom everybody jeered at as a rank outsider simson was the fortunate drawer of roaring tommy mills got the second favourite and felgatefor whom in his absence mills drewgot another outsider called polo dig scarcely liked to tell arthur of his bad luck but his chum extracted the secret from him im jolly glad said arthur sententiously the worst thing that could happen to you would be to win im glad youll have a good lesson thanks said dig and went out to try to sell blazer for three stamps but no one would look at him and dig finally crushed the paper into his waistcoatpocket in disgust and wished he had his stamps safe there instead a fortnight later just as he and arthur were marching down proudly to the cricketfield in order to take part in a great matchthe first of the seasonbetween an eleven of aingers and an eleven of barnworths he was struck all of a heap by the amazing announcement conveyed by simson that blazer had won the derby dig turned pale at the news and convulsively dug his hand into his pocket to see if he had his paper safe not really he exclaimed yes he has roaring tommy was nowhere jolly lucky for me i sold my ticket to tilbury for eightandsix i wish id bought yours for threepence when you asked me dig laughed hysterically then ive got the tenandsix he asked rather dig made two ducks eggs and missed every ball that came in his way that afternoon and was abused and hooted all round the field what cared he he had blazer burning a hole in his pocket and tenandsix in postagestamps waiting for him in millss study as soon as he could decently quit the scene of his inglorious exploits he bolted off to claim his stakes mills was not at home so he took a seat and waited for him glancing round the room carefully in case the stamps should be lying out for him somewhere but they were not in due time mills returned hullo kid what do you want dig grinned and pulled out his paper hows that umpire demanded he mills stared at the document what on earth is the row with you what are you driving at tenandsixpence please said the beaming baronet ive got blazer mills laughed youre not in much of a hurry has blazer won then yes a rank outsider too do you know i tried all i knew to sell my ticket for threepence just fancy if i had its a pity you didnt said mills taking a chair the fact is theres been a bit of a muddle about blazer that ass simson when he wrote out the tickets wrote blazer twice over instead of blazer and catterwaul they were both such regular outsiders it didnt seem worth correcting it at the time im awfully sorry you know but yours lets see said he taking the cadaverous baronets ticket and looking at it yours has got one of the corners torn offyes thats it yours should be catterwaul dig gasped and tried to moisten his parched lips it was a long time before the words came its a swindle cried he choking ive won itiigive me the shillings pence dont make an ass of yourself said mills i tell you youve got the wrong paper isnt that enough no its not enough you thief you roared dig tossing his tawny mane everybody said you were a blacklegi know its all lies youre telling and iii dont care if you do lick me as he didnt care of course it didnt so much matter but mills cut short further argument by licking him and ejecting him neck and crop from the room in the passage he pitched headfirst into the arms of mr railsford whats wrong asked the master looking down at the miserable face of the small savage before him its a swindle shouted dig its a swindle mr railsford i won it fairlyand hes a thiefhes stolen shillings pence of mine dont make all that noise said railsford quietly for the luckless baronet was almost out of his wits i can hear you without shouting who has robbed you why that blackleg swindler in there said dig pointing at millss door tenandsix tenandsixthe thief come with me said the master and he led dig back into millss study mills said he oakshott says you have robbed him what does it mean ive not done anything of the kind said mills himself rather pale and scared i told himit was all a mistake it wasnt my fault what was a mistake just tell me what it is all about here dig took up the parable why he got up a sweep on the derby and got us each to shell out six stamps and there were twentyone fellows in and i drew blazer the winner and now he wont give me the stakes and says my blazer is a mistake for catterwaul railsford frowned this is a serious matter you know the rule about gambling oh please sir said mills who had dropped all his bravado as he realised that he stood a good chance of being expelled i really didnt mean it for gambling it wasnt for money only stamps and i thought there was no harm ill never do such a thing again sir really and he almost went on his knees the doctor must deal with this matter mills said railsford sternly you must go to him tomorrow evening oh mr railsford hell expel me howled the culprit good job too ejaculated dig sotto voce possibly said the master where is the money digs spirits rose he knew he would get his rights the stampshere sir said the wretched mills going to his desk and where is the list of names mills produced it tremulously railsfords brows knit as he glanced down it each of these boys gave you six stamps twentyone sixpences tenandsix said dig rehearsing his mental arithmetic yes sir i really didnt mean to cheat sir yes you did yapped dig who now that he was to finger his winnings had perked up wonderfully silence oakshott said railsford angrily your name is here last on the list take back your six stamps and write me out one hundred lines of livy by thursday morning poor dig turned green and staggered back a pace and stared at the six stamps in his hand why gasped he i had blazeri be silent sir and go to your study and tell tilbury to come here in due time tilbury came and received back his six stamps and a hundred lines of livy and an order to send the next boy on the black list to receive a similar reward for his merits and so the tedious process went on and that afternoon in millss study twenty boys sadly took back six stamps each and received among them two thousand lines of livy to be handed in on thursday morning one name remained the first on the list and consequently the last in the order in which railsford had taken it i will return these said he taking up the six remaining stamps to felgate myself mills made one more appeal do let me off going to the doctor sir implored he why sir i never thought it could be wrong if felgate went in for it and theyve all got their stamps back sir please let me off i cannot do that if the doctor treats you less severely than you deserve it will be because you have made this reparation instead of carrying out the act of dishonesty you had it in your mind to perpetrate and he left him there and proceeded with a heart as heavy as any he had worn since he came to grandcourt to felgates study chapter twenty one the naturalists field club felgate as we have said had almost forgotten the existence of the sweep or the fact that he had given his name to the venture when therefore railsford unexpectedly walked into his study he did not in any way connect the visit with that trivial incident he conjured up in his mind any possible motive the master could have for this interview he could only think of one and perceiving a paper in railsfords hands concluded that he had discovered the authorship of a certain anonymous letter addressed to mr bickers and had looked in for a little explanation felgate was quite prepared to gratify him and promised himself a cheerful quarter of an hour over so congenial an occupation he was in consequence considerably mortified when the real object of the visit unfolded itself felgate said railsford i have come to you on very unpleasant business this is not the first time i have had to caution you that your example in the house is neither worthy of a prefect nor a senior boy thank you sir said felgate with ostentatious indifference he had better have remained silent for railsford dismissed whatever of mildness he had come armed with and stood on his dignity dont be impertinent felgate it will do you no good i want to know how it comes that your name appears here at the head of a list of entries for a sweepstake on a horse race when you as a prefect know that gambling in any shape or form is strictly prohibited here felgate taken back by this unexpected indictment looked at the paper and laughed i really dont know how my name comes there i cant be supposed to know why anybody who likes should write my name down on a piece of paper you mean to say that you never entered your name asked railsford beginning to feel a sense of relief certainly not you were asked to do so what did you reply i havent a notion i probably said dont bother meor do anything you like or something of that sort did you point out that it was against the rules no is it against the rules there doesnt seem any harm in it if fellows choose to do it besides it wasnt for money did you give six stamps stamps i fancy someone came to borrow some stamps of me a week or so ago i forget who it was felgate said the master with a tone of scorn which made the prefect wince it is hardly worth your while to tell lies when you can satisfy me of your guilt quite as easily by telling the truth i wont ask you more questions for i have no wish to give you more opportunities of falsehood here are your six stamps go to doctor ponsford tomorrow at pm felgate looked blank at this announcement what he exclaimed go to the doctor are you going to tell him about a trifle like this it is no trifle for a prefect deliberately to break the school rules and encourage others to do so i have said the same thing to you before look here mr railsford said felgate with a curious mixture of cringing and menace its not fair to send me to the doctor about a thing like this i know you have a spite against me but you can take it out of me without bringing him into it i fancy if you knew all i know youd think twice before you did it railsford looked at him curiously you surely forget felgate that you are not speaking to a boy in the shell no i dont i know youre a master and head of a house and a man who ought to be everything thats right and good come come interrupted railsford we have had enough of this you are excited and forget yourself to talk in this foolish way and he quitted the study what he wondered could be the meaning of all this wild outbreak on the part of the detected prefect what did he mean by that if you knew all i know it sounded like one of those vague menaces with which arthur had been wont to garnish his utterances last term what did felgate know beyond the secret of his own wrongdoings which could possibly affect the master of the shell it flashed across railsford suddenlysuggested perhaps by the connection of two ideasthat arthur himself might be in some peril or difficulty it was long since the master had attempted to control the secret of his prospective relationship with the vivacious young shell fish everybody knew about it as soon as ever he set foot in grandcourt and daisys name was common property all over the house arthur had contrived to reap no small advantage from the connection the prefects had pretty much left him alone and as a relative of the master he had been tacitly winked at in many of his escapades with a leniency which another boy could not have hoped for what if now arthur should lie under the shadow of some peril which if it fell must envelop him and his brotherinlaw both if for instance he had committed some capital offence which if brought to light should throw on him railsford the terrible duty of nipping in the bud the school career of daisys own brother it seemed the only solution to felgates mysterious threat and it made him profoundly uncomfortable he felt he had not done all the might for the boy he had been so scrupulously careful not to give any pretext for a charge of favouritism that he had even neglected him at times now and then he had had a chat but arthur had such a painful way of getting into awkward topics that such conferences were usually short and formal he had occasionally given an oversight to the boys work but arthur so greatly preferred to mug as he called it in his own study that opportunities for serious private coaching had been quite rare recently too a difference had sprung up between arthur and marky about the smileys and railsford felt that he had not done all he might to smooth over that bitter memory and recover the loyalty and affection of the bereaved dogfancier it may have been some or all of these notions which prompted the master to invite his young kinsman to accompany him on the following daybeing the midterm holidayon an expedition into the country the occasion had been chosen by the grandcourt naturalists field club for their yearly picnic this club was a very select and by repute dry institution consisting partly of scientific boys and partly of masters its supposed object was to explore the surrounding country for geological botanical and historical specimens which were when found deposited in a museum which nobody in the school on any pretext ever visited every member had the privilege of introducing a friend but no one took advantage of the invitation except once a year on the occasion of the annual picnic when there was always a great rush and a severe competition to be numbered among the happy participants of the clubs hospitality it was long since arthur had given up all idea of joining these happy parties great therefore was his astonishment and delight when on the evening before the term holiday railsford put his head into the study and said arthur would you like to come tomorrow to the field club picnic at wellham abbey rather said arthur very well be ready at ten ive ordered a tandem tricycle arthur was in ecstasy if there was one kind of spree he liked it was a picnic at an abbey and if there was one sort of conveyance he doated on it was a tricycle he wiped off every score on his mental slate against marky and voted him the greatest brick going and worthy to be backed up to the very endespecially if they had oysters at the picnic wish you could come old man said he to dig who was groaning over his lines of livy i wouldnt go with him if he asked me the cad growled dig no hes not a cad if it hadnt been for him you wouldnt have seen one of your stamps back and you might have been expelled straight away into the bargain tell you what dig youve been scouting for stafford all the last week he ought to do something for you why dont you ask him to take you hell do it like a shot hes always civil to us dig thought it over if he says yes will you help me polish off my lines all right i say go soon or somebody else may have asked him dig went and to his satisfaction was informed that stafford would take him if he promised to be steady which of course he did promise so between them the two chums polished off the livynever was the great historian made such mincemeat of before or afterand then gave themselves over to delightful anticipations of the field club picnic one misgiving disturbed arthurs peace of mind railsford might make a base use of his opportunity as partner on the tricycle to corner him about his misdeeds and generally to jaw him besides as dig was going too it would be ever so much jollier if dig and he could go to wellham together and let the masters go by themselves we must work it somehow dig said arthur if we go we must have a high old timeand not be let in for a lot of rot about old bones and fossils and that sort of thing rather not said dig though i wouldnt mind if we could get hold of a skull it would look prime on the mantelpiece gammer who went last year says it was an awful gotomeeting turn out tophats and service at the abbey and scarcely a bit of grub but i hear the spreads to be rather good this year down by the rivers edge hooroo said dig i guess you and i will be about when they call over for that part of the spree the morning was dull and cloudy and dig and arthur as they stood on the hall steps and looked up at the sky debated with themselves whether the day would hold up long enough to allow of the picnic at the waters edge to their relief the other excursionists who gradually assembled took a hopeful view of the weather and predicted that it would be a fine afternoon whatever the morning might be as they were naturalist field club people our boys supposed they knew what they were saying and dismissed their qualms in consequence wellham abbey was ten miles off most of the party proposed to reach it on foot mr roe was driving with the doctor and his niece and one or two others like railsford preferred to travel on wheels dig was standing somewhat lugubriously beside arthur inspecting the tandem and wondering how he was to get to wellham when mr grover came up and said to railsford how are you going railsford not in that concern are you come and walk with me ive not had a chat with you for ages arthur felt a violent dig in his ribs from the delighted baronet there was a chance for the high old time yet well the fact is id promised one of my boys to give him the ride said the master of the shell oh please dont mind me said arthur oakshott and i can bring the machine for you to wellham if youd sooner walk is oakshott going yes sir staffords asked him hasnt he dig yes sir ive scouted for stafford at cricket this term so hes asked me today and ive done my lines sir oh very well said railsford to whom the temptation of a walk with grover was even greater than that of a teteatete ride with arthur herapath but can you manage it manage it exclaimed they in tones as if they could scarcely believe they heard aright rather sir well said the master tickled with the evident delight of the pair to be together take care how you go you had better take the grassen road so as to avoid the hill come along grover so these two artful young naturalists had it their own way after all come on sharp said arthur and get out of the ruck jolly good joke telling us not to go by maiden hill said digby thatll be the best part of the lark luckily a tandem tricycle of the type provided for them is not a machine which requires any very specially delicate riding had it been arthur and dig might have been some time getting out of the ruck as they politely termed the group of their pedestrian fellownaturalists for they were neither of them adepts besides which the tricycle being intended for a pair of fullgrown men they had some difficulty in keeping their saddles and working their treadles at one and the same time they had to part company with the latter when they went down and catch them flying as they came up and the result was not always elegant or swift however they managed to pass muster in some sort as they started off under the eye of their master and as speedily as possible dodged their vehicle up a side lane where free from embarrassing publicity they were at leisure to adapt their progress to their own convenience it wasnt quite as much fun as they had expected the machine was a heavy one and laboured a good deal in its going the treadles as i have said were very long the brake did not always act and the steering apparatus was stiff even the bell in whose music they had promised themselves some solace was out of tune and the road was very like a ploughed field the gaiety of the boys toned down into sobriety and the sobriety into silence and their silence into the illhumour begotten of perspiration dust fatigue and disappointment their high old time was not coming off at length by mutual consent they got off and began viciously to shove the machine up the hill theyll all be there already said arthur looking at his watch weve been two hours i wish id walked with them said dig pity you didnt growled arthur you arent very lively company anyhow ive done my share of the fag you and marky may bring the beast home this altercation might have proceeded to painful lengths had not a diversion occurred in their arrival at the crest of the hill any ordinary traveller would have stood and admired the beautiful view the finest it was said in the county but arthur and dig were in no humour for artistic raptures the sight of the abbey towers peeping cut in the valley among the trees and of the silver river which curled past it suggested to them no thoughts of historic grandeurno meditations on the pathetic beauty of ruin it made them smell oysters and hear the popping of lemonade corks and reminded them they had still two long miles to go before lunch get on sharp said arthur climbing into his saddle it wont take us long to go down the hill it didnt they did the distance a mile and a half in about three minutes the brake came to grief the moment they started and they had nothing for it but to hold on and let her fly as to attempting to control the speed with their feet they were thankful enough to get those members up on the rest out of reach of the treadles which plunged up and down like the pistons of a steamengine luckily there was nothing on the road luckily too the ruts which had broken the ground on the other side were for the most part absent on this once or twice the machine lurched ominously and they thought all was up and once or twice a stone or obstacle ahead promised to terminate finally their headlong career but the gallant tandem cleared them all and her passengers clutched on to their handles like grim death and between them they did the distance in some seconds under the record and ran a clean halfmile on the level at the foot of the hill before they could bring one of the most famous runs of the season to a standstill thanks to this rapid performance they were only about a quarter of an hour after the pedestrians at the abbey well here you are said railsford you came by grassen i suppose rather rough riding wasnt it we came by maiden hill after all said arthur it was rather rough did you walk down then no we rode it we came down in pretty good time theres something the matter with the brake so we had to let her go possibly railsford had a better notion of the narrow escape of the two harebrained young guests of the club than they had themselves they forgot all about it the moment they saw a hamper being carried in the direction of the river and heard mr roe announce that they might as well have lunch now and explore the abbey afterwards hear hear whispered dig to his friend eh rather said arthur and they were invaluable in spreading the repast and hastening the moment when mr roe at last announced that they were all ready to begin it was rather an imposing company the doctor was there and his niece and messrs roe grover railsford and one or two other masters smedley also was present very attentive to miss violet and clipstone was there as well as our friends ainger barnworth and stafford and all the learned luminaries of the fifth were there too and one or two scientists from the fourth arthur and dig had rarely been in such good company and had certainly never before realised how naturalists can eat it was a splendid spread and the two chums snugly entrenched behind a rampart of hampers drowned their sorrows and laid their dust in lemonade and recruited their minds and bodies with oysters and cold beef and rolls and jam tarts till the profession of a naturalist seemed to them to be one of the most glorious in all this glorious world now said mr roe who was president of the club and host let us go and see the abbey i have put together a few notes on its history and architecture which i thought might be useful let us go first to the saxon crypt which is unquestionably the oldest portion of the structure oh lag all that said dig to his friend are you going to hear all that rot not if i know it replied arthur wed better lie low and help wash up the plates and when theyre gone we can go for a spin up the big window so when mr roe having collected his little audience round him began to descant with glowing countenance on the preciousness of some fragments of a reputed druidical font lately dug up in the crypt two naturalists who should have been hanging on his lips were busy polishing up the plates and the remnants of the repast at the waters edge and watching their chance for a spin up the ruined arch of the great window that window in its day must have been one of the finest abbey windows in england it still stood erect covered with ivy while all around it walls towers and roof had crumbled into dust some of the slender stone framework still dropped gracefully from the gothic arch and at the apex of all there still adhered a foot or two of the sturdy masonry of the old belfry no boy could look up to that lofty platform standing out clear against the grey sky without feeling his feet tingle certainly arthur and dig were not proof against its fascination the first part of the climb up the tumbled walls and along the ivy covered buttresses was easy enough the few sparrows and swallows bustling out from the ivy at their approach had often been similarly disturbed before but when they reached the point where the great arch freeing itself as it were of its old supports sprung in one clear sweep skyward their difficulties began the treacherous stones more than once crumbled under their feet and had it not been for the sustaining ivy they would have come down with a run too you see said mr roe to his admiring audience below the work of dissolution is still rapidly going on these stones have fallen from the great arch since we came here regular jerrybuilders they must have had in those days growled dig scrambling up the last few yards did you ever see such rotten walls arthur confessed he hadnt but having gained the top he forgave the builders rarely had dig and he been so pleased with themselves and one another it was a genuine feat of climbing of which very few could boast and peril and achievement bind friends together as no mortar ever binds bricks that window said mr roe looking up from below is considered inaccessible it is said to be haunted but the truth is i believe that it is infested by owls here a faint boohoo from above bore sudden and striking testimony to the truth of the masters observations hullo said arthur peering over theyre going look sharp down dig or well be left dig obeyed it was much more difficult getting down than getting up still by dint of clinging tight hold of the ivy and feeling every step he managed to descend the perilous arch and get on to the comparatively safe footing of the buttress you cut on shouted arthur from above ill be down in a second dont waiti have found an owls nest up here and im going to collar a young un for each of us dont tell them if railsford asks where i am tell him im walking home you can go with him on the tandem ill be home as soon as you at the same moment a shout from below of herapath oakshott still further hastened digs descent to terra firma come on said railsford who was already seated on the tricycle its coming on to rain wheres herapath oh hes walking home he told me to tell you so weve been scrambling about can i come in the tandem if hes not coming you can has he gone on then nohe was just getting aa specimen said dig hopping up on the saddle and resolving that marky should do all the work he says hed sooner walk dear me here comes the rain said railsford turning up his collar wed better go on hell get wet whichever way he comes home so they departedas also did mr roe and the doctor and all the others theres an owl again said mr roe looking back at the big window he was wrong the shout he heard was from arthur not this time in sport but in grim earnest for having abandoned the idea of capturing the owls he had started to descend the arch he had safely accomplished half the distance when a ledge of mortar gave way under him and left him hanging by his arms to the ivy he felt in vain with his feet for some support but could find none digs previous descent had knocked away most of the little ledges by which they had come up finally by a desperate effort he pulled himself up a few inches by the ivy and managed to get a footing again but there he stuck he could not go down further and to go up would bring him no nearer grandcourt than he was at present so it was arthur shouted and everyone thought him an owl and left him there in the rain to spend a pleasant evening on the top of the great window of wellham abbey chapter twenty two the haunted window let me see said the doctor as he and railsford met once during the day i have two of your boys to see this evening one a prefect was it necessary to send him up it was sir if i saw the slightest prospect of dealing properly with him myself i would have done so he is an enemy to the order of our house and as you know our house just now cannot afford to have more enemies than it has your enemies are those of your own house said the doctor sternly i had expected long before this that it would have been possible to restore it to the ordinary rights of grandcourt an impenetrable mystery is a bad thing for a school it is said railsford feeling uncomfortable and here the conservation ended railsford had not been long in his room that evening when sir digby oakshott knocked at the door and entered with a long face please sir have you seen anything of herapath said he hes not turned up whatare you sure ive asked them all all the others have come i expect hell get pretty drenched if hes lost his way he cant have lost the wayits too simple what was he doing at the abbey when you last saw him going after owls said dig where on the big window we got to the top you know and i came down as soon as i saw you all starting and he shouted that he would be down in a second and was going to walk home and we werent to wait i say i wonder if hes got stuck up there or come a cropper digs face was pale as the thought flashed across his mind railsford was not a bit less concerned go quickly and see if mr roe has sent away his trap and if not keep it if it has gone go to jasons and get one directly oakshott in five minutes the baronet returned i cant get a trap anywhere said he dismally but ive got jason to send a horse that will do said railsford hurrying down will it do groaned dig i cant go too oh mr railsford shouted he as the master was jumping into the saddle what road shall you come back by maiden hill said the master digging his heels into the horses side with a heavy heart digby watched him start and then putting on his cap determinedly followed him on foot into the night and rain i shall do it in two hours and a half said he to himself if i trot part of the way what a cad i was to leave him up there it was not till bedtime at railsfords that fellows generally became aware that the master and two of the boys were missing railsford and oakshott had both been seen in the school after their return from the picnic railsford had of course depended on the boy to explain his sudden absence and dig had been too miserable and excited to think of telling anybody as he started on his weary tramp the first inquiry for the missing ones came from the doctor who after his interview with felgate sent a messenger over to the master of the shell to request his presence in the headmasters study at once the messenger returned to report that mr railsford was not in and no one knew where he was gone then the hue and cry being once raised it appeared that arthur and digs study was also empty and that its owners were nowhere to be found presently the school gatekeeper reported that on coming up from the town just now he had seen mr railsford galloping on one of jasons horses in the direction of the london road and munger who had been out of bounds reported in private because the disclosure might get him into trouble if it came to the ears of the authorities that just as he was sneaking in at the gate he met sir digby oakshott baronet sneaking out the doctor who might never have heard of the affair had he not chanced to want to see railsford particularly that evening walked over to the house about bedtime and interviewed ainger have you the slightest idea what it all means asked the headmaster not the slightest sir said ainger shortly if he had had he would have spoken long ago as the doctor knewor should have known no one is to stay up said the doctor and i wish you to take charge of the order of the house in mr railsfords absence ainger circumstances have occurred which may make it necessary to remove felgate to another house meanwhile he has forfeited his prefecture here and the doctor went away leaving the captain of railsfords with a new perplexity piled up on all the others whereupon ainger sent his house to bed and threatened them with all sorts of penalties if lights were not out and all quiet by it was a sleepless night for a good many in grandcourt mr roe and grover sat up together in the rooms of the former anxious and perplexed about their missing friend mr bickers walked about his room too and wondered if his game was to slip through his fingers after all and felgate lay awake and laughed to himself in the conviction that to him belonged the glory of hunting the scoundrel from grandcourt and maple simson tilbury and dimsdale in the shell dormitory lay awake too and strained their ears at every sound in the court below and wondered ruefully what had become of their two missing comrades dig as he ploughed his way footsore and weary through the rain and mud of maiden hill down which he had shot at such a glorious pace not twelve hours before thought wistfully once or twice of that warm dry bed in the dormitory and the friendly voices of his allies there assembled but he would never return there without old arthur in the times of their prosperity and security those two boys had often quarrelled often neglected one another often forgotten all about one another and a casual onlooker might have said they are not friends they are no more to one another than any other two boys in the school ah but if the critic could have looked into digs heavy heart as he floundered through the mud that night he would have told a different tale often enough our friend seems to us like an ordinary friend we have our little tiffs and our little reconciliations we have our mutual jokes and our timehonoured arguments we say goodbye with unruffled spirits and meet again with an unimpassioned nod but now and again the testing time comes the storm breaks over our heads the thunder rolls round us then the grip of our hands tightens we find that we are not friends but brothers and the lightning flash reveals to us what we never suspected before that there is something in the world dearer to us even than life and as our hearts sink we envy those happy people who by their simple trust in their saviour and in the all pervading goodness are able to face with courage both life and death dig stumbled on dead beat losing heart at every step and stopping sometimes to take breath with a gasp which sounded ominously like a sob the long hill seemed interminable there was no glimmer of a light anywhere to cheer him no clatter of a horses hoofs to ring hope into his heart all was black and wet and dreary what if he should find the abbey deserted and have to walk homealone he had nearly reached the ruin when he stumbled against two men conversing in the middle of the road to his inexpressible relief one of them was railsford mr railsford gasped the boy springing upon the master with a suddenness which made both men start is that you wheres arthur have you found him hes all righthes on the top of the window still and we cant get him down till daylight im just arranging with farmer white to bring a ladder dig made a dash in the direction of the abbey gate where are you going said railsford im going to hop up beside him shouted dig almost beside himself with relief the master caught him firmly by the arm if you think of such a thing oakshott i shall get farmer white here to cart you straight back to grandcourt this terrible threat sobered dig at once he waited impatiently till the two men had made their arrangements and then with beating heart accompanied the master to the ruin he is safe up where he is said the latter and says he has room to sit down and a back of ivy to lean against but he must be half drowned and frozen it will do him good to know you are here now stay where you are while i get on the wall and shout to him he cannot hear us down here dig waited and listened to the master scrambling up the ivy and feeling his way on his hands and knees along the wall to the bottom of the arch then he heard him shout arthur are you there all right and his heart leapt as a shrill reply came back from the heights oakshott is here with me shouted the master it was all a mistake about not being able to hear from the level ground dig heard the hallo what cheer dig as plainly as he heard railsford himself what cheer he howled in reply keep up your pecker old man rather yelled arthur then dig begged and besought railsford to allow him to mount at least to where the latter stood and the master made him happy by consenting from this point it was easy to carry on a talk and there in the rain through the dark watches of the night those three had one of the most profitable conversations they had ever enjoyed a yokel who chanced to pass hearing those weird celestial voices took to his heels and ran a mile straight off and reported with ashy face and trembling lips that a ghost had appeared on the arch of the abbey as he passed and called to him thrice and had shrieked with demoniacal laughter as he hurried from the accursed place towards dawn the rain ceased and the three watchers despite all their efforts became drowsy when farmer white and two of his men arrived on the scene with a long ladder and a rope they had to stand and shout from below for a minute or so before railsford started into wakefulness and remembered where he was as for dig he lay with his cheek buried in the wet ivy sleeping as soundly as if he had been in the dormitory at school it was no easy task to get arthur down from his dizzy perch in the first place he was so sound asleep that it was impossible to rouse him from below consequently he could give no assistance in his own rescue the ladder was far too short to reach within a quarter of the distance of where he was and for a long time it seemed as if the ropes might as well have been left at home at length however by a combined effort the ladder was hoisted on to the top of the wall and so elevated it reached a point on the arch above the place where the stones had given way the difficulty was to secure it on the narrow ledge in any way so that it could be ascended safely when finally by dint of careful adjustment and rigid holding at the bottom it was pronounced reasonably safe dig was most eager to volunteer the ascent urging that he was the lightest weight and that the four men could do more good in holding the ladder the lads right said the farmer let him go up railsford was forced to consent it would have been obviously risky for a heavy man to ascend that rickety ladder dig rarely felt so proud and happy as when he skipped lightly up the rungs and reached the ivy covered masonry of the arch it was not a difficult climb to the top and it was as well it was not for in his eagerness he forgot the admonitions of caution he had received below and scrambled up as recklessly as if he had been ascending a london tramcar his heart beat as at last he came upon his dear old friend arthur sat sound asleep his hands behind his head his legs hanging over the edge of the arch and his back propped in the angle formed by the junction of the window and the fragment of the old roof lucky for him was that natural armchair for without it at the first fall of sleep he would undoubtedly have rolled from his perch into the depths below dig approached him gently and discreetly nearly time to get up old chappie said he laying his hand on the sleepers arm to prevent any sudden start that nearly was a stroke of genius had he incautiously announced that the chapelbell had begun to ring or that he would be late for callover the result might have been fatal as it was arthur opened his eyes lazily and yawned all serene why hullo i say is that you dig old man yes rather sit steady weve got a ladder and ropes and markys just down there how are you arthur rubbed his eyes and his teeth chattered pretty cold and stiff old man how jolly of you to come you see the mortar or something slipped and i couldnt get up or down i yelled but youd gone at last i managed to get up again and there ive stuck how are we going down now theyve got the ladder up just below us if you can manage to get down so far arthur began to move his stiff limbs one by one by way of judging what he could do dig meanwhile shouted down that he was safe up and arthur was all right not time for another try at the owls said the latter getting one foot up and trying to rise owls be hanged said dig helping his friend gingerly to his feet i feel like a poker said arthur shouldnt care to run a mile just now nobody wants you to what youve got to do is to dig hold of the ivy with your hands and let yourself down ill go first and take care of your feet awfully brickish of you dig said arthur im sorry im such a lout i feel as if my joints want oiling come on said dig the descent was slow and for poor arthur painful but thanks to the ivy and digs steady steering it was in due time accomplished safely and the top of the ladder reached now then one at a time shouted the farmer he cant go alone called dig hes too stiff wont it bear both of us the unanimous opinion below was that it would not even digs weight as he went up had been as much as they could manage finally railsford suggested that a rope should be thrown up which dig could tie round arthurs body and so support him from above as he came down the plan was a good one and arthur contrived by its help to lower himself down the steps into the arms of his rescuers dig was not long in following and five minutes later the party was standing safe and sound and thankful on the greensward of the abbey floor the farmer insisted on taking them all to his house and comforting their souls and bodies with a hot breakfast in front of a blazing fire after which he ordered out his trap and drove them himself up to grandcourt the first gettingup bell was ringing as they drove into the quadrangle and at the sound of the wheels half a dozen anxious watchers darted out to welcome their return still more shouted down greetings from the dormitory window and arthur and dig had they been in the mood for lionising might have had their heads turned by the excitement which their reappearance seemed to produce but they were neither of them in a mood for anything but going to bed for after the excitement of the night and morning a reaction had set in and their heads ached and their bodies were done out they even resisted railsfords recommendation of a hot bath and took possession of the dormitory and curled themselves up to sleep leaving fate or anyone else to explain their absence for the next few hours to the authorities below as for railsford after seeing his young charges stowed away in their berths he shook himself together took his cold bath and walked over to breakfast with grover none the worse for the fatigues and exposure of that eventful night have you seen the doctor yet inquired grover when the meal was over i suppose not he was asking for you particularly last night what for do you know i dont i was wondering if you did for i imagine from his manner it is something important oh i know i had to report one of my prefects yesterday for gambling no doubt it is in connection with that perhaps you know it seems a great pity you and bickers hit it so badly bickers seems to have a preposterous notion in his head that you are in some way responsible for what happened to him last term he even wanted to bring the matter up in the last session of masters in your absence and when we stopped it he promised to return to it at the next oh bickers said railsford scornfully i am really tired of him grover its the greatest pity he wasnt allowed to say what he had to say at that meeting he will never be happy till he has it off his mind and it surely wouldnt be necessary for me to take any notice of his rhodomontades im glad you are so little concerned about them i was afraid they might be worrying you railsford smiled ive plenty in my own house to do that thanks no all i ask is to keep the peace with bickers and have nothing to do with him he may then say anything he likes well i suppose i had better go over to the doctors now and report myself the doctor received railsford coldly and required a full account of the strange adventures of the preceding night railsford felt a little hurt at his evident want of sympathy in his story and was beginning to look out for a chance of escaping when doctor ponsford said i wanted to see you last night about felgate your prefect i had a very unsatisfactory interview with him he appears to lack principle and as you said not to recognise his responsibility in the house he tried to shift the blame for this gambling business wholly upon mills who by the way i floggedand could not be brought to see that there was anything wrong in his conduct or unbecoming in a senior boy i think it may be well to remove him next term either into my house or mr roes meanwhile he understands that he does not retain his prefecture in yours i am thankful for such an arrangement said railsford that however is only part of what i had to say to you before he left he brought a most extraordinary charge against you which i should certainly have disregarded had it not coincided strangely with a similar charge made elsewhere i only repeat it to you in order to give you an opportunity of repudiating it it had relation to the outrage which was committed on mr bickers last term for which your house still lies in disgrace he stated that you knew more about that mystery than anyone else at grandcourt and indeed gave me the impression from the language he used that he actually considers you yourself were the perpetrator of the outrage that of course is the mere wild talk of a revengeful illdoer railsford laughed a short uneasy laugh had the doctor worded the question in slightly different form it might have been difficult to answer it as decisively as he could now it is and if he were here to hear me i would say that it is as absolutely and wickedly false as emphatically as i say it to you sir i am sorry indeed that you should have thought it necessary to put the question there is never anything lost said the doctor drily by giving the calumniated person an opportunity of denying a charge of this sort however preposterous i am myself perfectly satisfied to take your word that you neither had any part in the affair yourself nor have you any knowledge as to who the culprits are railsford coloured and bit his lips the doctor had now put the question in the very form which he had dreaded if he could only have held his peace the matter would be at an end perhaps never to revive again but could he an honest man hold his peace excuse me said he in undisguised confusion what i said was that the imputation that i had anything to do with the outrage myself was utterly and entirely false which said the doctor incisively is tantamount to admitting that the imputation that you are sheltering the real culprits is well founded at the risk of being grievously misunderstood doctor ponsford replied railsford slowly and nervously yet firmly i must decline to answer that question very well sir said the doctor briskly this conversation is at an endfor the present chapter twenty three after you thanks to youth and strong constitutions arthur and dig escaped any very serious consequences from their nights exposure at wellham abbey they slept like dormice from eight in the morning to six in the afternoon and woke desperately hungry with shocking colds in their heads and with no inclination whatever to get up and prepare their work for the following day the doctor came and felt their pulses and looked at their tongues and listened to their coughs and sneezes and said they were well out of it still as they assured him with loud catarrhic emphasis that they felt rather bad still and very shaky he gave them leave to remain in bed for the rest of the day and petrified them where they lay by the suggestion of a mustard poultice apiece they protested solemnly that the malady from which they suffered was mental rather than physical and required only rest and quiet to cure it whereat the doctor grinned and said very well they had leave to stay as they were till the morning then if they were not recovered he would try the mustard poultices to their consternation and horror after he had gone they suddenly remembered that tonight was the night appointed for the first grand rehearsal of a performance proposed to be given by the comedians of the house on the eve of speechday at the end of the term the comedians were a timehonoured institution at grandcourt any casual visitor to the school from about the middle of april onwards might at any time have been startled and horrified by finding himself suddenly face to face in a retired corner with some youthful form undergoing the most extraordinary contortions of voice and countenance railsford himself used to be fond of recounting his first experience of this phenomenon he was going down early one morning to the fields when on the shady side of the quadrangle he encountered a boy whom he recognised after a little scrutiny to be sir digby oakshott baronet the reason why he did not immediately grasp the identity of so familiar a personage was because sir digbys body was thrown back his arms were behind his back his legs were spread out and his head was thrown into the air with an expression which the master of the shell had never seen there before and never saw again there was but one conclusion to come to the baronet had gone mad or he would never be standing thus in the public quadrangle at seven oclock in the morning the supposition was immediately confirmed by beholding the patients face break slowly into a horrible leer and his mouth assume a diagonal slant as he brought one hand in front the index finger close to his nose and addressed a lamppost as follows when abednego jinks says a thing tommy my boy you may take your alfred david theres more in it than there is in your head railsford in alarm was about to hasten for professional assistance for what he considered a very bad case when dig catching sight of him relieved him inexpressibly by dropping at once into his ordinary sane manner and saying with a blush of confusion oh mr railsford i didnt know you were there i was mugging up my part for the comedians you know im abednego jinks not much of a part only you can get in a little gag now and then railsford after what he had witnessed was prepared to admit this and left the disciple of the dramatic muse to himself and the lamppost and secretly hoped when the performance of the comedians came off he might get an order for the stalls although the grandcourt house comedians were an old institution they had not always been equally flourishing at railsfords for instance in past years they had decidedly languished the performances had possibly been comic but that was due to the actors not the author for the scenes chosen were usually stock selections from the tragedies of shakespeare such for instance as the death of king lear the ghost scene in hamlet the conspirators scene in julius caesar and the banquet in macbeth but as soon as the irrepressible wake got hold of the reins as of course he did the old order changed with startling rapidity the new director made a clean sweep of shakespeare and all his works whats the fun of doing roman citizens in eton jackets and white chokers said he and sending everybody to sleep lets give them a change and make them laugh as if everybody hadnt laughed for years at the roman citizens in eton jackets so he hunted about and made inquiries of friends who were supposed to know and finally submitted to the company a certain screaming farce entitled after you withso the description informed himtwo funny old gentlemen one low comedian two funny old ladies and one maidof allwork besides a few walking gentlemen and others it sounded promising and a perusal of the piece showed that it was very amusing i cannot describe it but the complications were magnificent the two old gentlemen one very irascible the other very meek were of course enamoured of the two old ladies one very meek and the other very irascible the low comedian was of course the victim and the plague of both couples and took his revenge by the usual expedient of siding with each against the other and being appointed the heir to both the walking gentlemen wereneed it be saidthe disappointed heirs and the maidofallwork as is the manner of such persons did everybodys work but her own the parts were allotted with due care and discrimination the two funny old gentlemen were undertaken by sherriff and ranger the two funny old ladies by dimsdale and maple the low comedian by sir digby oakshott and the maidofallwork by arthur herapath as for the walking gentlemen cabmen detective et hoc genus omne they were doled out to anyone who chose to take them there had been no regular rehearsals yet but private preparation of the holeandcorner kind i have described had been going on for a week or so the actors themselves had been looking forward with eagernessnot to say trepidationto the first rehearsal which was appointed to take place this evening in the fourth classroom in the presence of wake and stafford and a few other formidable critics of the upper school great therefore was the dismay when it was rumoured that the low comedian and the maidofall work were on the sick list with a doctors certificate the first impulse was to postpone the date but on wake representing that there was no evening for ten days on which they could get the use of the room it was resolved to do the best they could with the parts they had and read the missing speeches from the book although the house generally was excluded from the rehearsals the fourthform boys managed to scramble in on the strength of the classroom in which the performance was to take place being their own and besides the invited guests named above it was frequently found at the end of a performance when the gas was turned up that the room was fuller of juniors and babies than it had been when the curtain rose on the present occasion not being a fulldress rehearsal there was no curtain nor was there anything to distinguish the actors from their hearers save the importance of their faces and the evident nervousness with which they awaited the signal to begin and here let me give my readers a piece of information a screaming farce is ever so much more difficult to act than a tragedy of shakespeare anywell any duffer can act brutus or richard the third or the ghost of banquo but it is reserved only to a few to be able to do justice to the parts of bartholomew bumblebee or miss anastatia acidrop and when one comes to compare the paltry exploits and dull observations of the old tragedy heroes with the noble wit and sublime actions of their modern rivals it is not to be wondered at so it happened on the present occasion after you was far too ambitious a flight for the comedians at railsfords they had far better have stuck to king lear in the first place none of the characters seemed to understand what was expected of them sherriff the funny irascible old gentleman skulked about in the back of the scene and tapped his fingers lightly on the top of his hat and stamped his foot gently with the most amiable of smiles on his countenance his one idea of irascible humour seemed to be to start every few moments to leave the room and then stop short halfway to the door and utter a few additional remarks over his shoulder and then to make again for the door with a noise which sounded halfway between a sneeze and the bleating of a goat maple also who personated miss olive omlett the meek elderly lady appeared to have come with a totally erroneous conception of the role of that inoffensive character he delivered his speeches in a voice similar to that in which boys call the evening papers at a london railway station and lost no opportunity of clutching at his heart which by the way maple wore on his right flankand of rising up from and sitting down on his chair at regular intervals while anybody else was addressing him then greatly to the chagrin of the director the jokes which seemed so good in print never came off right in the speaking those which were delivered right nobodyleast of all the actorsseemed to see and the others came to grief by being mauled in the handling when for instance on the meek gentleman observing oh my poor head miss acidrop ought to have made a very witty and brilliant point by retorting theres nothing in that she entirely spoiled the fun by saying thats nothing to do with it and when loud laughter should have been created by the irascible man walking off with the meek mans hat on his head they both quitted the scene with no hats on their heads at all this was dispiriting and the absence of the low comedian and the maid ofallwork tended still further to mar the success of the rehearsal for wake had to read these parts from the book and at the same time coach the other actors thus for instance in the famous speech of abednego jinks the low comedian already cited it rather broke up the humour of that masterpiece of declamation to hear it delivered thus when abednego jinksoh that wont do ranger take your hand out of your waistcoat and look more like a fool yes thats better now wheres the place oh yeswhen abednego jinks says a thing tommy my boy oh no no no didnt i tell you you neednt start up from your chair as if i was going to cut your throat sit steady and gape at me like an idiot thats the styletommy my boy tommy my boy towhere on earths the place oh yeswhen abednego jinks says a thing tommy my boy oughtnt you to look funnier than that yourself interposed ranger relaxing his own expression to ask the question oh of course only im reading just now oakshott will have to get that up of course now begin again go on look a foolthatll dowhen abednego jinks says a thing tommy my boyi say screw your chair round a bit and face the audience for mercys sake said stafford who was getting rather tired of the whole thing do tell us what happens when abednego jinks says a thing tommy my boy you may take your alfred daviddo look rather more vacant old man my dear fellow once more interposed the prefect ranger could not possibly look a more utter idiot than he looks this minute what is he to take his affidavit about i do so want to know you may take your alfred david tommy my boy oh no thats wrong tommy my boy you may take your alfred david yes yesgo on urged stafford theres more in it than there is in your head more in what the affidavit asked ranger solemnly no thats not what you say you say you dont say so i think said stafford that what he did say was a good deal funnier than what he ought to say whats the good of saying you dont say so when everyone of us here can swear you did i dont see the joke in it myself do any of you no was it meant for one asked someone gravely its not written down in the book that anyones to grin said maple hastily referring to his copy oh thats all rightonly i wish youd look alive and get to some of the jokes i thought you said it was a funny piece so it is replied wake rather dismally its full of points they must all be crowded up to the end then said stafford if wake had not had a soul above difficulties he might have been tempted to abandon his labour of hercules on the spot and indeed it is probable his troupe would have struck and so saved him the trouble of deciding had not an extraordinary and dramatic change suddenly come over the aspect of affairs the rehearsal was dragging its slow length along and everybody even the amiable stafford was losing his temper when the door flew open and two young persons entered and made their way boldly up to the stage as all the room was dark except the part allotted to the actors it was not till these intruders had mounted the platform and honoured the company with two ceremonious bows that their identity became apparent arthur and dig after twelve hours in bed had become weary unto death and when presently from the room below arose the voices and laughter of the comedians they kicked the clothes off them and mutually agreedcolds or no coldsthey could stand or rather lie it no longer wouldnt they grin if we turned up said arthur i vote we do all serene said dig we may as well get up dig meant the term get up in the professional sense he accordingly arrayed himself to the best of his lights in the garb of a low comedian that is he put on a red dressinggown flannel drawers and a very tall collar made out of cardboard and blacked a very fine moustache on his lip with a piece of coal arthur meanwhile had a more delicate task to perform in extemporising the toilet of a maidof allwork an ulster belonging to tilbury supplied him with a dress and by turning up the sleeves and arranging his nightdress apronwise over the front he managed to give a fair idea of the kind of character he aimed to personate he then ruffled up his hair and brought as much of it as he was able down in the front for a fringe surmounting it all with a handkerchief shaped to represent a cap finally he smudged his face over with coal dust and secured one of mrs hastingss mops and a pail from the cupboard at the end of the corridor and pronounced himself ready for the fray it need hardly be said that the apparition of these two extraordinary figures created a sensation among the jaded comedians and their friends the sudden restoration to health of the two invalids was less astonishing perhaps than their strange getup or the spirit with which they proceeded to throw themselves into their respective parts wake with a smile of relief shut up his book and retired among the audience dig knew his part well and acted it with such a depth of low comedy that it mattered little what mistakes or blunders the funny irascible and the funny meek gentlemen and ladies made he uttered the greatest commonplaces a leer and a wink which imported a vast deal of meaning into the words and had evidently so well studied his part that he could not even sit down on the chair or walk out of the room without tumbling on all fours or upsetting one or two of the other actors wake suggested mildly that he was overdoing it but was voted down by an indignant chorus of admirers who urged the low comedian on to still further extravagance until had his part been that of a clown he could scarcely have thrown more dramatic intensity into it he was ably and gallantly backed up by the maidofallwork who was evidently convinced that the main duty and occupation of such functionaries is to upset everything to clatter up and down the rooms in hobnail boots to flourish her mop in her masters and mistresss faces and otherwise assert her noble independence of the ordinary laws governing domestic servants in these ambitions she succeeded to a moral and when in addition thanks to the cold in her head she pronounced all her ms bs and her ns ds the result was exhilarating in the extreme theres dot bady bed dicerlooking that bister tobby and biss oblett said she flourishing her mop in miss omletts face whereat although the remark was a serious one and not meant to be facetious the audience was convulsed the second scene was in full swing miss omlett and the funny meek old gentleman were taking refuge behind two sofas from the threatened violence of mr bumblebee and miss acidrop the low comedian was having a kickup all round and the maidofallwork was putting her pail on the head of one of the walking gentlemen with the comment dow thed theres goidg to be a dice doise when the door of the room once more opened and railsford entered unobserved in the darkness he had not come to see the performance although he knew it was about to be held and had indeed allowed the use of the classroom for the purpose but feeling very dejected in the presence of the cloud which had suddenly fallen on him he had been unable to work that evening and had decided to pay a visit of condolence to his young kinsman and the baronet partly in the hope of edifying them by a little quiet talk by the sick bedside and partly to satisfy himself that no very alarming symptoms had resulted from last nights severe exposure picture his astonishment when he found the two beds in the dormitory empty and the invalids flown he made inquiries of the dame she had taken them up two eggs apiece and some tea and hot buttered toast at six oclock which they had partaken of and then informing her that they felt no better they had disposed themselves as she supposed to sleep he looked into their study they were not there nor had anyone heard of them in the preparation room finally he peeped into the fourth classroom and beheld the two invalids masquerading on the stage and recognised the voice and sentiments of his kinsman albeit proceeding through the nose as he flourished his or rather her mop in the air and announced that there was going to be a dice doise the whole scene was so ridiculous that railsford deemed it prudent not to discover himself and withdrew as unobserved as he had entered at least he had the satisfaction of knowing that arthur and dig were all right after their adventure and that thought he is the main thing poor railsford had plenty else to occupy his thoughts that evening the interview with the doctor in the morning had seemed to bring him up short in his career at grandcourt if his enemies had tried to corner him they could not have done it better it was true that he knew the culprits and by not denouncing them was to that extent shielding them but he had come to that knowledge as the reader knows by an accident of which as an honourable man he felt he had no right to take advantage even to set right so grievous a wrong as the bickers mystery he might explain without mentioning names how he had learned the facts but that would be as good as naming the culprit for branscombe had been the only case of serious illness accompanied by delirium at grandcourt during the last two terms he might write to branscombe and tell him his dilemma and beseech him to make a confession and yet what right had he to take advantage of the boys unconscious confession to put pressure on him to make it public other persons less fastidious might do it but railsford could not the alternative of course was that he would in all probability have to leave grandcourt if the matter had rested only between him and the doctor he might have made a private communication under pledge of secrecy and so induced his principal to let the matter drop but the matter did not rest solely between him and the doctor mr bickers and felgate by some means which he was unable to fathom appeared to have learned the secret and were not likely to let it drop indeed it was evident that so far from that they would like if possible to fix a charge of actual complicity in the outrage on himself railsford laughed contemptuously at the notion as the wild malice of a revengeful enemy but he knew that no explanation would be likely to put them off the pursuit short of the actual naming of the culprits which he was resolved at all risks to refuse was this to be the end of his brilliant school career after two terms of hard work and honest battle was he to be turned away cashiered and mined just because he had stayed to nurse a sick boy and overheard his delirious confession it was no small temptation as he sat in his room that night to compromise with honour he could so easily save himself he could by a word sweep away the cloud which hung over his future and not his future only but daisys the outrage had been a cowardly one two of its perpetrators at least were worthless boys and the other was away from grandcourt and might possibly never come back was it worth risking so much for so small a scruple did not his duty to grandcourt demand sacrifices of him and could he not that very night remove a dark blot from its scutcheon so the battle went on and railsford fought it out inch by inch like a man he was not singlehanded in such matters he had a friend who always wins and he helped railsford to win that night chapter twenty four the strange adventures of a brownpaper parcel railsford was somewhat surprised at callover on the following morning to observe that neither arthur herapath nor digby oakshott answered to their names why are they not here he asked theyre still on the sick list said ainger has anyone seen them yes sir said tilbury they were coughing a good deal in the night and said they felt too bad to get up this morning and had the medical doctors leave to stay in bed till he came round oh said railsford and walked upstairs to interview these two unfortunate invalids well said he entering the room just in time to interrupt what he imagined from the sounds heard outside must have been a spirited bolster match how are you both this morning they both began to cough wearily a little better i think said arthur with fortitude i think we might try to get up later on but the medical said wed better wait till he saw us and he relapsed into a painful fit of coughing i feel very hot all over said the baronet who was notoriously energetic at bolster matches now you two said railsford sternly just get up at once i shall remain in the room while you dress they looked at him in reproachful horror and broke into the most heart rending paroxysm of coughing he had ever listened to stop that noise said he and get up at once oh please markymr railsfordwere so bad andand daisy would be so sorry if i got consumption or anything of that sort we shall get into trouble sir added the baronet for getting up without the medicals leave he told us to stay in bed and here another cough which however was promptly suppressed you will get into no more trouble with him than you have got into already for getting up last night after he had gone and acting in the farce in the fourth classroom the culprits regarded one another with looks of consternation did you see us then asked arthur you see markymr railsford i meanwed promised to i want no explanations arthur you had no business to get up then and youve no business not to get up now shamming isnt honourable and that ought to be reason enough why you and oakshott should drop it after this the delinquents dressed in silence and followed their master down to the classroom where the ironical welcome of their fellows by no means tended to smooth their ruffled plumage however as they were down their colds recovered in ample time to allow of their taking part in the cricket practice in the afternoon and the exercise had a wonderful effect in reconciling them to their compulsory convalescence they were sitting half working half humbugging in their study at preparationtime when railsford again looked in herapath said he if you bring your cicero down to my room presently ill show you the passages marked for the swift exhibition in due time arthur presented himself he and digby between them had smelt a rat hes going to jaw you you bet said the baronet looks like it i wonder why he always picks on you and me for jawing why cant he give the other fellows a turn never mind he was civil to us that night at the abbeyi suppose id better let him have his own way so after a fitting interval he repaired with his books to the lions den these astute boys had been not quite beside the mark in their surmise that the master had ulterior reasons in inviting arthur to his study he did want to jaw him but not in the manner they had anticipated after going through the cicero and marking the portions requiring special getting up for the examination railsford put down his pen and sat back in his chair arthur said he there is something i should like to ask you its coming i knew it said arthur to himself do you remember arthur last term you and i had some talk one evening about what happened to mr bickers and the mysterious way in which that secret had been kept arthur fidgeted uncomfortably oh yes said he thats all done with now though isnt it i think not do you remember my asking you if you knew anything about it which i did not oh yesi didnt i know nothing more about it than you do how do you know that what if i knew nothing about it arthur looked puzzled i want you to be frank with me it is a matter of great importance to us all to get this affair cleared upmore to me than you guess all i ask you is do you know who did it why yes said arthur how did you discover did anyone tell you no i found out do you consider that you have no right to tell me the name arthur stared at him and once more thought to himself what a wonderfully clever fellow this brotherinlaw of his was it doesnt much matter if i tell you said he only i mean to keep it dark from anybody else who was it then inquired the master with beating heart tell me why you know i wish to hear the name from you arthur repeated the master all right mark railsford esquire ma thats the name isnt it railsford started back in his chair as if he had been shot and stared at the boy what what do you sayi arthur had never seen acting like it all right i tell you its safe with me ill keep it as dark as ditchwater arthur youre either attempting a very poor joke or you are making a most extraordinary mistake do you really mean to say that you believe it was i who attacked mr bickers arthur nodded knowingly and that you have believed it ever since the middle of last term yesi say werent you the only one in it then asked the boy who could not any longer mistake the masters bewildered and horrified manner for mere acting railsford felt that this was a time of all others to be explicit i did not do it arthur and i had no more connection with the affair thanyour father arthur was duly impressed by this asseveration its a precious rum thing then about all those things you know they looked awfully fishy against you what things i dont understand you perhaps id better not tell you said the boy getting puzzled himself i cant force you to tell me but when you know its a matter of great importance to me to know how you or anybody came to suspect such a thing of me i think you will do it arthur thereupon proceeded to narrate the history of the finding of the matchbox sack and wedge of paper with which the reader is already familiar and considerably astonished his worthy listener by the businesslike way in which he appeared to have put two and two together and to have laid the crime at his railsfords door nothing would satisfy the boy now but to go up and fetch down the incriminating articles and display them in the presence of the late criminal to his wrath and amazement when he went to the cupboard he foundwhat it had been the lot of a certain classical personage to find before himthat the cupboard was bare the articles were nowhere to be seen dig on being charged with their abstraction protested that he had never set eyes on them and when arthur told him the purpose for which they were wanted he was scarcely less concerned at the mysterious disappearance than his friend arthur finally had to return to railsford without the promised evidence i cant make it out said he theyre gone did anyone know about this except yourself dig knew said arthur and he must have collared them who oakshott oh no but i happened to say something last term just after that trial we had you know i was talking about it on the strict quiet of course to felgate felgate exclaimed the master and the whole truth flashed upon him at once yes he promised to keep it dark i really didnt think there was any harm you know as he is a prefect you think he has taken the things then must have said arthur i dont know why though ill go and ask him you had better not said railsford if felgate had taken them he probably had some reason and there was no occasion to involve arthur any further in the business the thing is said arthur still sorely puzzled if it wasnt you who was it railsford smiled that is a question a great many persons are asking but you are the only boy i have met with who has no doubt in his mind that i was the guilty person arthur winced im awfully sorry sir said he ill tell them all you had nothing to do with it i think you had better say nothing how do you know i am not telling you a lie now arthur winced once more he would have preferred if railsford had given him one hundred lines for daring to suspect him and had done with it i say said he you neednt tell them at home marky i know i was a cad especially when you were such a brick that night at the abbey and ill never do it again theyd be awfully down on me if they knew my dear boy you are not a cad and i shall certainly not tell anyone of your little mistake but leave me now i have a lot of things to think about goodnight arthur returned to his room in dejected spirits he had made a fool of himself he knew and done his best friend an injustice consequently he felt for once in a way thoroughly ashamed of himself what irritated him most of all was the loss of the articles he had so carefully treasured up as evidence against somebody felgates collared them thats certain said he and why he has a big row on with marky replied dig i expect he means to bowl him out about this thats it said arthur thats what hes up to i say dig we ought to be able to pay him out you and i and save old marky im game said dig but how get the things back anyhow lets see theyve got something on at the forum tonight havent they yestwo to one hell be there why of course he will hes got to second the motionsomething about the fine arts arthur laughed well try a bit of fine art on him i vote come on old man well have a look round his rooms for the traps so they sallied out and after peeping into the forum on their way to ascertain that their man was safely there they marched boldly upstairs to his study if it had not been for the righteousness of their cause these boys might have thought twice before entering anyones room in his absence but arthur in his present temper had cast to the winds all scruples and regarding himself merely as a robbed lioness searching for her whelps he would have liked to meet the man who would tell him he hadnt a perfect right to be where he was dig for his part was not prepared to raise any such awkward question the boys instinct had told them right for one of the first things they beheld on a corner of the windowsill apparently put there hurriedly before starting for the forum was a brownpaper parcel corresponding exactly with the missing bundle it was carefully tied up and under the string was thrust an envelope addressed to mr bickers arthur whistled and dig ran forward to capture the lost property steady said the former warily perhaps its just a dodge to catch us see how it lies in case we have to put it back they took the necessary bearings with all precaution and then hurried back with their prize to their own study how long before the forums up demanded arthur depositing the parcel on the table twenty minutes said dig all serene the things had evidently been recently tied up with new string in fresh brown paper the wedge of paper and the matchbox being rolled up in the middle of the sack that seems all right said arthur now lets see the letter he carefully slid a penholder under the fold of the envelope so as to open it without breaking and extracted the letter which ran as follows dear siri send you the three things i told you of the sack has his initials on it the paper belongs to him as you will see and he is the only man in the house who could reach up to put the matchbox on the ledge please do not mention my name my only reason is to get justice done yours truly tf oh the cad was the joint exclamation of the two readers as they perused this treacherous epistle look alive now said arthur cut down as fast as ever you can and fetch one of those turfs lying on the corner of the grass you know whats that for asked dig who felt quite out of the running never mind cut away theres no time to lose dont let anyone see you dig obeyed and selected one of the turfs in question which he clandestinely conveyed up to his room now lend a hand to wrap it up said arthur dont you see itll make a parcel just about the size and weight of the sack mind how you tie it upa double knot not a bow dig began to perceive what the sport was at last and grinned complacently as he tied up the new parcel into an exact counterfeit of the old arthur overhauled it critically and pronounced it all right now said he well write him a letter he sat down and dashed off the following dig nudging vehement approval of the contents from behind sirim a cad and a liar and a thief dont believe a word i say you can tell anyone you like most of them know already yours truly jerry sneak thats ripping exclaimed the admiring dig as this elegant epistle was carefully folded into the original envelope and after being gummed down was thrust under the string of the counterfeit parcel oh i wish i could be there to see it opened we may get into a row for it said arthur i dont care itll show him up and be a real legup for marky look alive now and come and put it back in his room so they sallied up once more and carefully replaced the parcel exactly where they had found it and then rejoicing exceedingly dodged down again it seemed to them a politic thing just to look in at the forum on their way down to witness the end of the debate and take part in the division they had not the slightest idea what the debate was about but they made themselves prominent among the ays and cheered loudly when the motion was declared to be carried by two votes felgate nodded to them as he passed out little guessing the real meaning of the affectionate smile with which they returned the greeting so your colds better youngster said he to arthur looks like it replied arthur felgates first glance as he entered the room was towards the corner in which he had left his parcel he had just been cording it up that evening when he suddenly remembered his engagement at the forum and in the hurry of the discovery he had carelessly left it out instead of as he had intended locking it up however thought he to himself its all safe as it happens i wont send it over to bickers till tomorrow afternoon just before the masters session it will be far more effective if he opens it in the brutes presence and after all i dont care a twopennypiece if he knows it comes from me or notthe cad he had half a mind to open the letter and tell mr bickers to mention his name if he chose but just as he was about to do so munger came in to see him so he abandoned the idea and locked the parcel up safely in his drawer felgate had as the reader may have judged come to the conclusion that it was time to play his trump card against his enemy railsfords reporting of him to the doctor had been to mix metaphors a little the last straw which breaks the patient camels back he had had a very warm and uncomfortable quarter of an hour with the headmaster and as we know had defended himself on the plea that railsford being a malefactor himself was not competent to judge of the conduct of his boys the doctor had severely silenced this covert accusation although taking note of it sufficiently to suggest the very awkward string of questions which he put the following morning to the unlucky master of the shell felgate however had an impression that his statement to the doctor had missed fire and being determined not wholly to cast his trump card away he had walked across and sought an interview with mr bickers that estimable gentleman was considerably impressed by discovering first of all that this boy was the author of the mysterious letter last term and secondly that he possessed such satisfactory evidence of the strange story he accepted felgates statement that his sole motive was the credit of grandcourt and the relief of his own conscience without too particularly inquiring into its value and undertook not to mention his informers name in any use he might have to make of the information to that end he suggested it would be better for him to have the evidence to produce when required felgate promised to send it over to him next day if that would suit mr bickers said it would suit admirably there was to be a masters meeting in the evening when no doubt the question would come up and if felgate preferred not to appear himself he might send mr bickers the things there with a letter which the master promised to read without disclosing the name of the writer this seemed a satisfactory plan and felgate hoped that in return for what he was doing mr bickers would intercede with the doctor to restore him to his prefecture which mr bickers said he would do and the interview ended felgate had not much difficulty in possessing himself of the articles arthur had himself exhibited them to him last term and he remembered the corner of the locker in which they had lain probably arthur had never looked at them since and would be very unlikely to miss them now even if he did felgate didnt care the securing them was easy enough for on that particular evening arthur and dig were roosting on the big arch of wellham abbey in no condition to interfere if all their worldly goods had been ransacked the remainder the reader knows that eventful evening was to witness one more solemnity before the order for lights out cut short its brief career arthur and dig having returned to their study held a grave consultation over the sack and matchbox and wedge of paper wed better hide them said dig where he cant find them again not safe said arthur wed better burn them burn them said dig astounded by the audacious proposition then we give up all our evidence good job too all the better for marky theyve done us no good so far this was true and dig having turned the matter over said he was game the conspirators therefore locked their door and piled up their fire it was long since their study had glowed with such a cheerful blaze the resinwheel flared and crackled and spat as if it was in the jest and was enjoying it and the flames blazed up the chimney as though they were racing who should be the first to carry the joke outside the matchbox and paper wedge vanished almost instantaneously and the old bonedry sack itself rose grandly to the occasion and flared away merrily inch by inch until a quarter of an hour after the illumination had begun the last glowing vestige of it had skipped up after the sparks the boys were sitting complacently contemplating this glorious finale when a loud knock came at the door and a shout in aingers voice of let me in whats the row cried arthur shovelling the ashes under the grate while dig with wonderful presence of mind whipped out the toasting fork and stuck half a loaf on the end of it open the door cried ainger accompanying his demand with a kick which made the timbers creak your chimneys on fire arthur rushed and opened the door while dig once more with wonderful presence of mind seized up the bath bucket and emptied it on the fire you young idiots shouted ainger as he rushed in halfblinded with the smoke raised by digs coup de theatre youll have the house on fire bring a jug with you both of you up to the roof they each snatched up a jug and with pale countenances followed the captain up to the skylight as they emerged on to the roof they were horrified to see the chimney belching forth sparks and smoke with unmistakable fierceness fortunately the roof was flat and the chimneypot accessible the contents of the three jugs rapidly damped the ardour of the rising flames and in five minutes after aingers first knock at the door the danger was all over luckily i happened to see it from smedleys room opposite said the captain whatever had you been cooking for supper they laughed it was evident the captain was not going to visit the misadventure severely on their heads something good said arthur but i guess itll be a little overdone now thanks awfully ainger for helping us out we might have got into a jolly row if it hadnt been for you mightnt we dig and they departed peacefully to bed leaving ainger to wonder what was the use of being the captain of a house when your main occupation is to put out fires kindled by the juniors and be patted on the back by them in return chapter twenty five the blow falls my good friend said monsieur lablache you are in a great trouble i am sorry for you monsieur had looked in as he sometimes did to breakfast in his friends study the two men one strong the other weak still clung to one another in an odd sort of friendship railsfords protection had improved monsieurs position in the school not a little the boys of his own house were more tolerant of his foreign peculiarities and some of the other masters taking to heart the chivalrous example of their junior colleague had begun to think better of the unpopular detention master and to recognise good qualities in him to which hitherto they had been blind if monsieur could only have got it out of his head that he was a born diplomatist there would not have been a more harmless master in grandcourt i am sorry for you my good friend repeated he but you will be brave really lablache you dont give a man an appetite for breakfast things dont look very cheerful i know but what special cause for lamentation have we bad lies will be told of you at the masters meeting tonight said the frenchman but take courage mon ami i shall be there have you any idea what the lies are to be asked railsford who perhaps was not as jubilant as he might have been at this last cheering promise meester beekaire so i have heard desires to accuse you of having assaulted him it is absurd but no i overhear him say to meester rogers in the masters hall that he has evidence he has evidenceho ho it is absurd railsford had not much difficulty after his talk with arthur last night in guessing where this evidence was likely to be and whence it proceeded if that was the whole of the trouble he had to face he could have afforded to laugh with monsieur but the doctors question still rang in his ears that he could not get round or avoid bickers no doubt believes he is right said he but as you say monsieur he is absurdi wish he had been allowed to say what he wanted at the last meeting when i wasnt there but mon ami it would be unfair let him say it to your face and you stand up and say to him to his face it is onewhat you call it one very big lie well i will do my best said railsford smiling it is a wretched business altogether it is strange it is a secret still i have my thoughts often friend railsford i sometimes think of this boy and sometimes of that boy i have even said to myself why do we look only in meester railsfords house why could it not befor i see boys of all the houseswhy could it not be perhaps one of meester beekaires own boys they hate himi wish branscombe would come back i think if he did i would ask him railsford shifted his chair uneasily and suddenly changed the conversation how are the little girls asked he poor monsieur it was easy to turn him from any subject by a question like this his eyes glistened at the mere mention of their names and as he sat there and talked about them with their portraits lying on the breakfasttable before him mr bickers branscombe even railsford himself vanished out of sight and his world held nothing but just those three little absent girls of his far away in his beloved france railsford was tempted more than once during the day to absent himself boldly from the masters meeting in the evening and allow matters to take whatever course they chose in his absence after all he said to himself the fatal question will be put sooner or later and then i must go down probably said the bolder spirit within him but keep your feet railsford my brave fellow as long as you can so he braced himself up to the ordeal and walked across at the appointed time calm and collected determined to die game if die he must it was a full meeting but to everybodys surprise most of all railsfords dr ponsford was not present the headmaster as i have said had the greatest belief in holding himself aloof from the settlement of any question which could possibly be settled without him one might have supposed that the present question was one which would require his particular handling ultimately it would no doubt but meanwhile he would let his lieutenants sift the various issues raised and send up to him only the last point for his adjudication railsford was disappointed on the whole for his one wish was to have the matter settled once for all and to know the worst before he went to bed that night mr roe and grover and one or two more of his friends came forward to greet him as he entered as if nothing was about to take place but he did not feel actor enough to keep up the farce and retired to his back seat at the first opportunity and waited impatiently for the meeting to begin the usual routine business seemed interminable the little questions of procedure and discipline which were brought up and talked over had very little interest to him and once when he found his opinion was being directly invited on some matter he had with confusion to admit that he had not gathered what the question was at last mr roe said turning over the agenda paper that disposes of all the ordinary business the only other matter is a personal question adjourned from our last meeting whereupon everyone settled himself in his place expectantly mr bickers rose briskly and made his speech mr roe and gentlemen said he i am sorry once again to trouble the meeting with the affairs of so very unimportant a person as myself and i can only repeat what i have said before and what i have a right to take credit for that my only motive in doing so is my clear duty to grandcourt and the removal from a large number of innocent boys of a stigma under which they at present suffer here someone said hear hear and everybody agreed that mr bickers had begun well in february last continued he i was unfortunate enough to meet with some personal violence while passing the door of an adjoining house in the dark i was seized from behind enveloped in a sack which was tied over my head and shoulders in a manner which both gagged me and rendered me powerless to move my arms my feet were also tied together and in this condition i was dragged into a cupboard under the stairs and there left for the night my impression is that two or three strong persons were engaged in the outrage although the pinioning was performed by only one i was released in the morning by my colleague in whose house i had been attacked who with his senior boys untied my hands and expressed himself as greatly astonished and indignant at what had befallen me i fully believed at the time these protestations on my colleagues part were sincere here mr bickers was beginning to get aggressive and the backs of one or two of railsfords friends particularly monsieurs back went up that same morning gentlemen the doctor came and challenged the house to produce the offender or offenders every boy in the house was called over and questioned separately said each one denied not only that he had done it himself but that he had any knowledge of who had every member of the house except the master of the house was thus questioned the master was not challenged the house was disgraced by the doctor and from that time to this the secret has been carefully kept but capital has been made out of the supposed misfortune of the house to set on foot several ambitious schemes which depended for their success on the continued isolation of the house from the rest of the school the master of the house was a prime mover in these schemes and in consequence decidedly interested in preserving the new state of affairs now gentlemen you may ask why i make all this preamble hear hear from monsieur and order order from the chairman i do so because i feel i have no right to take for granted that you all know what is nevertheless a notorious fact in grandcourt now gentlemen it appears that my colleagues acquiescence in the disgrace of his house was not shared by some of his boys certainly not by onewhose name i am not at liberty to mentionbut whom i can speak of honourably as being actuated by disinterested motives in securing justice to myselfwhich is a matter of small momentand in removing a slur from the good name of grandcourt this boy took the trouble to make some inquiries shortly after the event and succeeded in getting together some evidence which when i produce it i think will convince you that little doubt remains as to the identity of the real culprit i should have preferred if my informant might have been present here to state his own case but he is naturally reluctant to come forward he has however described to me what the nature of his evidence is and i have his full authority for making use of that information now in the first place he claims to have found the sack in which i was enveloped and which was left on the floor of the cupboard where i had been imprisoned after my release this sack he tells me bears the initials mr which correspond with the initials of the midland railway dryly observed grover amid some smiles which roused mr bickers considerably no sirthe initials mr correspond with the name of the master of the house in which i was assaulted they belong to mark railsford railsford sat with his lips drawn contemptuously during this announcement which failed to make the impression on the meeting generally which the speaker had expected but he went on in the second place he found that the door which closes by itself when not propped open had been held open by a twisted piece of paper which on being unrolled was found to be part of a newspaper addressed to mark railsford esquire grandcourt this made rather more impression than the last except on railsford who still faced his accuser scornfully in the third place a matchbox was discovered on the ledge above the door placed there to judge by its freedom from dust very recently i ask you to notice three things in connection with this gentlemen a match was struck while i was being dragged into the cupboard a match found on the floor that morning corresponds exactly with the matches in the box placed up on the ledge and finally the height of that ledge from the ground shows that it could only have been placed there by someone over six feet high and the only person of that height in the house is the master mr mark railsford a dead silence followed this and masters present wondered how railsford could still sit so indifferent and unmoved now gentlemen continued mr bickers after having allowed a due interval for this last shot to go home i should not be justified in repeating these assertions unless i were also prepared to lay before you the proofs on which those assertions are based i therefore requested my informant to let me have these he has done this and this parcelhere he took up a brownpaper parcel from the seat beside himcontaining the articles i have mentioned was placed in my hands just as i came to this meeting i have not even examined them myself so that i am sure you will do me the credit of believing that when i place them just as they are in your hands mr chairman i cannot be charged with having tampered with my evidence in any way here he handed the parcel up to mr roe amid dead silence had you not better open it yourself asked the chairman who evidently did not like the business no sir i request you will do so and that mr railsford will confront the contents first in your hands not mine there is a letter here addressed to you said mr roe please read that also said mr bickers declining to take it mr roe knitted his brow and tore open the envelope his brows went up with a start as his eyes fell on the opening words he read the letter through and then turning to mr bickers said this letter is not intended for reading aloud mr bickers yes it is i insist on your reading it mr chairman if you insist i will do it but i think you would be wiser to put it in your pocket read it mr chairman repeated mr bickers excitedly mr roe accordingly read in a voice which betrayed some emotion sir im a cad and a liar and a thief dont believe a word i say you can tell anyone you like most of them know already yours truly jerry sneak the effect of the letter may be more easily imagined than expressed the audience received it first with astonishment then with consternation and finally as the light dawned in on their minds with laughter railsford alone looked serious and bewildered as for mr bickers his face turned white and he looked for a moment as if he would spring at mr roes throat he snatched the letter from the chairmans hand and looked at it and then stared round him on the amused faces of his colleagues you have been hoaxed i fear said mr roe mr bickers said nothing but pointed to the parcel am i to open it asked the chairman yes yes said the master hoarsely mr roe obeyed and disclosed the turf amid another general laugh in which all but railsford and mr bickers joined the latter had by this time lost his selfcontrol he glared round him like a baited animal and then rounding suddenly on railsford exclaimed this is your doing you are at the bottom of this railsford vouchsafed no reply but a contemptuous shrug he was in no humour to see the joke disgust was his one sensation order please said the chairman these meetings if they are to be of any value must be conducted without any quarrelling mr bickers may we consider this unpleasant affair now at an end no shouted mr bickers i have been insulted i dont care by whom the matter is not at an endnot till i have received an answer from this railsford here to my question let him get up like a man and say he did not attack me like a coward last term and allow the blame and suspicion to fall on others let him even get up and declare that he does not know anything about the affair i defy him to do it he dare not a silence followed this violent tirade and everyone turned to railsford he sat motionless and pale with his eyes on his accuser have you anything to say mr railsford or shall we consider the matter at an end i have nothing to say said the master of the shell sitting except that i refuse to answer these questions very good quite right said monsieur springing to his feet when meester beekaire can speak like a gentleman he here the chairman interrupted i addressed my question to mr railsford said he i can understand he declines under present circumstances to make any reply to these accusations but may i suggest it would be most unfortunate if we had to adjourn this disagreeable question again hear hear i imagine it can be very easily terminated tonight we are all ready i am sure to make allowance for a gentleman who is suffering from the irritation of a practical joke his questions were undoubtedly offensively put and mr railsford as i say was entitled to refuse to answer them but i ask him in order to close this painful controversy finally to allow me as chairman of this meeting to repeat those questions myself so that he may have an opportunity as no doubt he desires of formally placing on record his denial of the charges which have been brought against him railsford gasped inwardly the longexpected blow was coming and he felt it was no use to run from it any longer the questions resolve themselves to two first is there any foundation for the charge that you committed or in any way participated in the assault on mr bickers last term and second is there any truth in the statement that you know who the culprit or culprits are mr bickers have i stated your questions correctly yes growled mr bickers let him answer them if he can every one now turned to railsford who rose slowly to his feet and fixed his eyes full on the chairman his friends thought they had rarely seen a finerlooking man than he appeared at that moment and looked forward with pleasure to applauding his denial and greeting him as finally clear of the odious suspicions under which he had laboured for so long his reply was brief and clear mr roe and gentlementhe first question i answer with an emphatic negative the second question i do not answer at all a bombshell exploding in the hall could not have caused greater consternation and astonishment than this avowal grover monsieur and his other friends turned pale and wondered if they were dreaming others frowned mr bickers smiled i knew it said he i knew it mr roe said you can hardly have heard the question properly mr railsford may i repeat it i heard it perfectly well said railsford you are aware of the very serious nature of your reply do you give any reasons for your refusal none at all i think said mr grover rising gallantly to protect his friend it would be well if this meeting adjourned i submit there is no further business before us i oppose that said mr bickers who had recovered his calmness rapidly i propose mr chairman that this meeting adjourn for five minutes while the headmaster is invited to come and assist our decisions this was seconded if i may be allowed said railsford i should like to support that proposal after that of course it was agreed to and for five minutes the meeting stood suspended railsfords friends utilised the interval by begging him to reconsider his position and if possible put himself right by stating all he knew he thanked them but said it was impossible and finally withdrew again to his own seat and waited anxiously for the doctors arrival in due time the headmaster arrived with a tolerable notion of the object of this unusual summons mr roe briefly explained what had taken place and reported the circumstances under which the headmasters authority was now invited for once the doctor looked genuinely distressed despite all his rebuffs he had for some weeks looked upon the master of the shell as one of the most promising men on his staff and he deplored the infatuation which now promised to bring his connection with grandcourt to an abrupt end but there was no alternative mr railsford said he you have heard mr roes statement is it correct quite correct sir and you persist in your refusal to say whether or no you have any knowledge as to who the persons were who assaulted mr bickers i cannot answer the question you know that the inference from such a refusal is that you know the names and refuse to give them upin other words that you are shielding the evildoers i cannot answer that or any question on the subject doctor ponsford i am aware of my position and feel that i have no course open but to place my resignation in your hands once more poor monsieur started up oh no he has good reasons he is not bad he must not leave the doctor motioned him to be silent and then addressing railsford said your resignation of course follows as a natural consequence of the position you adopt it is better that you should offer it than that i should have to ask for it i shall take a week to consider my duty in the matter this meeting is now at an end chapter twenty six things go well with mr bickers it is not to be wondered at if the proceedings at the remarkable masters session just reported leaked out somehow and became the talk of grandcourt it was rarely that anything the masters did or said in their solemn conclaves made much impression on the complacency of their boys but on the present occasion it was other wise rumour had already been active as to the feud between mr bickers and the master of the shell and not a few of the betterinformed boys had heard that it was connected with the outrage last term and that mr bickerss intention was to bring that crime home in some manner best known to himself to mr railsford the idea was generally poohpoohed as a piece of vindictive folly for all that there was a good deal of speculation as to the proceedings at the masters session and when it was over curiosity to learn the result the hurried summons to the doctor during the evening had not passed unnoted the general opinion was that the row had come suddenly and acutely to a head when two superior officers fly at one anothers throats the spectacle may be interesting and even amusing to the onlooker but i never heard of it doing anything towards the promotion of discipline or the encouragement of good tone among the rank and file the quarrel of the two masters at grandcourt certainly failed to do any good to the school and if it did less mischief than might have been expected it was because up till now the parties principally concerned had had their own reasons for keeping it private felgate was naturally anxious to hear the result of an entertainment to which he had as he imagined made so valuable a contribution he therefore ventured to call on mr bickers the following morning for a little friendly chat his reception did not quite come up to his expectations so sir exclaimed mr bickers meeting him at the door you have thought me a fitting subject for one of your jokes have you what have you to say for yourself felgate looked at him in amazement i really dont understand said he what joke you wish to keep it up do you very well sir and mr bickers took down a cane you have thought fit to amuse yourself at my expense said mr bickers i intend to repay myself at yours hold out your hand you are not going to punish me for hold out your hand sir really i acted for the best if it was a mistake i do you hear me sir hold out your hand at once felgate sullenly obeyed and mr bickers there and then discharged his little debt adding interest now go away and dont dare to come near me again stay take with you these tokens of your illtimed humour they may serve to amuse someone else begone and he thrust into his hands the unlucky parcel and closed the door in his face felgate smarting and bewildered walked back to his house with the parcel under his arm furious with mr bickers and as eager now for revenge on him as yesterday he had been for revenge on railsford what could have happened to make all his carefully laid scheme fall through and set mr bickers whom he had counted upon as an ally thus suddenly against him had railsford met him with some countercharge or turned the tables by some unexpected move in the face of his accusers that could not be for already the rumour had spread through the house that mr railsford had resigned his post what did mr bickers mean by talking of a joke and thrusting back upon him the very proofs which but yesterday had been objects of such anxious care and solicitude to them both felgate flung the unlucky parcel down on the table and called himself a fool for ever having meddled with it was it possible he himself had been made a fool of and that these precious proofs had after all been trumped up by that young scapegrace herapath to hoodwink him at any rate arthur might have his property back now and much good might it do him he should felgate started as he suddenly caught sight of what looked like a blade of grass protruding from a rent in the brown paper he looked again it was not one blade only but two or three with an exclamation of consternation he tore off the covering and disclosedthe turf a joke no wonder mr bickerss manner had been a trifle stiff that morning however had it got there it was like a conjurers trick no one had seen or touched the parcel but himself he had himself placed it in mr bickerss hands indeed from the time he had taken the things from herapaths cupboard till the moment of parting with them he had scarcely had his eyes off it stay that evening he was at the forum he had left it for an hour unguardedly in his room yet even then he could almost have sworn the parcel had been untouched in his absence besides the letter was there still directed in his own hand he picked up the envelope to satisfy himself it was the same of course it was and he had explained in his letter what the articles were he took out the letter and glanced at it and as he did so the blood rushed to his face and he knew at last that he had been made a fool of it needed no great penetration to guess who it was to whom he owed his humiliation so he armed himself with a ruler in one hand and the parcel in the other and walked over to herapaths study the proprietors were at home and had apparently expected the visit for an elaborate barricade had been drawn across the door by means of the table bedstead and other furniture so that felgate when he looked in could barely see more than the heads of his young friends let me in he said trying to push the door open awfully sorry cant come in said dig cheerfully herapath and i are having a scrub up come again presently do you hear me you two let me in at once dont you hear were doing the place up said arthur go to some of the other chaps if you want a job done i want you two and if you dont let me in at once ill force my way in say what you want there we can hear said arthur felgate made a violent effort to effect an entrance but without avail the stout iron bedsteads held their own and the wedge inserted under the door prevented it from opening farther than to allow the invaders head to peep in i shall report you for this said felgate ha ha ha youre not a monitor my boy go and do it well report you for invading our privacy say what you want there cant you you know what i want well enough said felgate forced at last to recognise that entrance was hopeless whats the good of coming to tell us then responded dig what business had you to go to my room the other evening went to return your call said arthur sorry we werent at home when you called on us and thought wed do the polite and look you up that makes us square doesnt it do you know i could get you expelled for coming and taking things out of my room said felgate ha ha do it look sharp well all go home together i want the things you took away do you hear one of the masters has sent for them they are to be given up immediately are they tell one of the masters if he wants them hed better go up the chimney after them i shant waste my time here any more youll be sorry for it both of you when i catch you all right wait till then i say you havent seen a lump of turf about have you theres one missing ha ha chimed in dig how did you like the writing of the letter jolly hand our chaps write in the shell dont they felgate had not remained to hear these last two genial inquiries but had returned storming and raving to his room the only game left him now was revenge he would be very much surprised if that did not come off a little better than the last arthur and dig meanwhile were by no means in the elated spirits which their successful resistance to the siege might have warranted not that they were affected by the bullys retreating threat they had heard that sort of thing from one or two fellows in their day and their bones were still unbroken no what afflicted them and plunged them into a sea of wrath and misery was the report circulated that morning and confirmed by reliable testimony that marky was going to leave grandcourt at first they could not credit it but when ainger himself with a long face confirmed it they were forced to believe their ears why they asked but ainger had nothing to tell them on that score they therefore took the bold step of waiting upon the master of the shell himself marky said arthur its not true youre leaving is it the misery of the boys tone went to railsfords heart i am afraid it is true arthur how did you hear everybody knows but i say why i have resigned you resignedof your own accord havent you been kicked out then arent you obliged to go i am obliged to go thats why i have resigned youll know all about it some day but i say cant you withdraw your resignation and stay oh i say marky we shall be awfully up a tree without you here why ever are you going cant it all be squared no old fellow i fear not but i am not going for a week yet lets make the most of the time and get ahead with our work for remember youve that swift exhibition coming near ahead work exclaimed arthur in disgust ill not do a stroke of work more i tell you what if you leave marky i shall leave too and so will dig there my dear old fellow said railsford kindly you are talking like a little donkey if you want to help me youll just determine to work all the harder now i say said dig shirking the question have you got into a row mr railsford is it anything aboutyou know what you really mustnt ask me boys its sufficient that i have to go and i dont think you two will believe it is because i have done anything wrong rather not said arthur warmly but i say marky just tell us thisit wasnt us got you into the row was it it was awfully low of me to let it out to felgate but we bowled him out in time just when he was going to send those things to bickers did you see the nice trick we played him he wont be able to do it again for we burned the things such a flareup it isnt our fault youre going is it no not a bit said railsford now you had better go they went and proclaimed their masters wrongs through the length and breadth of the house the shell took up the matter specially and convened an informal meeting to consult as to what was to be done lets send him a round robin and ask him not to go suggested maple lets get our governors to write to the doctor said another lets all leave if he does thats bound to make him stay said a third arthur however had a more practical proposal what wed better do is to get up a whacking petition to pony said he weve got a right to do it and if all the fellows will sign it he cant well let him go the question arose who was to write the petition and after some discussion it was resolved to call the amiable stafford into their councils he at once suggested that if the petition was to be of any weight it should come from the entire house with the captains name at the head of the list and a deputation was told off forthwith to wait upon ainger he was not very encouraging but said there would be no harm in trying and undertook to draw up the petition and sign his name first underneath the petition was short and businesslike to dr ponsford sirwe the boys of mr railsfords house have heard with great sorrow that he is to leave grandcourt we consider he has done more for our house than any other master and feel it would be the greatest loss to all of us if he were to go he does not know we are sending this we hope it will have your favourable consideration and make it possible for him to stay among us in two days this document received the signature of every boy in the house except felgate and munger who contrived to evade it ainger took no trouble to press them for their signatures and indeed stated not in a whisper that the petition would carry more weight without these two particular names than with them whereat felgate and munger felt rather sorry they had not signed a deputation was then appointed consisting of the head boy in each form represented in the house to convey the petition to the doctor arthur not being the head shell boy in the house felt very sore to be left out and prophesied all sorts of failure to the undertaking in consequence however he was consoled vastly by a fight with tilbury that same afternoon tilbury though a signatory to the petition was unlucky enough to brag in the hearing of his comrade that one reason he had signed it was because he believed railsford had had something to do with the payingout of mr bickers last term and was a friend to the house in consequence whereupon arthur crimson in the face requested him to step outside and receive the biggest hiding he had ever had in his life tilbury obeyed and although the combat was not quite so decided as arthur had boasted it disposed of the libel which had originated it and made it clear to the house that those who knew best at any rate were now as firmly resolved to defend their masters innocence as last term they had been to glory in his guilt the doctor received the deputation politely and allowed ainger to read the petition and list of names without interruption when the ceremony was over he said quietly the only fault i have to find with you is that you have presented your petition to me instead of to mr railsford it is perfectly open for mr railsford to with draw his resignation in that case it would fall to me to settle the question of his remaining here and that would be the time for you to present your petition this was not very consoling and the doctors manner discouraged any further explanation ainger therefore left the petition lying on the table and withdrew his men to report the doubtful success of their mission to their comrades the week wore on and in two days railsfords short reprieve would be up he had already begun to get together some of his things preparatory to packing up and had written out a careful paper of memoranda for the use of his successor he had allowed the work of the house to be as little as possible disturbed by the coming event and had even hurt monsieurs feelings by the peremptory manner in which he discouraged any representation being made by the masters with a view to avert his departure he had of course sent a plain unvarnished account of his position to his special correspondent which happily reached her at the same time as a highlycoloured and decidedly alarming communication on the same subject from miss daisys brother he received an answer full of courage which helped him greatly yet as the day drew near he felt himself clinging desperately to his post and hoping against hope even at the eleventh hour to see some daylight through his great difficulty had he known that on that very last day but one mr bickers had received by the post a certain letter he might have felt tempted to delay till tomorrow the final strappingup of his portmanteau for mr bickerss letter was from branscombe and was as follows siri have been expecting to return to grandcourt all this term but i am sorry to say i have been ill again and the doctor says i shall have to go abroad for some months before i go i feel i must make a confession which will surprise you as much to read as it pains me to write it i was the ringleader in the attack upon you last term at the door of mr railsfords house i was very angry at the time at having been punished by you before all my house but i am very sorry now for what happened and hope you will in time forgive me i know what trouble my conduct has caused not only to you but to mr railsford whose house has been unjustly punished for what was my offence there were three of us in it one was another boy of your house and the other was in mr railsfords house only all he did was to show us the cupboard in which we put you i should be glad to think before i go away that things are put right at grandcourt by this confession please forgive me for my revengeful act and believe me sir yours truly s branscombe psplease show this letter to dr ponsford and mr railsford this startling letter mr bickers read over several times with great amazement and no less vexation he was angry not at the injury which had been done to himself but because this letter had come just when it did tomorrow in all probability his enemy would have left grandcourt and then it would be less matter for even if the truth were then made known railsfords offence in shielding the evildoer would remain the same but now this letter might spoil everything it would at any rate postpone railsfords departure and might give him an opportunity of reinstating himself for good at grandcourt mr bickers was in a quandary he was by nature a vindictive jealous and fussy man with a low opinion of everybody and an extreme obstinacy in his own opinion but he was not naturally a dishonest man it was only when his other passions rushed out strongly in one direction and his integrity stood on the other side that his honour suffered shipwreck and went by the board it did so now for mr bickers having thought over the situation deliberately put the letter into his pocket and went about his usual avocations as if nothing had happened any amount of excuses rushed in to his assistance after all there had been three culprits and one of them belonged to the accused house railsford no doubt was shielding his own boy and branscombes confession affected in no way his offence or the penalty attached to it on the whole there was nothing to make mr bickers uncomfortable and it was observed in the masters hall that evening that he made himself quite agreeable and even nodded in a halffriendly way to railsford on the occasion of his last appearance at schooldinner after the master of the shell had retired to his house the doctor asked his other lieutenants to remain a few moments as he had a statement to make to them every one knew what that statement was to be it is only right that i should inform you said dr ponsford that i have considered it my duty to accept mr railsfords resignation and that he leaves grandcourt tomorrow i confess that i do this with great pain and regret for i have the highest opinion of mr railsfords abilities and character but discipline must be maintained in a school like ours i have no doubt that in acting as he has done mr railsford considers that he is acting honourably i do not wish to impugn his motives mistaken as i suppose them but the fact remains that he virtually admits his knowledge of the offender last term and at the same time refuses to give him up to justice under those circumstances i had no choice but to accept his resignation for a moment branscombes letter burned uncomfortably in mr bickerss pocket while the doctor was speaking but it cooled again and when mr grover said i am sure sir you will not misunderstand me when i say that your statement has caused some of us the deepest pain he felt himself able to join in the universal hear hear with quiet fervour we fully recognise continued mr grover that under the circumstances you had only this one course left open to you at the same time we who know and esteem our colleague feel that his removal will be a distinct loss to grandcourt and would like to add our own opinion to yours that in the course he has considered it right to take he has been actuated by conscientious and honourable motives mr bickers having said hear hear once did not feel called upon to repeat it at the end of this short speech and was indeed rather glad to hurry back to his own house he had an idea that this time tomorrow he should feel considerably more comfortable chapter twenty seven clearing up and clearing out railsfords farewell evening in his house was not destined to be a peaceful one he had scarcely returned from the masters dinner meditating a few final touches to his packing when sir digby oakshott baronet waited upon him the baronet was evidently agitated and more than that his face was onesided and one of his eyes glowed with all the colours of the rainbow why oakshott said the master what is the matter you have been fighting thats not half of it said dig excitedly i say markyi mean mr railsford please herapath wants to see you hes in a bad way up stairs its that cad felgate hes bashed us he was in an awful wax about the dodge we played him over that sack you know and tried to pay us out the other day but we kept him out but hes been waiting his chance ever since and when i was out of the study this evening he came in and gave it hot to herapath when i got back arthur was about done and then felgate turned on me if id been bigger i could have got a stroke or two in at his face but i couldnt do it i barked his shins though and gave him one on the neck with my left so he didnt get it all his own way but i say cant you come up and see old herapath you havent got any raw beefsteaks about have you hell want a couple to set him right railsford hurried upstairs arthur was lying on his sofa blinking up at the ceiling with his one open eyean eloquent testimony both to his friends veracity and to the activity of his assailant you see he began almost before railsford reached the patient so anxious was he to excuse his battered appearance he caught me on the hop marky when i never expected him and gave me no time to square up to him i could have made a better fight of it if hed given me time between the rounds but he didnt railsford made no remark on the unequal conflict but did what he could to assist the sufferer and reduce his countenance to its normal dimensions arthur was far less concerned at his wounds than at the moral injury which he had suffered in being so completely punished in the encounter he feared railsford would entertain a lower opinion of him in consequence if id have only known he was coming i could have made it hotter for him he said only he got my head in chancery early and though i lashed out all i could he took it out of me marky do you mind feeling if my ribs are all right i sort of fancied one of em had gone his ribs however were all there and badly as he was bruised railsford was able to pronounce that no bones were broken which greatly relieved both the boys the master helped the wounded warrior to undress and then assisted him up to the dormitory where after carefully tucking him up and advising dig to turn in too he left him and returned to his room his impulse was immediately to summon felgate and mete out to him exemplary chastisement for his dastardly act but on second thoughts he remembered that he was or rather he would be tomorrow no longer master of the house besides much as the chastisement might have relieved his own feelings it would leave the house and everyone in it in much the same position as heretofore putting everything together he decided that his last official act should be to report the matter to the doctor next morning and leave him to deal with it having come to which conclusion he strapped up his portmanteau and sent an order to jason for his cab tomorrow he was meditating an early retirement to bed when a knock sounded at the door and the three prefects entered it seemed a long while since their first embarrassed meeting in that same room at the beginning of last term much had happened since then the house had gone down into the depths and risen to the heights there had come disgrace and glory defeat and victory the ranks of the prefects themselves had been broken and the master himself had ended his brief career amongst his boys but as great a change as any had been the growing respect and sympathy between railsford and his head boys it was long since he had learned the secret that sympathy is the golden key to a boys heart as long as he tried to do without it sitting on his high horse and regarding his pupils as mere things to be taught and ordered and punished he had failed but from the moment he had seized the golden opportunity presented by the misfortune of the house to throw in his lot with it and make his interests and ambitions those of his boys he had gained a hold which no other influence could have given him his prefects had led the way in the reaction which had set in in his favour and perfect confidence bound them all together in no common bond do you mind our disturbing you sir said ainger we didnt want you to go without our telling you how awfully sorry we are we dont know what will become of the house im not sure that i much care said stafford how good of you to come like this said the master for i wanted to talk to you you must care stafford and all of you you surely arent going to give up all the work of these two terms just because a little misfortune has befallen us its not a little misfortune said ainger but a very great one all the more reason you should not be knocked over by it didnt we all set ourselves to work last term in the face of a big misfortune and didnt we get some good out of it for the house it will be my one consolation in leaving to feel sure you will not let the work of the house flag an inch remember railsfords is committed to the task of becoming cock house of the school our eleven is quite safe im certain no team in all the rest of the houses put together can beat us but you must see we give a good account of ourselves on prizeday too some of the boys have nagged a little lately in work we must keep them up to itnot by bullyingnobody will work for thatbut by working on their ambition and making the cause of each boy the cause of the whole house railsford as he uttered these words seemed to forget how soon he would have to say you instead of we he had hardly realised yet what that meant well try hard said ainger but what we wanted to say besides letting you know how sorry we are was to ask if its really necessary for you to go is there no way of getting out of it none at all that i can see said railsford fellows say you know who it was assaulted mr bickers last term and wont tell perhaps its to save some fellow in the house from being expelled but my dear fellows said railsford dont lets spoil our last evening by talking about this miserable affair i cant tell you anything at all i can only ask you to believe i have good reasons for what im doing they ought to be good reasons if the price i have to pay is to leave grandcourt and all of you it was evidently no use trying to draw him further and as the first bed bell sounded shortly afterwards they withdrew after a cordial but dismal farewell i shall see you again in the morning before i go said he the prefects walked away abstracted and downcast it was all very well for him to say keep the work up when i am gone but how were they to do it he was the pivot on which all their work had been turning and without him what chance was there of keeping the house together for a day come in here a minute you fellows said ainger as they reached the captains door we must do something to stop it thats a very feeble observation to make said barnworth is that what you want us to come in here for no hang it barnworth theres no time for chaff at present what i want to say is have we tried every possible means of finding out who scragged bickers last term i think so said stafford every one in the house has denied it if its one of our fellows its probably the biggest liar among us which means felgate said ainger or munger said barnworth its not felgate said ainger for he has burnt his fingers in trying to fix it on railsford himself and it he was the real culprit you may depend on it hed have kept very quiet munger has kept quiet said barnworth munger why hes a fool and a coward both he could never have done such a thing lets ask him ill tell you why i mentioned him i never thought of it till now the other day i happened to be saying at dinner to somebody that that affair was going to be cleared up at last and that the doctor had been in consultation with bickers and railsford about it the evening beforeyou know thats what we were toldand would probably come acrossthis was an embellishment of my ownwith a policeman and point the fellow out munger was sitting opposite me and when i began to speak he had just filled his tumbler with water and was going to drink it but halfway through he suddenly stopped and put the tumbler down with such a crack on the table that he spilt half the water on to the cloth i didnt think anything of it at the time but it occurs to me now well said ainger its an offchance staff do you mind bringing him the one thing to do said barnworth while the messenger was gone is to frighten it out of him nothing else will do well said ainger if you think so you must back me up though after a long interval stafford returned to say that munger was in bed and refused to get up good said barnworth i like that now staff you amiable old boy will you kindly go to him again and say that the prefects are waiting for him in the captains study and that if he is not here in five minutes they will have to do without him i fancy thats true isnt it he added appealing to his colleagues lets see if that doesnt draw him if it does depend upon it there was something in that tumbler barnworth was right in less than five minutes munger appeared half dressed and decidedly uneasy in his manner what do you want me for he demanded with an attempt at bluster what do you mean by not coming when we sent for you when you know perfectly well what you are wanted for what am i wanted for asked munger glancing nervously round you know well enough munger how do i know till you tell me snarled the boy if he doesnt know said barnworth to ainger significantly we must do as we proposed ill go and get my papers and be ready for you in a minute this meaningless speech had a remarkable effect on munger he stared first at one prefect then at the other and when barnworth rose as if to leave the room he said waitdont do that what is it you want to ask you know that as well as we do are you going to say what you know or not i dont know how you got to know anything about it began munger its a plot against me and we dont want all that said ainger sternly what we want to know is did you do it yourself and if not who else was in it of course i couldnt do it myself you couldnt strong as you are you helped then i had nothing to do with thethe scragging said munger ioh i say ainger you arent going to get me expelled surely do let us off this time im not the headmaster youll have to ask him that your only chance is to make a clean breast of it at once what was it you did i only opened the door of the bootbox and helped drag him in i had nothing to do with the scragging branscombe did all that himself and clipstone hung to his legs it needed all the selfcontrol of the three prefects to refrain from an exclamation of astonishment at this wonderful disclosure are you telling the truth demanded ainger i ami swear iti never even knew what they meant to do till an hour before it was clipstones idea and iowed him money for betting and he had a pull on me and made me do it but i swear i never touched bickers except to help pull him in now one question more was there anyone else in it but just you three nobody as sure as i stand here very well you can go now we shall have to tell the doctor of course and theres no knowing what he will do but its been your best chance to make a clean breast of it while you had the opportunity the wretched munger departed to his bed but not to sleep he could not conceive how railsford first and then these three prefects should have discovered his deeply hidden secret not a word about it had escaped his own lips branscombe was away and clipstone scarcely anyone in railsfords house ever saw but the secret was out and what kept munger awake that night was neither shame nor remorse but fear lest he should be expelled or perhaps worse arrested the three prefects sat late talking over their wonderful discovery its good as far as it goes said barnworth but it doesnt clear up the question how railsford got to hear of it and what his motive has been in shielding the criminals it cant have been on mungers account for the two have been at war all the term and i dont suppose since the affair he has exchanged two words with either branscombe or clipstone dont you think said the captain that now we do know all about it we might go and ask him it was a brilliant suggestion and they went but railsford was in bed and asleep and his visitors important as was their business had not the hardihood to arouse him and were reluctantly obliged to postpone their explanation till the morning even then they seemed destined to be thwarted for railsford had gone for a bathe in the river and only returned in time for callover when of course there was no opportunity for a private conference but as soon as breakfast was over they determined to catch him in his room and put an end to their suspense there and then alas not five minutes before they arrived railsford had gone out this time as cooke informed them to the doctors it seemed a fatality and who was to say whether his next move might be to quit grandcourt without even giving them a chance the only thing to do is to go and catch him at the doctors said ainger weve a right to goat least i haveto report munger all serene said barnworth better for you to go alone it would only put ponys back up if we all went for once in his life ainger felt that there were some dignities connected with the captaincy of a house and for once in his life he would have liked to transfer those dignities to any shoulders but his own but he put a bold face on it and marched across to the doctors perhaps i shall only make it worse for railsford said he to himself pony will think it precious rum of us to have let two terms go by without finding the secret out and then when it suits us to find it getting hold of it in half an hour so it is precious rum and if railsford has known the names all along and kept them quiet its not likely to make things better for him that we have discovered them on our own account anyhow im bound to report a thing like this at once and its barely possible it may turn something up for railsford as he crossed the quadrangle a cab drove in and set down a tall elderly gentleman who after looking about him advanced towards the prefect and said can you direct me to the headmasters house yes sir said ainger im going there myself its this way it wasnt often strangers made so early a call at grandcourt a fine old building this said the gentleman how many houses are there eight said ainger and whose do you belong to railsfords thats his behind us and which is mr bickers this must be the father of one of bickers fellows thought ainger that one next to ours he replied the gentleman looked up at the house in an interested way and then relapsed into silence and walked gravely with his guide to the doctors the doctors waitingroom was not infrequently tenanted by more than one caller on business at that hour of the morning for between nine and ten he was at home to masters and prefects and illconducted boys and not a few of the latter knew by painful experience that a good deal of serious business was often crowded into that short space of time this morning however there was only one occupant when ainger and the gentleman were ushered in that occupant was railsford why ainger said the master scarcely noticing the stranger i did not expect you here what are you come for to report a boy which one and for what is it a bad case its munger sir for being one of the party who assaulted bickers last term railsford started and it was an odd thing that the gentleman although his back was turned did so too how did you discover that said the master ainger briefly explained and the gentleman evidently disturbed in his mind walked to the window when the conference between the other two had ended the latter turned abruptly and said excuse me but i accidentally overheard you just now mention a matter in which i am very much interested in fact it is about it that i am here to see dr ponsford at present at that moment the doctor entered the room the other two naturally gave way to the visitor who accordingly advanced and greeted the head master allow me to introduce myself dr ponsford i dare say you do not remember me my name is branscombe you know of course the painful business on which i have come i hope mr branscombe your son is no worse we should be sorry to lose him we looked upon him as a promising boy the gentleman looked hard at the doctor you surely say this to spare my feelings dr ponsford of course i understand my son can never return here is that so i am truly sorry you would be the last to wish him to return to a school in which his name has been so disgraced it was the doctors turn to look astonished disgraced branscombe was always one of our model boys until last term said the father i dont understand you said the doctor surely dr ponsford you know by this time my sons offence i do not attempt to excuse it he voluntarily took the only right step to take in his position by confessing pardon me said the doctor but i still do not understand what confession do you refer to has not mr bickers communicated the contents of my sons letter to him written two days ago he must have received it yesterday morning in it my boy confessed that he assisted by two others had been the author of the outrage on mr bickers last term he is deeply repentant and wishes by this confession to put right all the mischief which has resulted from his act but surely mr bickers has shown you the letter he has neither shown me it nor mentioned it is it possible my boy was so anxious and restless about the affair that i promised him to come down and see you fully expecting that long before now you would have been made acquainted with everything would it trouble you to send for mr bickers certainly said the doctor then turning to ainger and railsford he said would you two come again later on and on your way ainger will you ask mr bickers to come here excuse me doctor said mr branscombe but i should much prefer if these two gentlemen remained i believe in fact thatalthough i do not know themthey have come to see you on this same business that i have perhaps railsford began the doctor when his visitor broke in railsford is this railsford why to be sure now i look at you how ungrateful you must have thought me but you slipped away so suddenly that day when mrs branscombe and i arrived that in our excitement and anxiety we scarcely had time to look at you much less to thank you indeed it was only lately my son told me how devotedly you had tended him and it breaks his heart now to think that you of all persons have suffered almost more than anybody by what he did surely sir mr bickers showed you his letter no i have not seen or heard of it said railsford but i know what you say your son has now confessed and have known it since the time of his illness dr ponsford i am at liberty now to explain myself may i do so certainly said the doctor sternly railsford thereupon gave an account of the boys sudden illness and of the accidental manner in which he had learned from the boys delirious talk of his own guilt and the guilt of his confederates i could not but regard a secret so acquired as sacred said he and even though by keeping it i was actually shielding criminals i should have been a greater traitor to betray them than to shield them may i say sir put in ainger at this point that the prefects in our house last night received a confession from munger which corresponds exactly with what mr branscombe says except that i did not mention the names of the other two culprits said mr branscombe my son did not even name them to me munger was not so particular he says clipstone suggested the affair and assisted branscombe to carry it out while he himself held the light and helped drag mr bickers into the bootbox that was what i had come to report to you now sir added he to the headmaster dr ponsford looked half stunned with this cascade of revelations and explanations then he went up to railsford and took his hand i am thankful indeed that all this has happened nowin time a few hours more and it would have come too late to prevent a great injustice to you railsford ainger go for mr bickers and come back with him mr bickers had a tolerable inkling of what awaited him and when he found himself confronted with all the overwhelming evidence which was crowded that morning into the doctors waitingroom he hauled down his colours without even coming to close quarters yes said he sullenly i did keep back the letter i considered it better for grandcourt and everyone that mr railsford should go than that this old affair should be settled after all i was the person chiefly interested in it and if i didnt choose to do what would vindicate myself i had a right to do so my opinion is that there will be no peace at grandcourt while mr railsford is here if he is now to remain i shall consider it my duty to resign i hope not mr bickers said railsford now that this unhappy secret is cleared up why shouldnt we forget the past and work together for the future i promise for myself and my house to do our best thank you said mr bickers dryly the offer is a tempting one but it is not good enough goodmorning late that afternoon mr bickers drove away in the cab which had come to take mr railsford it was an occasion for rejoicing to nobodyfor everybody agreed with railsford that it would have been possible even yet to make a fresh start and work together for the good of the school but as mr bickers thought otherwise no one complained of him for leaving another cab came on the following day for clipstone whose departure was witnessed with rather more regret because he was a good cricketer and not quite as bad a fellow as he often tried to make out his expulsion was a salutary warning to one or two who had looked up to him as a modelamongst them to munger who transferred with a heavy bad mark against his name to mr roes house thought over his former ways and tried as well as a cad of his temper can do to improve them in the future jason surely was making his fortune fast for the very next day yet one more cab drove into the square and after a brief halt drove away with felgate he left grandcourt regretted by none least of all by arthur herapath who with a beefsteak on his cheek and linseed poultice over his temple whooped defiantly at the retreating cab from his dormitory window and began to feel better and better as the rumble of the wheels gradually receded and finally lost itself in the distance chapter twenty eight dulce domum the great th day of july had come round at last and arthur herapath was in an unwonted flutter of excitement for was not this speechday and were not mr and mrs herapath and daisy due by the train ever since a week ago arthur had heard that he had run a dead heat for the swift exhibition with smythe of the schoolhouse he had not known which end of him was uppermost he envied neither smedley his gold medal nor barnworth his cavendish scholarship he condoled patronisingly with ainger on not having quite beaten the captain of the school and virtually hinted to wake who had won the first remove into the sixth that if he cared to come and sit at his feet he might be able to put him up to a thing or two for plumtre medal next christmas sir digby was scarcely less elevated for he had won the shell history prize by a deal of tremendous hard work and as he had never done such a thing in his life before he scarcely knew what to make of it fellows told him there must have been an awful shady lot in against him but that didnt satisfactorily explain the great mystery railsford told him it was the reward of downright work and he inclined to think such was the case himself arthur of course gibed at the idea all gammon said he its a lucky fluke for you and im glad for your maters sake but i wouldnt say too much about it if i were you itll make the fellows grin why should they grin at me any more than you well you see i was in the running for the swift they put it down to me last term so i was bound to pull it off you only pulled off half of it you know said dig arthur looked not quite pleased at this reference but laughed it off oh of course i cant object to go halves with young smythe if id known he was quite so hot on it i might have spurted a bit more but im glad i didnt poor young beggar hed have been precious cut up to miss it what about that boat on the river asked dig who did not swallow the whole of this are you going to buy the front or back half of it young oakshott said arthur with all the dignity of a swift exhibitioner dont you make a bigger ass of yourself than you can help the term had ended well for railsfords house although restored to their equal rights with the rest of grandcourt the spirit of enterprise and achievements which had been born during the troubles of last term survived and begot an equal spirit in the other houses who felt their prestige in danger from the bold challenge of these latest aspirants the match of railsfords against the school did not come off for the athletic union of which railsford had been chosen president by acclamation decided to limit the contests to house matches only but though deprived of an opportunity of asserting themselves against all grandcourtwhich might have been of doubtful benefitthe house beat successively the schoolhouse roes and grovers houses and as everyone had foreseen ended the term as the crack cricket house of the school how they would fulfil their other and more ambitious scheme of becoming the cock house for studies remained much longer a doubtful question no one of course supposed for a moment they would carry off all the prizes they entered for and after the removal of the ban upon the house it was pretty generally calculated they they would do a great deal less than they would have done under the old order of things but railsford was not the man to allow the house to rest on their oars because of a single success surely he represented it was not to go out to all the school that railsfords fellows could only work when they were in a bad temper glorious as it would have been to clear the prize list when they were isolated and sulky it would be still more glorious to show that not less could they do it when they were in good cheer and shoulder to shoulder with the rest of the school besides if they won all the athletic events and none of the scholastic people would be sure to say any fools can excel in sports if they let all their books go by the board thus railsford whipped up his house to their great effort and the result was that todays prize list showed that nearly half the honours of the examinations had fallen to railsfords boys not a few there were who looked gloomy that the result was no better they grudged the school the other half but there was no gloom on the masters face as he read the list down and saw the reward of his labours he was proud but his pride was not on account of mark railsford as six months ago it might have been but of every boy senior and junior who had put his back gallantly into the work and made a name for the good old house but this is a tedious digression to make while arthur and the baronet are putting on their sunday togs and brushing up their sunday tiles preparatory to going down to meet the train from london they were up to the business they had done it before they knew how essential it was to engage half a dozen cabs off different parts of the rank so as to be sure of getting one and not for the first time in their lives they bagged three or four porters in advance with a similar object the platform as usual was full of courtiers waiting for their people and many was the passage of arms our shellfish engaged in to beguile the time hullo heres a lark said arthur presently when the arrival bell had just sounded heres markydo you see him i say wont he blush when daisy goes and kisses him before all the fellows look out said the baronet here comes the scrimmage the train was steaming into the station and as usual the boys all along the platform began to run and woe betide those who either did not run too or were not lucky enough to get a perch on the footboard our young gentlemen were far too knowing to suffer disadvantage through neglect of one or another of these simple expedients here they are yelled arthur waving to his chum spotted them first shot go on simson cut your sticks off this step these are all my people in here how are you digs here weve got a cab fetch up some of our porters dig i say amid such effusive greetings mr and mrs herapath and miss daisy herapath alighted and fell into the armsor rather civilly shook hands with their son hullo daisy markys here there he comes here she is mr railsford heres daisy i say daisy added he in a confidential whisper youd better not kiss him before all the fellows wait till you get up to our study railsford arrived before this piece of fraternal counsel was ended and solved the difficulty by quietly shaking hands all round and asking mrs herapath if she had had a comfortable journey arthur had the mortification of seeing five out of his six cabs drive gaily off under his very nose with other fellows people inside and his temper was also further ruffled when all his porters waited on him at the door of the sixth for their fee however he had the presence of mind to tell them to wait till he came back in the evening and then slamming the cab door hopped up on the box beside the driverno grandcourt boy had ever been known to ride inside a fourwheeler with his peopleand drove off it was a gay scene in the great quadrangle that summer morningfathers mothers sisters cousins and aunts were all mixed up in one glorious crowd with their boys mounting guard over them and introducing them right and left to all the other boys within call mr and mrs herapath like their son were up to the business and quietly led the way through the throng towards the hall where the speeches were to be delivered and where as they knew by experience it was better to look for a seat too early than too late arthur and dig however were by no means disposed to waste daisy in so unprofitable an occupation and therefore haled her off to their study some of us who know the young lady are able to excuse the pride with which these two gallant tenders towed their prize into portfor as dig shared arthurs study of course he shared his sister on this occasion it wanted a very few dropping and facetious introductions on the way such as daisy you know my sister or what cheer sherryever hear of chuckey or no good maple my boy bespoke to set the rumour going that daisy herapath markys spoon was come and was on show in herapaths study to her credit be it said the young lady bore her ordeal with exemplary patience and goodhumour she liked everything she saw she admired the study so much what a pretty lookout on the old squarewhat a luxurious lunchah arthur had not forgotten her weakness for marmaladeand so on the boys voted her a brick and arthur went so far as to say he hoped she and marky would fix it up in time for her to come and be dame of the house before he left all this timewould you believe itthe poor master of the shell was sitting in his study very bashful and wondering whether he would get a chance of speaking to daisy during the day at all she had been spirited away from under his very eyes in the most truculent manner by her graceless brother and it seemed very doubtful whether he would be allowed mrs hastings at this moment knocked at the door and handed in a dainty little note addressed to mark railsford esquire from the doctors niece dear mr railsford wrote miss violet will you and miss herapath join us at lunch before the speeches i should so like to make her acquaintance yours truly violet ponsford so railsford armed with this authority sallied forth boldly to recapture his daisy he thought he knew where to find her and was not mistaken the little impromptu lunch was in full swing when he entered the festive study he had rarely felt so embarrassed and the manifest excitement of his two pupils at his arrival did not tend to restore him to ease and now occurred a wonderful case of presence of mind on the part of two small and tender boys no sooner had railsford entered and somewhat hesitatingly advanced to the table preparatory to stating his business than sir digby oakshott baronet winked at arthur herapath esquire and arthur herapath esquire kicked sir digby oakshott baronet under the table after which both rose abruptly to their feet and bolted from the room making the corridor echo with their laughter they explained afterwards that they wanted to bag front seats for the speeches and that no doubt was a highly satisfactory reason at twelve oclock when the earl of somebody and sir brown robinson and the other local celebrities and governors of the school entered the hall that usually dingy room was packed from end to end by a brilliant and expectant crowd the radiant faces of the boys peeped out from among the phalanges of their no less radiant people the prize boys on the front benches kept up a running fire of talk and cheering the masters in their gowns beamed right and left as if all of them put together could not give a fellow a hundred lines if he asked for it and the college servants grouped at the doors smiled as if no cloud had ever ruffled their temper since last speechday while the doctor as he rose resplendent in his academical robes and called for silence looked as if no more solemn question had engaged his attention all the term than the arrangement of his strings and the droop of the scarlet hood on his back then speechday began my readers hardly want me to describe so familiar a scene they will be able to picture to themselves better than i can picture it for them how smedley was cheered when he got up to deliver the english oration in honour of the old school and how he blushed and ran short of breath when he came to the quotation from milton at the end which had something about a violet in ithow when ainger rose to give the greek speech his own fellows rose at him amid cries of well run sir well hit well fielded and cheered every sentence of the greek though they had not an idea what it was abouthow barnworth was similarly encouraged through his latin oration with cries of jump it out one inch more mingled sometimes with false quantity speak up prompterhow after the speechifying was done the examiners rose and made their reports which nobody listened to and everyone voted a bore how next dr ponsford rose with a rustle of his silk gown which was heard all over the hall in the dead silence and proceeded to tell the earl of somebody and the other distinguished guests what everybody knew namely that the school had now come to the end of another years work and etcetera etcetera but how when he took up his list and the tables containing the prizes were wheeled forward and uncovered attention once more awoke the boys on the prize benches settled their cravats and felt if their hairpartings were all right and then sat back in their places with a delightful simulation of indifference the reader knows all about it he has been through it he knows the cheers which hailed the announcement that smedley was going up to oxford with a balliol scholarship in his pocket and that ainger had won one of the minor scholarships at georges he does not need to be told of the shouts which greeted the appearance of boy after boy from railsfords house on the platform steps to receive his prize or of the grim smile on the doctors face as a youthful voice from the prize benches forgetting the solemnity of the occasion shouted marky again bravo us nor when presently arthur herapath was called up to receive a piece of paper informing him that he was the winner of half the swift exhibition or when close behind digby oakshottthe doctor scurrilously omitted his full titletrotted up to accept the shell history prizecan anyone who has been in such a scene before fail to imagine the cheers and laughter and chaff which the public appearance of these two notorious characters evoked so the ceremony went onand the reader i think can bear me out when i say that after an hour of it i distinctly sawfor i was there near the frontseveral ladies yawn behind their fans and otherwise show signs of fatigue so that when the poor little babies who had done as honest work as anybody toddled up to get their little prizes scarcely anybody looked at them and were glad when they were polished off which i thought a shame and resolved whenever i am headmaster of a public school i shall turn my prize list upside down and call the babies up first it was all over at last and then followed that wonderful event the speechday dinner when boys and visitors all sat down promiscuously to the festive board and celebrated the glories of the day with a still more glorious spread arthur and dig were in high feather they had i am sorry to say shunted their progenitors up to the doctors table and in the congenial society of some of their own lot were jammed in at one of the side tables with just elbowroom enough to do execution arthur was comfortably packed between sherriffs sister and maples second cousin and cheered by game pie and mellowed by ginger ale made himself vastly agreeable see that chap with the sandy wig said he to miss sherriff hes a baronetsir digby oakshott baronet ass pig and nobody knows what elsehes my chum arent you dig sherriffs sister you know make yourself civil cant you dig can make you laugh sometimes added he aside to his fair neighbour then his genial eye roamed up and down the room and lit up suddenly as he perceived with their backs to him railsford and daisy dining happily at the next table he gave a whistle to dig and pointed with his thumb over his shoulder dig who was in the middle of a pull at the ginger ale put down his tankard suddenly and crammed his handkerchief into his mouth such a game said arthur to maples second cousin on his right look round behind you do you see them see whom asked the young lady those two regular pair of spoons look at him helping her to raspberry pie oh my word who are they asked his neighbour laughing but arthur was at that moment busy attracting the attention of all his friends within call and indicating to them in pantomimic gesture what was going on oh said he hearing the question at last thats marky our house master you know and hes spoons on my sister daisyjust see how theyre going it do you want to be introduced to my sister i say ill oh no indeed not yet said the young lady in alarm presently please all right dig i say pass the word down to those fellows to fill up their mugs do you hear and fill up sherriffs sisters mug too and all those girls down there look out now and keep your eye on me whereupon he rose and made a little speech partially audible to those immediately round him but supremely inaudible to the two parties specially concerned behind were going to drink a toast said arthur i vote we drink the health of jolly old marky and my sister daisy there they are behind going the pace like a house on fire gentlemen and ladies i vote we drink their very good health and the sooner daisys the dame of railsfords the better larks for us the toast was honoured with much enthusiasm and there were loud cries for a speech in return but the master of the shell was making speeches of quite another kind and utterly unconscious of the flattering little demonstration which was taking place behind him he was telling daisy in whispers the story of the term and feeling himself rewarded for all he had gone through by her sympathetic smile the dinner ended at last and but one more ceremony remained this was the timehonoured cheering with which speechday at grandcourt always came to an end smedley and the prefects walked in procession to the head table and ranged themselves behind the head governors chair while everyone stood up three cheers for grandcourt called the captain and you may fancy the earthquake that ensued then in regular order followed three cheers for the doctor three cheers for miss violet three cheers for the governors then again in regular order the captain of each house stepped forward and called for three cheers for his own house all of which were vigorously giveneach house being on its mettle to drown all the others last in the list ainger stepped forward and called for three cheers for railsfords then arthur and dig and the rest of the house got upon their chairs and put their backs into the shout and everyone allowed that whatever else railsfords wasnt first in it could carry off the palm for noise at the end of the third cheer a voice called out one more for the cock house whereat arthur and dig and the rest of them got on their chairs again and yelled till the roof rang then amid a multitude of promiscuous cheers for the captain the prefects the cook jason the school cat thucydides and finally for dulce domum grandcourt broke up for the holidays let you and me friendly reader say goodbye here amid all the cheery bustle and excitement of the crowded quadrangle it is better to part so than to linger about talking morality till the great square is emptytill the last of the cabs has rumbled away out of hearingtill the echoes of our own voices come back and startle us from behind the chapel buttresses if we wait till then we part sadly and miss the promise of a meeting again but if we part now while arthur on the box of his cab with his people safely stowed inside is whooping his noisy farewells right and leftwhile smedley with his balliol scholarship in his pocket is leaving grandcourt for good and casting his last shy look up at the doctors windowwhile messrs roe grover and railsford are talking cheerfully of their highland trip in august while monsieur humming partant pour la syrie is hurrying away to his own dear france and his still dearer little girlswhile ainger and barnworth the old and the new captains of railsfords are grasping hands at the doorif we part now we part not as those who bid a long farewell but as those who think and talk of meeting again
