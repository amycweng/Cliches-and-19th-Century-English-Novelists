reginald cruden a tale of city life by talbot baines reed i suppose this book is not so much aimed at schoolboys as most of this authors books are as at the young adult starting out in life for the story here is one almost of warning about the mistakes a young man of good will might make in trying to find employment in a hard time the first job he takes is interesting because it is in a typesetting office which the author knew a great deal about having inherited a similar business from his father the second job is quite unknown to the young hero rather a shady one it is obvious to us the readers because we are allowed certain information that reginald could not have you would enjoy hearing it or reading it if you must nh reginald cruden a tale of city life by talbot baines reed chapter one an interrupted bathe it was a desperately hot day there had been no day like it all the summer indeed squires the head gardener at garden vale positively asserted that there had been none like it since he had been employed on the place which was fourteen years last march squires by the way never lost an opportunity of reminding himself and the world generally of the length of his services to the family at garden vale and on the strength of those fourteen years he gave himself airs as if the place belonged not to mr cruden at all but to himself he was the terror of his mistress who scarcely dared to peep into a greenhouse without his leave and although he could never exactly obtain from the two young gentlemen the respect to which he considered himself entitled he still flattered himself in secret they couldnt do exactly what they liked with his garden today however it was so hot that even squires after having expressed the opinion on the weather above mentioned withdrew himself into the coolest recess of his snug lodge and slept sweetly leaving the young gentlemen had they been so minded to take any liberty they liked with his garden the young gentlemen however were not so minded they had been doing their best to play lawn tennis in the blazing sun with two of their friends but it was too hot to run too hot to hit and far too hot to score so the attempt had died away and three of them now reclined on the sloping bank under the laurel hedge dividing their time between lazily gazing up at the darkblue sky and watching the proceedings of the fourth of their party who still remained in the courts this lastmentioned youth who to judge by his countenance was brother to one of those who lolled on the bank presented a curious contrast to the general languor of the afternoon deserted by his companions in the sport he was relieving himself of some of his superfluous energy by the novel diversion of playing tennis with himself this he accomplished by serving the ball high up in the air and then jumping the net so as to take it on the other side following up his return by another leap over the net and so on till either he or the ball came to grief on an ordinary day the exertion involved in this pastime would be quite enough for any ordinary individual but on a day like the present with the thermometer at ninety in the shade it was a trifle too much even to watch for goodness sake shut up horrors said the elder brother we might as well be playing ourselves as watch you at that sort of thing the young gentleman addressed as horrors was at that moment in the midst of one of his aerial flights and had neither leisure nor breath to answer do you hear repeated the other if you want to keep warm go indoors and put on a greatcoat but dont fag us to death with that foolery eight exclaimed the young athlete scoring the number of times the ball had crossed the net and starting for another jump shut up reg till ive done he soon was done even horace cruden could not keep it up for ever and at his tenth bound his foot caught in the net and he came all fours on to the court there now youre happy said his brother now you may as well come and sit here out of the cold horace picked himself up laughing all very well said he im certain i should have done it twelve times if you hadnt put me off my jump never mind ill do it yet oh horace interposed one of the others beseechingly if you love us lie down now im quite ill watching you i assure you well all vow we saw you do it twelve times well put it in the times if you like and say the net was five feet ten anything as long as you dont start at it again this appeal had the effect of reducing the volatile horace to a state of quiescence and inducing him to come and share the shade with his companions never saw such a lazy lot said he lying flat on his back and balancing his racquet on his finger you wont do anything yourselves and you wont let any one else do anything regular dogs in the manger my dear fellow said the fourth of the party in a half drawl weve been doing nothing but invite you in to the manger for the last hour and you wouldnt come cant you take a holiday while weve got one bad luck to it said reginald theres only a week more i dont see why you need growl old man said the visitor who had spoken first youll get into the sixth and have a study to yourself and no mathematics unless you like poor harker said horace hes always down on mathematics anyhow i shant be sorry to show up at wilderham again shall you bland depends on the set we get drawled bland whose full name was blandford i hear theres a crowd of new fellows coming and i hate new fellows a fellow must be new some time or other said horace harker and i were new boys once werent we harker harker who had shared the distinction of being tossed with horace in the same blanket every night for the first week of his sojourn at wilderham had not forgotten the fact and ejaculated rather the mischief is continued blandford they get such a shady lot of fellows there now the schools not half as respectable as it was there are far too many shopkeepers sons and that sort of sort of animal hed like to say laughed horace bland cant get over being beaten for the french prize by barber the tailors son blandford flushed up and was going to answer when reginald interposed well and suppose he cant its no wonder i dont see why those fellows shouldnt have a school for themselves its not pleasant to have the fellow who cuts your waistcoat crowing over you in class horace began to whistle as he generally did when the conversation took a turn that did not please him best way to remedy that said he presently is not to get beaten by your tailors son shut up horace said the elder brother whats the use of making yourself disagreeable blands quite right and you know you think so yourself oh all serene said horace cheerfully shouldnt have known i thought so unless you had told me what do you think harker well said harker laughing as i am disreputable enough to be the only son of a widow who has barely enough to live on and who depends on the charity of a cousin or some one of the sort for my education im afraid bland and i would have to go to different schools every one laughed at this confession and reginald said oh but youre different harkerbesides it isnt money makes the difference the thing is interposed horace was your father in the wholesale or retail tradethats the difference i wish youd shut up horace said reginald tartly you always spoil any argument with your foolery now thats hard lines said horace when i thought i was putting the case beautifully for you never mind what do you say to a bathe in the river you fellows too much fag to get towels said reginald but if you like to go for them and dont ask us to look at our watches and see in how many seconds you run up to the house and back well think about it thanks said horace and started up to the house whistling cheerily awfully hot that brother of yours make a fellow said blandford watching him disappear yes said reginald yawning he is rather flighty but hell turn out all right i hope turn out said harker why hes all right already from the crown of his head to the sole of his boot except said blandford for a slight crack in the crown of his head its just as well perhaps hes not the eldest son reg well said reginald laughing i can hardly fancy horace the head of the family must be a rum sensation said harker to be an heir and not have to bother your head about how youll get your bread and butter some day how many hundred millions of pounds is it youll come in for reg i forget what a humbug you are said reginald my fathers no better off than a lot of other people thats a mild way of putting it anyhow said blandford and here the conversation ended the boys lay basking in the sun waiting for horaces return he was unusually long in coming seems to me said blandford hes trying how long he can be instead of how quickfor a variety just like him said reginald five minutes passed away and ten and fifteen and then just as the boys were thinking of stirring themselves to inquire what had become of him they heard his steps returning rapidly down the gravel walk well cried reginald without sitting up have you got them at last horaces voice startled them all as he cried reg reg come quick quick there was no mistaking either the tones or the white face of the boy who uttered them reginald was on his feet in an instant rushing in the direction of the house towards which his brother had already started what is it horace he said as he overtook him something about fathera telegram gasped the other not another word was spoken as they ran on and reached the hall door the hall door stood open just outside on the hot stone steps lay the towels where horace had dropped them five minutes ago carlo the dog lay across the mat and lazily lifted his head as his master approached within stood mrs cruden pale and trembling with a telegram in her hand and in the background hovered three or four servants with mingled curiosity and anxiety on their faces despite the heat reginald shivered as he stood a moment at the door and then sprang towards the telegram which his mother gave into his hand it was from mr crudens coachman dated from saint nathaniels hospital master was took ill driving from citybrought here where he is very bad indeed doctor says no hope one needs to have received such a message oneself to understand the emotions with which the two brothers read and reread the pitiless words nothing but their own hard breathing broke the stillness of those few minutes and who knows in that brief space what a lifetime seemed crowded horace was the first to recover his selfpossession mother said he and his voice sounded strange and startling in the silence theres a train to the city in five minutes ill go by that and he was off it was threequarters of a mile to the station and there was no time to parley even on an errand like this many would have abandoned the endeavour as an impossibility especially in such a heat but horace was a good runner and the feat was nothing uncommon for him as he flung himself into the train he gave one quick glance round to see if reginald had possibly followed him but no he was alone and as the whistle shrieked and the train steamed out of the station horace for the first time had a moment to reflect not half an hour ago he had been lying with his brother and companions on the tennis lawn utterly unconscious of any impending calamity what ages ago that seemed for a few minutes all appeared so confused and unreal that his mind was a blank and he seemed even to forget on what errand he was bound but horace was a practical youth and before that halfhours journey to the city was accomplished he was at least collected in mind and prepared to face the trial that awaited him there was something about the telegram that convinced him it meant more than it said still a boys hopefulness will grasp at a straw and he battled with his despair his father was not deadhe would recoverat the hospital he would have the best medical assistance possible the coachman who sent the telegram would be sure to make things out at the worst yes when he got to saint nathaniels he would find it was a false alarm that there was nothing much the matter at all and when his mother and reginald arrived by the next train he would be able to meet them with reassuring news it was not more than a tenminutes cab drive from the terminusthe train was just in now in twelve minutes this awful suspense would be at an end such was the hurried rush of thoughts through the poor boys brain during that dismal journey he had sprung from the carriage to a hansom cab almost before the train had pulled up and in another moment was clattering over the stones towards the hospital the hopes of a few minutes before oozed away as every street corner brought him nearer his destination and when at last the stately front of saint nathaniels loomed before him he wished his journey could never end he gazed with faltering heart up at the ward windows as if he could read his fate there the place seemed deserted a few street boys were playing on the pavement and at the door of the inpatients ward a little cluster of visitors were collected round a flower stall buying sweet mementoes of the country to brighten the bedsides of their friends within no one heeded the pale scared boy as he alighted and went up the steps a porter opened the door my father mr cruden is here how is he is it the gentleman that was brought in in a fit yes in his carriageis he better will you step in and see the doctor the doctor was not in his room when the boy was ushered in and it seemed an age before he entered you are mr crudens son said he gravely yesis he better he was brought here about halfpast three insensible with apoplexy is he better now asked horace again knowing perfectly well what the dreaded answer would be he is not my boy said the doctor gravely we telegraphed to your mother at once as you knowbut before that telegram could have reached her your poor father it was enough poor horace closed his ears convulsively against the fatal word and dropped back on his chair with a gasp the doctor put his hand kindly on the boys shoulder are you here alone said he presently my mother and brother will be here directly your father lies in a private ward will you wait till they come or will you go up now a struggle passed through the boys mind an instinctive horror of a sight hitherto unknown struggled hard with the impulse to rush at once to his fathers bedside at length he said falteringly i will go now please when mrs cruden and reginald arrived half an hour later they found horace where the doctor had left him on his knees at his fathers bedside chapter two a comedown in the world mr cruden had the reputation of being one of the most respectable as well as one of the richest men in his part of the county and it is fair to say he took far more pride in the former quality than the latter indeed he made no secret of the fact that he had not always been the rich man he was when our story opens but he was touchy on the subject of his good family and his title to the name of gentleman which he had taught his sons to value far more than the wealth which accompanied it and which they might some day expect to inherit his choice of a school for them was quite consistent with his views on this point wilderham was not exactly an aristocratic school but it was a school where money was thought less of than good style as the boys called it and where poverty was far less of a disgrace than even a remote connection with a shop the crudens had always been great heroes in the eyes of their schoolfellows for their family was unimpeachable and even with others who had greater claims to be considered as aristocratic their ample pocketmoney commended them as most desirable companions mr cruden however with all his virtues and respectability was not a good man of business people said he let himself be imposed upon by others who knew the value of money far better than he did his own beautiful estate at garden vale rumour said was managed at double the expense it should be and of his money transactions and speculations in the citywell he had need to be the wealthy man he was said his friends to be able to stand all the fleecing he came in for there nevertheless no one ever questioned the wealth of the crudens least of all did the crudens themselves who took it as much for granted as the atmosphere they breathed in on the day on which our story opens mr cruden had driven down into the city on business no one knew exactly what the business was for he kept such matters to himself it was an ordinary expedition which consisted usually of half a dozen calls on half a dozen stockbrokers or secretaries of companies with perhaps an occasional visit to the family lawyer or the family bank today however it had consisted of but one visit and that was to the bank and it was whilst returning thence that mr cruden was suddenly seized with the stroke which ended in his death had immediate assistance been at hand the calamity might have been averted but neither the coachman nor footman was aware of what had happened till the carriage was some distance on its homeward journey and a passerby caught sight of the senseless figure within they promptly drove him to the nearest hospital and telegraphed the news to garden vale but mr cruden never recovered consciousness and as the doctor told horace before even the message could have reached its destination he was dead we may draw a veil over the sad scenes of the few days which followed of the meeting of the widow and her sons at the bedside of the dead of the removal of the loved remains home of the dismal preparations for the funeral and all the dreary details which occupy mourners in the house of death for some time mrs cruden prostrated by the shock of her bereavement was unable to leave her room and the burden of the care fell on the two inexperienced boys who had to face it almost singlehanded for the crudens had no near relatives in england and those of their friends who might have been of service at such a time feared to intrude and so stayed away blandford and harker the boys two friends who had been visiting at garden vale at the time of mr crudens death had left as quietly and considerately as possible and so great was the distraction of those few sad days that no one even noticed their absence till letters of condolence arrived from each it was a dreary week and reginald on whom as the elder son and the heir to the property the chief responsibility rested was of the two least equal to the emergency i dont know what i should have done without you old man said he to horace on the evening before the funeral when all the preparations being ended the two boys strolled dismally down towards the river you ought to have been the eldest son i should never have thought of half the things there were to be done if you hadnt been here of course mother would have known what was to be done said horace if she hadnt been laid up shes to get up this evening well i shall be glad when tomorrows over said reginald its awful to have it all hanging over one like this i cant believe father was alive a week ago you know no more can i said the other and im certain we shall not realise how we miss him for long enough yet they walked on for some distance in silence each full of his own reflections then horace said mother is sure to want to stay on here shes so fond of the place yes its a comfort she wont have to move by the way i wonder if she will want us to leave wilderham and stay at home now i fancy not father wanted you to go to oxford in a couple of years and she is sure not to change his plan well i must say said reginald if i am to settle down as a country gentleman some day i shall be glad to have gone through college and all that sort of thing before if i go up in two years i shall have finished before im twentythree hullo heres mother the boys ran forward to greet mrs cruden who pale but smiling came quietly down the garden towards them and after a fond embrace laid her hands on the arm of each and walked slowly on between them you two brave boys said she and there was a cheery ring in her voice that sent comfort into the hearts of both her sons how sorry i am to think of all you have had to go through while i like a silly weak woman have been lying in bed oh mother said horace with a face that reflected already the sunshine of hers how absurd to talk like that i dont believe you ought to be out here now oh yes i ought ive done with that and i am strong enough now to stand beside the boys who have stood so bravely by their mother wed be a nice pair of boys if we didnt eh reg said horace reginalds reply was a pressure of his mothers hand and with a rainbow of smiles over their sorrowful hearts the three walked on lovingly together the mother with many a brave cheery word striving to lift her sons above their trouble not only to hope of earthly comfort but to trust in that great father of the fatherless beside whom all the love of this world is poor and fleeting at length they turned to go in and mrs cruden said there is a letter from mr richmond the lawyer saying he will call this evening to talk over some business matters i suppose he will be here by now couldnt he have waited till after tomorrow said horace he particularly asked to come tonight said the mother at any rate i would like you both to be with me while he is here we must not have any secrets from one another now i suppose its about the will or the estate said reginald i suppose so i dont know said mrs cruden mr richmond always managed your fathers business affairs you know so he will be able to tell us how matters stand they reached the house and found mr richmond had already arrived and was awaiting them in the library mr richmond was a solemn grave personage whose profession was written on his countenance his lips were so closely set that it seemed as if speaking must be a positive pain to him his eyes had the knack of looking past you as though he was addressing not you but your shadow on the wall and he ended every sentence no matter what its import with a mechanical smile as though he were at that instant having his photograph taken why mr cruden should have selected mr richmond as his man of business was a matter only known to mr cruden himself for those who knew the lawyer best did not care for him and without being able to deny that he was an honest man and a wellmeaning man were at least glad that their affairs were in the hands of some one else he rose and solemnly greeted the widow and her two sons as they entered i am sorry to intrude at such a time said he but as your late husbands adviser i considered it right to call and make you acquainted with his affairs here mr richmond smiled greatly to reginalds indignation thank you said mrs cruden sit down please mr richmond mr richmond obeyed dubiously eyeing the two boys as he did so these are your sons i presume said he to mrs cruden they are said she mr richmond rose and solemnly shook hands with each of the lads informing each with a smile as he did so that he was pleased to make his acquaintance you wish the young gentlemen to remain perhaps he inquired as he resumed his seat to be sure said mrs cruden somewhat nettled at the question go on please mr richmond certainly madam said the lawyer may i ask if you are acquainted with the late mr crudens state of affairs i wish to hear that from you said the widow and with as little delay as possible mr richmond certainly madam mr cruden honoured me with his confidence on these matters and i believe next to himself i knew more about them than any one else here mr richmond paused and smiled in fact continued he i may almost say i knew more about them than he did himself for your excellent husband mrs cruden was not a good man of business reginald could not stand the smile which accompanied this observation and said somewhat hotly look here mr richmond if you will say what youve got to say without laughing and speaking disrespectfully of my father we shall be glad certainly master cruden said the lawyer a trifle disconcerted by this unexpected interruption then turning to the widow he continued the fact is madam the late mr cruden was i fear under the impression that he was considerably better off than he was mr richmond paused as if for a reply but as no one spoke he continued i am sorry to say this appears to have been the case to a much larger extent than even i imagined your late husband mrs cruden i believe spent largely on his estate here and unfortunately kept no accounts i have frequently entreated him to reckon over his expenditure but he always replied that it was considerably under his income and that there was no need as long as that was the case to trouble himself about it a nervous movement among his listeners was the only reply the lawyer received to this last announcement or to the smile which accompanied it mr cruden may have been correct in his conjecture madam although i fear the contrary if my father said a thing blurted out reginald at this point i see no reason for doubting his word none in the least my dear master cruden but unfortunately your father did not know either what his income was or what his expenditure was do you know what they were said reginald not heeding the deprecating touch of his mothers hand on his as far as i understand the state of your fathers affairs said mr richmond undisturbed by the rude tone of his inquisitor his income was entirely derived from interest in the stock of two american railways in which he placed implicit confidence and in one or the other of which he insisted on investing all capital which came to his hand the total income from these two sources would in my opinion just about cover mr crudens various expenses of all kinds there was something like a sigh of relief from the listeners as mr richmond reached this point but it died away as he proceeded in his choice of an investment for his capital mr cruden consulted no one i believe beyond himself for some time it seemed a fortunate investment and the shares rose in value but latterly they took a turn for the worse and early this year i am sorry to say one of the railways suspended payment altogether and mr cruden lost a considerable portion of his fortune thereby i heard my husband say some months ago that he had made some slight loss in the city said mrs cruden but i imagined from the light manner in which he treated it that it was quite trifling and would be quickly repaired he did hope that would be the case although all his friends urged him to sell out at once he insisted on holding on in the hope of the railway recovering itself and has it recovered asked mrs cruden with a tremble in her voice i regret to say it has not mrs cruden on the contrary it was declared bankrupt a few days ago and what is still more deplorable it has involved in its own ruin the other railway in which the remainder of your husbands property was invested so that all the shares which stand in his name in both concerns are now worth no more than the paper they are printed on mr richmond came to the point at last with startling abruptness so much so that for a moment or two his listeners sat almost petrified by the bad news and unable to say a word the lawyer finished what he had to say without waiting your husband heard this lamentable news mrs cruden on the occasion of his last visit to the city the only call he made that day was at his bankers where he was told all and there is no reason to doubt that the shock produced the stroke from which he died mr richmond said mrs cruden after a while like one in a dream can this be true what does it all mean alas madam said the lawyer it would be no kindness on my part to deny the truth of what i have told you it means that unless you or your late husband are possessed of some means of income of which i know nothing your circumstances are reduced to a very low point but there must be some mistake said horace both railways cant have gone wrong we shall surely save something i wish i could hold out any hope i have all the documents at my office and shall be only too glad mrs cruden to accompany you to the bank for your own satisfaction mrs cruden shuddered and struggled bravely to keep down the rising tears a long pause ensued every moment of which made the terrible truth clearer to all three of the hearers and closed every loophole of hope what can be done said horace at last happily there is garden vale said reginald and there was a choking in the throat of the heir as he spoke we shall have to sell it the contents of it you will master cruden said the lawyer the estate itself is held on lease well the contents of it said reginald bitterly you are not going to make out they dont belong to us certainly not said mr richmond on whom the taunt was quite lost unless as i trust is not the case your father died in debt do you mean to say said horace slowly like one waking from a dream do you mean to say we are ruined mr richmond i fear it is so said the lawyer unless mr cruden was possessed of some means of income with which i was not acquainted i regret very much mrs cruden having to be the bearer of such bad news and i can only say the respect i had for your late husband will make any assistance i can offer you by way of advice or otherwise a pleasure and mr richmond bowed himself out of the room with a smile it was a relief to be left alone and mrs cruden despite her weakness and misery struggled hard for the sake of her boys to put a brave face on their trouble reg dear said she to her eldest son who had fairly broken down and with his head on his hand was giving vent to his misery try to bear it after all we are left to one another and the poor mother could not finish her sentence but bent down and kissed the wet cheek of the boy of course it means said horace after a pause we shall have to give up garden vale and leave wilderham too and reg was sure of a scholarship next term i say mother what are we to do we are all strong enough to do something dear boy said mrs cruden ill take care you dont have to do anything mother said reginald looking up ill work my fingers to the bones before you have to come down to that he spoke with clenched teeth half savagely even if we can sell all the furniture continued horace taking a practical view of the situation it wouldnt give us much to live on shut up horace said reginald whats the use of making the worst of everything hasnt mother had quite enough to bear already horace subsided and the three sat there in silence until the daylight faded and the footman brought in the lights and announced that coffee was ready in the drawingroom there was something like a shock about this interruption what had they to do with menservants and coffee in the drawingroom they who an hour or two ago had supposed themselves wealthy but now knew that they were little better than beggars we shall not want coffee said mrs cruden answering for all three then when the footman had withdrawn she said boys i must go to bed god bless you and give us all brave hearts for we shall need them the funeral took place next day happily it was of a simple character and only a few friends were invited so that it was not thought necessary to alter the arrangements in consequence of mr richmonds announcement of the evening before but even the slight expense involved in this melancholy ceremony grated painfully on the minds of the boys who forgot even their dead father in the sense that they were riding in carriages for which they could not pay and offering their guests refreshments which were not theirs to give the little cemetery was crowded with friends and acquaintances of the deadcountry gentry most of them who sought to show their respect for their late neighbour by falling into the long funeral procession and joining the throng at the graveside it was a severe ordeal for the two boys to find themselves the centres of observation and to feel that more than half the interest exhibited in them was on account of their supposed inheritance one bluff squire came up after the funeral and patted reginald on the back never mind my boy said he i was left without a father at your age youll soon get over it and your mother will have plenty of friends glad to see you up at the hall any day and your brother too you must join our hunt next winter and keep up the family name god bless you reginald shrank from this greeting like a guilty being and the two desolate boys were glad to escape further encounters by retreating to their carriage and ordering the coachman to drive home at once a few days disclosed all that was wanting to make their position quite clear mr crudens will confirmed mr richmonds statement as to the source of his income all his money was invested in shares of the two ruined railways and all he had to leave besides these was the furniture and contents of garden vale even this when realised would do little more than cover the debts which the next week or two brought to light it was pitiful the way in which that unrelenting tide of bills flowed in swamping gradually the last hope of a competency or even means of bare existence for the survivors neither mrs cruden nor her sons had been able to endure a days delay at garden vale after the funeral but had hurried for shelter to quiet lodgings at the seaside kept by an old servant where in an agony of suspense they awaited the final result of mr richmonds investigations it came at last and bad as it was it was a comfort to know the worst the furniture carriages and other contents of garden vale had sufficed to pay all debts of every description with a balance of about l remaining over and above to represent the entire worldly possessions of the cruden family which only a month ago had ranked with the wealthiest in the county so said mrs cruden with a shadow of her old smile as she folded up the lawyers letter and put it back in her pocket we know the worst at last boys which is said reginald bitterly we are worth among us the magnificent sum of sixteen pounds per annum quite princely reg dear said his mother let us be thankful that we have anything and still more that we may start life owing nothing to any one start life exclaimed reginald i wish we could end it with oh hush hush my precious boy exclaimed the widow you will break my heart if you talk like that think how many there are to whom this little sum would seem a fortune why it may keep a roof over our heads at any rate or help you into situations or bury us groaned reginald the mother looked at her eldest son half in pity half in reproach and then burst into tears reginald sprang to her side in an instant what a beast i am he exclaimed oh mother do forgive me i really didnt think what i was saying no dear reggie i know you didnt said mrs cruden recovering herself with a desperate effort you mustnt mind me ii scarcely knowi it was no use trying the poor mother broke down completely and on that evening it was impossible to talk more about the future next morning however all three were in a calmer mood and horace said at breakfast we cant do any good here mother hadnt we better go to london i think so and parker here knows of a small furnished lodging in dull street which she says is cheap we might try there to begin with eh reg reginald winced and then replied oh certainly the sooner we get down to our right level the better that evening the three crudens arrived in london chapter three number six dull street probably no london street ever rejoiced in a more expressive name than dull street it was not a specially dirty street or a specially disreputable street or a specially dark street the neighbourhood might a hundred years ago have been considered genteel and the houses even fashionable and some audacious antiquarians went so far as to assert that the street took its name not from its general appearance at all but from a worthy london alderman who in the reign of george the first had owned most of the neighbouring property be that as it may dull street wasand for all i know may still beone of the dullest streets in london a universal seediness pervaded its houses from roof to cellar nothing was as it should be anywhere the window sashes had to be made airtight by wedges of wood or paper stuck into the frames a bell in dull street rarely sounded after less than six pulls there was scarcely a sittingroom but had a crack in its grimy ceiling or a handle off its illhung door or a strip of wall paper peeling off its walls there were more chairs in the furnished apartments of dull street with three legs than there were with four and there was scarcely horsehair enough in the twentyfour sofas of its twentyfour parlours to suffice for an equal quantity of bolsters in short dull street was the shabbiest genteel street in the metropolis and nothing could make it otherwise a wellbuilt tastefullyfurnished house in the middle of it would have been as incongruous as a new patch in an old garment and no one dreamt of disturbing the traditional aspect of the place by any attempt to repair or beautify it indeed the people who lived in dull street were as much a part of its dulness as the houses they inhabited they were for the most part retired tradesmen or decayed milliners or brokendown government clerks most of whom tried to eke out their little pensions by letting part of their lodgings to others as decayed and brokendown as themselves these interesting colonists whose one bond of sympathy was a mutual seediness amused themselves for the most part by doing nothing all day long except perhaps staring out of the window in the remote hope of catching sight of a distant cab passing the street corner or watching to see how much milk their opposite neighbour took in or reading the news of the week before last in a borrowed newspaper or talking scandal of one neighbour to another jemima my dear said a middleaged lady who with her son and daughter was the proud occupant of number dull streetjemima my dear i see today the bill is hout of the winder of number six never replied jemima a sharplooking young woman of twenty who had once in her life spent a month at a ladies boardingschool and was therefore decidedly genteel i wonder whos coming a party of three so i hear from miss mouldens maid which is niece to mrs grimley a widowhere the speaker snuffled

jemima no one supposes you meant to tell fibs you couldnt help it amid consolations such as these the poor flurried lady subsided and regained her former tranquillity of spirit the shucklefordssuch was the name of this amiable familywere comparatively recent sojourners in dull street they had come there six years previously on the death of mr shuckleford a respectable wharfinger who had saved up money enough to leave his wife a small annuity shortly before his death he had been promoted to the command of one of the thames steamboats plying between chelsea and london bridge in virtue of which office he had taken to himselfor rather his wife had claimed for himthe title of captain and with this patent of gentility had held up her head ever since her children following her good example were not slow to hold up their heads too and were fully convinced of their own gentility samuel shuckleford had as his mother termed it been entered for the law shortly after his fathers death and miss jemima shuckleford after the months sojourn at a ladies boardingschool already referred to had settled down to assist her mother in the housework and maintain the dignity of the family by living on her income such were the new nextdoor neighbours of the crudens when at last they arrived sadly and with the new world before them at number dull street mr richmond who with all his unfortunate manner had acted a friends part all along had undertaken the task of clearing up affairs at garden vale superintending the payment of mr crudens debts the sale of his furniture and the removal to dull street of what little remained to the family to remind them of their former comforts it might have been better if in this last respect the boys and their mother had acted for themselves for mr richmond appeared to have hazy notions as to what the family would most value the first sight which met the boys eyes as they arrived was their tennisracquets in a corner of the room a very small case of trinkets was on mrs crudens dressingtable and not one of the twenty or thirty books arranged on the top of the sideboard was one which any member of the small household cared anything about but mr richmond had done his best and being left entirely to his own devices was not to be blamed for the few mistakes he had made he was there to receive mrs cruden when she arrived and after conducting the little party hurriedly through the three rooms destined for their accommodation considerately retired until the moment when they were left to themselves in the shabby little dull street parlour not one of the crudens had understood the change which had come over their lot all had been so sudden so exciting so unlookedfor during the last few weeks that all three of them had seemed to go through it as through a dream but the awakening came now and a rude and cruel one it was the little room dignified by the name of a parlour was a dingy stuffy apartment of the true dull street type the paper was faded and torn the ceiling was discoloured the furniture was decrepit the carpet was threadbare and the cheap engraving on the wall with its title as happy as a king seemed to brood over the scene like some mocking spirit they passed into mrs crudens bedroom and the thought of the delightful snug little boudoir at garden vale sent a shiver through them as they glanced at the bare walls the dilapidated halftester the chipped and oddly assorted crockery the boys room was equally cheerless one narrow bed a chair and a small washstand was all the furniture it boasted of and a few old cuttings of an antiquated illustrated paper pinned on to the wall afforded its sole decoration a low dreary whistle escaped from horaces lips as he surveyed his new quarters followed almost immediately by an equally dreary laugh why gasped he theres no lookingglass however is reg to shave it was an heroic effort and it succeeded mrs crudens face lit up at the sound of her sons voice with its old sunshine and even reginald smiled grimly i must let my beard grow said he but mother i say and his voice quavered as he spoke what a miserable room yours is i cant bear to think of your being cooped up there oh its not so bad said mrs cruden cheerily the pink in the chintz doesnt go well with the scarlet in the wallpaper certainly but i dare say i shall sleep soundly in the bed all the same but such a wretched lookout from the window mother and such a vile jug and basin mrs cruden laughed never mind about the jug and basin said she as long as they hold water and as for the lookoutwell as long as i can see my two boys faces happy thats the best view i covet you never think about yourself said reginald sadly i say mother said horace suppose we call up the spirits from the vasty deep and ask them to get tea ready this practical suggestion met with general approbation and the little party returned more cheerily to the parlour where horace performed marvellous exploits with the bellhandle and succeeded in the incredible time of seven minutes in bringing up a small slipshod girl who after a good deal of staring about her and a critical survey of the pattern of mrs crudens dress contrived to gather a general idea of what was required of her it was a queer meal half ludicrous half despairing that first little teaparty in dull street they tried to be gay reginald declared that the tea his mother poured out was far better than any the footman at garden vale used to dispense horace tried to make fun of the heterogeneous cups and saucers mrs cruden tried hard to appear as though she was taking a hearty meal while she tasted nothing but it was a relief when the girl reappeared and cleared the table then they unpacked their few belongings and tried to enliven their dreary lodgings with a few precious mementoes of happier days finally worn out in mind and body they took shelter in bed and for a blessed season forgot all their misery and forebodings in sleep there is no magic equal to that which a nights sleep will sometimes work the little party assembled cheerfully at the breakfasttable next morning prepared to face the day bravely a large letter in mr richmonds handwriting lay on mrs crudens plate it contained three lettersone from the lawyer himself and one for each of the boys from wilderham mr richmonds letter was brief and businesslike dear madamenclosed please find two letters which i found lying at garden vale yesterday with regard to balance of your late husbands assets in your favour i have an opportunity of investing same at an unusually good rate of interest in sound security shall be pleased to wait on you with particulars am also in a position to introduce the young gentlemen to a business opening which if not at first important may seem to you a favourable opportunity on these points i shall have the honour of waiting on you during tomorrow afternoon and meanwhile beg to remain your obedient servant r richmond we ought to make sure what the investment is said reginald after hearing the letter read before we hand over all our money to him to be sure dear said mrs cruden who hated the sound of the word investment i wonder what he proposes for us said horace some clerkship i suppose perhaps in his own office said reginald what an opening that would be never you mind the laws very respectable but i know id be no good for that i might manage to serve tea and raisins behind a grocers counter or run errands or or black boots suggested reginald black boots i bet you neither you nor i could black a pair of boots properly to save our lives it seems to me we shall have to try it this very morning said reginald for no one has touched mine since last night but who are your letters from said mrs cruden are they very private not mine said horace its from old harker you may read it if you like mother mrs cruden took the letter and read aloud dear horrors thats what he calls me you know explained horace in a parenthesis i am so awfully sorry to hear of your new trouble about money matters and that you will have to leave garden vale i wish i could come over to see you and help you all the fellows here are awfully cut up about it and lots of them want me to send you messages i dont know what i shall do without you this term old man you were always a brick to me be sure and write to me and tell me everything as soon as i can get away for a day ill come and see you and ill write as often as i can your affectionate t harker pswilkins i expect will be the new monitor in our house he is sure now to get the scholarship reg was certain of i wish to goodness you were both back here he might just as well have left out that about the scholarship said reginald its not very cheering news to hear of another fellow stepping into your place like that i suppose he thought wed be curious to know said horace precious curious growled reginald but whos your letter from reg asked mrs cruden oh just a line from bland replied he hastily putting it into his pocket he gives no news if truth must be told blandfords letter was not a very nice one and reginald felt it he did not care to hear it read aloud in contrast with harkers warmhearted letter blandford had written dear crudeni hope its not true about your fathers money going all wrong it is a great sell and fellows here i know will be very sorry never mind i suppose theres enough left to make a decent show and between you and me it would go down awfully well with the fellows here if you could send your usual subscription to the football club harker says youll have to leave garden vale im awfully sorry as i always enjoyed my visits there so much what are you going to do why dont you try for the army the exams are not very hard my brother told me and of course its awfully respectable if one must work for ones living i must stop now or i shall miss tennis excuse more yours truly g blandford reginald knew the letter was a cold and selfish one but it left two things sticking in his mind which rankled there for a long time one was that come what would he would send a guinea to the school football club the other waswas it quite out of the question that he should go into the army awfully rough on reg said horace being so near that scholarship itll be no use to wilkins not a bit and fifty pounds a year would be something to horace was going to say us but he pulled up in time and said reg well said reg as things have turned out it might have come in useful i wonder if it wouldnt have been wiser mother for me to have stayed up this term and made sure of it i wish you could reg but we have no right to think of it besides you could only have held it if you had gone to college oh of course said reg but then it would have paid a good bit of my expenses there and i might have gone on from there to the army you know and got my commission mrs cruden sighed what an awakening the boy had still to pass through we must think of something less grand than that my poor reg said she and something we can share all together i hope mr richmond will be able to hear of some business opening for me as well as you for we shall need to put our resources together to get on mother exclaimed reginald overwhelmed with sudden contrition what a selfish brute you must think me you dont think id let you work while i had a nerve left ill do anythingso will horace but you shall not mother you shall not mrs cruden did not argue the point just then and in due time mr richmond arrived to give a new direction to their thoughts the investment he proposed seemed a good one but in fact the little family knew so little about business generally and money matters in particular that had it been the worst security possible they would have hardly been the wiser this point settled mr richmond turned to his proposals for the boys as i said in my letter mrs cruden said he the opening is only a modest one a company has lately been formed to print and publish an evening paper in the city and as solicitor to the company i had an opportunity of mentioning your sons to the manager he is willing to take them provided they are willing to work the pay will begin at eighteen shillings a week but i hope they will soon make their value felt and command a better position they are young yet what shall we have to do asked horace that i cannot exactly say said the lawyer but i believe the manager would expect you to learn the printers business from the beginning what would the hours be asked mrs cruden well as it is an evening paper there will fortunately be no late night work i believe seven in the morning to eight at night were the hours the manager mentioned andand faltered the poor mother who was beginning to realise the boys lot better than they did themselvesand what sort of companions are they likely to have mr richmond i believe the manager is succeeding in getting respectable men as workmen i hope so workmen exclaimed reginald suddenly do you mean we are to be workmen mr richmond just like any fellows in the street couldnt you find anything better than that for us my dear master cruden i am very sorry for you and would gladly see you in a better position but it is not a case where we can choose this opening has offered itself of course you are not bound to accept it but my advice is take what you can get in these hard times oh of course were paupers iforgot said reg bitterly and beggars maynt be choosers anything you like mother added he meeting mrs crudens sorrowful look with forced gaiety ill sweep a crossing if you like mr richmond or black your officeboys boots anything to get a living poor boy he broke down before he could finish the sentence and his flourish ended in something very like a sob horace was hardly less miserable but he said less evidently as reg himself had said beggars could not be choosers and when presently mr richmond left and the little family talked the matter over late into the afternoon it was finally decided that the offer of the manager of the rocket newspaper company limited should be accepted and that the boys should make their new start in life on the monday morning following chapter four the rocket newspaper company limited the reader may imagine that the walk our two heroes took citywards that monday morning was not a very cheerful one it seemed like walking out of one life into another behind like a dream were the joyous merry days spent at garden vale and wilderham with no care for the future and no want for the present before them still more like a dream lay the prospect of their new work with all its anxiety and drudgery and weariness and the miserable eighteen shillings a week it promised them and equally wretched at the present moment there was the vision of their desolate mother alone in the dull street lodgings where they had just left her unable at the last to hide the misery with which she saw her two boys start out into the pitiless world the boys walked for some time in silence then horace said old man i hope whatever they do theyll let us be together at this place we neednt expect any such luck said reginald it wouldnt be half so bad if they would you know said horace i cant help hoping theyll take us as clerks at least they must know were educated and more fit for that sort of work than than doing common labourers work said reg rather if theyd put us to some of the literary work you know horaceediting or correcting or reporting or that sort of thing i could stand that there are plenty of swells who began like that im pretty well up in classics you know andwell they might be rather glad to have some one who was horace sighed richmond spoke as if we were to be taken on as ordinary workmen oh richmonds an ass said reg full of his new idea he knows nothing about it i tell you horace they wouldnt be such idiots as to waste our education when they could make use of it richmond only knows the manager but the editor is the chief man after all by this time they had reached fleet street and their attention was absorbed in finding the bystreet in which was situated the scene of their coming labours they found it at last and with beating hearts saw before them a building surmounted by a board bearing in characters of gold the legend rocket newspaper company limited the boys stood a moment outside and the courage which had been slowly rising during the walk evaporated in an instant ugly and grimy as the building was it seemed to them like some fairy castle before which they shrank into insignificance a board inscribed workpeoples entrance with a hand on it pointing to a narrow side court confronted them and mechanically they turned that way reginald did for a moment hesitate as he passed the editors door but it was no use the two boys turned slowly into the court where amid the din of machinery and a stifling smell of ink and rollers they found the narrow passage which conducted them to their destination a man at a desk half way down the passage intercepted their progress now then young fellows what is it we want to see the manager please said horace no use today my lad no boys wanted were full up we want to see the manager said reginald offended at the mans tone and not disposed to humour it tell you we want no boys cant you see the notice up outside look here said reginald firing up and heedless of his brothers deprecating look we dont want any of your cheek tell the manager were here will you and look sharp the timekeeper stared at the boy in amazement for a moment and then broke out with take your hook do you hear youor ill warm you its a mistake put in horace hurriedly mr richmond said we were to come here to see the manager at nine oclock and couldnt you have said so at first growled the man with his hand still on his ruler and glaring at reginald without giving yourselves airs as if you were gentry go on in and dont stand gaping there for goodness sake reg whispered horace as they knocked at the managers door dont flare up like that youll spoil all our chance reg said nothing but he breathed hard and his face was angry still come in cried a sharp voice in answer to their knock they obeyed and found a man standing with a pen in his mouth at a desk searching through a file of papers he went on with his work till he found what he wanted apparently quite unconscious of the boys presence then he rang a bell for an overseer whistled down a tube for a clerk and shouted out of the door for a messenger and gave orders to each then he sent for some one else and gave him a scolding that made the unlucky recipients hair stand on end then he received a visit from a friend with whom he chatted and joked for a pleasant quarter of an hour then he took up the morning paper and skimmed through it whistling to himself as he did so then he rang another bell and told the errandboy who answered it to bring him in at one oclock sharp a large boiled beef underdone with carrots and turnips and a pint of s and b whatever that might mean then he suddenly became aware of the fact that he had visitors and turned inquiringly to the two boys mr richmond began horace in answer to his look but the manager cut him short oh ah yes he said nuisance go to the composingroom and ask for mr durfy saying which he sat down again at his desk and became absorbed in his papers it was hardly a flattering reception and gave our heroes very little chance of showing off their classical proficiency they had at least expected as mr richmonds nominees rather more than a half glance from the manager and to be thus summarily turned over to a mr durfy before they had as much as opened their mouths was decidedly unpromising reginald did make one feeble effort to prolong the interview and to impress the manager at the same time excuse me said he in his politest tones would you mind directing us to the composingroom my brother and i dont know the geography of the place yet eh composingroom get a boy to show you plenty outside it was no go evidently and they turned dismally from the room the errandboy was coming up the passage as they emergedthe same errandboy they had seen half an hour ago in the managers room but as their classical friends would say quantum mutatus ab illo hectore his two arms were strung with the handles of frothing tin cans from the elbow to the wrist he carried two tin cans in his mouth his apron was loaded to bursting with bread fish cheese potatoes and other edibles the necks of bottles protruded from all his pocketsfrom the bosom of his jacket and from the fob of his breechesand round his neck hung a ponderous chain of onions in short the errandboy was busy and our heroes even with their short experience of business life saw that there was little hope of extracting information from him under present circumstances so they let him pass and waited for another they had not to wait long for the passage appeared to be a regular highway for the junior members of the staff of the rocket newspaper company limited but though several boys came it was some time before one appeared whose convenience it suited to conduct our heroes to the presence of mr durfy just however as their patience was getting exhausted and reginald was making up his mind to shake the dust of the place from his feet a boy appeared and offered to escort them to the composingroom they followed him up several flights of a rickety staircase and down some labyrinthine passages to a large room where some forty or fifty men were busy setting up type at the far end of this room at a small table crowded with proofs sat a redfaced individual whom the boy pointed out as duffy well now what do you want asked he as the brothers approached the manager said we were to ask for mr durfy said reginald i wish to goodness hed keep you down there he knows im crowded out with boys he always serves me that way and ill tell him so one of these days this last speech though apparently addressed to the boys was really a soliloquy on mr durfys part but for all that it failed to enchant his audience they had not in their most sanguine moments expected much but this was even rather less than they had counted on mr durfy mused for some time then turning to reginald he said do you know your letters here was a question to put to the captain of the fifth at wilderham i believe i do said reginald with a touch of scorn in his voice which was quite lost on the practical mr durfy what do you mean by believe do you or do you not of course i do then why couldnt you say so at once take this bit of copy and set it up at that case there and you young fellow take these proofs to the subeditors room and say ive not had the last sheet of the copy of the railway accident yet and im standing for it cut away horace went off after all thought he to himself whats the use of being particular i suppose im what they call a printers devil nothing like starting modestly here goes for my lords the subeditors and the last page of the railway accident and he spent a festive tenminutes hunting out the subeditors domains and possessing himself of the missing copy with reginald however it fared otherwise a fellow may be head of the fifth at a public school and yet not know his letters in a printing office and after five or tenminutes hopeless endeavour to comprehend the geography of a typecase he was obliged to acknowledge himself beaten and apprise mr durfy of the fact im sorry i misunderstood you said he putting the copy down on the table im not used to printing no said mr durfy scornfully i guessed not youre too stuckup for us i can tell you here barber an unhealthylooking young man answered to the name take this chap here to the back caseroom and see he sweeps it out and dusts the cases see if thatll suit your abilities my dandy and without waiting to hear reginalds explanations or remonstrances mr durfy walked off leaving the unlucky boy in the hands of mr barber now then stir your stumps mr dandy said the latter itll take you all your time to get that shop straight i can tell you so youd better pull up your boots got a broom no muttered reg through his teeth ive not got a broom go and get that one then out of the corner there reginald flushed crimson and hesitated a moment do you ear are you deaf get that one there reginald got it and trailing it behind him dismally followed his guide to the back caseroom it was a small room which apparently had known neither broom nor water for years the floor was thick with dirt and the cases ranged in the racks against the walls were coated with dust there you are said mr barber open the window do you ear and dont let none of the dust get out into the composingroom or therell be a row come and tell me when youve done the floor and ill show you ow to do them cases rattle along do you ear or you wont get it done today and mr barber who had had his day of sweeping out the shops departed slamming the door behind him things had come to a crisis with reginald cruden early in his business career he had come into the city that morning prepared to face a good deal he had not counted on much sympathy or consideration from his new employers he had even vaguely made up his mind he would have to rough it at first but to be shut up in a dirty room with a broom in his hand by a cad who could not even talk grammar was a humiliation on which he had never once calculated tossing the broom unceremoniously into a corner he opened the door and walked out of the room barber was already out of sight chuckling inwardly over the delicious task he had been privileged to set to his dandy subordinate and none of the men working near knew or cared what this pale handsome new boy did either in or out of the back caseroom reginald walked through them to the passage outside not much caring where he went or whom he met if he were to meet mr barber or mr durfy or the manager himself so much the better as it happened he met horace looking comparatively cheerful with some papers in his hand hullo reg said he have they promoted you to a printers devil too fancy what bland would say if he saw us never mind theres four hours gone and in about another six we shall be home with mother again i shall be home before then said reg im going now i cant stand it horace horace stared at his brother in consternation oh reg old man you mustnt really you mustnt do lets stick together however miserable it is its sure to seem worse at first its all very well for you horace doing messenger work you havent been set to sweep out a room horace whistled whew that is a drop too much but he added taking his brothers arm dont cut it yet old man for mothers sake dont ill come and help you do it if i can why couldnt they have given it me to do and let you go the messages reginald said nothing but let his brother lead him back slowly to the big room presided over by mr durfy where is it horace inquired of him at the door that little room in the corner all right ill come if i possibly can do try it old man wont you ill try it said reginald with something very like a groan as he opened the door and walked grimly back to the back caseroom horace full of fear and trembling on his brothers account hurried with his copy to mr durfy and waited impatiently till that grandee condescended to relieve him of it is there anything else he inquired as he gave it up anything else yes plenty but dont come bothering me now horace waited for no more elaborate statement of mr durfys wishes but thankfully withdrew and made straight for reginald he found him half hidden half choked by the dust of his own raising as he drew his broom in a spiritless way across the black dry floor he paused in his occupation as horace entered and for a moment as the two stood face to face coughing and sneezing a sense of the ludicrous overcame them and they finished up their duet with a laugh i say said horace as soon as he could get words i fancy a little water would be an improvement here where are we to get it from said reg i suppose there must be some about shall i go and see we might tip one of those fellows outside a sixpence to go and get us some hold hard old man said horace laughing again were not so flush of sixpences as all that i guess if we want any water we shall have to get it ourselves ill be back directly poor reg spirited up for a while by his brothers courage proceeded more gingerly with his sweeping much amazed in the midst of his misery to discover how many walks in life there are beyond the capacity even of the captain of the fifth of a public school he was not however destined on the present occasion to perfect himself in the one that was then engaging his attention horace had scarcely disappeared in quest of water when the door opened and no less a personage than the manager himself entered the room he was evidently prepared neither for the dust nor the duster and started back for a moment as though he were under the impression that the clouds filling the apartment were clouds of smoke and reginald was another guy fawkes caught in the act he recovered himself shortly however and demanded sharply what are you doing here making all this mess im trying to carry out mr durfys instructions replied reginald leaning on his broom and not at all displeased at the interruption durfys instructions what do you mean sir mr durfys that will do here you said the manager opening the door and speaking to the nearest workman tell mr durfy to step here mr durfy appeared in a very brief space durfy said the manager wrathfully what do you mean by having this room in such a filthy mess arent your instructions to have it swept out once a week when was it swept last some little time ago weve been so busy in our department sir that yes i know you always say that im sick of hearing it dont let me find this sort of thing again send some one at once to sweep it out this lad doesnt know how to hold a broom take care its done by four oclock and ready for use pheugh its enough to choke one and the manager went off in a rage coughing satisfactory as this was in a certain sense for reginald it was not a flattering way of ending his difficulties nor did the spirit in which mr durfy accepted his chiefs reprimand at all tend to restore him to cheerfulness bah you miserable idiot you give up that broom and get out of this or ill chuck you out i dont think you will said reginald coolly dropping the broom and facing his enemy he was happier at that moment than he had been for a long time he could imagine himself back at wilderham with the school bully shouting at him and his spirits rose within him accordingly what do you say you huggermugger puppy youyou mr durfys adjectives frequently had the merit of being more forcible than appropriate and on the present occasion what with the dust and his own rage the one he wanted stuck in his throat altogether i said i dont think you will repeated reginald mr durfy looked at his man and hesitated reginald stood five foot nine and his shoulders were square and broad besides he was as cool as a cucumber and didnt even trouble to take his hands out of his pockets all this mr durfy took in and did not relish but he must not cave in too precipitately so he replied with a sneer think a lot you know about thinking cant even hold a broom clear out of here i tell you double quick do you hear reginalds spirits fell it was clear from mr durfys tone he was not going to attempt to chuck him out and nothing therefore could be gained by remaining he turned scornfully on his heel knowing that he had made one enemy at any rate during his short connection with his new business and if he had known all he could have counted two for mr durfy finding himself in a mood to wreak his wrath on some one summoned the illfavoured barber to sweep out the back caseroom and gave his orders so viciously that barber felt distinctly aggrieved and jumping to the conclusion that reginald had somehow contrived to turn the tables on him he registered a secret vow there and then that he would on the first opportunity and on all subsequent opportunities be square with that luckless youth caring very little about who hated him or who liked him reginald wandered forth to intercept the faithful horace with the now unnecessary water and the two boys finding very little to occupy them during the rest of the day remained in comparative seclusion until the seven oclock bell rang when they walked home possibly wiser and certainly sadder for their first day with the rocket newspaper company limited chapter five the crudens at home if anything could have made up to the two boys for the hardships and miseries of the day it was the sight of their mothers bright face as she awaited them that evening at the door of number dull street if the day had been a sad and lonely one for mrs cruden she was not the woman to betray the secret to her sons and indeed the happiness of seeing them back was enough to drive away all other care for the time being shabby as the lodgings were and lacking in all the comforts and luxuries of former days the little family felt that evening as they gathered round the teatable and unburdened their hearts to one another more of the true meaning of the word home than they had ever done before now dear boys said mrs cruden when the meal was over and they drew their chairs to the open window im longing to hear your days adventures how did you get on was it as bad as you expected it wasnt particularly jolly said reginald shrugging his shouldersnothing like wilderham was it horrors well it was a different sort of fun certainly said horace you see mother our education has been rather neglected in some things so we didnt get on as well as we might have done do you mean in the literary work said mrs cruden im quite sure youll get into it with a little practice but its not the literary work unluckily said reginald ah you mean clerks work you arent as quick at figures perhaps as you might be thats not exactly it said horace the fact is mother were neither in the literary not the clerical department im a printers devil oh horace what do you mean said the horrified mother oh im most innocently employed i run messages i fetch and carry for a gentleman called durfy he gives me some parliamentary news to carry to one place and some police news to carry to another placeand bytheway they read very much alikeand when im not running backwards or forwards i have to sit on a stool and watch him and be ready to jump up and wag my tail the moment he whistles its a fact mother think of getting eighteen shillings a week for that its a fraud mrs cruden could hardly tell whether to laugh or cry my poor boy she murmured then turning to reginald she said and what do you do reg oh i sweep rooms said reg solemnly but theyve got such a shocking bad broom there that i cant make it act if you could give me a new broomhead mother and put me up to a dodge or two about working out corners i might rise in my profession there was a telltale quaver in the speakers voice which made this jaunty speech a very sad one to the mothers ears it was all she could do to conceal her misery and when horace came to the rescue with a racy account of the days proceedings told in his liveliest manner she was glad to turn her head and hide from her boys the trouble in her face however she soon recovered herself and by the time horaces story was done she was ready to join her smiles with those which the history had drawn even from reginalds serious countenance after all said she presently we must be thankful for what we have some one was saying the other day there never was a time when so many young fellows were out of work and thankful to get anything to do and its very likely too reg that just now when they seem rather in confusion at the office they really havent time to see about what your regular work is to be wait a little and theyre sure to find out your value they seem to have done that already as far as sweeping is concerned the manager said i didnt know how to hold a broom i was quite offended said reginald you are a dear brave pair of boys said the mother warmly and i am prouder of you in your humble work than if you were kings hullo said horace theres some one coming up our stairs sure enough there was and more than one person as it happened there was a knock at the door followed straightway by the entrance of an elderly lady accompanied by a young lady and a young gentleman who sailed into the room much to the amazement and consternation of its occupants mrs cruden i believe said the elderly lady in her politest tones yes replied the owner of that name let me hintroduce myselfmrs captain shuckleford my son and daughterneighbours of yours mrs cruden and wishing to be friendly were sorry to hear of your trouble very trying it is my usband mrs cruden has gone too pray take a seat said mrs cruden reg will you put chairs reg obeyed with a groan these are your boys are they said the visitor eyeing the youths will you come and shake ands with me reggie what a dear good looking boy he is mrs cruden and ow do you do too my man said she addressing horace pretty well and what do they call you my name is horace said my man blushing very decidedly and retreating precipitately to a far corner of the room ah dear me and my usbands name mrs cruden was oward i never ear the name without affliction this was very awkward for as the unfortunate widow could not fail to hear her own voice it was necessary for consistencys sake that she should show some emotion which she proceeded to do when her daughter hurriedly interposed in an audible whisper ma dont make a goose of yourself behave yourself do so i am beaving myself jemima replied the outraged parent and i dont need lessons from you its very kind of you to call in said mrs cruden feeling it time to say something do you live near here we live next door at number four said miss jemima put that handkerchief away ma what next i wonder if my andkerchiefs not my hown id like to know what is yes mrs cruden we heard you were coming and we wish to treat you with consideration knowing your circumstances its all one gentlefolk can do to another yes and i ope the boys will be good friends sam talk to the boys sam needed no such maternal encouragement as it happened and had already swaggered up to horace with a familiar air jolly weather aint it yes said horace looking round wildly for any avenue of escape but finding none pretty hot in your shop aint it said the lawyers clerk yes again said horace with a peculiar tingling sensation in his toes which his visitor little dreamed of horace was not naturally a shorttempered youth but there was something in the tone of this selfsatisfied lawyers clerk which raised his dander not much of a berth is it pursued the catechist no said horace not a very chirrupy screw so im toldeh this was rather too much either horace must escape by flight which would be ignominious or he must knock his visitor down which would be rude or he must grin and bear it the middle course was what he most inclined to but failing that he decided on the latter so he shook his head and waited patiently for the next question what do you do eh dirty work aint it yes isnt yours said horace in a tone that rather surprised the limb of the law mine no what makes you ask that he inquired only because i thought id like to know said horace artlessly mr shuckleford looked perplexed he didnt understand exactly what horace meant and yet whatever it was it put him off the thread of his discourse for a time so he changed the subject i once thought of going into business myself he said but they seemed to think id do better at the law same time dont think im a nailer on business chaps i know one or two very respectable chaps in business do you replied horace with a touch of satire in his voice which was quite lost on the complacent sam yes why in our clubdo you know our club no said horace ohi must take you one eveningyes in our club weve a good many business chapswellbehaved chaps too horace hardly looked as overwhelmed by this announcement as his visitor expected would you like to join no thank you eh youre afraid of being blackballed i suppose no fear i can work it with them i can walk round any of them i let you know they wouldnt do it especially when they knew id a fancy for you my boy if horace was grateful for this expression of favour he managed to conceal his feelings wonderfully well at the same time he had sense enough to see that vulgar and conceited as samuel shuckleford was he meant to be friendly and inwardly gave him credit accordingly he did his best to be civil and to listen to all the bumptious talk of his visitor patiently and sam rattled away greatly to his own satisfaction fully believing he was impressing his hearer with a sense of his importance and cheering his heart by the promise of his favours and protection with the unlucky reginald meanwhile it fared far less comfortably jemima my dear said mrs shuckleford who in all her domestic confidences to mrs cruden kept a sharp eye on her familyjemima my dear i think reggie would like to show you his album an electric shock could not have startled and confused our hero more it was bad enough to hear himself called reggie but that was nothing to the assumption that he was pining to make himself agreeable to miss jemimahe to whom any lady except his mother was a cause of trepidation and to whom a female like miss jemima was nothing short of an ogress ive not got an album he gasped with an appealing look towards his mother but before mrs cruden could interpose to rescue him the ladylike miss jemima who had already regarded the goodlooking shy youth with approval entered the lists on her own account and moving her chair a trifle in his direction said in a confidential whisper ma thinks were not a very sociable couple thats what it is a couple he and jemima a couple reginald was ready to faint and looked towards the open window as if he meditated a headlong escape that way as to any other way of escape that was impossible for he was fairly cornered between the enemy and the wall and unless he were to cut his way through the one or the other he must sit where he was i hope you dont mind talking to me mr reggie continued the young lady when reginald gave no symptom of having heard the last observation we shall have to be friends you know now we are neighbours so you havent got an album this abrupt question drove poor reginald still further into the corner what business was it of hers whether he had got an album or not what right had she to pester him with questions like that in his own house in fact what right had she and her mother and her brother to come there at all those were the thoughts that passed through his mind and as they did so indignation got the better of good manners and everything else find out he said he could have bitten his tongue off the moment he had spoken for reginald was a gentleman and the sound of these rude words in his own voice startled him into a sense of shame and confusion tenfold worse than any miss shuckleford had succeeded in producing i beg your pardon he gasped hurriedly ii didnt mean to be rude now was the hour of miss jemimas triumph she had the unhappy youth at her mercy and she took full advantage of her power she forgave him and made him sit and listen to her and answer her questions for as long as she chose and if ever he showed signs of mutiny the slightest hint such as youll be telling me to mind my own business again was enough to reduce him to instant subjection it was a bad quarter of an hour for reginald and the climax arrived when presently mrs shuckleford looked towards them and said across the room now i wonder what you two young people are talking about in that snug corner oh never mind if its secrets nice it is mrs cruden to see young people such good friends so soon we must be going now children she added we shall soon see our friends in our own ouse i ope a tender leavetaking ensued for a while as the retreating footsteps of the visitors gradually died away on the stairs the little family stood motionless as though the slightest sound might recall them but when at last the streetdoor slammed below reginald flung himself into a chair and groaned mother we cant stay here we must leave tomorrow horace could not help laughing why reg he said you seemed to be enjoying yourself no end shut up horace its nothing to laugh about my dear boy said mrs cruden you think far more about it than you need after all they seem kindly disposed persons and i dont think we should be unfriendly thats all very well said reg if there was no jemima in the question i should say its all very well said horace if there was no sam in the question though i dare say he means to be friendly but didnt you and jemima hit it then reg i quite thought you did didnt i tell you to shut up repeated reg this time half angrily i dont see mother he added however poor we are we are called on to associate with a lot like that they have not polished manners certainly said mrs cruden but i do think they are goodnatured and thats a great thing i should think so said horace what do you think samuel wants to propose me for his club which seems to be a very select affair all i know is said reginald nothing will induce me to go into their house it may be rude but im certain id be still more rude if i did go well said horace i vote we take a walk as its a fine evening i feel a trifle warm after it all what do you say they said yes and in the empty streets that evening the mother and her two sons walked happy in one anothers company and trying each in his or her own way to gain courage for the days of trial that were to follow the brothers had a short consultation that night as they went to bed not on the subject of their next door neighbours horrors said reg whats to be done about the rocket i cant stop there its awful said horace but what else can we do if we cut it theres mother left a beggar couldnt we get into something else what whod take us there are thousands of fellows wanting work as it is but surely were better than most of them were gentlemen and well educated so much the worse it seems said horace what good is it to us when were put to sweep rooms and carry messages do you mean to say you intend to stick to that sort of thing all your life asked reg till i can find something better said horace after all old man its honest work and not very fagging and its eighteen shillings a week anyhow i think we might let richmond know what a nice berth hes let us in for why his officeboys better off yes and if we knew as much about bookkeeping and agreement stamps and copying presses as his officeboy does we might be as well off whats the good of knowing how many ships fought at salamis when we dont even know how many ounces you can send by post for twopence at least i dont goodnight old man and horace really scarcely less miserable at heart than his brother buried his nose in the dull street pillow and tried to go to sleep chapter six reginalds prospects develop it was in anything but exuberant spirits that the two crudens presented themselves on the following morning at the workmans entrance of the rocket newspaper company limited the bell was beginning to sound as they did so and their enemy the timekeeper looked as though he would fain discover a pretext for pouncing on them and giving them a specimen of his importance but even his ingenuity failed in this respect and as horace passed him with a goodhumoured nod he had much against his will to nod back and forego his amiable intentions the brothers naturally turned their steps to the room presided over by mr durfy that magnate had not yet arrived much to their relief and they consoled themselves in his absence by standing at the table watching their fellowworkmen as they crowded in and proceeded with more or less alacrity to settle down to their days work among those who displayed no unseemly haste in applying themselves to their tasks was barber who with the dust of the back caseroom still in his mind and equally on his countenance considered the present opportunity of squaring up accounts with reginald too good to be neglected for reasons best known to himself mr barber determined that his victims flagellation should be moral rather than physical he would have liked to punch reginalds head or better still to have knocked reginalds and horaces heads together but he saw reasons for denying himself that pleasure and fell back on the more ethereal weapons of his own wit hullo puddin ead he began ows your pa and your ma today find the old bailey a ealthy place dont they reginald favoured the speaker by way of answer with a stare of mingled scorn and wrath which greatly elevated that gentlemans spirits ow long is it theyve got seven years aint it my eye they wont know you when they come out youll be so growed the wrath slowly faded from reginalds face as the speaker proceeded leaving only the scorn to testify to the interest he took in this intellectual display horace delighted to see there was no prospect of a flareup smiled and began almost to enjoy himself i say continued barber just a little disappointed to find that his exquisite humour was not as electrical in its effect as it would have been on any one less dense than the crudens ow is it you aint got a clean collar on today and no scent on your andkercherseh this was getting feeble even mr barber felt it for he continued in a more lively tone glad we aint got many of your sickening sort ere snivelling school boy brats thats what you are tired of pickin pockets and think youre goin to show us your manners yah if you wasnt such a dirty ugly pair of puppy dogs id stick you under the pumpso i would reginald yawned and walked off to watch a compositor picking up type out of a case horace on the other hand appeared to be deeply interested in mr barbers eloquent observations and inquired quite artlessly but with a twinkle in his eyeis the pump near here i was looking for it everywhere yesterday it was mr barbers turn to stare he had not expected this and he did not like it especially when one or two of the men and boys near who had failed to be convulsed by his wit laughed at horaces question after all moral flagellation does not always answer and when one of the victims yawns and the other asks a matteroffact questions it is disconcerting even to an accomplished operator however barber gallantly determined on one more effort ughtrying to be funny are you mr snubnose best try and be honest if you can you and your mealymug brother itll be ard work i know to keep your ands in your own pockets but youd best do it do you earpair of psalmsingin twopennyhapenny puppy dogs this picturesque peroration certainly deserved some recognition and might possibly have received it had not mr durfys entrance at that particular moment sent the idlers back suddenly to their cases reginald either heedless of or unconcerned at the new arrival remained listlessly watching the operations of the compositor near him an act of audacity which highly exasperated the overseer and furnished the key note for the days entertainment for mr durfy to use an expressive term had got out of bed the wrong side this morning for the matter of that after the blowingup about the back caseroom he had got into it the wrong side last night so that he was doubly perturbed in spirit and a short conversation he had just had with the manager below had not tended to compose him durfy said that brusque official as the overseer passed his open door come in what about those two lads i sent up to you yesterday are they any good not a bit growled mr durfy fools both of them which is the bigger fool the old one then keep him for yourselfput him to composing and send the other one down here send him at once durfy do you hear with this considerately worded injunction in his ears it is hardly to be wondered at that mr durfy was not all smiles as he entered the domain which owned his sway his eye naturally lit on reginald as the most suitable object on which to relieve his feelings now then there he called out what do you mean by interfering with the men in their work im not interfering with anybody said reginald looking up with glowing cheeks im watching this man come out of it do you hear me why dont you go about your own work ive been waiting here tenminutes for you look here said mr durfy his tones getting lower as his passion rose if you think were going to keep you here to give us any of your impudence youre mistaken so i can tell you its bad enough to have a big fool put into the place for charity without any of your nonsense if i had my way id give you your beggarly eighteen shillings a week to keep you away go to your work reginalds eyes blazed out for a moment on the speaker in a way which made horace who heard and saw all tremble but he overcame himself with a mighty effort and said where mr durfy glanced round the room young gedge he called out a boy answered the summons clear that rack between you and barber and put up a pair of cases for this fool here and look after him off you go and off you go added he rounding on reginald and if we dont make it hot for you among us im precious mistaken it was a proud moment certainly for the cock of the fifth at wilderham to find himself following meekly at the heels of a youngster like gedge who had been commissioned to put him to work and look after him but reginald was too sick at heart and disgusted to care what became of himself as long as mr durfys odious voice ceased to torment his ears the only thing he did care about was what was to become of horace was he to be put in charge of some one too or was he to remain a printers devil mr durfy soon answered that question what are you standing there for demanded he turning round on the younger brother as soon as he had disposed of the elder go down to the managers room at once youre not wanted here so they were to be separated there was only time to exchange one glance of mutual commiseration and then horace slowly left the room with sad forebodings more on his brothers account than his own and feeling that as far as helping one another was concerned they might as well be doomed to serve their time at opposite ends of london gedge under whose imposing auspices reginald was to begin his typographical career was a diminutive youth who to all outward appearances was somewhere about the tender age of fourteen instead of as was really the case being almost as old as reginald himself he was facetiously styled magog by his shopmates in allusion to his small stature which required the assistance of a goodsized box under his feet to enable him to reach his upper case his face was not an unpleasant one and his voice which still retained its boyish treble was an agreeable contrast to that of most of the gentlemen of the case in mr durfys department for all that reginald considered himself much outraged by being put in charge of this chit of a child and glowered down on him much as a mastiff might glower on a terrier who presumed to do the honour of his back yard for his benefit however the terrier in this case was not at all disheartened by his reception and said cheerily as he began to clear the frame you dont seem to fancy it i say i dont wonder never mind i shant lick you unless you make me thanks said reginald drily but scarcely able to conceal a smile at this magnanimous declaration magog worked busily away putting away cases in the rack dusting the frame down with his apron and whistling softly to himself thanks for helping me said he after a time as reginald still stood by doing nothing i could never have done it all by myself reginald blushed a little at this broad hint and proceeded to lift down a case but he nearly upset it in doing so greatly to his companions horror youd better rest he said youll be fagged out here let me do it there you are now were ready to start you ive a good mind to go and get old tacker to ring up the big bell and let them know youre just going to begin reginald could hardly be offended at this goodnatured banter and as gedge was after all a decentlooking boy and aspirated his hs and did not smell of onions he began to think that if he were doomed to drudge in this place he might have been saddled with a more offensive companion its a pity to put tacker to the trouble young un said he hell probably ring when im going to leave off and thatll do as well thats not bad for you said gedge approvingly not half bad go on like that and youll make a joke in about a fortnight look here said reginald smiling at last i shall either have to punch your head or begin work youd better decide which youd like best well as durfy is looking this way said gedge i suppose youd better begin work stick that pair of empty cases up therethe one with the big holes below and the other one above you neednt stick them upside down though unless you particularly want to they look quite as well the right way now then youd better watch me fill them and see what boxes the sorts go in no larks now here goes for the ms so saying mr magog proceeded to fill up one box with types of the letter m and another box some distance off with as and another with bs and so on till presently the lower of the two cases was nearly full reginald watched him with something like admiration inwardly wondering if he would ever be able to find his way about this labyrinth of boxes and strongly of opinion that only muffs like printers would think of arranging the alphabet in such an absurdly haphazard manner the lower case being full up gedge meekly suggested that as he was yet several feet from his full size they might as well lift the upper case down while it was being filled which done the same process was repeated only with more apparent regularity and the case having been finally tilted up on the frame above the lower case the operator turned round with a pleased expression and said what do you think of that why i think its very ridiculous not to put the capital j next to the capital i said reginald gedge laughed go and tell durfy that hed like to hear it reginald however denied himself the pleasure of entertaining mr durfy on this occasion and occupied himself with picking up the types and inspecting them and trying to learn the geography of his cases now said magog mounting his box and taking his composingstick in his hand keep your eye on me young fellow and youll know all about it and he proceeded to setup a paragraph for the newspaper from a manuscript in front of him at a speed which bewildered reginald and baffled any attempt on his part to follow the movements of the operators hand among the boxes he watched for several minutes in silence until gedge considering he had exhibited his agility sufficiently halted in his work and with a passing shade across his face turned to his companion and said i say isnt this a beastly place there was something in his voice and manner which struck reginald it was unlike a common workman and still more unlike a boy of gedges size and age it is beastly he said im awfully sorry for you you know continued gedge in a half whisper and going on with his work at the same time because i guess its not what youre used to im not used to it said reginald nor was i when i came my old screw of an uncle took it into his head to apprentice me here because hed been an apprentice once and didnt see why i should start higher up the ladder than he did are you an apprentice no not that i know of said reginald not knowing exactly what he was lucky beggar im booked here for nobody knows how much longer id have cut it long ago if i could i say whats your name cruden well cruden im precious glad youve turned up itll make all the difference to me i was getting as big a cad as any of those fellows there for youre bound to be sociable but youre a nicer sort and its a good job for me i can tell you apart from the flattery of these words there was a touch of earnestness in the boys voice which struck a sympathetic chord in reginalds nature and drew him mysteriously to this new hourold acquaintance he told him of his own hard fortunes and by what means he had come down to his present position gedge listened to it all eagerly were you really captain of the fifth at your school said he almost reverentially i say what an awful drop this must be you must feel as if youd sooner be dead i do sometimes said reginald i know i would replied gedge solemnly if i was you was that other fellow your brother then yes gedge mused a bit and then laughed quietly how beautifully you two shut up barber between you just now he said its the first snub hes had since ive been here and all the fellows swear by him i say cruden its a merciful thing for me youve come i was bound to go to the dogs if id gone on as i was much longer reginald brightened it pleased him just now to think any one was glad to see him and the spontaneous way in which this boy had come under his wing won him over completely we must manage to stick together he said horace you know is working in another part of the office its awfully hard lines for we set our minds on being together but it cant be helped and im glad any way youre here young un the young un beamed gratefully by way of response the paragraph by this time was nearly setup and the conversation was interrupted by the critical operation of lifting the matter from the stick and transferring it to a galley a feat which the experienced magog accomplished very deftly and greatly to the amazement of his companion just as it was over and reginald was laughingly hoping he would not soon be expected to arrive at such a pitch of dexterity mr durfy walked up so thats what you call doing your work is it playing the fool and getting in another mans way is that all youve done reginald glared at him and answered im not playing the fool hold your tongue and dont answer me you miserable puppy let me see what you have done ive been learning the boxes in the case said reginald mr durfy sneered you have have you thats what youve been doing the last hour i suppose since youve been so industrious pick me out a lowercase x do you hear reginald made a vague dive at one of the boxes but not the right one for he produced a z ah i thought so said mr durfy with a sneer that made reginald long to cram the type into his mouth now lets try a capital j as it happened reginald knew where the capital j was but he made no attempt to reach it and answered if you want a capital j mr durfy you can help yourself magog nearly jumped out of his skin as he heard this audacious reply and scarcely ventured to look round to notice the effect of it on mr durfy the effect was on the whole not bad for a moment the overseer was dumbfounded and could not speak but a glance at the resolute pale boy in front of him checked him in his impulse to use some other retort but the tongue as soon as words came he snarled ho is it that you mean my beauty all right well see whos master here and if i am im sorry for you and he turned on his heel and went youve done it now said magog in an agitated whisperdone it clean done what asked reginald done it with durfy he will make it hot for you and no mistake never mind if the worst comes to the worst you can cut but hold on as long as you can hell make you go some time or another he wont make me go till i choose replied reginald ill stick here to disappoint him if i do nothing else the reader may have made up his mind already that reginald was a fool im afraid he was but do not judge him harshly yet for his troubles are only beginning chapter seven an exciting end to a dull day horace meanwhile had wended his way with some trepidation and curiosity to the managers sanctum he felt uncomfortable in being separated from reginald at all especially when the latter was left singlehanded in such an uncongenial atmosphere as that breathed by mr durfy and barber he could only hope for the best and meanwhile what fate was in store for himself he knocked at the managers door doubtfully and obeyed the summons to enter brusque man as the manager was there was nothing disagreeable about his face as he looked up and said ohyoure the youngster mr richmond put in here yes sir my brother and i are yes and i hear youre both fools is that the case reginald isnt whatever i am said horace boldly isnt he im told hes the bigger fool of the two never mind that though i assure you began horace but the manager stopped him yes yes i know all about that now listen to me i dare say youre both wellmeaning boys and mr richmond is interested in you so ive promised to make room for you here though its not convenient and the wages you are to get are out of all proportion to your valueso far horace was glad at least that the manager dropped in those last two words if your brother is clever and picks up his work soon and doesnt give himself airs hell get on faster than you i cant put you at case but they want a lad in the subeditors room do you know where that is yes sir said horace i took some proofs there yesterday but sir well what said the manager sharply is there no possibility of reginald and me being together faltered the boy yesoutside if youre discontented said the manager it was evidently no use and horace walked dismally to the door the manager looked after him take my advice said he rather more kindly than he had hitherto spoken make the best of what youve got young fellow and itll be better still in time shut the door after you the subeditors roomor rooms for there was an inner and an outer sanctumwas in a remote dark corner of the building so dark that gas was generally burning in it all day long giving its occupants generally the washedout pallid appearance of men who do not know when day ends or night begins the chief subeditor was a young baldheaded spectacled man of meek appearance who received horace in a resigned way and referred him to the clerks in the outer room who would show him how he could make himself useful feeling that so far as he was concerned he had fallen on his feet and secretly wishing poor reginald was in his shoes horace obeyed and retired to the outer room the occupants of that apartment were two young gentlemen of from eighteen to twenty years of age who it was evident at a glance were not brothers one was short and fair and chubby the other was lank and lean and cadaverous one was sorrowful and lugubrious in countenance the other seemed to be spending his time in trying hard not to smile and not succeeding the only thing they did appear to share in common was hard work and in this they were so fully engrossed that horace had to stand a full minute at the table before they had leisure to look up and notice him the gentleman in there said horace addressing the lugubrious youth as being the more imposing of the two said if i came to you you could set me to work the sad one gave a sort of groan and said ah he was right there it is work i say said the other youth looking up dont frighten the kid booms youll make him run away i wish i could run away said booms in an audible soliloquy so you can if you like you old crocodile i say young un have you got a chair horace had to confess he had not a chair about him thats a go weve only two here we shall have to take turns on them booms will stand first wont you booms oh of course said booms rising and pushing his chair towards horace thanks said horace but id sooner stand really no no said booms resignedly im to stand waterford says so sit down young un said waterford and dont mind him he wont say so but hes awfully glad to stand up for a bit and stretch his legs now do you see this lot of morning papersyoull see a lot of paragraphs marked at the side with a blue pencil youve got to cut them out mind you dont miss any sure you understand horace expressed himself equal to this enormous task and set to work busily with his scissors if he had had no one but himself to consider he would have felt comparatively happy he found himself in a department of work which he liked and which though at first not very exciting promised some day to become interesting his chief was a gentleman not likely to interfere with him as long as he did his work steadily and his companions were not only friendly but entertaining if only reginald could have a seat at this table too horace felt he could face the future cheerily how he wondered was the poor fellow getting on that moment in his distant uncongenial work youre not obliged to read all the paragraphs you know said waterford as horaces hand slackened amid these musings its a close shave to get done as it is and hes marked a frightful lot this morning he was right all the cuttings had to be taken out and pasted on sheets before twelve oclock and it took the three of them hard at work with scissors and paste to get the task accomplished they talked very little and joked still less but when it was all done like three honest men they felt pleased with themselves and decidedly amiable towards one another now booms is going out for the grub arent you booms hell get some for you too young un if you like no thanks id be very glad but i promised to have dinner with my brotherhes a compositor here lucky man groaned booms think of having nothing to do but pick up types instead of slaving like this every day see the sausages are hot this time wont you booms and look alive theres a dear fellow booms retired sadly goodnatured chap booms said waterford rather a risk of imposing on him if one isnt careful hes an awfully decent fellow but its a sad pity hes such a masher a what asked horace a masher he maynt look it but he goes it rather strong in that line after hours he doesnt mean it poor soul but hes mixed up with some of our reporters and tries to go the pace with them i dont care for that sort of thing myself but if you do hes just your man you wouldnt think it to look at him would you certainly not replied horace much impressed by this confidence and the revelation it afforded as booms reentered shortly afterwards looking very gloomy burdened with two plates two mugs and a sheaf of knives and forks under his arm he certainly did not give one the impression of a very rakish character and horace could scarcely refrain from smiling as he tried to picture him in his afterhours character he left the couple to their sausages and went out in the vain hope of finding reginald somewhere but there was no sign of workmen anywhere and to his disgust he ascertained from a passing boy that the compositors dinnerhour did not begin till he was due back at his work everything seemed to conspire to sever the two brothers and horace dejectedly took a solitary and frugal repast he determined at all hazards to wait a minute after the bell summoning him back to work had ceased pealing and was rewarded by a hasty glimpse of his brother and the exchange of a few hurried sentences it was better than nothing and he rushed back to his room just in time to save his reputation for punctuality the afternoon passed scarcely less busily than the morning they sat and booms had contrived to raise a third chair somewherewith a pile of work in front of them which at first seemed hopeless to expect to overtake there were effusions to decline with thanks and others to enter in a book and send up to the composingroom there were some letters to write and others to answer there were reporters notes to string together and telegrams to transcribe and all the while a dropping fire of proofs and revises and messages was kept up at them from without which they had to carry to their chief and deal with according to his orders horace being inexperienced was only able to take up the simpler portions of this miscellaneous work but these kept him busy hammer and tongs with scarcely time to sneeze till well on in the afternoon the rocket unlike most evening papers waited till the evening before it appeared and did not go to press till five oclock after that it issued later editions once an hour till eight oclock and on special occasions even as late as ten the great rush of the day therefore as horace soon discovered was over at five oclock but between that hour and seven there was always plenty to do in connection with the late editions and the following days work at seven oclock every one left except a subeditor and one of the clerks and one or two compositors to see after the eight oclock and any possible later edition as soon as you get your hand in young un youll have to take your turn at late work booms and i take every other night now horace could say nothing against this arrangement though it meant more separation from reginald at present however his hand not being in he had nothing to keep him after the seven oclock bell and he eagerly escaped at its first sound to look for reginald not however till he had witnessed a strange sight about a quarter to seven booms whose early evening it was showed signs of uneasiness he glanced sorrowfully once or twice at the clock then at horace then at waterford then he got up and put his papers away finally he mused on a washhand basin in a corner of the room and said dolefully i must dress i think waterford all serene said waterford briskly the young un and i will finish up here then nudging horace he added in a whisper hes going to rig up now dont pretend to notice him thats all booms proceeded to divest himself of his office coat and waistcoat and collar and to roll up the sleeves of his flannel shirt preparatory to an energetic wash he then opened a small box in a corner of the room from which he produced first a clothesbrush with which he carefully removed all traces of dust from his nether garments after that came a pair of lightcoloured pats which he fitted on to his boots then came a bottle of hairoil and afterwards a highlystarched dicky or shirtfront with a stud in it which by a complicated series of strings the owner contrived to fasten round his neck so as to conceal effectually the flannel shirtfront underneath once more he dived and this time the magic box yielded up what seemed to horaces uninitiated eyes to be a broad strip of stiff cardboard but which turned out to be a collar of fearful and wonderful proportions which when once adjusted fully explained the wisdom displayed by the wearer in not deferring the brushing of his trousers and the donning of his pats to a later stage of the proceedings for nothing not even a pickpocket at his gilt watchchain with its pendant charms could lower his chin a quarter of an inch till bedtime but more was yet to come there were cuffs to put on which left one to guess what had become of mr boomss knuckles and a light jaunty necktie to embellish the dicky then with a plaintive sigh he produced a blue figured waistcoat and after it a coat shaped like the coat of a robin to cover all finally there appeared a hat broadbrimmed lowcrowned and dazzling in its glossiness a pair of gay dogskin gloves a crutch walkingstick a pink silk handkerchief and then this joint work of art and nature was complete all right said he in melancholy tones as he set his hat a little on one side of his head and with his stick under his arm began with his gloves waterford got up and walked slowly and critically round him giving a few touches here and there and brushing a little stray dust from his collar all right dear boy mind how you go and oh groaned booms in tones of dire distress i knew i should forget something would you mind waterford what is it my glassits in the box andand i should have got it out before i put the collar on thanks i should have been lost without it oh if i had forgotten it with this awful reflection in his mind he bade a sorrowful goodnight and walked off with his head very erect his elbows high up and one hand fondling the nearlyneglected eyeglass pretty isnt it said waterford as he disappeared it isrot said horace emphatically why ever dont you laugh him out of it my dear boy you might as well try to laugh the hair off his head ive tried it a dozen times after all the poor dear fellow means no harm but what does he do now oh dont ask me according to his own account hes the fastest man about towngoes to all the shows hobnobs with all the swells smokes furious cigars and generally mashes but my private notion is he moons about the streets with the handle of his stick in his mouth and looks in a few shop windows and gets half a dozen oysters for supper and then goes home to bed you see he couldnt well get into much mischief with that collar on if he went in for turndowns id be afraid of him the bell cut further conversation short and in another minute horace and reginald were walking arminarm in the street outside there was much to talk about much to lament over and a little to rejoice over horace felt half guilty as he told his brother of his good fortune and the easy quarters into which he had fallen but reginald was in too defiant a mood to share these regrets as much as he would have done at any other time as long as durfy wanted to get rid of him so long was he determined to stay where he was and meanwhile in young gedge he had some one to look after which would make the drudgery of his daily work tolerable horace did not altogether like it but he knew it was no use arguing then on the subject they mutually agreed to put the best face on everything before their mother she was there to meet them at the door and it rejoiced her heart to hear their brave talk and the cheery story of their days adventures all day long her heart had gone out to them in yearnings of prayer and hope and love and it repaid her a hundred fold this hour of happy meeting with the sunlight of their faces and the music of their voices filling her soul as soon as supper was over reginald suggested a precipitate retreat into the streets for fear of another neighbourly incursion mrs cruden laughingly yielded and the trio had a long walk heedless where they went so long as they were together they wandered as far as oxford street looking into what shops were open and interested still more in the everchanging stream of people who even at ten oclock at night crowded the pavements they met no one they knew not even booms but it mattered little to them that no one noticed them they had one another and there was a sense of security and comfort in that which before these last few weeks they had never dreamed of they were about to turn out of oxford street on their homeward journey when a loud shout close by arrested their attention looking round they saw a boy with disordered dress and unsteady gait attempting to cross the road just as a hansom cab was bearing down at full speed on the place where he stood they only saw his back but it was evident he was either ill or dazed for he stood stupidly where he was with the peril in fullview but somehow helpless to avoid it the cabman shouted and pulled at his horses head but to the horrified onlookers it was only too clear that nothing could stop his career in time he was already within a yard or two of the luckless boy when reginald made a sudden dash into the road charging at him with a violence that sent him staggering forward two paces and then brought him to the earth reginald fell too on the top of him and as the cab dashed past it just grazed the sole of his boot where he lay it was all the work of a momentthe shout the vision of the boy and the rescueso sudden indeed that mrs cruden had barely time to clutch horace by the arm before reginald lay prone in the middle of the road in another moment horace was beside his brother helping him up out of the mud are you hurt old man not a bit said reginald very pale and breathless but rising to his feet without help look outtheres a crowdtake mother home and ill come on as soon as ive seen this fellow safe im not damaged a bit with this assurance horace darted back to his mother in time to extricate her from the crowd which whatever happens is sure to collect in the streets of london at a minutes warning hes all right said horacenot hurt a bit come on mother out of this hell probably catch us up before were home i say said he and his voice trembled with excitement and brotherly pride as he spoke wasnt it splendid mrs cruden would fain have stayed near but the crowd made it impossible to be of any use so she let horace lead her home trembling but with a heart full of thankfulness and pride and love for her young hero reginald meanwhile with the coolness of an old football captain proceeded to pick up his man and appealed to the crowd to stand back and give the fellow room the boy lay halfstunned with his fall his face covered with mud but to reginalds delight he was able to move and with a little help stand on his feet as he did so the light from the lamp of the cab fell on his face and caused reginald to utter an exclamation of surprise and horror young gedge the boy looked at him for a moment in a stupid bewildered way and then gave a short startled cry are you hurt said reginald putting his arm round him noii dont thinklets get away reginald called to the crowd to stand back and let them out an order which the crowd obeyed surlily and with a disappointed grunt not even a broken leg not even the cabmans number taken down one or two who had seen the accident patted reginald on the back as he went by but he hurried past them as quickly as he could and presently stood in the seclusion of a bystreet still supporting his companion on his arm are you hurt he inquired again no said gedge i can walk the two stood facing one another for a moment in silence breathless still and trembling with the excitement of the last few minutes oh cruden cried the boy at last seizing reginalds arm what will you think of me i wasiid been drinkingim sober now but reginald cut him short gently but firmly i know said he youd better go home now young un gedge made no answer but walked on with his arm still in that of his protector reginald saw him into an omnibus and then returned sadly and thoughtfully homeward humph said he to himself as he reached dull street i suppose i shall have to stick on at the rocket after all chapter eight mr durfy gives reginald a testimonial reginald cruden was a young man who took life hard and seriously he was not brilliantindeed he was not clever he lacked both the good sense and the goodhumour which would have enabled him like horace to accept and make the best of his present lot he felt aggrieved by the family calamity and just enough ashamed of his poverty to make him touchy and intractable to a degree which as we have seen already amounted sometimes almost to stupidity still reginald was honest he made no pretence of enjoying life when he did not enjoy it he disliked mr durfy and therefore he flared up if mr durfy so much as looked at him he liked young gedge and therefore it was impossible to leave the youngster to his fate and let him ruin himself without an effort at rescue it is one thing to snatch a heedless one from under the hoofs of a cab horse and another to pick him up from the slippery path of vice and set him firmly on his feet reginald had thought nothing of the one but he looked forward with considerable trepidation to meeting the boy next morning and attempting the other gedge was there when he arrived working very busily and looking rather troubled he flushed up as reginald approached and put down his composingstick to shake hands with him reginald looked and felt by a long way the more uncomfortable and guilty of the two and he was at least thankful that gedge spared him the trouble of beginning oh cruden said the boy i know exactly what youre going to say youre going to tell me youre deceived in me and that im a young fool and going to the dogs as hard as i can i dont wonder you think so i wasnt going to say that said reginald i was going to ask you how you were oh im all right but i know youre going to lecture me cruden and im sure you may theres nothing you can say i dont deserve i only wish i could make you believe ill never be such a fool again ive been making resolutions all night and now youve come here im sure i shall be able to break it off if you will only stand by me cruden i owe you such a lot if you only knew how grateful i was perhaps wed better not talk about it now said reginald feeling very uncomfortable and rather disconcerted at this glib flow of penitence but young gedge was full of it yet and went on im going to turn over a new leaf this very day cruden ive told the errandboy hes not to get me any beer and im determined next time that beast durfy asks me to go what exclaimed reginald was it with him you used to go yes i know youll think all the worse of me for it after the blackguard way hes got on to you you see before you came i didnt likethat is i couldnt well refuse him hed have made it so hot for me here i fancy he found out i had some pocketmoney of my own for he generally picked on me to come and have drinks with him and of course i had to pay why only last nightlook out here he comes sure enough he was and in his usual amiable frame of mind oh there you are are you he said to reginald with a sneer do you know where the lowercase x is now eh reginald swelling with the indignation gedges story had roused in him turned his back and made no answer nothing as he might have known by this time could have irritated mr durfy more look here young gentleman said the latter coming close up to reginalds side and hissing the words very disagreeably in his ear when i ask a question in this shop i expect to get an answer mind that and whats more ill have one or you leave this place in five minutes come now give me a lowercase x reginald hesitated a moment suppose mr durfy had it in him to be as good as his word what then about young gedge he picked up an x sullenly and tossed it at the overseers feet thats not giving it to me said the latter with a sneer of triumph already on his face pick it up directly do you hear and give it to me reginald stood and glared first at mr durfy then at the type yesterday he would have defiantly told him to pick it up himself caring little what the cost might be but things had changed since then humiliating as it was to own it he could not afford to be turned off his pride could not afford it his care for young gedge could not afford it the slender family purse could not afford it why ever did he not think of it all before and spare himself this double indignity with a groan which represented as much inward misery and humiliation as could well be compressed into a single action he stooped down and picked up the type and handed it to mr durfy it was well for him he did not raise his eyes to see the smile with which that gentleman received it next time itll save you trouble to do what youre told at once mr puppy he said get on with your work and dont let me catch you idling your time any more and he walked off crowned with victory and as happy in his mind as if he had just heard of the decease of his enemy the manager it was a bad beginning to the day for reginald he had come to work that morning in a virtuous frame of mind determined if possible to do his duty peaceably and to hold out a helping hand to young gedge it was hard enough now to think of anything but his own indignities and the wretch to whom he owed them he turned to his work almost viciously and for an hour buried himself in it without saying a word or lifting his eyes from his case then young gedge stealing a nervous glance at his face ventured to say i say cruden i wish i could stand things like you i dont know what i should have done if that blackguard had treated me like that whats the use said reginald he wants to get rid of me and im not going to let him im jolly glad of it for my sake i wish i could pay him out for you so you can how next time he wants you to go and drink say no said reginald upon my word i will said gedge and i dont care how hot he makes it for me if you stick by me cruden you know ill stick by you young un said reginald but that wont do you much good unless you stick by yourself suppose durfy managed to get rid of me after all then i should go toto the dogs said gedge emphatically youre a greater fool than i took you for then said reginald if you only knew he added more gently what a job it is to do whats right myself and how often i dont do it youd see its no use expecting me to be good for you and myself both what on earth am i to do then im certain i cant keep square myself i never could whos to look after me if you dont like a brave man reginald shy and reserved as he was told him i need not repeat what was said that morning over the type cases it was not a sermon nor a catechism only a few stammering laboured words spoken by a boy who felt himself half a hypocrite as he said them and who yet for the affection he bore his friend had the courage to go through with a task which cost him twenty times the effort of rescuing the boy yesterday from his bodily peril little good you will say such a sermon from such a perverse bad humoured preacher as reginald cruden could do very likely reader but after all who are you or i to say so had any one told reginald a week ago what would be taking place today he would have coloured up indignantly and hoped he was not quite such a prig as all that as it was when it was all over it was with no selfsatisfied smile or inward gratulation that he returned to his work but rather with the nervous uncomfortable misgivings of one who says to himself after all i may have done more harm than good by the end of a fortnight reginald greatly to mr durfys dissatisfaction was an accomplished compositor he could setup almost as quickly as gedge and his proofs showed far fewer corrections moreover as he was punctual in his hours and diligent at his work it was extremely difficult for the overseer or any one else to find any pretext for abusing him it is true mr barber who had not yet given up the idea of asserting his moral and intellectual superiority continued by the ingenious device of squabbling his case and tampering with the screw of his composingstick and other such pleasing jokes not unknown to printers to disconcert the new beginner on one or two occasions but ever since reginald one morning catching him in the act of mixing up his es with his as had carried him by the collar of his coat and the belt of his breeches to the water tank and dipped his head therein three times with no interval for refreshment between mr barber had moderated his attentions and become less exuberant in his humour with the exception of gedge now his fast ally reginalds other fellow workmen concerned themselves very little with his proceedings one or two indeed noticing his proficiency hinted to him that he was a fool to work for the wages he was getting and some went so far as to say he had no right to do so and had better join the chapel to save trouble what the chapel was reginald did not trouble even to inquire and replied curtly that it was no business of any one else what his wages were wasnt it said the deputation what was to become of them if fellows did their work for half wages they should like to know are you going off or must i make you demanded reginald feeling he had had enough of it and the deputation remembering barbers head and the water tank withdrew very much perplexed what to do to uphold the dignity of the chapel they decided to keep their eye on him and as they were able to do this at a distance reginald had no objection at all to their decision he meanwhile was keeping his eye on gedge and mr durfy and about a fortnight after his arrival at the rocket a passage of arms occurred which slight as it was had a serious influence on the future of all three parties concerned the seven oclock bell had rung and this being one of horaces late evenings reginald proposed to gedge to stroll home with him and call and see mrs cruden the boy accepted readily and the two were starting off arm in arm when mr durfy confronted them reginald who had never met his adversary beyond the precincts of the rocket before did not for a moment recognise the vulgar loudly dressed little man sucking his big cigar and wearing his pot hat ostentatiously on one side but when he did he turned contemptuously aside and said come on young un come on young un echoed mr durfy taking his cigar from his mouth and flicking the ashes in reginalds direction thats just what i was going to say young gedge youre coming with me tonight ive got orders for the alhambra my boy and supper afterwards thank you said gedge rather uncomfortably its very kind of you mr durfy but ive promised cruden to go with him promised cruden what do you mean crudenll keep till tomorrow the orders wont im afraid i cant said gedge afraid i tell you i dont mean to stand here all night begging you just come along and no more nonsense well have a night of it you must excuse me said the boy torn between reginald on the one hand and the fear of offending durfy on the other the latter began to take in the position of affairs and his temper evaporated accordingly i wont excuse you thats all about it he said let go that snivelling louts arm and do what youre told let the boy alone do you hear added he addressing reginald and take yourself off come along gedge gedge is not going with you said reginald keeping the boys arm in his hes coming with me arent you young un the boy pressed his arm gratefully but made no reply this was all mr durfy wanted to fill up the vials of his wrath you miserable young hound you said he with an oath let go the boy this moment or ill turn you out of the placeand him too reginald made no reply his face was pale but he kept the boys arm still fast in his own going with you indeed shouted mr durfy going with you is he to learn how to cant and sing psalms not if i know itor if he does you and he and your brother and your old fool of a mother mr durfy never got to the end of that sentence a blow straight from the shoulder of the wilderham captain sent him sprawling on the pavement before the word was well out of his mouth it had come now it had been bound to come sooner or later and reginald as he drew the boys arm once more under his own felt almost a sense of relief as he stood and watched mr durfy slowly pick himself up and collect his scattered wardrobe it was some time before the operation was complete and even then mr durfys powers of speech had not returned with a malignant scowl he stepped up to his enemy and hissed the one menace all right and then walked away reginald waited till he had disappeared round the corner and then turning to his companion took a long breath and said come along young un it cant be helped the reader must forgive me if i ask him to leave the two lads to walk to dull street by themselves while he accompanies me in the wake of the outraged and mudstained mr durfy that gentleman was far more wounded in his mind than in his person he may have been knocked down before in his life but he had never as far as he could recollect been quite so summarily routed by a boy half his age earning only eighteen shillings a week and the conviction that some people would think he had only got his deserts in what he had suffered pained him very much indeed he did not go to the alhambra his clothes were too dirty and his spirits were far too low he did in the thriftiness of his soul attempt to sell his orders in the crowd at the theatre door but no one rose to the bait so he had to put them back in his pocket on the chance of being able to doctor up the date and crush in with them some other day then he mooned listlessly up and down the streets for an hour till his clothes were dry and then turned into a publichouse to get a brush down and while away another hour still the vision of reginald standing where he had last seen him with young gedge at his side haunted him and spoiled his pleasure he wandered forth again feeling quite lonely and wishing some one or something would turn up to comfort him nor was he disappointed the very chap said a voice suddenly at his side when he was beginning to despair of any diversion so it is how are you my man we were talking of you not two minutes ago durfy pulled up and found himself confronted by two gentlemen one about forty and the other a fashionable young man of twentyfive how are you mr medlock said he to the elder in as familiar a tone as he could assume glad to see you sir how are you too mr shanklin pretty well pretty fair said mr shanklin come and have a drink durfy you look all in the blues gone in love i suppose eh or been speculating on the stock exchange you shouldnt you know a respectable man like you he looks as if hed been speculating in mud said mr medlock pointing to the unfortunate overseers collar and hat which still bore traces of his recent calamity never mind well wash it off in the bodega come along durfy felt rather shy at first in his grand company especially with the consciousness of his muddy collar but after about half an hour in the bodega he recovered his selfpossession and felt himself at home by the way said mr medlock filling up his visitors glass last time we saw you you did us nicely over that tip for the park races my boy if alf and i hadnt been hedged close up we should have lost a pot of money im very sorry said durfy you see another telegram came after the one i showed you that i never saw thats how it happened i really did my best for you but its a bad job if we pay you to get hold of the rockets telegrams and then lose our money over it said mr medlock never mind this time but youd better look a little sharper my boy theres the brummagem cup next week you know and we shall want to know the latest scratches on the night before itll be worth a fiver to you if you work it well durfy fill up your glass mr durfy obeyed glad enough to turn the conversation from the miscarriage of his last attempt to filch his employers telegrams for the benefit of his betting friends and his own pocket by the way said mr shanklin presently moses and i have got a little company on hand just now durfy what do you think of that a company said mr durfy ill wager its not a limited one if youre at the bottom of it whats your little game now its a little idea of alfs said mr medlock whose christian name was moses and it ought to come off too this is something the way of it suppose you were a young greenhorn durfywhich im afraid you arentand saw an advertisement in the rocket saying you could make two hundred and fifty pounds a year easy without interfering with your business eh what would you do if i was a greenhorn said durfy id answer the advertisement and enclose a stamped envelope for a reply to be sure you would and the reply would be wed like to have a look at you and if you looked as green as we took you for wed ask for a deposit and then allow you to sell wines and cigars and that sort of fancy goods to your friends youd sell a dozen of port at sixty shillings do you see half the cash down and half on delivery wed send your friend a dozen at twelve and six and if he didnt shell out the other thirty bob on delivery wed still have the thirty bob he paid down to cover our loss do you twig durfy laughed do you dream all these things he said or how do you ever think of them genius my boy genius said mr medlock of course he added it couldnt run for long but we might give it a turn for a month or two the worst of it is put in mr shanklin its a ticklish sort of business that some people are uncommon sharp at smelling out one has to be very careful theres the advertisement for instance youll have to smuggle it into the rocket my boy it wouldnt do for the governors to see it theyd be up to it but theyd never see it after it was in and the rockets just the paper for us ill try and manage that said durfy you give it me and ill stick it in with a batch of others somehow alf thinks wed better do the thing from liverpool continued mr medlock and all we want is a good secretarya nice green innocent stupid honest young fellowthats what we want if we could pick up one of that sort theres no doubt of the thing working mr durfy started and coloured up and then looked first at mr medlock and then at mr shanklin whats the matter do you think youd suit the place asked the former with a laugh no but i know who will you do who a young puppy under me at the rocket said durfy excitedly the very man to a t and he thereupon launched into a description of reginalds character in a way which showed that not only was he a shrewd observer of human nature in his way but when it served his purpose could see the good even in a man he hated i tell you said he hes born for you if you can only get him and if you dont think so after what ive said perhaps youll believe me when i tell you on the quiet he knocked me down in the gutter this very evening because i wanted to carry off a young convert of his to make a night of it at the alhambra there what do you think of that i wouldnt tell tales of myself like that for fun i can tell you theres no mistake about that being the sort of chap we want said mr medlock if only we can get hold of him said mr shanklin leave that to me said mr durfy only if he comes to you never say a word about me or hell shy off whereupon these three guileless friends finished their glasses and separated in great good spirits and mutual admiration chapter nine samuel shuckleford comes of age reginald meanwhile blissfully unconscious of the arrangements which were being made for him spent as comfortable an evening as he could in the conviction that tomorrow would witness his dismissal from the rocket and see him a waif on the great ocean of london life to his mother and even to young gedge he said nothing of his misgivings but to horace as the two lay awake that night he made a clean breast of all youll call me a fool i suppose he said but how could i help it a fool why reg i know i should have done the same but for all that it is unlucky it is even eighteen shillings a week is better than nothing said reginald with a groan poor mother was saying only yesterday we were just paying for our keep and nothing more what will she do now oh youll get into something im certain said horace and meanwhile meanwhile ill do anything rather than live on you and mother horrors ive made up my mind to that why continued he you wouldnt believe what a sneak ive been already you know what bland said about the football club in his letter no i didnt show it to you he said it would go down awfully well if i sent the fellows my usual subscription i couldnt bear not to do it after that and ii sold my tennisbat for five shillings and took another five shillings out of my last two weeks wages and sent them half a sov the other day horace gave an involuntary whistle of dismay but added quickly i hope the fellows will be grateful for it old man they ought to be never mind im certain we shall pull through it some day we must hope for the best anyhow and with a brotherly grip of the hand they turned over and went to sleep reginald presented himself at the rocket next morning in an unusual state of trepidation he had half made up his mind to march straight to the managers room and tell him boldly what had happened and take his discharge from him but horace dissuaded him after all he said durfy may think better of it upon my word i hardly know whether i want him to said reginald except for young gedges sake and mothers anyhow ill wait and see if you like mr durfy was there when he arrived bearing no traces of last nights fracas except a scowl and a sneer which deepened as he caught sight of his adversary reginald passed close to his table in order to give him an opportunity of coming to the point at once but to his surprise the overseer took no apparent notice of him and allowed him to go to his place and begin work as usual id sooner see him tearing his hair than grinning like that said young gedge in a whisper you may be sure theres something in the wind whatever it was mr durfy kept his own counsel and though reginald looked up now and then and caught him scowling viciously in his direction he made no attempt at hostilities and rather appeared to ignore him altogether even when he was giving out the copy he sent reginald his by a boy instead of as was usually his practice calling him up to the table to receive it reginalds copy on this occasion consisted of a number of advertisements a class of work not nearly as easy and far less interesting than the paragraphs of news which generally fell to his share however he attacked them boldly and unattractive as they were contrived to get some occupation from them for his mind as well as his hand here for instance was some one who wanted a groom young good looking and used to horses how would that suit him and why need he be goodlooking and what was the use of saying he must be used to horses who ever heard of a groom that wasnt the man who put in that advertisement was a muff here was another of a different sort js come back to your afflicted mother and all shall be forgiven heigho suppose js had got a mother like mrs cruden what a brute he must be to cut away what had he been doing to her robbing her or bullying her or what reginald worked himself into a state of wrath over the prodigal and very nearly persuaded himself to leave out the promise of forgiveness altogether if the young gentleman who dropped an envelope in the putney omnibus on the evening of the th instant will apply to b at grip street he may hear of something to his advantage how some people were born to luck think of making your fortune by dropping an envelope in a putney omnibus how gladly he would pave the floor of every omnibus he rode in with envelopes if only he could thereby hear anything to his advantage he had a great mind to stroll round by number grip street that evening to see who this mysterious b could be to intelligent young men in businessadd l a year to your income without any risk or hindrance whatever to ordinary workapply confidentially to omega shy street liverpool with stamp for reply none but respectable intelligent young men need apply hullo reginald laid down his composingstick and read the advertisement over again and after that he read it again word by word most carefully l a year why that was as much again as his present income and without risk or interfering with his present work too well his present work might be his past work tomorrow but even so with l a year he would be no worse off and of course he could get something else to do as well by way of ordinary work if only he could bring in l a year to the meagre family store what little luxuries might it not procure for his mother what a difference it might make in that dreary poky dull street parlour where she sat all day or if they decided not to spend it but save it up think of a pound a week ready against a rainy day reginald used to have loose enough ideas of the value of money but the last few weeks had taught him lessons and one of them was that a pound a week could work wonders apply confidentially yes of course or else any duffer might snatch at the prize it was considerate too to put it that way for of course it would be awkward for any one in a situation to apply unless he could do it confidentiallyand quite right too to enclose a stamp for a reply no one who wasnt in earnest would do so and thus it would keep out fellows who applied out of mere idle curiosity none but respectable intelligent young men need apply humph reginalds conscience told him he was respectable and he hoped he was also moderately intelligent though opinions might differ on that point omegathat sounded well the man knew greekpossibly he was a classical scholar and therefore sure to be a gentleman oh what a contrast to the cad durfy liverpool ah there was the one drawback and yet of course it did not follow the l a year was to be earned in liverpool otherwise how could it fail to interfere with ordinary business besides why should he advertise in the rocket unless he meant to get applications from londoners altogether reginald was pleased with the advertisement he liked the way it was put and the conditions it imposed and indeed was so much taken up with the study of it that he almost forgot to set it up in type whatever are you dreaming about said young gedge youve stood like that for a quarter of an hour at least youll have durfy after you if you dont mind the name startled reginald into industry and he set the advertisement up very clearly and carefully and reread it once or twice in the type before he could make up his mind to go on to the next the thought of it haunted him all day should he tell horace or gedge or his mother of it should he go and give durfy notice then and there no he would reply to it before he told any one and then if the answer was unsatisfactorywhich he could not think possiblethen no one would be the wiser or the worse for it the day flew on leaden wings gedge put his friends silence down to anxiety as to the consequences of yesterdays adventure and did and said what he could to express his sympathy mr durfy alone sitting at his table and directing sharp glances every now and then in his direction could guess the real meaning of his preoccupation and chuckled to himself as he saw it reginald spent threepence on his way home that eveningone in procuring a copy of the rocket and two on a couple of postagestamps armed with these he walked rapidly home with horace giving him in an absent sort of way a chronicle of the days doings but breathing not a word to him or his mother subsequently about the advertisement after supper he excused himself from joining in the usual walk by saying he had a letter to write and for the first time in his life felt relieved to see his mother and brother go and leave him behind them then he pulled out the newspaper and eagerly read the advertisement once more in print there it was not a bit changed lots of fellows had seen it by this time and some of them very likely were at this moment answering it they shouldnt get the start of him though he sat down and wrote sirhaving seen your advertisement in the rocket i beg to apply for particulars i am respectable and fairly intelligent and am at present employed as compositor in the rocket newspaperoffice i shall be glad to increase my income i am years of age and beg to enclose stamp for a reply to this address yours truly reginald cruden he was not altogether pleased with this letter but it would have to do if he had had any idea what the advertiser wanted intelligent young men for he might have been able to state his qualifications better but what was the use of saying i think i shall suit you when possibly he might not suit after all he addressed the letter carefully and wrote private and confidential on the envelope and then walked out to post it just in time after doing so to meet his mother and horace returning from their excursion well reg have you written your letter said his mother cheerily was it to some old schoolfellow no mother said reginald in a tone which meant i would rather you did not ask me and mrs cruden did not ask i think said she as they stopped at their doori almost think boys we ought to return the shucklefords call its only nine oclock we might go in for a few minutes i know you dont care about it but we must not be rude you know what do you think reg reg sighed and groaned and said if we must we must and so instead of going in at their own door they knocked at the next the tinkle of a piano upstairs and the sound of sams voice audible even in the street announced only too unmistakably that the family was at home and a collection of pot hats and shawls in the hall betrayed the appalling fact when it was too late to retreat that the shucklefords had visitors mrs shuckleford came out and received them with open arms ow appy i am to see you and the boys said she i suppose you saw the extra lights and came in very neighbourly it was we thought about sending you an invite but didnt like while you was in black for your usband but its all the same now youre here very appy to see you jemima my dear come and tell mrs cruden and the boys youre appy to see them sam tooits sams majority mrs cruden twentyone he is today and his pa all overoh ow appy i am youve come we had no idea you had friends said mrs cruden nervously well call again please no you dont mrs cruden said the effusive mrs shuckleford ere you are and ere you staysi am so appy to see you you and i can ave a cosy chat in the corner while the young folk enjoy theirselves jemima put a chair for mrs c alongside o mine and sam take the boys and see they have some one to talk to em the dutiful sam who appeared entirely to share his mothers jubilation at the arrival of these new visitors obeyed the order with alacrity come on young fellows said he just in time for shouting proverbs you go and sit down by miss tomkins horace her in the green frock and you had better go next jemima cruden when i say three and away youve got to shout anythingll do so long as you make a noise no they must shout their right word said miss tomkins a vivacious looking young person of thirty come close said she to horace and ill whisper what youve got to shout whisper dog thats your word horace seated himself dreamily where he was told and received the confidential communication of his partner with pathetic resignation he only wished the signal to shout might soon arrive as for reginald when he felt himself once more in the clutches of the captivating jemima and heard her whisper in his ear the mysterious monosyllable love his heart became as ice within him and he sat like a statue in his chair looking straight before him oh how he hoped omega would give him some occupation for his evenings that would save him from this sort of thing now call them in said sam a signal was accordingly given at the door and in marched a young lady really a pleasant sensiblelooking young person accompanied by a magnificentlyattired young gentleman who to horaces amazement proved to be no other than the melancholy booms there was however no time just now for an exchange of greetings mr booms and his partner were placed standing in the middle of the floor and the rest of the company were seated in a crescent round them there was a pause and you might have heard a pin drop as samuel slowly lifted his hand and said in a stage whisper now then mind what youre at when i say away one two three and a at the last syllable there arose a sudden and terrific shout which sent mrs cruden nearly into a fit and made the looselyhung windows rattle as if an infernal machine had just exploded on the premises the shout was immediately followed by a loud chorus of laughter and cries of well have you guessed it yes i know what it is said the pleasant young lady do you know mr booms no he said sadly how could i guess what is it miss crisp why love me love my dog isnt it right well guessed cried every one and amid the general felicitation that ensued the successful proverbguessers were made room for in the magic circle and horace had a chance of exchanging how dye do with mr booms whod have thought of meeting you here said he in a whisper i didnt expect to meet you said the melancholy one i say cruden please dont mentionher her whom said horace bewildered boomss reply was a mournful inclination of the head in the direction of miss crisp oh i see all right old man youre a lucky fellow i think she looks a jolly sort of girl lucky jolly oh cruden ejaculated his depressed friend why whats wrong said horace dont you think shes nice she is but shuckleford cruden is not hullo you two said the voice of the gentleman in question at this moment you seem jolly thick oh of course shopmates i forgot both in the news line eh now whos for musical chairs dont all speak at once i shall have to play the piano now mr reginald said miss jemima making a last effort to get a word out of her silent companion im afraid youre not enjoying yourself a bit reginald rose instinctively as she did and offered her his arm he was half dreaming as he did so and fancying himself back at garden vale it was to his credit that when he discovered what he was doing he did not withdraw his arm but conducted his partner gallantly to the piano and said im afraid im a bad hand at games musical chairs is great fun said miss jemima i wish i could play it and the piano both you have to run round and round and then when the music stops you flop down on the nearest chair and theres always one left out and the last one wins the game do try it reginald gave a scared glance at the chairs being arranged back to back in a long line down the room and said may i play the piano instead and then you can join in the game what do you play the piano exclaimed the young lady forgetting her dignity and clapping her hands oh my eye what a novelty ma mr reginalds going to play for musical chairs sam do you hear mr cruden plays the piano isnt it fun reginald flung himself with a sigh down on the cracked musicstool music was his one passion and the last few months had been bitter to him for want of it he would go out of his way even to hear a street piano and the brightest moments of his sundays were often those spent within sound of the roll of the organ it was like a snatch of the old life to find his fingers once more laid caressingly on the notes of a piano and as he touched them and began to play the shucklefords the rocket omega all faded from his thoughts and he was lost in his music what a piano it was tinny and cracked and out of tune the music was in the boys soul and it mattered comparatively little he began with webers last waltz and dreamed off from it into a gavotte of corellis and from that into something else calling up favourite after favourite to suit the passing moods of his spirit and feeling happier than he had felt for months but webers last waltz and corellis gavottes are not the music one would naturally select for musical chairs and when the strains continue uninterrupted for five or tenminutes during the whole of which time the company is perambulating round and round an array of empty chairs the effect is somewhat monotonous mrs shucklefords guests trotted round goodhumouredly for some time then they got a little tired then a little impatient and finally samuel as he passed close behind the musicstool gave the performer a dig in the back which had the desired effect of stopping the music suddenly whereupon everybody flopped down on the seat nearest within reach some found vacancies at once others had to scamper frantically round in search of them and finally as the chairs were one fewer in number than the company one luckless player was left out to enjoy the fun of those who remained in all right said samuel when the first round was decided and a chair withdrawn in anticipation of the next i only nudged you to stop a bit sooner cruden the game will last till midnight if you give us such long doses doses reginald turned again to the piano and tried once more to lose himself in its comforting music he played a short german air of only four lines which ended in a plaintive wailing cadence again the moment the music ceased he heard the scuffling and scampering and laughter behind him and shouts of pollys out pollys out i say said shuckleford as they stood ready for the next round give us a jingle cruden pop goes the weasel or something of that sort that last was like the tune the cow died of and stop short in the middle of a line anyhow reginald rose from the piano with flushed cheeks and saidim afraid im not used to this sort of music perhaps miss shuckleford yes jim you play you know the way you change places with jim cruden and come and run round but reginald declined the invitation with thanks and took up a comic paper in which he attempted to bury himself while miss shuckleford hammered out the latest polka on the piano stopping abruptly and frequently enough to finish half a dozen rounds in the time it had taken him to dispose of two fresh games followed and to all except the crudens the evening passed merrily and happily even horace felt the infection of the prevalent goodhumour and threw off the reserve he had at first been tempted to wear in an effort to make himself generally agreeable mrs cruden cooped up in a corner with her loquacious hostess did her best too not to be a damper on the general festivity but reginald made no effort to be other than he felt himself he could not have done it if he had tried but as scarcely any one seemed afflicted on his account even his unsociability failed to make samuel shucklefords majority party anything but a brilliant success in due time supper appeared to crown the evenings delights and after supper a gentleman got up and proposed a toast which of course was the health of the hero of the occasion samuel replied in a facetious county court address in which he expressed himself jolly pleased to see so many friends around him and hoping theyd all enjoyed their evening and that if there were any of them still to come of agelaughtertheyd have as high an old time of it as he had had tonight he was sure ma and jim said ditto to all he said and before he sat down he was very glad to see their new next door neighbours hear hear theyd had their troubles but they could reckon on friends in that room the young fellows were bound to get on if they stuck to their shop and hed like to drink the health of them and their ma cheers the health was drunk mrs cruden looked at reginald horace looked at reginald but reginald looked straight before him and bit his lips and breathed hard whereupon horace rose and said we think it very kind of you to drink our healths and i am sure we are much obliged to you all for doing so which said the shucklefords party broke up and the crudens went home chapter ten will you walk into my parlour said the spider to the fly the two days which followed the despatch of the letter to omega were long and anxious ones for reginald cruden it would have been a great relief to him had he felt free to talk the matter over with horace but somehow that word confidential in the advertisement deterred him for all that he made a point of leaving the paper containing it in his brothers way if by any chance the invitation to an additional l a year might meet his eye had it done so it is doubtful whether reginald would have been pleased for he knew that if it came to selecting one of the two horace would probably pass for quite as respectable and considerably more intelligent a young man than himself still he had no right to stand in his brothers way if fate ordained that he too should be attracted by the advertisement he therefore left the paper lying conspicuously about with the advertisement sheet turned toward the beholder horace however had too much of the rocket in his business hours to crave for a further perusal of it during his leisure he kicked it unceremoniously out of his way the first time he encountered it and when reginald saw it next it was in a mangled condition under the stairs in the suspicious company of the servantgirls cindershovel on the second morning when he arrived at his work a letter lay on his case with the liverpool postmark addressed r cruden esquire rocket office london in his excitement and haste to learn its contents it never occurred to him to notice the unexpected compliment conveyed in the word esquire and he might have remained for ever in blissful ignorance of the fact had not his lefthand neighbour the satirical mr barber considered the occasion a good one for a few flashes of wit ullo esquire ow are you esquire there is somebody knows you then liverpool too thats where all the chaps who rob the till go to r cruden esquiremy eye whats the use of putting any more than london on the envelopesuch a wellknown character as you stuckup idiot to this address reginald attended sufficiently to discover that it was not worth listening to after which he did not even hear the concluding passages of his neighbours declamation being absorbed in far more interesting inquiries he tore the envelope open and hurriedly read siryour favour is to hand and in reply we beg to say we shall be glad to arrange an interview one of our directors will be in town on monday next and can see you between one and two oclock at weavers hotel be good enough to treat this and all further communications as strictly confidentialwe are sir yours faithfully the select agency corporation psask at weavers hotel for mr medlock liverpool the welcome contents of this short note fairly staggered him if the tone of the advertisement had been encouraging that of this letter was positively convincing it was concise businesslike grammatical and courteous since his trouble reginald had never been addressed by any one in the terms of respect conveyed in this communication furthermore the appointment being between one and twothe dinner hourhe would be able to keep it without difficulty or observation particularly as weavers hotel was not a stones throw from the rocket office then again the fact of his letter being from a corporation gratified and encouraged him a select agency corporation was not the sort of company to do things meanly or inconsiderately they were doubtless a select body of men themselves and they required the services of select servants and it was perfectly reasonable that in an affair like this which might lead to nothing strict mutual confidence should be observed supposing in the end he should see reason to decline to connect himself with the corporation reginald liked to think this possible though he felt sure it was not probable why if he had said much about it previously it might be to the prejudice of the corporation finally he thought the name medlock agreeable and was generally highly gratified with the letter and wished devoutly monday would come round quickly the one drawback to his satisfaction was that he was still as far as ever from knowing in what direction his respectable and intelligent services were likely to be required monday came at last when he went up on the saturday to receive his wages he had fully expected to learn mr durfys intentions with regard to him and was duly surprised when that gentleman actually handed him his money without a word and with the faintest suspicion of a smile hes got a nailer on you old man and no mistake said gedge dolefully id advise you to keep your eye open for a new berth if you get the chance and i say if you can only hear of one for two this last appeal went to reginalds heart and he inwardly resolved if mr medlock turned out to be as amiable a man as he took him for to put in a word on gedges behalf as well as his own at the coming interview the dinnerbell that monday tolled solemnly in reginalds ears as he put on a clean collar and brushed his hair previously to embarking on his journey to weavers hotel what change might not have taken place in his lot before that same bell summoned him once more to work he left the rocket a needy youth of l shillings a year was he to return to it passing rich of l shillings weavers hotel was a respectable quiet resort for country visitors in london and reginald as he stood in its homely entrance hall felt secretly glad that the corporation selected a place like this for its london headquarters rather than one of the more showy but less respectable hotels or restaurants with which the neighbourhood abounded mr medlock was in his room the waiter said and mr cruden was to step up he did step up and was ushered into a little sittingroom where a middleaged gentleman stood before the fireplace reading the paper and softly humming to himself as he did so mr cruden sir said the waiter ah mr cruden good morning take a seat john i shall be ready for lunch in about tenminutes reginald with the agitating conviction that his fate would be sealed one way or another in tenminutes obeyed and darted a nervous glance at his new acquaintance he rather liked the looks of him he looked a comfortable welltodo gentleman with rather a handsome face and a manner by no means disheartening mr medlock in turn indulged in a careful survey of the boy as he sat shyly before him trying to look selfpossessed but not man of the world enough to conceal his anxiety or excitement let me see said mr medlock putting his hands in his pocket and leaning against the mantelpiece you replied to the advertisement didnt you yes sir said reginald and what made you think you would suit us well sir stammered reginald you wanted respectable intelligent young menandand i thought ithat is i hoped i might answer that description mr medlock took one hand out of his pocket and stroked his chin have you been in the printing trade long only a few weeks sir what were you doing before that reginald flushed i was at school sirat wilderham wilderham why thats a school for gentlemens sons my father was a gentleman sir said the boy proudly hes dead then said mr medlock that is sad but did he leave nothing behind him he died suddenly sir said reginald speaking with an effort and left scarcely anything did he die in debt you must excuse these questions mr cruden added the gentleman with an amiable smile it is necessary to ask them or i would spare you the trouble he did die in debt said reginald but we were able to pay off every penny he owed and left nothing for yourself when it was done very honourable my lad it will always be a satisfaction to you it is sir said reginald cheering up you naturally would be glad to improve your income how much do you get where you are eighteen shillings a week mr medlock whistled softly eighteen shillings thats very little very poor pay said he i should have thought with your education you could have got more than that it pleased reginald to have his education recognised in this delicate way we had to be thankful for what we could get said he there are so many fellows out of work very true very true said mr medlock shaking his head impressively we had no less than replies to our advertisement reginald gave a gasp what chance had he among competitors mr medlock took a turn or two up and down the room meditating with himself and keeping his eye all the time on the boy yes said he a lot isnt it very sad to think of it very sad said reginald feeling called upon to say something now said mr medlock coming to a halt in his walk in front of the boy i suppose you guess i wouldnt have asked you to call here if i and my fellowdirectors hadnt been pleased with your letter reginald looked pleased and said nothing and now ive seen you and heard what youve got to say i think youre not a bad young fellow but mr medlock paused and reginalds face changed to one of keen anxiety im afraid mr cruden youre not altogether the sort we want the boys face fell sadly i would do my best he said as bravely as he could if youd try me i dont know what the work is yet but im ready to do anything i can humph said mr medlock what we advertise for is sharp agents to sell goods on commission among their friends now do you think you could sell l worth of wine and cigars and that sort of thing every year among your friends youd need to do that to make l a year you know you understand could you go round to your old neighbours and crack up our goods and book their orders and that sort of thing i dont think you could myself it strikes me you are too much of a gentleman reginald sat silent for a moment with the colour coming and going in his cheeks then he looked up and said slowly im afraid i could not do that siri didnt know you wanted that so saying he took up his hat and rose to go mr medlock watched him with a smile if not of sympathy at any rate of approval and when he rose motioned him back to his seat not so fast my man i like your spirit and we may hit it yet reginald resumed his seat with a new interest in his anxious face you wouldnt suit us as a drummerthat is said mr medlock hastily correcting himself as a toutan agent but you might suit us in another way were looking out for a gentlemanly young fellow for secretaryto superintend the concern for the directors and be the medium of communication between them and the agents we want an educated young man and one we can depend upon as to the work thats picked up in a week easily now supposesuppose when i go back to liverpool i were to recommend you for a post like that what would you say reginald was almost too overwhelmed for words he could only stammer oh sir how kind of you the directors would appoint any one i recommended continued mr medlock looking down with satisfaction on the boys eagerness youre young of course but you seem to be honest thats the great thing i think i can promise that said reginald proudly the salary would begin at l a year but we should improve it if you turned out well and you would of course occupy the companys house at liverpool we should not ask for a premium in your case but you would have to put l into the shares of the corporation to qualify you and of course you would get interest on that now said he as reginald began to speak dont be in a hurry take your time and think it well over if you say yes you may consider the thing settled and if you say nowell we shall be able to find some one else ah here comes lunchstop and have some with mebring another plate waiter reginald felt too bewildered to know what to think or say he a secretary of a company with l a year it was nearly intoxicating and for the post spontaneously offered to him in the almost flattering way it had beenthis was more gratifying still in his wildest dreams just now he never pictured himself sitting down as secretary to the select agency corporation to lunch with one of its leading directors mr medlock said no more about business but made himself generally agreeable asking reginald about his father and the old days inquiring as to his mother and brother and all about his friends and acquaintances in london reginald felt he could talk freely to this friend and he did so he confided to him all about mr durfys tyranny about his brothers work at the rocket and even went so far as to drop out a hint in young gedges favour he told him all about wilderham and his schoolfellows there about the books he liked about the way he spent his evenings about dull streetin fact he felt as if he had known mr medlock for years and could talk to him accordingly i declare said that gentleman pulling out his watch after this pleasant talk had been going on a long time its five minutes past two im afraid youll be late reginald started up so i shall id no idea it was so late im afraid i had better go sir well write me a letter to liverpool tomorrow or wednesday at the latest as we must fill up the place soon think it well over good bye my man i hope i shall see you again before long by the way of course you wont talk about all this out of doors oh no said reginald i havent even mentioned it yet at home mr medlock laughed well if you come to liverpool youll have to tell them something about it see heres a list of our directors your mother may recognise some of the names but beyond your mother and brother dont talk about it yet as the corporation is only just starting reginald heartily concurred in this caution and promised to act on it and then after a friendly farewell hastened back to the rocket office the clock pointed nearly a quarter past two when he entered he was not the sort of fellow to slink in when no one was looking in fact he had such a detestation of that sort of thing that he went to the other extreme and marched ostentatiously past mr durfys table as though to challenge his observation if that was his intention he was not disappointed oh said the overseer with a return of the old sneer which had been dormant ever since the night reginald had knocked him down you have come have you and you know the hour do you yes its a quarter past two said reginald is it sneered mr durfy in his most offensive way yes it is replied the boy hotly what did he care for durfy now tomorrow in all probability he would have the satisfaction of walking up to that table and saying mr durfy i leave here on saturday meanwhile he was not disposed to stand any of his insolence but he hardly expected what was coming next very well then you can just put your hat on your head and go back the way you came sir what do you mean said reginald in startled tones mean what i say shouted durfy youre dismissed kicked out and the sooner you go the better so this was the dignified leavetaking to which he had secretly looked forward kicked out and kicked out by durfy reginalds toes tingled at the very thought youve no right to dismiss me for being a few minutes late said he it was durfys turn now to be dignified he went on writing and did his best to affect oblivion of his enemys presence reginald too indignant to know the folly of such an outburst broke out i shall not take my dismissal from you i shall stay here as long as i choose and when i go ill go of my own accord you cad you mr durfy still went on writing with a cheerful smile on his countenance do you hear said reginald almost shouting the words im not going to please you i shall go to please myself i give you notice and thank heaven ive done with you durfy looked up with a laugh go and make that noise outside he said we can do without you here gedge my man put those cases beside you back into the rack and go and tell the porter hes wanted the mention of gedges name cowed reginald in an instant and in the sudden revulsion of feeling which ensued he was glad enough to escape from the room before fairly breaking down under a crushing sense of injury mortification and helplessness gedge was at the door as he went out oh cruden he whispered what will become of me now wait for me outside at seven oclock please do that afternoon reginald paced the streets more like a hunted beast than a human being all the bad side of his naturehis pride his conceit his selfishnesswas stirred within him under a bitter sense of shame and indignity he forgot how much his own intractable temper and stupid selfimportance had contributed to his fall and could think of nothing but durfys triumph and the evil fate which at the very moment when he was able to snap his fingers in the tyrants face had driven him forth in disgrace with the tyrants fingers snapped in his face he had not spirit or resolution enough to wait to see gedge or any one that evening but slunk away hating the sight of everybody and wishing only he could lose himself and forget that such a wretch as reginald cruden existed ah reginald its a long race to escape from oneself men have tried it before now with better reason than you and failed wait till you have something worse to run from my honest foolish friend face round like a man and stand up to your pursuer you have hit out straight from the shoulder before today do it again now one smart round will finish the business for this false reginald is a poor creature after all and you can knock him out of time and over the ropes with one hand if you like try it and save your running powers for an uglier foeman some other day reginald did fight it out with himself as he walked mile after mile that afternoon through the london streets and by the time he reached home in the evening he was himself again he met his mothers tears and horaces dismal looks with a smile of triumph so youve heard all about it have you said he oh reginald said his mother in deep distress how grieved i am for you you neednt be mother said reginald for ive got another situation far better and worth three times as much and then he told them as far as he felt justified in doing so of the advertisement and what it had led to finishing up with a glowing description of mr medlock whom he only regretted he had not had the courage to ask up to tea that very evening but there was a cloud on the bright horizon which his mother and horace were quicker to observe than he but reg said the latter surely it means youd have to go to liverpool yes im afraid it does thats the one drawback but surely you wont accept it then said the younger brother reginald looked up horaces tone if not imperious had not been sympathetic and it jarred on him in the fulness of his projects to encounter an obstacle why not he replied its all very well for you in your snug berth but i must get a living mustnt i i should have thought something might turn up in london persisted horace things dont turn up as we want them said reginald tartly look here horace you surely dont suppose i prefer to go to liverpool to staying here of course not said horace beginning to whistle softly to himself it was a bad omen and mrs cruden knew it come said she cheerily we must make the best of it these names reg in the list of directors mr medlock gave you seem all very respectable do you know any of them asked reginald mr medlock thought you might i know one or two by name replied she theres the bishop of s i see and major wakeman who i suppose is the officer who has been doing so well in india theres a member of parliament too i see it seems a good set of directors of course they arent likely all to turn up at board meetings said reginald with an explanatory air i dont see myself what business a bishop has with a select agency corporation said horace determined not to see matters in a favourable light my dear fellow said reginald trying hard to keep his temper i cant help whether you see it or not by the way mother about the l to invest i think mr richmond mrs cruden started this exciting news said she drove it out of my head for the moment boys i am very sorry to say i had a note today stating that mr richmond was taken ill while in france and is dead he was one of our few old friends and it is a very sad blow she was right the crudens never stood in greater need of a wise friend than they did now chapter eleven reginald takes his fate into his own hands the next day reginald wrote and accepted the invitation of the directors of the select agency corporation he flattered himself he was acting deliberately and after fully weighing the pros and cons of the question true he still knew very little about his new duties and had yet to make the acquaintance of the bishop of s and the other directors but on the other hand he had seen mr medlock and heard what he had to say and was quite satisfied in his own mind that everything was all right and greatest argument of all he had no other place to go to and l a year was a salary not to be thrown away when put into ones hands still he felt a trifle uncomfortable about the necessity of going to liverpool and breaking up the old home of course he could not help himself and horace had no right to insinuate otherwise all the same it was a pity and if there had not been the compensating certainty of being able to send up regular contributions to the family purse which would help his mother to not a few comforts hitherto denied he would have been more troubled still about it what will you do about the l said horace next day forcing himself to appear interested in what he inwardly disapproved oh said reginald id intended to ask richmond to lend it me its not exactly a loan either it would be the same as his investing in the company in my name the money would be safe and hed get his interest into the bargain but of course i cant go to him now no and i dont know whom else you could ask said horace they might let me put in a pound a week out of my salary said reginald that would still leave me two pounds a week and of that i could send home at least twentyfive shillings horace mused it seems to me rather queer to expect you to put the money in said he it may be queer but its their rule mr medlock says and whatever does the corporation do its precious hazy to my mind i cant tell you anything about it now said reginald the concern is only just started and i have promised to treat all mr medlock told me as confidential but im quite satisfied in my mind and you may be too horace horace did not feel encouraged to pursue the discussion after this and went off alone to work in low spirits and feeling unusually dismal by the way said reginald as he started bring young gedge home with you i meant to see him last night but forgot reginald spent the day uneasily for himself and his mother in trying to feel absolutely satisfied with the decision he had come to and in speculating on his future work towards afternoon weary of being all day in the house he went out for a stroll it was a beautiful day and the prospect of a walk in the park by daylight was a tempting one as he was passing down piccadilly he became aware of some one approaching him whom he knew and whom in another moment he recognised as blandford there was some excuse certainly for not taking in his old schoolfellows identity all at once for the boy he had known at wilderham only a few months ago had suddenly blossomed forth into a man and had exchanged the airy bearing of a schoolboy for the halflanguid swagger of a man about town hullo bland old man exclaimed reginald lighting up jubilantly at the sight of an old familiar face how are you who would have thought of seeing you blandford was surprised too and for a moment critically surveyed the boy in front of him before he replied ah cruden that you i shouldnt have known you reginalds face fell he became suddenly aware and for the first time in his life that his clothes were shabby and that his boots were in holes i shouldnt have known you he replied you look so much older than when i saw you last so i am but i say added bland reddening as an acquaintance passed and nodded to him im rather in a hurry cruden just now if youre not engaged this evening come and dine with me at seven at the shades and we can have a talk goodbye and he went on hurriedly leaving reginald with an uncomfortable suspicion that if hereginaldhad been more smartly dressed and had worn gloves and a tall hat the interview would have been more cordial and less hasty however the longing he felt for the old happy days that were past decided him to appear at the shades at the hour appointed although it meant absence from home on one of his few remaining evenings and still more a further desertion of young gedge he repented of his resolution almost as soon as he had made it what was to be gained by assuming a false position for an evening and trying to delude himself into the notion that he was the equal of his old comrade did not his clothes his empty pockets the smart of durfys tongue and even the letter now on its way to mr medlock all disprove it and yet three months ago he was a better man all round than blandford who had been glad to claim his friendship and accept his fathers hospitality reginald rebelled against the idea that they two could still be anything to one another than the friends they had once been but all the while the old school saw came back into his mindthat imposition sentence he had in his day written out hundreds of times without once thinking of its meaning tempora mutantur et nos mutamur in illis he reached the shades a few minutes before seven and waited outside till his friend arrived he had not to wait long for blandford and a couple of companions drove up punctually in a hansomall of them to reginalds horror being arrayed in full evening dress hullo cruden youve turned up then said blandford what not in regimentals you usent to be backward in that way never mind they say dress after seven oclock here but theyre not strict we can smuggle you in oh how reginald wished he was safe back in dull street by the way continued blandford these are two friends of mine crudenmr shanklin and mr pillans crudens an old wilderham fellow you know he added in an explanatory aside the gentleman introduced as mr shanklin stared curiously at reginald for a few seconds and then shook hands had the boy known as much of that gentleman as the reader does he would probably have displayed considerably more interest in his new acquaintance than he did as it was he would have been glad of an excuse to avoid shaking hands with either him or his emptyheaded companion mr pillans he went through the ceremony as stiffly as possible and then followed the party within now then said blandford as they sat down at one of the tables what do you say itll save trouble to take the table dhote eh are you game you fellows table dhote for four waiter what shall we have to drink i say hock to start with i wont take any wine said reginald with an effort why not youre not a teetotaler are you i wont take any wine repeated reginald decisively and to his satisfaction he was allowed to do as he pleased the dinner passed as such entertainments usually do diminishing in interest as it went on in his happiest days reginald always hated what the boys used to call feeds and he found that three months altered circumstances had by no means reconciled him to the infliction he shirked the last two or three courses and grew heartily tired of the sight of a plate you wondered how i came to be in town said blandford the fact is my uncle went off the hooks a few weeks ago and as im his heir you know i came up and havent gone back yet i dont think i shall either no whats the use with the pot of money youve come in for said mr shanklin youre far more comfortable up in town yes and youre a nice boy to show a fellow about town said blandford laughing wilderhams all very well you know cruden continued he but its a grind being cooped up there when youve got your chance of a fling well youve not wasted your chances my boy said mr pillans who besides being emptyheaded was unhealthy in complexion and red about the eyes blandford appeared rather flattered than otherwise by this observation and told mr pillans to shut up and not tell tales out of school i suppose wilderham hasnt changed much since last term asked reginald wistfully oh no plenty of fellows left and new ones comerather a better lot take them all round than we had last term has the football club been doing well again asked the old boy oh middling by the way the fellows growled rather when you only sent them halfasov instead of a sov reginald coloured up little his comrade knew what that halfsovereign had cost him he relapsed into silence and had to derive what compensation he could from the fast talk in which the other three engaged apparently heedless of his presence in due time the meal ended and blandford called for the bills until that moment reginald had never imagined for a moment but that he had been dining as his old schoolfellows guest he had understood blandfords request of his company as an invitation and as an invitation he had accepted it and as an invitation he had repented of it what then was his embarrassment to find a bill for six shillings and sixpence laid down before him as his share of the entertainment for a moment a flush of relief passed across his face he was glad not to find himself under obligations to blandford after all but in another moment relief was changed to horror as he remembered that three shillings was all the money he had about him oh the humiliation the anguish of this discovery he would have had anything happen rather than this he sat staring at the bill like a being petrified come along said blandford lets go to the smokingroom i suppose you fellows will have coffee there coffee for four waiter are you ready but reginald did not move nor did the waiter whats the row said blandford to the latter the waiter pointed to reginalds bill oh hes waiting for your bill cruden look sharp old man the colour came and went in reginalds face as though he had been charged with some hideous crime and it seemed like a deliberate mockery of his trouble that his three companions and the waiter stood silent at the table eyeing him and waiting for his answer im sorry he said at length bringing up the words with a tremendous effort i find ive not money enough to pay it i made a mistake in coming here all four listeners stood with faces of mingled amazement and amusement at the boys agitation and the tragic manner in which he accounted for it any one else would have carried it off with a jest but to reginald it was like passing through the fire would you mindmay i trouble youthat is will you lend me threeand sixpence blandford he said at last blandford burst out laughing i thought at least youd swallowed a silver spoon said he here waiter ill settle that bill how much is it no said reginald laying down his three shillings if you can lend me threeandsixpence thats all i want bosh said blandford pitching half a sovereign to the waiter take it out of that and this coffee too and come along into the smoking room you fellows reginald would fain have escaped but the horrid dread of being suspected of caring more about his dinner than his company deterred him and he followed dejectedly to the luxurious smokingroom of the shades he positively refused to touch the coffee or the cigar even though blandford took care to remind him they had been paid for nor except when spoken to could he bring himself to open his lips or take part in the general talk blandford however who ever since the incident of the bill seemed to consider himself entitled to play a patronising part towards his schoolfellow continued to keep him from lapsing into obscurity wheres your brother living he asked presently hes in town too said reginald my mother and he and i live together where id like to call on your mother we live in dull street said reginald beginning in sheer desperation to pluck up heart and hang out no more false colours dull street thats rather a shady locality isnt it said mr pillans reginald rounded on him blandford might have a right to catechise him but what business was it of this numbskulls where he lived youre not obliged to go there he said with a curl of his lip unless you like mr shanklin smiled at this sally a demonstration which considerably incensed the not too amiable mr pillans ill take precious care i dont said the latter reginald said thanks drily and in a way so cutting that mr shanklin and blandford both laughed this time look here said the unwholesome pillans looking very warm what do you say that for do you want to cheek me dont be a fool pillans it doesnt matter to you where he lives said blandford thank goodness it dontor whether he pays his rent either its a pity you had to leave garden vale said blandford apparently anxious to turn the conversation into a more pacific channel such a jolly place it was what do you do with yourself all day long in town reginald smiled i work for my living said he keeping his eye steadily fixed on mr pillans as if waiting to catch the first sign of an insult on his part thats what we all do more or less said mr shanklin blandford here works like a nigger to spend his money dont you old man i do so said blandford with your valuable assistance and with somebody elses assistance too said mr pillans with a shrug in the direction of reginald reginald understood the taunt and rose to his feet youre not going said blandford i am i dont forget i owe you for my dinner blandford and i shant forget that i owe you also for introducing me to a blackguard good night and without allowing his hearers time to recover from the astonishment into which these words had thrown them he marched out of the shades with his head in the air it was a minute before any of the three disconcerted companions could recover the gift of speech at last mr shanklin burst out into a laugh capital that was he said theres something in the fellow and he added internally and not in the hearing of either of his companions if hes the same fellow medlock has hooked our fortunes made all very well said pillans but he called me a blackguard this simple discovery caused still greater merriment at the expense of the outraged owner of the appellation ive a good mind to go after him and pull his nose growled he nothing would please him better said blandford but youd better leave your own nose behind my boy before you start or there wont be much of it left i know cruden of old you wont see much more of him now sneered pillans now he owes you for his dinner it strikes me bland was never safer of a sixandsix in his life than he is of the one he lent tonight said mr shanklin unless im mistaken the fellow would walk across england on his bare feet to pay it back mr shanklin it was evident could appreciate honesty in any one else he was highly delighted with what he had seen of the new secretary if anything could float the select agency corporation the lads unsuspicious honesty would do it in fact things were looking up all round for the precious confederates with reginald to supply them with honesty with easygoing spendthrifts like blandford and pillans to supply them with money and with a cad like durfy to do their dirty work for them they were in as comfortable and hopeful a way as the promoters of such an enterprise could reasonably hope to be the trio at the shades soon forgot reginald in the delights of one anothers sweet society they played billiards at which mr shanklin won they also played cards at which by a singular coincidence mr shanklin won too they then went to call on a friend who knew the straight tip for the saint leger and under his advice they laid out a good deal of money which such are the freaks of fortune also found its way somehow into mr shanklins pocketbook finally they supped together and then went home to bed each one under the delusion that he had spent a very pleasant evening reginald was far from sharing the same opinion as he paced home that evening how glad he should be to be out of this hateful london where everything went wrong and reminded him that he was a pauper dependent on others for his living for his clothes for hisfaugh for his dinner happily he had not to endure it much longer at liverpool he would be independent he would hold a position not degrading to a gentleman he would associate with men of intellect and breeding he would even have the joy of helping his mother to many a little luxury which as long as he remained in london he could never have given her he quickened his pace and reached home gedge had been there spiritless and forlorn and had left as soon as he could excuse himself out of sight out of mind he had said with a forced laugh to horace when the latter expressed his regret at reginalds absence mrs cruden and horace both tried to look cheerful but the cloud on the horizon was too large now to be covered with a hand when reginald announced that he had written and accepted the invitation to liverpool there was no jubilation no eager congratulation what shall we do without you said mrs cruden it is horrid having to go mother said the boy but we must make the best of it if you look so unhappy i shall be sorry i ever thought of it his mother tried to smile and said yes we must try and make the best of it dear boys and if we cannot seem as glad as we should like to be its not to be wondered at at first is it i hope youll get holidays enough now and then to run up said horace oh yes i dont fancy therell be much difficulty about that replied reg in fact its possible i may have to come up now and then on business there was a silence for a few seconds and then he added rather nervously by the way mother about the l i had intended to ask mr richmond to advance it although i should have hated to do so but now i was wonderingdo you think there would be any objection to taking it out of our money and letting it be invested in my name in the corporation it really wouldnt make any difference for youd get exactly the same interest for it as you got through mr richmond and of course the principal would belong to you too i see no objection said mrs cruden its our common stock and if we can use it for the common good so much the better thanks said reginald if you wouldnt mind sending a line to mr richmonds clerk tomorrow he could let me have the cheque to take down or monday with me the three days that followed were dismal ones for the three crudens there are few miseries like that of an impending separation we wish the fatal moment to arrive and end our suspense we know of a thousand things we want to say but the time slips by wasted and hangs drearily on our hands we have not the spirit to look forward or the heart to look back we long to have it all over and yet every stroke of the clock falls like a cruel knell on our ears we long that we could fall asleep and wake to find ourselves on the other side of the crisis we dread so it was with the crudens and when at last the little trio stood on the monday on the platform of euston station all three felt that they would give anything to have the last few days back again ill write mother as often as ever i can said reginald trying to speak as if the words did not stick in his throat tell us all about your quarters and what you have to do and all that said horace mrs cruden had no words she stood with her eyes fixed on her boy and felt she needed all her courage to do that steadily horrors said reg as the guard locked the carriage door and the usual silence which precedes the blowing of the whistle ensued keep your eye on young gedge will you theres a good fellow i will and ill but here the whistle sounded and amid the farewells that followed reginald went out into his new world leaving them behind straining their eyes for a last look but little dreaming how and when that little family should meet again chapter twelve horace learns an art pays a bill and lends a helping hand i say cruden said waterford to horace one morning shortly after reginalds departure from london i shall get jealous if you dont pull up jealous of me said horace whatever for why before you came i flattered myself i was a bit of a dab at the scissorsandpaste business but youve gone and cut me out completely what rot said horace laughing theres more than enough cutting out to do with the morning papers to leave any time for operating on you besides any duffer can do work like that thats all very well said waterford theres only one duffer here that can do as much as me and booms put together and thats you now if you werent such a racehorse id propose to you to join our shorthand class youll have to learn it some time or other you know the very thing id like said horace that is he added if it wont take up all a fellows evenings how often are the classes well as often as we like generally once a week boomss washerwoman whatever has she to do with shorthand asked horace more than you think my boy she always takes eight days to wash his collars and cuffs he sends them to her on wednesdays and gets them back on the next day week so that we always practise shorthand on the wednesday evening dont we booms he inquired as the proud owner of that name entered the office at that moment there you are sighed he how do i know what you are talking about i was saying we always worked up our shorthand on wednesday evenings if you say so said the melancholy one it must be so i was telling cruden he might join us this winter very well said the other resignedly but where are you going to meet mrs megson has gone away and weve no reader bother you booms for always spotting difficulties in a thing you see added he to horace we used to meet at a good ladys house who kept a day school she let us go there one evening a week and read aloud to us for us to take it down in shorthand shes gone now bad luck to her and the worst of it is were bound to get a lady to take us in as weve got ladies in our class you see at the mention of ladies booms groaned deeply why i tell you what said horace struck by a brilliant idea what should you say to my mother i think she would be delighted and if you want a good reader aloud shes the very woman for you waterford clapped his friend enthusiastically on the back youre a trump cruden to lend us your mother isnt he booms oh yes said booms ive seen her and here he appeared to undergo a mental strugglei like her at any rate ill sound her on the matter by the way shell want to know who the ladies are itll only be one this winter im afraid said waterford as the megsons have gone its a miss crisp cruden a friend of boomss who whom i met the other night at the shucklefords said horace booms answered the question with such an agonised sigh that both his companions burst out laughing dear old booms can tell you more about her than i can said waterford all i know is shes a very nice girl indeed i agree with you said horace im sure she is you think so too dont you booms you dont know what i think said booms which was very true one difficulty still remained and this appeared to trouble horace considerably he did not like to refer to it as long as the melancholy masher was present but as soon as he had gone in to fetch the papers horace inquired of his friend i say waterford do you mean to say he chooses the very night he hasnt got a high collar to hush cried waterford mysteriously its a sore question with him but he couldnt write if he had one we never mention it though it is needless to say mrs cruden fell in most cordially with the new proposal she needed little persuasion to induce her to agree to a plan which meant the bright presence of her son and his friends in her house and it gave her special satisfaction to find her services on such occasions not only invited but indispensable and it is doubtful whether any of the party looked forward more eagerly to the cheery wednesday evenings than she did it was uphill work of course for horace at first in fact during the first evening he could do nothing but sit and admire the pace at which miss crisp followed more haltingly by booms and waterford took down the words of ivanhoe as fast as mrs cruden read them but by dint of hard unsparing practice he was able a week later to make some sort of a show and as the lessons went on he even had the delight of finding himself as waterford said in the running with his fellow scholars this success was not achieved without considerable determination on the boys part but horace when he did take a thing up went through with it he gave himself no relaxation for the first week or two every evening after supper he produced his pencil and paper and his mother produced her book and for two steady hours the work went on even at the office in the intervals of work he reported everything his ears could catch not excepting the melancholy utterances of booms and the vulgar conversation of the errandboy one day the subeditor summoned him to the inner room to give him some instructions as to a letter to be written when the boy much astonished his chief by taking a note of every word and producing the letter in a few moments in the identical language in which it had been dictated you know shorthand then inquired the mild subeditor yes sir a little i did not know of this before no sir i only began lately booms and waterford and i are all working it up the subeditor said nothing just then but in future availed himself freely of the new talent of his juniors and what was still more satisfactory it was intimated not many days later to horace from headquarters that as he appeared to be making himself generally useful the nominal wages at which he had been admitted would be increased henceforth to twentyfour shillings a week this piece of good fortune was most opportune for now that reginalds weekly contribution was withdrawn and pending the payment of his first quarters salary at christmas the family means had been sorely reduced and horace and his mother had been hard put to it to make both ends meet even with this augmented pay it might still have been beyond accomplishment had not their income been still further improved in a manner which horace little suspected and which had he known would have sorely distressed him mrs cruden between whom and the bright miss crisp a pleasant friendship had sprung up had almost the first time the two ladies found themselves together inquired of her new acquaintance as to the possibility of finding any light employment for herself during the hours when she was alone miss crisp as it happened did know of some work though hardly to be called light work which she herself having just at present other duties on hand had been obliged to decline this was the transcribing of the manuscript of a novel written by a lady in a handwriting so enigmatical that the publishers would not look at it unless presented in a legible form the lady was therefore anxious to get it copied out and had offered miss crisp a small sum for the service mrs cruden clutched eagerly at the opportunity thus presented the work was laborious and dreary in the extreme for the story was long and insipid and the wretched handwriting danced under her eyes till they ached and grew weak but she persevered boldly and for three hours a day pored over her selfimposed task when horace returned at evening no trace of it was to be seen only the pale face and weary eyes of his mother who yet was ready with a smile to read aloud as long as the boy wished and pretend that she only enjoyed a labour which was really taxing her both in health and eyesight reginald had written home once or twice since his departure but none of his letters had contained much news he said very little either about his work or his employers but from the dismal tone in which he drew comparisons between london and liverpool and between his present loneliness and days before their separation it was evident enough he was homesick in a letter to horace he said i get precious little time just now for anything but work and what i do get i dont know a soul here to spend it with theres a football club here but of course i cant join it i go walks occasionally though i cant get far as i cannot be away from here for long at a time and never of an evening you might send me a rocket now and then or something to read what about young gedge see durfy doesnt get hold of him could you ever scrape up sixandsix and pay it for me to blandford whose address i give below its something he lent me for a particular purpose when i last saw him do try i would enclose it but till christmas i have scarcely enough to keep myself i wish they would pay weekly instead of quarterly i would be awfully obliged if you would manage to pay the sixandsix somehow or other if you do see he gets it and knows it comes from me and send me a line to say he has got it dont forget theres a brick love to mother and young gedge i wish i could see you all this minute horace felt decidedly blue after receiving this letter and purposely withheld it from his mother had he been sure reginald was prosperous and happy in his new work this separation would not have mattered so much but all along he had had his doubts on both these points and the letter only confirmed them at any rate he determined to lose no time in easing his brothers mind of the two chief causes of his anxiety the very next saturday he appropriated sixandsix of his slender wages and devoted the evening to finding out blandfords rooms and paying him the money fortunately his man was at home an unusual circumstance at that hour of the night and due solely to the fact that he and pillans his fellow lodger were expecting company indeed the pageboy for our two gay sparks maintained a tiger between them showed horace up the moment he arrived under the delusion that he was one of the guests blandford and his friend sitting in state to receive their distinguished visitors among whom were to be the real owner of a racehorse a real jockey a real actor and a real winemerchant these openhearted and knowing young men were considerably taken aback to find a boy of horaces age and toilet ushered into their august presence blandford would have preferred to appear ignorant of the identity of the intruder but horace left him no room for that amiable fraud hullo bland said he just as if he had seen him only yesterday at wilderham what a jolly lot of stairs you keep in this place i thought i should never smoke you out how are you old man and before the horrified dandy could recover from his surprise he found his hand being warmly shaken by his old schoolfellow horace sublimely unconscious of the impression he was creating indulged in a critical survey of the apartment and said snug little crib youve gotnot quite so jolly though as the old study you and reg had at wilderham hows harker by the way and he proceeded to stroll across the room to look at a picture blandford and pillans exchanged glances wrath was in the face of the one bewilderment in the face of the other whos your friend whispered the latter an old schoolfellow who nice lot of fellows you seem to have been brought up with upon my word said mr pillans i suppose hell be up for christmas pursued horace jolly glad i shall be to see him too i say why dont you come and look us up the mater would be awfully glad though weve not very showy quarters to ask you to ah thats one of the prints you had in the study at school do you remember reg chipping that corner of the frame with a singlestick excuse me cruden began blandford in a severe tone my friend and i are just expecting company are you well i couldnt have stayed if youd asked me are any of the old school lot coming the fact is we can do without you young fellow said mr pillans horace stared it had not occurred to him till that moment that his old schoolfellow could be anything but glad to see him and he didnt believe it now will harker be coming he inquired ignoring mr pillans presence no no one you know is coming said blandford half angrily half nervously thats a pity id have liked to see some of the old lot ever since we came to grief none of them has been near us except harker he called one day like a brick but he wont be up again till christmas goodnight said blandford his tone was quite lost on horace goodnight old man by the way regyou know hes up in the north nowasked me to pay you sixandsix he owed you he said youd know about it is it all right blandford coloured up violently im not going to take it i told him so said he oh yes you are you old humbug said horace so catch hold a debts a debt you know its not a debt said blandford i gave it to him so goodnight no that wont do said horace he doesnt think so the fact is the beggar couldnt pay for his own dinner and blandford had to pay it for him he managed it very neatly said mr pillans horace fired up fiercely what do you mean whos this cad you keep about the place blandford if you dont go ill kick you down the stairs cried mr pillans by this time in a rage horace laughed mr pillans was his senior in years and his superior in inches but there was nothing in his unhealthy face to dismay the sturdy schoolboy do you want me to try shouted mr pillans not unless you like replied horace putting the money down on the table and holding out his hand to blandford the latter took it mechanically too glad to see his visitor departing to offer any obstacle ill look you up again some day said horace when your bulldog here is chained up when reg and harker are up this christmas we must all get a day together goodnight and he made for the door brushing up against the outraged mr pillans on his way take that for an impudent young beggar said the latter as he passed suiting the action to the word with a smart cuff directed at the visitors head horace however was quick enough to ward it off i thought youd try that on he said with a laugh youre but mr pillans who had by this time worked himself into a fury by a method known only to himself cut short further parley by making a desperate rush at him just as he reached the door the wary horace had not played football for three seasons for nothing he quietly ducked allowing his unscientific assailant to overbalance himself and topple head first on the lobby outside at the particular moment when the real owner of the racehorse and the real winemerchant who had just arrived reached the top of the stairs hullo young fellow said the sporting gentleman practising croppers are you or getting up an appetite or what high old times youre having up here among you whos the kid stop him gasped pillans picking himself up dont let him go hold him fast the winemerchant obligingly took possession of horace by the collar and the company returned in solemn procession to the room now then said horaces captor whats the row lets hear all about it has he been collaring any of your spoons or setting the house on fire or what who is he hes cheeked me said pillans brushing the dust off his coat hold him fast will you till i take it out of him but the horseracer was far too much of a sportsman for that no no said he laughing make a mill of it and im your man ill bet two to one on the young un to start with the winemerchant said he would go double that on pillans whereupon the sporting man offered a fivepound note against a halfsovereign on his man and called out to have the room cleared and a sponge brought in how far his scientific enthusiasm would have been rewarded it is hard to say for blandford at this juncture most inconsiderately interposed no no said he im not going to have the place made a cockpit shut up pillans and dont make an ass of yourself and you cruden cut off what did you ever come here for see what a row youve made it wasnt i made the row said horace im awfully sorry bland id advise you to cut that friend of yours i say hes an idiot goodbye and while the horseracer and the winemerchant were still discussing preliminaries and mr pillans was privately ascertaining whether his nose was bleeding horace departed in peace partly amused partly vexed and decidedly of opinion that blandford had taken to keeping very queer company since he last saw him the great thing was that horace could now write and report to reg that the debt had been paid his way home led him past the rocket office it was halfpast ten and the place looked dark and deserted even the lights in the editors windows were out and the late hands had gone home just at the corner horace encountered gedge one of the late hands in question hullo young un he said going home yes im going home said young gedge i heard from my brother yesterday he was asking after you was he said the boy halfsarcastically he does remember my name then whatever do you mean of course he does said horace you know that well enough i shouldnt have known it unless youd told me said gedge with a cloud on his face hes never sent me a word since he left hes been awfully busyhes scarcely had time to write home i say young un whats the row with you what makes you so queer oh i dont know said the boy wearily i used to fancy somebody cared for me but i was mistaken i was going to the dogs fast enough when cruden came here i pulled up then because i thought hed stand by me but now hes gone and forgotten all about me illwell theres nothing to prevent me going to the bad and i may as well make up my mind to it no no said horace taking his arm kindly you mustnt say that young un the last words reg said to me when he went off were keep your eye on young gedge dont forget the very last words and hes reminded me of my promise in every letter since ive been a cad i know not to see more of you but you mustnt go thinking that youve no friends if it were only for regs sake id stick to you dont blame him though for i know he thinks a lot about you and it would break his heart if you went to the bad of course you can help going to the bad old man we can all help it the boy looked up with the clouds half brushed away from his face i dont want to go to the bad said he but i sort of feel im bound to go unless some one sticks up for me im so awfully weakminded im not fit to be trusted alone hullo i say whispered horace suddenly stopping short in his walk whos that fellow sneaking about there by the editors door he looks precious like durfy said gedge i believe it is he what does he want there i wonderhe wasnt on the late shift to night was he no he went at seven i dont see what he wants hanging about when everybodys gone said horace unless hes screwed and cant get homeive known him like that that fellows not screwed though he added see hes heard some one coming and hes off steady enough on his legs rum said horace it looked like durfy too never mind whoever it is weve routed him out this time goodnight old man dont go down on your luck mind and dont go abusing reg behind his back and dont forget youre booked to come home to supper with me on monday and see my mother tata chapter thirteen the new secretary takes the reins it is high time to return to reginald whom we left in a somewhat dismal fashion straining his eyes for a last sight of his mother and brother as they waved farewell to him on the euston platform if the reader expects me to tell him that on finding himself alone our hero burst into tears or broke out into repentant lamentations or wished himself under the wheels of the carriage im afraid he will be disappointed reginald spent the first halfhour of his solitary journey in speculating how the oil in the lamp got round at the wick he considered the matter most attentively and kept his eyes fixed on the dim light until london was miles behind him and the hedges and grey autumn fields on either hand proclaimed the country then his mind abandoned its problems and for another halfhour he tried with all his might to prevent the beat of the engine taking up the rhythm of one of the old wilderham cricket songs that too he gave up eventually and let his imagination wander at large over those happy school days when all was merry when every friend was a brick and every exertion a sport when the future beckoned him forward with coaxing hand what grand times they were should he ever forget the last cricket match of the summer term when he bowled three men in one over and made the hardest catch on record in the wilderham close he and blandford ah blandford his mind swerved on the points here and branched off into the recollection of that illstarred dinner at the shades and the unhealthy bloated face of the cad pillans how he would have liked to knock the idiot down just as he had knocked durfy down that night when young gedge ah another point here and another swerve would horace be sure and keep his eye on the young un and was there any chance of getting him down to liverpool once more a swerve and this time into a straight reach of meditation for miles and miles ahead he thought of everything he pictured his own little office and livingroom he drew a mental portrait of the housekeeper and the cups and saucers he would use at his wellearned meals he made up his mind the boardroom would be furnished in green leather and that the bishop of s would be a jolly sort of fellow and fond of his joke he even imagined what the directors would say among themselves respecting himself after he had been introduced and made his first impression at any rate they should not say he lacked in interest for their affairs and when he wrote home ah this was the last of all the points and his thoughts after that ran on the same lines till the train plunged into the smoke and gloom of the great city which was henceforth to extend to him its tender mercies if reginald had reckoned on a deputation of directors of the select agency corporation to meet their new secretary at the station he was destined to be disappointed there were plenty of people there but none concerning themselves with him as he dragged his carpetbag from under the seat and set foot on the platform the bag was very heavy and shy street so he was told was tenminutes walk from the station it did occur to him that most secretaries of companies would take a cab under such circumstances and charge it to general expenses but he did not care to spend either the corporations money or his own for so luxurious a purpose and therefore gripped his bag manfully and wrestled with it out into the street the tenminutes grew to considerably more than twenty before they both found themselves in shy street a long oldfashioned dismal street it was with some shops in the middle and small offices at either end no imposinglooking edifice chaste in architecture and luxurious in proportions stood with open doors to receive its future lord reginald and his bag stumbled up a side staircase to the first floor over a chemists shop where a door with the name medlock loomed before him and told him he had come to his journeys end waiting a moment to wipe the perspiration from his face he turned the handle and found himself in a large bare carpetless room with a table and a few chairs in the middle of it a clock over the chimneypiece a few directories piled up in one corner and a bundle of circulars and wrappers in another and a little back room screened off from the general observation with the word private on the door such was the impression formed in reginalds mind by a single glance round his new quarters in the flutter of his first entrance however he entirely overlooked one important piece of furniturenamely a small boy with long lank hair and pale blotched face who was sitting on a low stool near the window greedily devouring the contents of a pinkcovered periodical this young gentleman on becoming aware of the presence of a stranger crumpled his paper hurriedly into his pocket and rose to his feet what do yer want he demanded is mr medlock here asked reginald no fear replied the boy has he left any message dont know who you are whats yer name im mr cruden the new secretary oh youre im are yer yes youve got to address them there envellups and ell be up in the morning this was depressing reginalds castles in the air were beginning to tumble about his ears in rapid succession the bare room he could excuse on the ground that the corporation was only just beginning its operations doubtless the carpet was on order and was to be delivered soon he could even afford not to afflict himself much about this vulgar irreverent little boy who was probably put in as they put in a little watchdog to see to the place until he and his staff of assistants rendered his further presence unnecessary but it did chill him to find that after his long journey and his farewell to his own home no one should think it worth while to be here to meet him and install him with common friendliness into his new quarters however mr medlock was a man of business and was possibly prevented by circumstances over which he had no control from being present to receive him wheres the housekeeper demanded he putting down his bag and relieving himself of his overcoat ousekeeper oh yus said the boy with a snigger no ousekeepers ere where are my rooms then asked reginald beginning to think it a pity the corporation had brought him down all that way before they were ready for him aint this room big enough for yer said the boy aint no more sep your bedroomno droringrooms in this shop show me the bedroom said reginald the boy shuffled to the door and up another flight of stairs at the head of which he opened the door of a very small room about the size of one of the wilderham studies with just room to squeeze round a low iron bedstead without scraping the wall there you areclean and haired and no error ive slep in it myself reginald motioned him from the room and then sitting down on the bed looked round him he could not understand it any common butchers boy would be better put up a little box of a bedroom like this with no better testimonial to its cleanliness and airiness than could be derived from the fact that the dirty little watchdog downstairs had occupied it and in place of a parlour that bare gaunt room below in which to sit of an evening and take his meals and enjoy himself why ever had the corporation not had the ordinary decency to have his permanent accommodation ready for him before he arrived he washed himself as well as he could without soap and towel and returned to the first floor where he found the boy back on his old stool and once more absorbed in his paper the reader looked up as reginald entered say whats yer name said he ever read tim tigerskin no ive not replied reginald staring at his questioner and wondering whether he was as erratic in his intellect as he was mealy in his countenance taint a bad un but taint arf as prime as the pirates bride the bloke there pisons two on em with prussic acid and wouldnt ever ave got nabbed if he adnt took some hisself by mistake the flat reginald could hardly help smiling at this appetising resume i want something to eat he said is there any place near here where i can get it trums but is sosseges is off at three oclock better try cuppershes a good un for bloaters i deals with im reginald felt neither the spirit nor the inclination to make a personal examination into the merits of the rival caterers youd better go and get me something he said to the boy coffee and fish or cold meat will do no fear i aint agoin for nothing replied the boy ill do your errands for a tanner a week and your leavings but not no less you shall have it said reginald whereupon the boy undertook the commission and departed the meal was a dismal one the herrings were badly oversmoked and the coffee was like mud and the boys conversation which filled in a running accompaniment was not conducive to digestion id most a mind to try some prussic in that corfee said that bloodthirsty young gentleman if id a known where the chemist downstairs keeps hisn then theyd a said youd poisoned yourself cos you was blue coming to this ere ole id a been put in the box at the inquige and id a said yes you was blue and i thought there was a screw loose the minit i see yer and id seen yer empty a paper of powder in your corfee while you thort nobody wasnt alooking and the juryd say it was tempory sanity and sooiside and say they considers i was a honest young feller and vote me a bob out of the poorbox there you are what do you think of that i suppose thats what the man in the pirates bride ought to have done said reginald with a faint smile to be sure he ought why its enough to disgust any one with the flat when he goes and takes the prussic hisself of course hed get found out well its just as well youve not put any in my coffee said reginald its none too nice as it is and id advise you young fellow to burn all those precious storybooks of yours if thats the sort of stuff they put into your head the boy stared at him in horrified amazement burn em oh walker whats your name demanded reginald why love replied the boy in a tone as if to say you had only to look at him to know his name well then young love clear these things away and come and make a start with these envelopes no fear i aint got to do no envellups youre got to do em i say youve got to do them too said reginald sternly and if you dont choose to do what youre told i cant keep you here the boy looked up in astonishment you aint my governor said he i am though said reginald and youd better make up your mind to it if you choose to do as youre told we shall get on all right but ill not keep you here if you dont his tone and manner effectually overawed the mutinous youngster he could not have spoken like that unless he possessed sufficient authority to back it up and as it did not suit the convenience of mr love just then to receive the sack from any one he capitulated with the honours of war put his tim tigerskin into his pocket and placed himself at his new governors disposal the evenings work consisted in addressing some two hundred or three hundred envelopes to persons whose names mr medlock had ticked in a directory and enclosing prospectuses therein it was not very entertaining work still as it was his first introduction to the operations of the corporation it had its attractions for the new secretary a very fair division of labour was mutually agreed upon by the two workers before starting reginald was to copy out the addresses and master love whose appetite was always good was to fold and insert the circulars and lick up the envelopes this being decided the work went on briskly and quietly reginald had leisure to notice one or two little points as he went on which though trivial in themselves still interested him he observed for one thing that the largest proportion of the names marked in the directory were either ladies or clergymen and most of them residing in the south of england very few of them appeared to reside in any large town but to prefer rural retreats far from the madding crowd where doubtless a letter even on the business of the corporation would be a welcome diversion to the monotony of existence as to the clergy doubtless their names had been suggested by the good bishop of s who would be in a position to introduce a considerable connection to his fellow directors reginald also noticed that only one name had been marked in each village it doubtless being assumed that every one in these places being on intimate terms with his neighbour it was unnecessary to waste stamps and paper in making the corporation known to two people where one would answer the same purpose he was curious enough to read one of the circulars and he was on the whole pleased with its contents it was as follows select agency corporation shy street liverpoolreverend sir for the ladies there were other circulars headed dear madam the approach of winter with all the hardships that bitter season entails on those whom providence has not blessed with sufficient means induces us to call your attention to an unusual opportunity for providing yourself and those dear to you with a most desirable comfort at a merely nominal outlay having acquired an enormous bankrupt stock of winter clothing of most excellent material and suitable for all measures we wish in testimony to our respect for the profession of which you are an honoured representative to acquaint you privately with the fact before disposing of the stock in the open market for l we can supply you with a complete clerical suit of the best make including overcoat and gloves etcetera etcetera the whole comprising an outfit which would be cheap at l in your case we should have no objection to meet you by taking l with your order and the balance any time within six months should you be disposed to show this to any of your friends we may say we shall be pleased to appoint you our agent and to allow you ten per cent on all sales effected by you which you are at liberty to deduct from the amount you remit to us with the orders we subjoin full list of winter clothing for gentlemen ladies and children money orders to be made payable to cruden reginald esquire secretary shy street liverpool hullo said reginald looking up excitedly dont fold up any more of those boy theyve made a mistake in my name and called me cruden reginald instead of reginald cruden it will have to be altered oh ah theres ony a couple of billions on em printed that wont take no time at all said master love beginning to think longingly of tim tigerskin it wont do to send them out like that said reginald oh yes it will bless you whats the odds if you call me tommy love or love tommy i knows who you mean and the governor e is awful partickler about these here being done tonight and we sent off millions on em last week my eye wasnt it a treat lickin up the envellups do you mean to say a lot of the circulars have been sent already undreds of grillions on em replied the boy of course it was no use after that delaying these so reginald finished off his task not a little vexed at the mistake and determined to have it put right without delay it was this cause of irritation most likely which prevented his dwelling too critically on the substance of the circular so affectionately dedicated to the poor country clergy beyond vaguely wondering where the corporation kept their bankrupt stock of clothing and how by the unaided light of nature they were to decide whether their applicants were stout or lean or tall or short he dismissed the matter from his mind for the time being and made as short work as possible of the remainder of the task then he wrote a short line home announcing his arrival in as cheerful words as he could muster and walked out to post it the pavements were thronged with a crowd of jostling men and women returning home from the days work but among them all the boy felt more lonely than had he been the sole inhabitant of liverpool nobody knew him nobody looked at him nobody cared two straws about him so he dropped his letter dismally into the box and turned back to shy street where at least there was one human being who knew his name and heeded his voice master love had made the most of his opportunities he had lit a candle and stuck it into the mouth of an inkbottle and by its friendly light was already deep once more in the history of his hero say whats yer name said he looking up as reginald reentered this here chap as scuttled a ship and drowned twenty on em e was a cute un and no error he rigs hisself up as a carpenter and takes a tile off the ships bottom just as the storm was acoming on and in corse she flounders and all ands and what became of him asked reginald oh in corse he stows hisself away in the boat with a lifebelt and gets washed ashore and he kills a tiger for is breakfast and its a pity you waste your time over bosh like that said reginald not interested to hear the conclusion of the heroic tims adventures if youre fond of reading why dont you get something better no feari like jam dont you make no error governor with which philosophical albeit enigmatical conclusion he buried his face once more in his hands and immersed himself in the literary jam before him reginald half envied him as he himself sat listless and unoccupied during that gloomy evening he did his best to acquaint himself by the aid of papers and circulars scattered about the room with the work that lay before him he made a careful tour of the premises with a view to possible alterations and improvements he settled in his own mind where the directors table should stand and in which corner of the private room he should establish his own desk he went to the length of designing a seal for the corporation and in scribbling for his own amusement the imaginary minutes of an imaginary meeting of the directors how would this do a meeting of directors of the select agency corporationby the way was it limited he didnt very clearly understand what that meant still most companies had the word after their name and he made a note to inquire of mr medlock whether it applied to themwas held on october st at the companys offices present the bishop of s in the chair messrs medlock blank mp soandso etcetera the secretary mr cruden having been introduced took his seat and thanked the directors for their confidence it was reported that the receipts for the last month had been well say l including l deposited against shares by the new secretary and the expenses l mr medlock reported the acquisition of a large bankrupt stock of clothing which it was proposed to offer privately to a number of clergymen and others as per a list furnished by the right reverend the chairman the following cheques were drawnrent for offices for a month l printing and postage l secretarys salary for one month l shillings ditto interest on the l deposit shillings pence officeboy one month l mr medlock for bankrupt stock of clothing l etcetera etcetera the secretary suggested various improvements in the offices and fittings and was requested to take any necessary steps after sundry other routine business the board adjourned this literary experiment concluded reginald who after the fatigues and excitement of the day felt ready for sleep decided to adjourn too do you stay here all night said he to love me you and me sleeps upstairs im afraid theres no room up there for two persons said reginald you had better go home tonight love and be here at nine in the morning go onas if i ad lodgins in the town if you dont want me i know one as do me and the chemists boy aint too big for the attick very well said reginald you had better go up to bed now its late dont you think youre having a lark with me said the boy taint eleven and i aint done this here tigerskin yet theres a lump of reading in it i can tell you when hed killed them tigers he rigged hisself up in their skins and yes yes said reginald im not going to let you stay up all night reading that rot cut up to bed now do you hear strange to say the boy obeyed there was something about reginald which reduced him to obedience though much against his will so he shambled off with his book under his arm secretly congratulating himself that the bed in the attic was close to the window so that he would be able to get a jolly long read in the morning after he had gone reginald followed his example and retired to his own very spare bed where he forgot all his cares in a night of sound refreshing sleep chapter fourteen the select agency corporation loses its officeboy mr medlock duly appeared next morning he greeted the new secretary with much friendliness hoped he had a good journey and left them all well at home and so on he further hoped reginald would find his new quarters comfortable most unfortunately they had missed securing the lease of a very fine suite of offices in lord street and had to put up with these for the present reginald must see everything was comfortable and as of course he would be pretty closely tied to the place for the directors would not like the offices left in charge of a mere officeboy he must make it as much of a home as possible as to money salaries were always paid quarterly and on christmas day reginald would receive his first instalment meanwhile as there were sure to be a few expenses reginald would receive five pounds on account a princely allowance equal to about thirteen shillings a week for the eight weeks between now and christmas the directors mr medlock said placed implicit confidence in the new secretary he was authorised to open all letters that came any money they might contain he was strictly to account for and pay into the bank daily to mr medlocks account he neednt send receipts mr medlock would see to that any orders that came he was to take copies of and then forward them to mr john smith weavers hotel london to be called for for execution he would have to answer the questions of any who called to make inquiries without of course disclosing any business secrets in fact as the aim of the corporation was to supply their supporters with goods at the lowest possible price they naturally met with a good deal of jealousy from tradesmen and persons of that sort so that reginald must be most guarded in all he said if it became known how their business was carried on others would be sure to attempt an imitation and the whole scheme would fail you know mr reginald said he excuse me interrupted reginald im afraid youre mistaken about my name youve printed it cruden reginald it should be reginald cruden dear me how extraordinarily unfortunate said mr medlock i quite understood that was your name and the unlucky part of it is we have got all the circulars printed and many of them circulated i have also given your name as mr reginald to the directors and advertised it so that i dont see what can be done except to keep it as it is after all it is a common thing and it would put us to the greatest inconvenience to alter it now dear me when i saw you in london i called you mr reginald didnt i no sir you called me mr cruden i must have supposed it was your christian name then perhaps it doesnt matter much said reginald and i dont wish to put the directors to any trouble to be sure i knew you would not well i was saying reginald thats right whatever way you take it the directors look upon you as a gentleman of character and education and are satisfied to allow you to use your discretion and good sense in conducting their business you have their names which you can show to any one they are greatly scattered so that our board meetings will be rare meanwhile they will be glad to hear how you are getting on and will i know appreciate and recognise your services by the way i believe i mentioned but really my memory is so bad that we should ask you to qualify to the extent of l in the shares of the company oh yes i have the cheque here said reginald taking it out of his pocket thats right and of course you will give yourself a receipt for it in the companys name curious isnt it with which pleasantry mr medlock departed promising to look in frequently and meanwhile to send in a fresh directory marked and some new circulars for him to get on with reginald not quite sure whether it was all as good as he expected set to work without delay to put into practice the various instructions he had received mr medlocks invitation to him to see everything was comfortable could hardly be fully realised on shillings a week that must wait for christmas and meanwhile he must make the best of what he had he set love to work folding and enclosing the new circulars this time calling attention to some extremely cheap globes and blackboards for ladies and infants schools while he drew himself up a programme of his daily duties in accordance with his impression of the directors wishes the result of this was that he came to the conclusion he should have his hands very full indeeda possibility he by no means objected to but it was not clear to him how he was to get much outdoor exercise or recreation or how he was to go to church on sundays or even to the bank on weekdays if the office was never to be left on this point he consulted mr medlock when he called in later in the day and arranged that for two hours on sunday and an hour every evening besides the necessary walk to the bank he might lock up the office and take his walks abroad whereat he felt grateful and a little relieved it was not till about four days after his arrival that the first crop of circulars sown among the clergy yielded their firstfruits on that day it was a harvest with a vengeance at least letters arrived most of them contained the two pounds and an order for the suit in some cases most elaborate measurements accompanied the order some asked for high church waistcoats others for low some wished for wideawake hats others for broadbrimmed clericals some sent extra money for a school boys suit as well and some contained instructions for a complete family outfit all were very eager about the matter and one or two begged that the parcel might be sent marked private reginald had a busy day from morning till nearly midnight entering and paying in the cash and forwarding the orders to mr john smith he organised a beautiful tabular account in which were entered the name and address of each correspondent the date of their letters the goods they ordered and the amount they enclosed and before the day was over the list had grown to a startling extent the next day brought a similar number of applications and remittances as to the globes and blackboards and of course some more also about the clerical suits and so from day to day the post showered letters in at the door and the secretary of the select agency corporation was one of the hardest worked men in liverpool master love meanwhile had very little time for his penny dreadfuls and complained bitterly of his hardships and indeed he looked so pale and unhealthy that reginald began to fear the constant licking was undermining his constitution and ordered him to use a sponge instead of his tongue but on this point loves loyalty made a stand nothing would induce him to use the artificial expedient he deliberately made away with the sponge and after a battle royal was allowed his own way and continued to lick till his tongue literally clave to the roof of his mouth by the end of a fortnight the first rush of work was over and reginald and his henchman had time to draw breath mr medlock had gone to london presumably to superintend the dispatch of the various articles ordered it was about this time that reginald had written home to horace complaining of the dulness of his life and begging him to repay blandford the shillings pence which had been weighing like lead on his mind ever since he left town and which he now despaired of ever being able to spare out of the slender pittance on which he was doomed to subsist till christmas happily that festive season was only a few weeks away now and then how delighted he should be to send home a round half of his income and convince himself he was after all a main prop to that dear distant little household had he been gifted with ears sharp enough to catch a conversation that took place at the bodega in london one evening about the same time the christmas spirit within him might have experienced a considerable chill the company consisted of mr medlock mr shanklin and mr durfy the latter was present by sufferance not because he was wanted or invited but because he felt inclined for a good supper and was sharp enough to know that neither of his employers could afford to fall out with him just then well how goes it said mr shanklin youve had a run lately and no mistake yes i flatter myself weve done pretty well one hundred pounds a day for ten days makes how much durfy a thousand said durfy humph said mr shanklin time to think of our christmas holidays wait a bit weve not done yet you say your two young mashers are still in tow alf yes green as duckweed but theyre nearly played out i guess one of them has a little bill for fifty pounds coming due in a fortnight and totherwell he wagered me a hundred pounds on a horse that never ran for the leger and hes got one or two trifles besides down in my books yes i got you that tip about the leger said durfy beginning to think himself neglected in this dialogue of selfcongratulation yes you managed to do it this time without botching it for a wonder said mr shanklin yes and i hope youll manage to give me the tenpound note you promised me for it mr s replied durfy with a snarl you seem to have forgotten that and my commission too for finding you your new secretary yes by the way said mr medlock he deserves something for that its the best stroke of business weve done for a long time its worth three weeks to us to have him there to answer questions and choke off the inquisitive hes got his busy time coming on i fancy bless you durfy the fellow was born for us he swallows anything ive allowed him thirteen shillings a week till christmas and he says thank you hes had his name turned inside out and i do believe he thinks it an improvement he sticks in the place all day with that young cockney gaolbird you picked us up too durfy and never growls does he help himself to any of the money not a brass farthing i do believe he buys his own postagestamps when he writes home to his mamma this last announcement was too comical to be received gravely ha ha he ought to be exhibited said shanklin he ought to be starved said durfy viciously he knocked me down once and i wouldnt have told you of him if i didnt owe him a grudge the puppy oh well i daresay youll be gratified some day or other said medlock i tell you one thing said durfy youd better put a stopper on his writing home too often i believe hes put his precious brother up to watch me why the other night when i was waiting for the postman to get hold of that letter you wanted im blessed if he didnt turn up and rout me outhe and a young chum of his brothers that used to be in the swim with me i dont think they saw me luckily but it was a shave and of course i missed the letter yes you did there was no mistake about that said mr shanklin viciously when did you ever not miss it how can i help it when its your own secretary is dogging me bless you think of him dogging any one the innocent anyhow we can cut off his letters home for a bit so as to give you no excuse next time and whats the next job to be then asked durfy the most particular of all replied the sporting man i want a letter with the boldham postmark or perhaps a telegram that will be delivered tomorrow night by the last post theres a fifty pounds turns on it and i must have it before the morning papers are out never mind what it is you must get it somehow and youll get a fiver for it as soon as thats done medlock and the young dandies bills have come due we can order a cab your secretary at liverpool will hold out long enough for us to get to the moon before were wanted youre right there said mr medlock laughing ill go down and look him up tomorrow and clear up and then i fancy hell manage the rest himself and we can clear out ha ha capital sherry this brand have some more durfy mr medlock kept his promise and cheered reginald in his loneliness by a friendly visit ive been away longer than i expected and i must say the way you have managed matters in my absence does you the greatest credit reginald i shall feel perfectly comfortable in future when i am absent a flush of pleasure rose to reginalds cheeks such as would have moved to pity any heart less coldblooded than mr medlocks no one has called i suppose no sir theres been a letter though from the rev t mulberry of woolfordinthemeadow to ask why the suit he ordered has not yet been delivered mr medlock smiled these good men are so impatient said he they imagine their order is the only one we have to think of what would they think of the four hundred and odd suits we have on order eh mr reginald i suppose i had better write and say the orders will be taken in rotation and that his will be forwarded in a few days better say a few weeks youve no notion of the difficulty we have in trying to meet every ones wishes say before christmasand the same with the globes and other things the time and trouble taken in packing the things really cuts into the profits terribly could we do any of it down here said reginald love and i have often nothing to do it was well the speaker did not notice the fiendish grimace with which the young gentleman referred to accepted the statement youre very good said mr medlock but i shouldnt think of it we want you for head work there are plenty to be hired in london to do the hand work by the way i will take up the register of orders and cash you have been keeping to check with the letters in town you wont want it for a few days reginald felt sorry to part with a work in which he felt such pride as this beautifully kept register however he had made it for the use of the corporation and it was not his to withhold after clearing up cautiously all round with the result that reginald had very little besides pen ink and paper left him mr medlock said good morning i may have to run up to town for a few days he said but i shall see you again very soon i hope meanwhile make yourself comfortable the directors are very favourably impressed with you already and i hope at christmas they may meet and tell you so in person boy make a parcel of these books and papers and bring them for me to my hotel love obeyed surlily he was only waiting for mr medlocks departure to dive into the mystery of trumpery toadstool or murdered for a lark in which he had that morning invested he made a clumsy parcel of the books and then shambled forth in a somewhat homicidal spirit in mr medlocks wake down the street at the corner that gentleman halted till he came up well young fellow picked any pockets lately the boy scowled at him inquisitively all right said mr medlock i never said you had im not going to take you to the policestation im going to give you half a crown this put a new aspect on the situation love brightened up as he watched mr medlocks hand dive into his pocket what should you do with a halfcrown if you had it do i know and no error id get the noogate calendar thats what id do you can read then rayther oh no not me can you read writing in corse do you always go to the post with the letters in corse do you ever see any addressed to mrs cruden or mr cruden in london bout once a week that there sekketery always gives em to me separate and says im to be sure and post em well i say theyre not to be posted said mr medlock heres half a crown and listen next time you get any to post put them on one side and every one you can show me you shall have sixpence for mind what youre at or hell flay you alive if he catches you off you go theres a good boy and love pocketed his halfcrown greedily and with a knowing wink at his employer sped back to the office that afternoon reginald wrote a short polite note to the rev t mulberry explaining to him the reason for any apparent delay in the execution of his order and promising that he should duly receive it before christmas this was the only letter for the post that day and love had no opportunity of earning a further sixpence he had an opportunity of spending his halfcrown however and when he returned from the post he was radiant in face and stouter under the waistcoat by the thickness of the coveted volume of the newgate calendar series with the impetuosity characteristic of his age he plunged into its contents the moment he found himself free of work and by the time reginald returned from his short evening stroll he was master of several of its stories tim tigerskin and the pirates bride were nothing to it they all performed their incredible exploits on the other side of the world but these heroes were beings of flesh and blood like himself and for all he knew he might have seen them and talked to them and have known some of the very spots in london which they frequented he felt a personal interest in their achievements say governor said he as soon as reginald entered do you know southwark road in london yes said reginald this ere chap bright was a light porter to a cove as kep a grocers shop there and one night when he was asleep in the armcheer he puts a sack on is ead and chokes im the old cove he struggles a bit but shut up said reginald angrily ive told you quite often enough give me that book at the words and the tones in which they were uttered love suddenly turned into a small fiend he struggled he kicked he cursed he howled to keep his treasure reginald was inexorable and of course it was only a matter of time until the book was in his hands a glance at its contents satisfied him look here said he holding the book behind his back and parrying all the boys frantic efforts to recover it dont make a fool of yourself youngster give it to me give me my book you and the boy broke into a volley of oaths and flung himself once more toothandnail on reginald already reginald saw he had made a mistake he had done about the most unwise thing he possibly could have done but it was too late to undo it the only thing apparently was to go through with it now so he flung the book into the fire and catching the boy by the arm told him if he did not stop swearing and struggling at once he would make him the boy did not stop and reginald did make him it was a poor sort of victory and no one knew it better than reginald if the boy was awed into silence he was no nearer listening to reason nay further than ever he slunk sulkily into a corner glowering at his oppressor and deaf to every word he uttered in vain reginald expostulated coaxed reasoned even apologised the boy met it all with a sullen scowl reginald offered to pay him for the book to buy him another to read aloud to him to give him an extra hour a dayit was all no use the injury was too deep to wash out so easily and finally he had to give it up and trust that time might do what arguments and threats had failed to effect but in this he was disappointed for next morning when nine oclock arrived no love was there nor as the day wore on did he put in an appearance when at last evening came and still no signs of him reginald began to discover that the sole result of his wellmeant interference had been to drive his only companion from him and doom himself henceforth to the miseries of solitary confinement for days he scarcely spoke a word the silence of that office was unearthly he opened the window winter as it was to let in the sound of cabs and footsteps for company he missed even the familiar rustle of the penny dreadfuls as the boy turned their pages he wished anybody even his direst foe might turn up to save him from dying of loneliness chapter fifteen a letter from horace dear reg so ran a letter from horace which reginald received a day or two after master loves desertion im afraid you are having rather a slow time up there which is more than can be said for us here theres been no end of a row at the rocket which you may like to hear about especially as two of the chief persons concerned were your friend durfy and your affectionate brother granville the subeditor came into the office where booms and waterford and i were working on friday morning and said in his usual mild way i should like to know who generally clears the postbox in the morning i do said booms you know the way he groans when he speaks the reason i want to know is because i have an idea one or two letters lately have either been looked at or tampered with before the editor or i see them i suppose im to be given in charge said booms i didnt do it but when once a mans suspected whats the use of saying anything even granville couldnt help grinning at this nonsense booms im glad to say i know you three fellows well enough by this time to feel sure it wasnt one of you i shouldnt have spoken to you about it if i had booms seemed quite disappointed he wasnt to be made a martyr of after all you think i know all about it he said no i dont and if youll just listen without running away with ridiculous notions booms said granville warming up a bit ill explain myself two letters during the last fortnight have been undoubtedly opened before i saw them they both arrived between eight oclock in the evening and nine next morning and they both came from sporting correspondents of ours in the country and contained information of a private nature intended for our paper the next day in one case it was about a horse race and in the other about an important football match the letters were not tampered with for the purpose of giving information to any other papers because we were still the only paper who gave the news so the probability is some one who wanted to bet on the event has tried to get hold of the news beforehand i never made a bet in my life said booms we couldnt help laughing at this for the stories he tells us of his terrific sporting exploits when he goes out of an evening in his high collar would make you think he was the loudest betting man in london granville laughed too better not begin he said and then blushed very red as it occurred to him he had made an unintentional pun but we looked quite grave and did not give any sign of having seen it and that put him on his feet again its not a comfortable thing to happen said he and what i want to propose is that one or two of you should stay late for a night or two and see if you can find out how it occurs there are one or two events coming off during the next few days about which we expect special communications so that very likely whoever it is may try again you must be very careful and i shall have to leave you to use your discretion for im so busy with the new literary supplement that i cannot stay myself well when hed gone we had a consultation and of course it ended in waterford and me determining to sit up poor boomss heart would break if he couldnt go on the mash as usual and though he tried to seem very much hurt that he was not to stay we could see he was greatly relieved waterford and i were rather glad as it happened for wed some work on hand it just suited us to get a quiet evening for so i wrote a note to miss crisp dont get excited old man shes a very nice girl but shes anothers by the way jemima asks after you every time i meet her which is once a week now shes invited herself into our shorthand class and after helping to rig old booms up to the ninetynines which wasnt easy work for his dicky kept twisting round to the side of his neck and we had to pin it in three places before it would keep steady i gave him the note and asked him would he ever be so kind as to take it round for me as it was to ask miss crisp if she would go and keep my mother company during my absence after that i thought we should never get rid of him he insisted on overhauling every article of his toilet at least four more pins were added to fix the restless dicky in its place on his manly breast we polished up his eyeglasses with washleather till the pewter nearly all rubbed off we helped him roll his flannel shirtsleeves up to the elbows for fearhorrible ideathey should chance to peep out from below his cuffs we devoted an anxious two minutes to the poising of his hat at the right angle and then passed him affectionately from one to the other to see he was all right after which he went off holding my letter carefully in his scented handkerchief and sayingdear gay deceiverthat he envied us spending a cosy evening in that snug office by the fire the work waterford and i have on hand istell it not in gath old man and dont scorn a fellow off the face of the earthto try to write something that will get into the literary supplement this supplement is a new idea of the editors and makes a sort of weekly magazine he writes a lot of it himself and we chip a lot of stuff for him out of other papers the idea of having a shot at it occurred to us both independently in a funny and rather humiliating way it seems waterford without saying a word to me or anybody had sat down and composed some lines on the swallowappropriate topic for this season of the year i at the same time without saying a word to waterford or anybody except mother had sat down and with awful groanings and wrestlings of mind evolved a lucubration in prose on ancient and modern athletic sports of course i crammed a lot of it up out of encyclopaedias and that sort of thing it was the driest rot you ever read and i knew it was doomed before i sent it in but as it was written i thought i might try so as of course i couldnt send it in under my own name i asked miss crisp if i might send it under hers the obliging little lady laughed and said yes but she didnt tell me at the same time that waterford had come to her with his swallow and asked the very same thing a rare laugh she must have had at our expense well i sent mine in and waterford sent in his we were both very abstracted for the next few days but little guessed our perturbation arose from the same cause then came the fatal wednesdaythe dwt day as we call itfor granville always saves up his rejected addresses for us to decline with thanks for wednesdays there was a good batch of them this day so waterford and i took half each i took a hurried skim through mine but no ancient and modern athletic sports were there i concluded therefore waterford had it granville writes in the corner of each dwt or dwt note which means declined with thanks pure and simple or declined with thanks and a short polite note to be written at the same time stating that the subeditor while recognising some merit in the contribution regretted it was not suitable for the supplement i polished off my pure and simple first and then began to tackle the notes about the fourth i came to considerably astonished me it was a couple of mild sonnets on the swallow with the name me crisp attached hullo i said to waterford tossing the paper over to him heres miss crisp writing some verses i should have thought she could write better stuff than that shouldnt you waterford very red in the face snatched up the paper and glanced at it do you think theyre so bad said he frightful twaddle said i fancy any one saying the drowsy year from winters sleep ye wake yet two of ye do not a summer make well said he grinning youd better tell her straight off its bosh and then shes not likely to make a fool of herself again hullo though i say he exclaimed picking up a paper in front of him every smudge and blot of which i knew only too well why shes at it again whats this ancient and mod why its in your writing did you copy it out for her i wrote that out yes said i feeling it my turn to colour up and look sheepish waterford glanced rapidly through the first few lines and then said well all i can say is its a pity she didnt stick to poetry im sure the line about waking the drowsy year is a jolly sight better than this awful rot though we are not told so in so many words we may reasonably conclude that athletic sports were not unpractised by cain and abel prior to the death of the latter as if they could have done it after i never said they could i said feeling very much taken down ohit was you composed it as well as wrote it was it said he laughing ho ho thats the best joke i ever heard poor little crisp what a shame to get her to fatheror mother a thing like this ha ha prior to the death of the latterthats something like a play of language my eye what a game shes been having with us us then youre the idiot who wrote about the swallows said i suppose i am said he blushing all over suppose i am well all i can say is im precious glad the little crisp isnt guilty of it two of ye do not a summer make indeed well they dont said he i know they dont said i half dead with laughing but you neednt go and tell everybody im sure its just as interesting as cain and abel there now we dont want to hear any more about them said i but i think we ought to send them both back to miss crisp to give her her laugh against us too we did so and i neednt tell you she lets us have it whenever we get within twenty yards of her heres a long digression but it may amuse you and you said you wanted something to read well waterford and i recovered in a few days from our first reverse and decided to have another shot and so we were rather glad of the quiet evening at the office to make our new attempts we half thought of writing a piece between us but decided wed better go on our own hooks after all as our styles were not yet broken in to one another we agreed we had better this time both write on subjects we knew something about waterford accordingly selected a day in a subsub editors life as a topic he really could claim to be familiar with while i pitched upon early rising a branch of science in which i flatter myself old man you are not competent to tell me whether i excel or not half the battle was done when we had fixed on our subjects so as soon as every one was gone we poked up the fire and made ourselves snug and settled down to work we plodded on steadily till we heard the halfpast nine letters dropped into the box then it occurred to us we had better turn down the lights and give our office as deserted a look as we could it was rather slow work sitting in the dark for a couple of hours not speaking a word or daring to move a toe the fire got low but we dared not make it up and of course we both had awful desires to sneeze and coughyou always do at such timesand half killed ourselves in our efforts to smother them we could hear the cabs and omnibuses in fleet street keeping up a regular roar but no footsteps came near us except once when a telegraph boy as we guessed by his shrill whistling and his smart step came and dropped a telegram into the box i assure you the click the flap of the letterbox made that moment although i knew what it was and why it was made my heart beat like a steamengine it was beginning to get rather slow when twelve came and still nothing to disturb us we might have been forging ahead with our writing all this time if we had only known presently waterford whispered they wont try tonight now just as he spoke we heard a creak on the stairs outside we had heard lots of creaks already but somehow this one startled us both i instinctively picked up the ruler from the table and waterford took my arm and motioned me close to the wall beside him another creak came presently and then another evidently some one was coming down the stairs cautiously and in the dark too for we saw no glimmer of a light through the partlyopened door we were behind it so that if it opened we should be quite hidden unless the fellow groped round it down he came slowly and there was no mistake now about its being a human being and not a ghost for we heard him clearing his throat very quietly and snuffling as he reached the bottom step i can tell you it was rather exciting even for a fellow of my dull nerves waterford nudged me to creep a little nearer the gas ready to turn it up at a moments notice while he kept at the door to prevent our man getting out after he was once in presently the door opened very quietly he did not fling it wide open luckily or he was bound to spot us behind it but he opened it just enough to squeeze in and then feeling his way round by the wall made straight for the letterbox although it was dark he seemed to know his way pretty well and in a few seconds we heard him stop and fumble with a key in the lock in a second or two he had opened it and then crouching down began cautiously to rub a match on the floor the light was too dim to see anything but the crouching figure of a man bending over the box and examining the addresses of one or two of the letters in it his match went out before he had found what he wanted it was hard work to keep from giving him a little unexpected light for my fingers itched to turn up the gas however it was evidently better to wait a little longer and see what he really was up to before we were down on him he lit another match and this time seemed to find what he wanted for we saw him put one letter in his pocket and drop all the others back into the box blowing out his match as he did so now was our time i felt a nudge from waterford and turned the gas full on while he quietly closed the door and turned the key i felt quite sorry for the poor scared beggar as he knelt there and turned his white face to the light unable to move or speak or do anything youll have guessed who it was so mr durfy said waterford leaning up against the door and folding his arms its you is it the culprit glared at him and then at me and rose to his feet with a forced laugh it looks like it he said so it does said waterford taking the key out of the door and putting it in his pocket very like it and it looks very much as if he would have to make himself comfortable here till mr granville comes what do you mean exclaimed the fellow ive as much right to be here as you have for the matter of that at this hour very well then said waterford as cool as a cucumber well all three stay here eh cruden im game said i he evidently didnt like the turn things were taking and changed his tack come dont play the fool he said coaxingly the fact is i expected a letter from a friend and as it was very important i came to get it its all right you may think so said waterford you may think its all right to come here on tiptoe at midnight with a false key and steal but other people may differ from you thats all besides youre telling a lie the letter youve got in your pocket doesnt belong to you it was rather a rash challenge but we could see by the way his face fell it was a good shot he uttered an oath and advanced threateningly towards the door sit down said waterford unless you want to be tied up there are two of us here and were not going to stand any nonsense i can tell you youve no right sit down and shut up repeated waterford i tell you if you cruden youll find some cord in one of those drawers if you dont shut up and sit down durfy we shall make you he caved in after that and i was rather glad we hadnt to go to extremes hadnt we better get the letter whispered i no hed better fork it out to granville said waterford he was wrong for once as you shall hear durfy slunk off and sat down on a chair in the far corner of the room swearing to himself but not venturing to raise his voice above a growl it was now about halfpast twelve and we had the lively prospect of waiting at least eight hours before granville turned up dont you bother to stay said waterford i can look after him but i scouted the idea and said nothing would induce me to go very well then said he we may as well get on with our writing so we pulled our chairs up to the table with a fullview of durfy in the corner and tried to continue our lucubrations but when you are sitting up at dead of night with a prisoner in the corner of the room cursing and gnashing his teeth at you it is not easy to grow eloquent either on the subject of a day in a subsubeditors life or early rising and so we found we gave it up presently and made up the fire and chatted together in a whisper once or twice durfy broke the silence im hungry growled he about two oclock so are we said waterford well go and get something im not going to be starved i tell you ill make you smart for it both of you youve been told to shut up said waterford rising to his feet with a glance towards the drawer where the cord was kept durfy was quiet after that for an hour or so then i suppose he must have overheard me saying something to waterford about you for he broke out with a vicious laugh reginald yes hell thank you for this ill make it so hot for him look here said waterford this is the last time youre going to be cautioned durfy if you open your mouth once more youll be gagged mind that i mean what i say this was quite enough for durfy he made no further attempt to speak but curled himself up on the floor and turned his face to the wall and disposed himself to all appearances to sleep whether he succeeded or not i cant say but towards morning he glowered round at us then he took out some tobacco and commenced chewing it and finally turned his back on us again and continued dozing and chewing alternately till the eight oclock bell rang and aroused us half an hour later granville arrived and a glance at our group was quite sufficient to acquaint him with the state of affairs so this is the man said he pointing to durfy yes sir we caught him in the act of taking a letter out of the box at midnight in fact hes got it in his pocket this moment durfy gave a fiendish grin and said thats a lie ive no letter in my pocket and he proceeded to turn his pockets one after the other inside out all i know is we both saw him take a letter out of the box and put it in his pocket said waterford yes snarled durfy and i told you it was a private letter of my own whatever the letter is you took it out of the box and you had better show it quietly said granville it will save you trouble i tell you i have no letter replied durfy again very well then cruden perhaps you will kindly fetch a policeman i started to go but durfy broke out this time in tones of sincere terror dont do that dont ruin me i did take it but give it to me then i cant ive eaten it wasnt this a thunderbolt how were we to prove whose the letter was wild thoughts of a stomachpump or soap and warm water did flash through my mind but what was the use the fellow had done us after all and we had to admit it no one stopped him as he went to the door half scowling half grinning good morning gentlemen said he i hope youll get a better nights rest tomorrow i promise not to disturb you here followed a few oaths but ill pay you out some of youcrudens reginalds sneaks prigsall of you with which neat peroration he took his leave and the rocket has not seen him since heres a long screed i must pull up now mothers not very well shes fretting im afraid and her eyes trouble her i cant say we shall be sorry when christmas comes for try all we can were in debt at one or two of the shops i know youll hate to hear it but its simply unavoidable on our present means i wish i could come down and see you but for one thing i cant afford it and for another i cant leave mother mrs shuckleford is really very kind though shes not a congenial spirit young gedge and i see plenty of one another hes joined our shorthand class and is going in for a little steady work all round he owes you a lot for befriending him at the time you did and hes not forgotten it i promised to send you his love next time i wrote harker will be in town next week which will be jolly ive never seen bland since i called to pay the shillings pence i fancy hes got into rather a fast lot and is making a fool of himself which is a pity you tell us very little about your corporation i hope it is going on all right i wish to goodness you were back in town i never was in love with the concern as you know and at the risk of putting you in a rage i cant help saying its a pity we couldnt all have stayed together just now forgive this growl old man your affectionate brother horace wednesday dwt day to our surprise and trepidation neither the day in a subsubeditors life nor early rising were among the papers given out today to be declined with thanks granville may have put them into the fire as not even worth returning or he may actuallyo mirabile dictube going to put us into print chapter sixteen visitors at number shy street the concluding sentences of horaces long letter particularly those which referred to his mothers poor health and the straitened circumstances of the little household were sufficiently unwelcome to eclipse in reginalds mind the other exciting news the letter had contained they brought on a fit of the blues which lasted more than one day for now that he had neither companion nor occupation for the business of the select agency corporation had fallen off completely there was nothing to prevent his indulgence in low spirits he began to chafe at his imprisonment and still more at his helplessness even were he at liberty to do anything christmas was still a fortnight off and till then what could he do on thirteen shillings a week he might cut down his commissariat certainly to say a shilling a day and send home the rest but then what about coals and postagestamps and other incidental expenses which had to be met in mr medlocks absence out of his own pocket the weather was very coldhe could hardly do without coals and he was bound in the interests of the corporation to keep stamps enough in the place to cover the necessary correspondence when all was said two shillings seemed to be the utmost he could save out of his weekly pittance and this he sent home by the very next post with a long wouldbe cheerful but really dismal letter stoutly denying that he was either miserable or disappointed with his new work and anticipating with pleasure the possibility of being able to run up at christmas and bring with him the welcome funds which would clear the family of debt and give it a good start for the new year when he had finished his letter home he wrote to mr medlock very respectfully suggesting that as he had been working pretty hard and for the last few days singlehanded mr medlock might not object to advance him at any rate part of the salary due in a fortnight as he was rather in need of money and he ventured to ask as christmas day fell on a thursday and no business was likely to be done between that day and the following monday might he take the two or three days holiday undertaking of course to be back at his post on the monday morning he enclosed a few postoffice orders which had come to hand since he last wrote and hoped he should soon have the pleasure of seeing mr medlockor anybody he added to himself as he closed the letter and looked wearily round the gaunt empty room now if reginald had been a believer in fairies he would hardly have started as much as he did when almost as the words escaped his lips the door opened and a female marched into the room a little prim female it was with stiff curls down on her forehead and a very sharp nose and very thin lips and fidgety fingers that seemed not to know whether to cling to one another for support or fly at the countenance of somebody else this formidable visitor spared reginald the trouble of inquiring to what fortunate circumstance he was indebted for the honour of so unlookedfor a visit now sir said she panting a little after her ascent of the stairs but very emphatic all the same the observation was not one which left much scope for argument and reginald did not exactly know what to reply at last however he summoned up resolution enough to say politely now madam can i be of any service inoffensive as the observation was it had the effect of greatly irritating the lady none of your sauce young gentleman said she putting down her bag and umbrella and folding her arms defiantly ive not come here to take any of your impertinence reginalds impertinence he had never been rude to a lady in all his life except once and the penance he had paid for that sin had been bitter enough as the reader can testify you neednt pretend not to know what ive come here for continued the lady taking a hasty glance round the room as if mentally calculating from what door or window her victim would be most likely to attempt to escape perhaps shes loves mother gasped reginald to himselfoh but what a venus this classical reflection he prudently kept to himself and waited for his visitor to explain her errand further you know who i am she said walking up to him no indeed said reginald hardly liking to retreat but not quite comfortable to be standing still unlessunless your name is love love screamed the outraged venus ill love you young gentleman before ive done with you love indeed you impudent saucebox you i beg your pardon began reginald love indeed id like to scratch you so i would cried the lady with a gesture so ominously like suiting the action to the word that reginald fairly deserted his post and retreated two full paces this was getting critical either the lady was mad or she had mistaken reginald for some one else in either case he felt utterly powerless to deal with the difficulty so like a prudent man he decided to hold his tongue and let the lady explain herself love indeed said she for the third time you saucy jackanapes you no sir my names wrigley she evidently supposed this announcement would fall like a thunderbolt on the head of her victim and it disconcerted her not a little when he merely raised his eyebrows and inclined his head politely now do you know what im come about said she no replied he yes you do you neednt think to deceive me sir it wont do i can tell you i really dont know said poor reginald who are you im the lady who ordered the globe and blackboard and sent two pounds along with the order to you mr cruden reginald there now perhaps you know what ive come for if she had expected reginald to fly out of the window or seek refuge up the chimney at this announcement the composure with which he received the overpowering disclosure must have considerably astonished her eh she said eh do you know me now i have no doubt you are right said he we had more than a hundred orders for the globes and boards and expect they will be delivered this week or next oh then you have been imposing on more than me said the lady who till this moment had imagined she had been the only correspondent of the corporation on the subject weve been imposing on no one said reginald warmly you have no right to say that mrs wrigley his honest indignation startled the good lady then why dont you send the things she demanded in a milder tone there are a great many orders to attend to and they have to be taken in order as we receive them probably yours came a good deal later than others no it didnt i wrote by return of post and put an extra stamp on too you must have got mine one of the very first in that case you will be one of the first to receive your globe and board i know that young man said she im going to take them with me now im afraid you cant do that said reginald they are being sent off from london the lady who had somewhat moderated her wrath in the presence of the secretarys unruffled politeness fired up as fiercely as ever at this there i knew it was a swindle from london indeed might as well say new york at once im not going to believe your lies you young robber dont expect it it was a considerable tax on reginalds temper to be addressed in language like this even by a lady and he could not help retorting rather hotly im glad you are only a woman mrs wrigley for i wouldnt stand being called a thief by a man i assure you oh dont let that make any difference said she fairly in a rage and advancing up to him knock me down and welcome you may just as well murder a woman as rob her i can only tell you again your order is being executed in london and i can tell you i dont believe a word you say and ill just have my two pounds back and have done with you come you cant say you never got that if you sent it i certainly did said reginald then perhaps youll hand it up this moment i would gladly do so if i had it but i suppose its gone to london too said she with supernatural calmness it has been paid in with all the money to the bank said reginald but if you wish it i will write to the managing director and ask him to return it by next post will you said she in tones that might have frozen any one less heated than reginald and you suppose ive come all the way from dorsetshire to get that for an answer do you youre mistaken sir i dont leave this place till i get my money or my things so now then said reginald feeling the case desperate and pushing a chair in her direction perhaps youd better sit down she glared round at him indignantly but perhaps it was the sight of his haggard troubled face or the faint suspicion that he after all might be more honest than his employers or the reflection that she could get her rights better out of the place than in it whatever the reason was she changed her mind you shall hear of me again sir said she mind that love indeed whereupon she bounced out of the office and slammed the door behind her reginald sat with his eyes on the door for a full two minutes before he could sufficiently collect his wits to know where he was or what had happened then a sense of indignation overpowered all his other feelingsnot against mrs wrigley but against mr medlock for leaving him in a position where he could be even in the remotest degree open to so unpleasant a charge as that he had just listened to why could he not be trusted with sufficient money and control over the operations of the corporation to enable him to meet so unfounded a charge what would the bishop of s or the other directors think if they heard that a lady had come all the way from dorsetshire to tell them they were a set of swindlers and thieves if he had had the sending off of the orders to see to he was confident he could have got every one of them off by this time even if he had made up every parcel with his own hands what in short was the use of being called a secretary if he was armed with no greater authority than a common junior clerk he opened the letter he had just written to mr medlock and sat down to write another more aggrieved in its tone and more urgent in its request that mr medlock would come down to liverpool at once to arrange matters on a more satisfactory footing it was difficult to write a letter which altogether pleased him but at last he managed to do it and for fear his warmth should evaporate he went out to post it locking the office up behind him he took a walk before returningthe first he had taken for a week it was a beautiful crisp december day when even through the murky atmosphere of liverpool the sun looked down joyously and the blue sky flecked with little fleecy clouds seemed to challenge the smoke and steam of a thousand chimneys to touch its purity reginalds steps turned away from the city through a quiet suburb towards the country he would have to walk too far he knew to reach real open fields and green lanes but there was at least a suggestion of the country here which to his weary mind was refreshing his walk took him past a large public school in the playground of which an exciting football match was in active progress like an old war horse reginald gazed through the palings and snorted as the cry of battle rose in the air hack it through sir well run collar him there as he heard those old familiar cries it seemed to him as if the old life had come back to him with a sudden rush he was no longer a poor baited secretary but a joyous schoolboy head of his form lord and master of half a dozen fags and a caution and example to the whole junior school he had chums by the score his study was always crowded with fellows wanting him to do this or help them in that how jolly to be popular how jolly when the ball came out of the scrimmage to hear every one shout let cruden have it how jolly as he snatched it up and rushed cleaving his way to the enemys goal to hear that roar behind him run indeed sir back him up well played yes he heard them still like music and as he watched the shifting fortunes of this game he felt the blood course through his veins with a strange familiar ardour ah here came the ball out of the scrimmage straight towards him oh the thrill of such a moment who does not know it a second more and he would have it alas poor reginald awoke as suddenly as he had dreamed a hideous paling stood between him and the ball he was not in the game at all nothing but a lonely friendless drudge whom nobody wanted nobody cared about with a glistening in his eyes which he would have scornfully protested was not a tear he turned away and walked moodily back to shy street caring little if it were to be the last walk he should ever take he was not however to be allowed much time for indulging his gloomy reflections on reaching his journeys end a person was waiting outside the office pacing up and down the pavement to keep himself warm the stranger took a good look at reginald as he entered and let himself in and then followed up the stairs and presented himself is mr reginald at home inquired he blandly reginald noticed that he was a middleaged person dressed in a sort of very shabby clerical costume awkward in his manner but not unintelligent in face that is my name replied he thank you i am glad to see you mr reginald you were kind enough to send me a communication not long ago aboutwell about a suit of clothes his evident hesitation to mention anything that would call attention to his own wellworn garb made reginald feel quite sorry for him oh yes said he taking good care not to look at his visitors toilet we sent a good many of the circulars to clergymen very considerate said the visitor i was away from home and have only just received it and he took the circular out of his pocket and seating himself on a chair began to peruse it presently he looked up and said are there any left any of the suits oh yes i expect so we had a large number could ican you show me one unfortunately i havent got them here they are all in london how unfortunate i did so want to get one then he perused the paper again how soon could i have one he said oh very soon now before christmas certainly replied reginald you are sure oh yes they will all be delivered before then and have you had many orders said the clergyman a great many said reginald hundreds i daresay there are many to whom it would be a boon at this season to get so cheap an outfit two hundred i should say said reginald would you like to leave an order with me two hundred dear me and did they all send the two pounds as stated here along with their order oh yes some sent more said reginald quite thankful to have some one to talk to who did not regard him either as a fool or a knave it must have been a very extensive bankrupt stock you acquired said the clergyman musingly and were all the applicants clergymen like myself nearly all dear me how sad to think how many there are to whom such an opportunity is a godsend we are sadly underpaid many of us mr reginald and are apt to envy you gentlemen of business your comfortable means now you i daresay get as much as three or four of us poor curates get together i hope not said reginald with a smile well if i even had your l a year i should be thankful said the poor curate but i havent that by l said reginald shall i put you down for a complete suit as mentioned in the circular yes im afraid i cannot well do without it said the other and what name and address said reginald well perhaps the simplest way would be as i am going back to london for you to give me an order for the things to present at your depot there it will save carriage you know very well said reginald i will write one for you you notice added he that we ask for l with the order ah yes said the visitor with a sigh that appears to be a stern necessity here it is mr reginald thank you said reginald i will write you a receipt and here is a note to mr john smith at weavers hotel london who has charge of the clothing i have no doubt he will be able to suit you with just what you want john smith i fancy i have heard his name somewhere is he one of your principalsa dark tall man i have never seen him said reginald but all our orders go to him for execution oh well thank you very much i am sure i am much obliged to you you seem to be singlehanded here it must be hard work for you pretty hard sometimes i suppose clothing is what you chiefly supply we have also been sending out a lot of globes and blackboards to schools dear me i should be glad to get a pair of globes for our parish schoolvery glad have you them here no they are in london too and how do you sell them i fear they are very expensive they cost l the set but we only ask l with the order that really seems moderate i shall be strongly tempted to ask our vicar to let me get a pair when in london will mr smith be able to show them to me yes he is superintending the sending off of them too how crowded weavers hotel must be with so many bulky articles said the curate oh you know i dont suppose mr smith keeps them there but he lives there while hes in town thats all our directors generally put up at weavers hotel i should greatly like to see a list of the directors if i may said the clergyman theres nothing gives one so much confidence as to see honoured names on the directorate of a company like yours i can give you a list if you like said reginald i daresay you know by name the bishop of s our chairman to be sure anddear me what a very good list of names thank you if i may take one of these i should like to show it to my friends well then i will call on mr smith in london and meanwhile i am very much obliged to you mr reginald for your courtesy very glad to have made your acquaintance good afternoon and he shook hands cordially with the secretary and departed leaving reginald considerably soothed in spirit as he reflected that he had really done a stroke of work for the corporation that day on his own account it was well for his peace of mind that he did not know that the clergyman on turning the corner of shy street rubbed his hands merrily together and said to himself in tones of selfsatisfaction well if that wasnt the neatest bit of work ive done since i came on the beat the innocent hed sit up i guess if he knew the nice pleasantspoken parson hes been blabbing to was sniff of the detective office my eyeits all so easy theres not much credit about the business after all but its pounds shillings and pence to sniff and thats better chapter seventeen samuel shuckleford finds himself busy jemima my dear said mrs shuckleford one day as the little family in number dull street sat round their evening meal i dont like the looks of mrs cruden its my opinion she dont get enough to eat really ma how you talk replied the daughter the butchers boy left there this very afternoon i saw him im afraid my dear he didnt leave anything more filling than a bill in fact i eard myself that the butcher told mrs marks he thought number ad gone far enough for im oh ma you dont mean to say theyre in debt said jemima who by the way had been somewhat more pensive and addicted to sitting by herself since reginald had gone north well if it was only the butcher i heard it from i wouldnt take much account of it but parker the baker as is doubts of them so i eard the grinsons maid tell ford when i was in is shop this very day and im sure youve only to look at oraces coat and at to see they must be in debt the poor boy looks a reglar scarecrow it all comes my dear of reginalds going off and leaving them oh ow i pity them that as a wild son dont talk nonsense ma said miss jemima firing up hes no more wild than sam here you seem to know more about reginald than most people my dear said her mother significantly to the surprise of the mother and brother jemima replied to this insinuation by bursting into tears and walking out of the room did you ever see the like of that she always takes on if any one mentions that boys name and shes old enough to be his aunt too the sooner she cures herself of that craze the better said sam pouring himself out some more tea she dont know quite so much about him as i do why what do you know about im then inquired mrs shuckleford in tones of curiosity never you mind we dont talk business out of the office all i can tell you is hes a bad lot poor mrs cruden no wonder she takes on what an infliction a wicked son is to a mother sam thatll do said the dutiful sam what do you know about it i tell you what ma youre thick enough with number youd better draw off a bit oh sam why so because i give you the tip thats all the old lady may not be in it but i dont fancy the connection but sam shes starving herself and orace is in rags send her in a rumpsteak and a suit of my old togs by the housemaid said sam or else do as you like and dont blame me if youre sorry for it mrs shuckleford knew it was no use trying to extract any more lucid information from her legal offspring and did not try but she made another effort to soften his heart with regard to the widow cruden and her son after all theyre gentlefolk in trouble as we might be said she and they do behave very nice at the shortand class to jemima gentlefolk or not said sam decisively spreading a slice of toast with jam i tell you youd better draw off maand jim must chuck up the class im not going to have her mixing with them but the childs eart would break sam if let it break she cares no more about shorthand than she does about county courts its all part of her craze to tack herself on that lot shes setting her cap at him while shes making up to his ma any flat might see that but shes got to jack up the whole boiling nowthere we neednt say any more about it and having finished his tea mr samuel shuckleford went down to his club to take part in a debate on cruelty to animals now the worthy captains widow mrs shuckleford had lived long enough in this world to find that human nature is a more powerful law even than parental obedience she therefore took to heart just so much of her sons discourse as fitted with the one and overlooked just so much as exacted the latter in other words she was ready to believe that reginald cruden was a bad lot but she was not able to bring herself on that account to desert her neighbour at the time of her trouble accordingly that same evening while samuel was pleading eloquently on behalf of our dumb fellowcreatures and jemima having recovered from her tears was sitting abstractedly over a shorthand exercise in her own bedroom mrs shuckleford took upon herself to pay a friendly call at number it happened to be one of horaces late evenings so that mrs cruden was alone she was lying wearily on the uncomfortable sofa with her eyes shaded from the light dividing her time between knitting and musing the latter occupation receiving a very decided preference pray dont get up said mrs shuckleford the moment she entered i only looked in to see ow you was youre looking bad mrs cruden thank you i am quite well said mrs cruden only a little tired and down in your spirits too and well you may be poor dear said the visitor soothingly no mrs shuckleford said mrs cruden brightly indeed i ought not to be in bad spirits today weve had quite a little family triumph today horace has had an article published in the rocket and we are so proud ah yes hes the steady one said mrs shuckleford theres no rolling stone about orace no said the mother warmly if they was only both alike said the visitor approaching her subject delicately ah but it often happens two brothers may be very different in temper and mind its not always a misfortune certainly not mrs cruden but when ones good and the others wicked oh then of course it is very sad said mrs cruden sads no name for it replied the visitor with emotion oh mrs cruden ow sorry i am for you you are very kind it is a sad trial to be separated from my boy but ive not given up hopes of seeing him back soon mrs shuckleford shook her head ow you must suffer on is account said she if your eart dont break with it it must be made of tougher stuff than mine but after all mrs shuckleford said mrs cruden there are worse troubles in this life than separation youre right oh im so sorry for you why for me i have only the lighter sorrow oh mrs cruden do you call a wicked son a light sorrow certainly not but my sons thank god are good brave boys both of them and who told you e was a good brave boy reggie i mean who told me said mrs cruden with surprise who told me he was anything else oh mrs cruden oh mrs cruden said mrs shuckleford beginning to cry mrs cruden at last began to grow uneasy and alarmed she sat up on the sofa and said in an agitated voice what do you mean mrs shuckleford has anything happened is there any bad news about reginald oh mrs cruden i made sure you knew all about it what is it cried mrs cruden now thoroughly terrified and trembling all over has anything happened to him is hedead and she seized her visitors hand as she asked the question no mrs cruden not dead maybe it would be better for im if he was better if he was dead oh please have pity and tell me what you mean cried the poor mother dropping back on to the sofa with a face as white as a sheet come dont take on said mrs shuckleford greatly disconcerted to see the effect of her delicate breaking of the news perhaps its not as bad as it seems oh what is it what is it i cant bear this suspense why dont you tell me and she trembled so violently and looked so deadly pale that mrs shuckleford began to get alarmed there there said she soothingly ill tell you another time youre not equal to it now ill come in tomorrow or the next day when youve had a good nights rest poor dear for pitys sake tell me all now gasped mrs cruden unless you want to kill me it dawned at last on the wellmeaning mrs shuckleford that no good was being done by prolonging her neighbours suspense any further well well its only that im afraid hes been doing something welldreadful oh mrs cruden how sorry i am for you mrs cruden lay motionless like one who had received a stab what has he done she whispered slowly i dont know dearreally i dont said mrs shuckleford beginning to whimper at the sight of the desolation she had caused it was sam my son told mehe wouldnt say what it wasand i ope you wont let im know it was me you eard it from mrs cruden for hed be very mercy on us mrs cruden had fainted help was summoned and she was carried to her bed when horace arrived shortly afterwards he found her still unconscious with mrs shuckleford bathing her forehead and tending her most gently you had better run for a doctor orace whispered she as the scared boy entered the room what is the matter what has happened gasped he poor dear shes broken downshes but go quick for the doctor orace horace went as fast as his fleet feet would carry him the doctor pronounced mrs cruden to be in a state of high fever produced by nervous prostration and poor living he advised horace if possible to get a nurse to tend her while the fever lasted especially as she would probably awake from her swoon delirious and would for several days remain in a very critical condition in less than five minutes horace was at miss crisps imploring her assistance the warmhearted little lady undertook the duty without a moments hesitation and from that night and for a fortnight to come hardly quitted her friends bedside mrs shuckleford deeming it prudent not to refer again to the unpleasant subject which had been the immediate cause of mrs crudens seizure waited till she was assured that at present she could be of no further use and then withdrew full of sympathy and commiseration which she manifested in all sorts of womanly ways during her neighbours illness not a day passed but she called in morning and afternoon to inquire after the patient generally the bearer of some homemade delicacy and sometimes to take her post by the sick bed while miss crisp snatched an hour or so of wellearned repose as for horace he could hardly be persuaded to leave the sick chamber but the stern necessity of work greater than ever now at this time of special emergency compelled him to take the rest necessary for his own health and daily duties with an effort he dragged himself to the office every morning and like an arrow he returned from it every evening and often paid a flying visit at midday his goodnatured companions voluntarily relieved him of all late work and indeed every one who had in the least degree come into contact with the gentle patient seemed to vie in showing sympathy and offering help young gedge was amongst the most eager of the inquirers at the house he squandered shillings in flowers and grapes and sometimes even ran the risk of disgrace at the rocket by lingering outside the house during a doctors visit in order to hear the latest bulletin before he went back to work in his mind as well as in horaces a faint hope had lurked that somehow reginald might contrive to run up to london for a day or two at least to cheer the house of watching mrs cruden in her delirium often moaned her absent sons name and called for him and they believed if only he were to come her restless troubled mind might cease its wanderings and find rest but reginald neither came nor wrote since horace on the first day of her illness had written telling him all no one had heard a word from him at last when after a week horace wrote again saying come to us if you love us and still no letter or message came back a new cloud of anxiety fell over the house reginald must be ill or away from liverpool or something must have happened to him or assuredly they said he would have been at his mothers side at the first breath of danger mrs shuckleford only as day passed day and the prodigal never returned shook her head and said to herself it was a blessing no one knew the reason not even the poor delirious sufferer herself poor people they had trouble enough on them not to need any more just now so she kept her own counsel even from jemima this was the more easy to do because she knew nothing either of reginald or his doings beyond what her son had hinted and as samuel was at present in the country on business she had no opportunity of prosecuting her inquiries on the subject sam in fact whether he liked it or not happened just now to hold the fortunes of the family of cruden pretty much in his own hands a few days before the conversation with his mother already reported he had been sitting in his room at the office his partner and the head clerk both being absent on county court business samuel felt all the dignity of a commanderinchief and was therefore not at all displeased when the officeboy had come and knocked at his door and said that a lady of the name of wrigley had called and wished to see him show the lady in said sam grandly and put a chair mrs wrigley was accordingly ushered in the dust of travel still on her for she had come direct from liverpool by the night train determined to put her wrongs in the hands of the law mr crawley samuels principal had been legal adviser to the late mr wrigley it was only natural therefore that the widow not liking to entrust her secret to the pettifogging practitioner of her own village should make use of a two hours break in her journey to seek his aid your masters not in young man said she as she took the proffered seat thats a pity im sure hell be very sorry said sam but if its anything i can do if you can save poor defenceless women from being plundered and punish those that plunder themthen you can here was a slice of luck for samuel the first bit of practice on his own account that had ever fallen in his way if he did not make a good thing out of it his initials were not ss he drew his chair confidentially beside that of the injured mrs wrigley and drank in the story of her woes with an interest that quite won her heart at first he failed to recognise either the name of the delinquent corporation or its secretary but when presently his client produced one of the identical circulars sent out with the name cruden reginald at the foot his professional instincts told him he had discovered a real job and no mistake he made mrs wrigley go back and begin her story over again a task she was extremely ready to perform and took copious notes during the recital he impounded the document envelope and all crossexamined and browbeat his own witnessin fact did all a rising young lawyer ought to do and concluded in judicial tones very good mrs wrigley i think we can do something for you i think we know something of the parties leave it to us madam we will put you right i hope you will said the lady you see as ive been all the way up to liverpool and back i think i ought to be put right most certainly you ought and you shall be and to think of his brazenfaced impudence in calling me love young man theres a profligate for you samuel was knowing enough to see that it would greatly please the outraged lady if he took a special note of this disclosure which he accordingly did and then rising once more assured his client of his determination to put her right and bade her a very good morning well if that aint a go said he to himself as he returned to his desk i never did have much faith in the chap but i didnt fancy he was that sort cruden reginald eh nice boy you are never mind im dead on you this time nuisance it is that mas gone and mixed herself up with that lot cant be helped though business is business and such a bit of practice too cruden reginald but you dont get round sam shuckleford when hes once round your way my beauty to the legal mind of sam this transposition of reginalds name was in itself as good as a verdict and sentence against him any one else but himself might have been taken in by it but you needed to get up very early in the morning to take in a cute one like ss he said nothing about the affair to his principal when he returned preferring to nurse it as a little bit of business of his own which he would manage by himself for once in a way and that very evening fortune threw into his way a most unexpected and invaluable auxiliary he was down at his club smoking his usual evening pipe over the rocket when a man he had once or twice seen before in the place came up and said after you with that paper all serene said sam ill be done with it in about an hour you dont take long said the other considering im on the committee said sam with ruffled dignity ive a right to keep it just as long as i please are you a member here no but im introduced whats your name durfy oh youre the man who was in the rocket i heard of you from a friend of mine by the way and here his manner became quite civil as a brilliant idea occurred to him look here it was only my chaff about keeping the paper you can have it ill look at it afterwards all right thanks said durfy who felt no excuse for not being civil too by the way said sam as he was going off with the paper there was a fellow at your office what was his name nowcrowder crundell some name of that sorti forget cruden you mean perhaps said durfy with a scowl ah yescruden is he still with you what sort of chap is he durfy described him in terms far more forcible than affectionate and added no hes not there now oh no i kicked him out long ago but ive not done with him yet my boy sam felt jubilant was ever luck like his here was a man who evidently knew reginalds real character and could doubtless if properly handled put him on the scent and as he metaphorically put it to himself give him a clean leg up over the job so he called for refreshments for two and then entered on a friendly discourse with durfy on things in general and offered to make him a member of the club then bringing the conversation round to reginald he hinted gently that he too had his eye on that young gentleman and was at the present moment engaged in bowling him out whereupon durfy after a slight hesitation and stipulating that his name should not be mentioned in the matter gave sam what information he considered would be useful to him suppressing of course all mention of the real promoters of the select agency corporation and giving the secretary credit for all the ingenuity and cunning displayed in its operations the two new friends spent a most agreeable evening sam flattering himself he was squeezing durfy beautifully into the service of his big job and durfy flattering himself that this bumptious young pettifogger was the very person to get hold of to help him pay off all his old scores with reginald cruden chapter eighteen poverty and love both come in at the door we left reginald in a somewhat comfortable frame of mind after his interview with the pleasant clergyman and the stroke of business he had transacted on behalf of the corporation it had been refreshing to him to converse in terms of peace with any fellowmortal and the ready satisfaction of this visitor with the method of business adopted by the company went far to dispel the uneasy impressions which mrs wrigleys visit had left earlier in the day after all he felt that he was yet on probation when christmas came and he was able to discuss matters personally with the directors he had no doubt his position would be improved he flattered himself they might think he was useful enough to be worth while keeping and in that case of course he would have a right to ask to be put on rather more comfortable a footing than he possessed at present and to be entrusted with a certain amount of control over the business of the corporation he would also be able mildly to suggest that it would be more convenient to him to receive his salary monthly than quarterly so as to enable him not only to live respectably himself as became their secretary but also to give regular help to his mother at home as it was with a beggarly thirteen shillings a week to live on he was little better than a common officeboy he would have said to himself but at that particular moment the door opened and the very individual whom his thoughts connected with the words appeared before him it was the very last apparition reginald could have looked for he had given up all idea of seeing the young desperado any more though he could not exactly say poverty had come in at the door and love had flown out of the windowfor the young gentleman had departed by the doorhe yet had made up his mind that cupid had taken to himself wings and flown away with no intention of ever returning to the scene of his late struggle but a glance at the starved emaciated figure before him explained very simply the mystery of this strange apparition the boys hands and lips were blue with cold and his cheekbones seemed almost to protrude through his pallid grimy cheeks he looked in fact what he was the picture of misery and he had no need of any other eloquence to open the heart of his late governor say whats yer name he said in a hollow imitation of his old voice beg yer pardon govnorwont do it no more if yer overlook it this time come in out of the cold and warm yourself by the fire said reginald poking it up to a blaze the boy obeyed half timidly he seemed to be not quite sure whether reginald was luring him in to his own destruction but at any rate the sight of the fire roused him to heroism and reckless of all consequences he walked in dont do nothink to me this time govnor whimpered he as he got within arms length let us off do you hear this time poor boy said reginald kindly putting a stool for him close beside the fire im not going to do anything but warm you sit down and dont be afraid the boy dropped almost exhausted on the stool and gazed in a sort of rapture into the fire then looking up at reginald he said beg your pardon govnoraint got a crust of bread you dont want ave yer the hint was quite enough to send reginald flying to his little larder the boy devoured the bread set before him with a fierceness that looked as if he had scarcely touched food since he had gone away he made clear decks of all reginald had in the place and then slipping off the stool curled himself up on the floor before the fire like a dog and dropped off into a heavy sleep reginald took the opportunity to make a hurried excursion to the nearest provision shop to lay in what store his little means would allow he might have spared himself the trouble of locking the door behind him though for on his return the boy had never stirred the little sleeper lay there all night until in fact the coals could hold out no longer and the fire went out then reginald woke him and carried him off to his own bed where he dropped off into another long sleep which lasted till midday after partaking of the meal his benefactor had ready for him on waking he seemed more like himself and disposed to make himself useful aint got no envellups to lick then said he looking round the deserted room no theres nothing to do here just now said reginald the boy looked a little disappointed but said presently want any errands fetched govnor no not now ive got all i want in for the present like yer winders cleaned not much use with this frost on them said reginald thwarted thus on every hand the boy asked no more questions but took upon himself to go round the office and dust it as well as he could with the ragged tail of his coat it was evidently his way of saying thank you and he seemed more easy in his mind when it was done he stopped once in the middle of his task as he caught reginalds eyes fixed half curiously half pityingly upon him saygovnor i aint going to read no more books do ye hear there was something quite pathetic in the tones in which this declaration of renunciation was made it was evidently a supreme effort of repentance and reginald felt almost uncomfortable as he heard it that there noogate calendar made a rare flareup didnt it govnor continued love looking wistfully towards the grate if perchance any stray leaves should have escaped the conflagration not such a flareup as you did said reginald laughing never mind well try and get something nicer to read no fear never no more i aint agoin to read nothink again i tell yer said the boy quite warmly and for fear of wavering in his resolution he went round the room once more rubbing up the cheap furniture till it shone and ending with polishing up the very hearth that had served as the sacrificial altar to his beloved newgate calendar only a few days before there was little or no more work to be done during the day a few letters had come by the mornings post angrily complaining of the delay in delivering the promised goods to these reginald had replied in the usual form leaving to love the privilege of licking them up he also wrote to mr medlock enclosing the two pounds the pleasant clergyman had left the day before and once more urging that gentleman to come down to liverpool he went out happily unconscious of the fact that a detective dogged every step he took to post these letters himself and at the same time to lay in a days provisions for two it was with something like a qualm that he saw his last halfsovereign broken over this purchase with nine shillings left in his pocket and twelve days yet to christmas it was as clear as daylight that things were rapidly approaching a crisis it was almost a relief to feel it on his way back to the office he passed a secondhand bookstall he had lingered in front of it many times before now turning over the leaves of this and that odd volume and picking up the scraps of amusement and information which are always to be found in such an occupation today however he overhauled the contents of the trays with rather more curiosity than usual not because he expected to find a pearl of great price among the dust and dogs ears of the threepenny tray reginald was the last person in the world to consider himself a child of fortune in that respect no he had master love on his mind and the memory of that blazing newgate calendar on his conscience and even at the cost of a further reduction of his vanishing income he determined not to return provided with food for loves body only but also for loves mind accordingly he selected two very shabby and tattered volumes from the threepenny trayone a fragment of robinson crusoe the other part one of the pilgrims progress and with these in his pocket and the eatables in his hands he returned to his charge as proud as a general who has just relieved a starving garrison after the frugal supper the books were triumphantly produced but master love still mindful of his recent tribulations regarded them shyly at first as another possible bait to his own undoing but presently curiosity and the sight of a wonderful picture of giant despair overcame his scruples and he held out his hand eagerly it was amusing to watch the critical look on his face as he took a preliminary glance through the pages of the two books reginald was half sorry he had not produced them one at a time but it being too late now to recall either he awaited with no little excitement the decision of the young connoisseur upon them apparently love found considerable traces of what he would call jam in both the picture of crusoe coming upon the footprint in the sand and that of the great battle between christian and apollyon seemed to gather into themselves the final claims of the two rivals and for a few moments victory trembled in the balance at last he shut up robinson crusoe and stuffed it in his pocket say whats yer name said he looking up and laying his finger on the battle scene which of them two does for tother the one in the armour said reginald thought sotother ones a flat to fight with that there long flagpole soon as es chucked it away es a dead un say what did they do with is dead body no use a idin of it if i was im id a cut is throat and left the razor in is and and theyd a brought it in soosanside bless you coroners juries is reglar flats at findin out them sort of things suppose you read what it says said reginald hardly able to restrain a laugh if you like you can read it aloud id like to hear it again myself the boy agreed and that evening the two queerly assorted friends sat side by side in the dim candlelight going over the wonderful story of the pilgrim reginald judiciously steered the course through the most thrilling parts of the narrative carefully avoiding whatever might have seemed to the boy dull or digressive love stopped in his reading frequently to discuss the merits of the story and deliver himself of his opinion as to what he would have done under similar circumstances he would have made short work with the lions chained by the roadside he would have taken a bullseye lantern through the dark valley and as for the river at the end he couldnt understand anybody coming to grief there why at victoria park last whit monday he had swum threequarters of a mile himself in vain reginald pointed out that christian had his armour on the young critic would not allow this as an excuse and brought up cases of gentlemen of his acquaintance who had swum incredible distances in their clothes and boots but the story that delighted him most was that of the man who hacked his way into the palace this was an adventure after his own heart he read it over and over again and was unsparing in his admiration of the hero whom he compared for prowess with will warspite the pirate and dick turpin and even his late favourite tim tigerskin his interest in him was indeed so great that he allowed reginald in a few simple words to say what it meant and to explain how we could all if we went the right way about it do as great things as he did why you youngster when you made up your mind you wouldnt read any more of those bad books you knocked over one of your enemies did i though how far in did i get you got over the doorstep anyhow but youve got plenty more to knock over before you get right into the place so have i my eye govnor cried the boy his grimy face lighting up with an excited flush well let em ave it they read and discussed and argued far into the night and when at last reginald gave the order to go to bed there were no two friends more devoted than the secretary of the select agency corporation and his officeboy loves sleep that night was like the sleep of a pugilistic terrier who in his dreams encounters and overcomes even deepmouthed mastiffs and colossal saint bernards he sniffed and snorted defiance as he lay and his brow was damp with the sweat of battle and his lips curled with the smile of victory as soon as he awoke his hand sought the pocket where the wonderful book lay and even as he tidied up the office and prepared the govnors breakfast he was engaged in mortal inward combats say govnor cried he with jubilant face as reginald entered ive done for another of em topped him clean over another of whom said reginald them pals awaitin in the all said he you know in that there pallis oh in the beautiful palace we were reading about said reginald who have you done for this time that there medlock said the boy medlock what are you talking about said reginald in blank amazement oh ive give him a wonner said the boy beaming he says to me collar all the letters your govnor writes ome he says and ill give you a tanner for every one you shows me love youre talking rubbish said reginald indignantly are i dont you make no mistake said the boy confidently i knows what he says and that there letter you wrote home last night and leaves on the table thats a tanner to me says i to myself when i sees it this morning a lie says i recollecting of that chap in the story book so i lets it be and my eye aint that a topper for somebodyoh no reginald stared at the boy half stupefied the room whirled round him and with a sudden rush the hopes of his life seemed to go from under him it was not for some time that he could find words to say hoarsely love is this the truth or a lie you are telling me liedont you make no error govnori aint on that lay i can tell you im goin right into that there pallis and theres two on em topped aready you mean to say mr medlock told you to steal my letters and give them to him yes and a tanner apiece on em too but dont you be afraid he dont get none out of me not if i swings for it you can go out for a run love said reginald come back in an hour i want to be alone you arent agiving me the sack asked the boy with falling countenance no no and you aint agoin to commit soosanside while im gone are yer he inquired with a suspicious glance at reginalds blanched face no be quick and go cos if you do they do say as a charcoal fire will you go said reginald almost angrily and the boy vanished i need not describe to the reader all that passed through the poor fellows mind as he paced up and down the bare office that morning the floodgates had suddenly been opened upon him and he felt himself overwhelmed in a deluge of doubt and shame and horror it was long before he could collect his thoughts sufficiently to see anything clearly why mr medlock should take the trouble to prevent his home letters reaching their destination was incomprehensible and indeed it weighed little with him beside the fact that the man who had given him his situation and on whom he was actually depending for his living was the same who could bribe his officeboy to steal his letters if he were capable of such a meanness was he to be trusted in anything else how was reginald to know whether the money he had regularly remitted to him was properly accounted for or whether the orders were being conscientiously executed then it occurred to him the whole business of the corporation had been done in hisreginaldsname that all the circulars had been signed by him and that all the money had come addressed to him then there was that awkward mistake about his name which accidental or intentional was mr medlocks doing and beyond all that was the fact that mr medlock had taken away the only record reginald possessed of the names of those who had replied to the circulars and sent money he found himself confronted with a mountain of responsibility of which he had never before dreamed and for the clearing of which he was entirely dependent on the good faith of a man who had not a week ago played him one of the meanest tricks imaginable what was he to make of itwhat else could he make of it except that he was a miserable dupe with ruin staring him in the face his one grain of comfort was in the names of some of the directors unless that list were fictitious they would not be likely to allow a concern with which they were identified to collapse in discredit was it genuine or not his doubts on this question were very speedily resolved by a letter which arrived that very afternoon it was dated london and ran as follows cruden reginald esquire sirthe attention of the bishop of s having been called to the unauthorised and as it would appear fraudulent use of his name in connection with a company styled the select agency corporation of which you are secretary i am instructed before his lordship enters on legal proceedings to request you to furnish me with your authority for using his lordships name in the manner stated awaiting your reply by return i am sir yours etcetera a turner secretary this was a finishing stroke to the disillusion in all his troubles and perplexities the good bishop of s had been a rock to lean on for the poor secretary but now even that prop was snatched away and he was left alone in the ruins of his own hopes he could see it all at last as he went back over the whole history of his connection with the corporation he was able to recognise how at every step he had been duped and fooled how his very honesty had been turned to account how his intelligence had been the one thing disliked and discouraged and what was to become of him now anything but desert the sinking shipthat question never cost reginald two thoughts he would right himself if he could he would protest his innocence of all fraud or connivance at fraud he would even do what he could to bring the real offenders to justice but as long as the corporation had a creditor left he would be there to face him and suffer the consequence of his own folly and stupidity young love got little sympathy that day in his reading indeed he could not but notice that something unusual had happened to the govnor and that being so not even the adventures of christian or the unexplored marvels of robinson crusoe could satisfy him he polished up the furniture half a dozen times and watched reginalds eye like a dog ready to catch the first sign of a want or a question presently he could stand it no longer and saidsay govnor whats up taint nothing along of me are it no my boy said reginald is it along of that there medlock reginald nodded it was well for mr medlock that he was not in the room at that moment ill top im see if i dont muttered the boy i owes im one for carting me down ere and i owes im four or five now and youll see if i dont go for im govnor youd better go back to your home said reginald with a kindly tremor in his voice im afraid youll get into trouble by staying with me it was fine to see the flash of scorn in the boys face as he said oh yus me go ome and leave yer walkeri stays ere very well then said reginald with a sigh we may as well go on with the book suppose you read me about giant despair chapter nineteen the shades lose several good customers it would be unfair to samuel shuckleford to say that he had no compunction whatever in deciding upon a course of action which he knew would involve the ruin of reginald cruden he did not like it at all it was a nuisance it was a complication likely to hamper him he wished his mother and sister would be less gushing in the friendships they made what right had they to interfere with his business prospects by tacking themselves on to the family of a man who was afterwards to turn out a swindler yes it was a nuisance but for all that it must not be allowed to interfere with the course that lay before the rising lawyer business is business after all and if cruden is a swindler whose fault is it if crudens mother breaks her heart not sss at any rate but sss fault it would be if he made a mess of this big job that was a reproach no one should lay at his door samuel may not have been quite the solomon he was wont to estimate himself still to do him justice once more he displayed no little ability in tracing out the different frauds of the select agency corporation and establishing reginalds guilt conclusively in his own mind it all fitted in like a curious puzzle his sudden mysterious departure from londonhis change of namethe selection of liverpool as headquartersthe distribution of the circulars among unsuspecting schoolmistresses in the south of englandthe demand for money to be enclosed with the orderand the fiction of the dispatch of the goods from london what else could it point to but a deliberate deeplylaid scheme of fraud the further samuel went the clearer it all appeared and the less compunction he felt for running to earth such a scoundrel but he was going to do nothing in a hurry ss was not the man to dish himself by showing his cards till he was sure he had them all in his hand possibly cruden was not alone in the swindle he might have accomplices even his mother and brotherwho can answer for the duplicity of human naturemight know more of his operations than they professed to know he might have confederates among his old companions at the rocket or even among his old school acquaintances yes there was plenty to go into before samuel put down his foot and who knew better how to go into it than ss so he kept his own counsel and except for cautioning his mother and sister to draw off from the undesirable connection and intimidating the maidofallwork at number dull street by most horrible threats of the penalties of the law to detain and give to him every letter bearing the liverpool postmark which should from that time forward come to the house no matter to whom addressedfor in his zeal it was easy to forget that by such a proceeding he was sailing uncommonly close to the wind himselfshowed no sign of taking any immediate step either in this or any other matter had he been aware that one sniff of the liverpool detective police had some days ago arrived by a series of independent and far more artistic investigations at as much knowledge as he himself possessed of the doings of the corporation samuel would probably have been content to make the most of the cards he held before the chance of using them at all had slipped by it is doubtful however whether in any case he would have succeeded in forestalling the wary mr sniff that gentleman had discovered in a few hours what it had taken samuel days of patient grubbing to unearth and his discoveries would have decidedly astonished the selfcomplacent little practitioner he would have been astonished for instance to hear that the liverpool postoffice had received instructions from the home office to hand over every letter addressed to cruden reginald shy street to the police he would also have been astonished if he had known that a detective in plain clothes dined every evening at the shades near to the table occupied by mr durfy and his friends that the hallporter of weavers hotel was a representative of the police in disguise and that representatives of the police had called on business at the rocket office had brushed up against blandford at street corners and had even taken the trouble to follow himsamuel shucklefordhere and there in his evenings perambulations yes small job as it was in mr sniffs estimation he knew the way to go about it and had a very good notion what was the right scent to go on and what the wrong the one thing that did put him out at first was reginalds absolutely truthful replies to all the pleasant clergymans questions this really did bother mr sniff for when a swindler is face to face with his victim the very last thing you expect of him is straightforward honesty so when reginald had talked about weavers hotel and mr john smith and had mentioned the number of orders that had arrived and the account of money that had accompanied them and had even confided the amount of his own salary mr sniff had closed one of his mental eyes and said to himself yes we know all about that but when it turned out that so far from such statements being fabrications to delude him they were simply truewhen the letter reginald had written to mr medlock that very evening lay in his hands and corroborated all he had saidwhen he himself followed the poor fellow an hour or two later on his errand of mercy and stood beside him as he spent that precious sixpence over robinson crusoe and the pilgrims progress mr sniff did feel for a moment disconcerted but unusual as it was he made the bold venture of jumping to the conviction of reginalds innocence and that theory once started everything went beautifully on the evening following mrs crudens sudden illness mr durfy strolled down in rather a disconsolate frame of mind towards the shades since his expulsion from the rocket office things had not been going pleasantly with him for a day or two he had deemed it expedient to keep in retirement and when at last he did venture forth in the vague hope of picking up some employment worthy of his talents he took care to keep clear of the haunts of his former confederates whom after his last failure he rather dreaded meeting it had been during this period that he had made the acquaintance of shuckleford and the prospect of revenge which that intimacy opened to him was a welcome diversion to the monotony of his existence but prospects of revenge do not fill empty stomachs and durfy at the end of a week began to discover that there might be an end even to the private resources of the late overseer of an evening newspaper and the part proprietor of an agency corporation he was in fact getting hard up and therefore putting his pride in his empty pocket he strolled down moodily to the shades determined at any rate to have a supper at somebody elses expense he had not reckoned without his host for after about half an hours impatient kicking of his heels outside mr medlock and mr shanklin appeared on the scene arm in arm they appeared by no means elated at seeing him but that mattered very little to the hungry durfy who followed them into the supperroom and took his seat at the table beside them if he had been possessed of any sensitiveness it might have been wounded by the utter indifference after the first signs of displeasure they paid to his presence they continued their conversation as though no third party had been near and except that mr medlock nodded when the waiter said for three seemed to see as little of him as hamlets mother did of the ghost however for the time being that nod of mr medlocks was all durfy particularly coveted he was hungry time enough to stand on his dignity when the knife and fork had done their work yes said mr shanklin times up today ive told him where to find us if he doesnt you must go your trip by yourself i can safely stay and screw my man up think he will turn up cant say he seems to be flush enough of money still well he cant say youve not helped him to get rid of it ive done my best said mr shanklin laughing i shall be glad of a holiday its as hard work sponging one fool as it is fleecing a couple of hundred sheep eh well the wool came off very easily i must say i reckon therell be a clean l to divide on the liverpool business alone nice occupation thatll be on the boulogne steamer tomorrow said mr shanklin dear me i hope it wont be rough im such a bad sailor then of course said mr medlock therell be your little takings to add to that your working expenses cant have been much mr shanklin laughed again no ive done without circulars and a salaried secretary by the way do you fancy any one smells anything wrong up in the north yet bless you no the fellows pretty near starving and yet he sent me up a stray l he received the other day its as good as a play to read the letters he sends me up about getting the orders executed in strict rotation as entered in a beautiful register he kept and which i borrowed my boy ha ha he wants me to run down to liverpool he says as hes not quite satisfied with his position there ho ho and hed like a little money on account as hes had to buy stamps and coals and all that sort of thing out of his own thirteen shillings a week its enough to make one die of laughing isnt it it is funny said mr shanklin but youre quite right to be on the safe side and start tomorrow you did everything in his name i supposetook the office ordered the printing and all that sort of thing oh yes i took care of that my name or yours was never mentioned except mine on the dummy list of directors that wont hurt well the corporations had a short life and a merry one and your precious secretarys likely to have a merry christmas after it all unless youd like to go down and spend it with him durfy added mr shanklin taking notice for the first time of the presence of their visitor durfy replied by a scowl i shall be far enough away by then said he why where are you going im going with you to be sure said he doggedly messrs medlock and shanklin greeted this announcement with a laugh of genuine amusement im glad you told us said mr shanklin we should have forgotten to take a ticket for you you may grin said durfy im going for all that youre a bigger fool even than you look said mr medlock to think so you can consider yourself lucky to get a supper out of us this last night you forget i can make it precious awkward for you if i like growled durfy awkward youve a right to be a judge of whats awkward after the neat way youve managed things sneered shanklin it takes you all your time to make things awkward for yourself let alone troubling about us durfy always hated when mr shanklin alluded to his blunders and he scowled all the more viciously now because he felt that after all he could do little against his two patrons which would not recoil with twofold violence on his own head no he had better confine his reprisals to the crudens by mr shucklefords assistance and meanwhile make what he could out of these ungrateful sharpers if you dont want me with you said he youll have to make it worth my while to stay away thats all youd think it a fine joke if you found yourself in the policestation instead of the railwaystation to morrow morning wouldnt you and mr durfys face actually relaxed into a smile at this flash of pleasantry youd find it past a joke if you found yourself neckandcrop in the gutter in two minutes said mr shanklin in a rage as you will do if you dont take care ill take care for fifty pounds said durfy its precious little share ive had out of the business and if you want me mum thats what will do it there i could tell you a thing or two already you dont know tush durfy youre a born ass come round to my hotel tomorrow at eight and ill see what i can do for you said mr medlock durfy knew how to value such promises and did not look by any means jubilant at the prospect held out however at this moment blandford and pillans entered the supperroom and his hosts had something better to think about than him he was hustled from his place to make room for the new guests and surlily retired to a neighbouring table where if he could not hear all that was said he could at least see all that went on hullo said shanklin gaily heres a nice time to turn up dear boys medlock and i have nearly done supper couldnt help weve been to the theatre havent we pillans said blandford who appeared already to be rather the worse for drink i have youve been in the bar most of the time said pillans ha ha i was told bland was studying for the bar i do like application said mr medlock blandford seemed to regard this as a compliment and sitting down at the table told the waiter to bring a bottle of champagne and some more glasses well he said with a simper what i say ill do ill do i said id turn up here and pay you that bill shanklin and i have turned up havent i upon my honour id almost forgotten that bill said mr shanklin who had thought of little else for the last week its not inconvenient i hope blandford laughed stupidly sorry if a trifle like that was inconvenient said he with all the languor of a millionaire forget what it was about some take in ill swear never mind a debts a debt and here goes how much is it fifty said mr shanklin blandford produced a pocketbook with a flourish and took from it a handful of notes that made durfys eyes as he sat at the distant table gleam the halftipsy spendthrift was almost too muddled to count them correctly but finally he succeeded in extracting five tenpound notes from the bundle which he tossed to shanklin thanks very much said that gentleman putting them in his pocket i find ive left your bill at home but ill send it round to you in the morning oh all serene said blandford putting his pocketbook back into his pocket have another bottle of chamdojust to celebratesettling old scores hullo where are you pillans pillans had gone off to play billiards with mr medlock so blandford and mr shanklin attacked the bottle themselves when it was done the former rose unsteadily and bidding his friend goodnight said he would go home as hed got a headache which was about as true an observation as man ever uttered goodnightoldfeller said he see you tomorrow and he staggered out of the place assisted to the door by mr shanklin who after an affectionate farewell sauntered to the billiardroom where mr medlock had already won a fivepound note from the ingenuous mr pillans your friends in good spirits tonight said mr shanklin capital fellow is bland so he is said pillans capital fellow with plenty of capital eh said mr medlock your shoot pillans and i dont mind going a sov with you on the cannon of course pillans lost his sovereign as he did several others before the game was over then feeling he had had enough enjoyment for one evening he said goodbye and followed his friend home but some one else had already followed his friend home durfy in whose bosom the glimpse of that welllined pocketbook had roused unusual interest found himself ready to go home a very few moments after blandford had quitted the shades it may have been only coincidence or it may have been idle curiosity to see if the tipsy lad could find his way home without an accident or it may have been a laudable determination that no one should take advantage of his helpless condition to deprive him of that comfortable pocketbook whatever it was durfy followed the reeling figure along the pavement as it threaded its way westward from the shades blandford may have had reason enough left to tell him that it would be better for his headache to walk in the night air than to take a cab and mr durfy highly approved of the decision he was able without difficulty or obtrusiveness to follow his man at a few yards distance and even give proof of his solicitude by an occasional steadying hand on his arm presently the wanderer turned out of the crowded thoroughfare up a by street where he had the pavement more to himself indeed except for a few stragglers hurrying home from theatres or concerts he encountered no one and as he penetrated farther beyond the region of public houses and tobaccoshops into the serener realms of offices and chambers and beyond that into the solitude of a westend square not a footstep save his own and that of his escort broke the midnight silence durfys heart beat fast for he had a heart to beat on occasions like this a hundred chances on which he had never calculated suddenly presented themselves what if some one might be peering out into the night from one of the black windows of those silent houses suppose some motionless policeman under the shadow of a wall were near enough to see and hear suppose the cool night air had already done its work and sobered the wayfarer enough to render him obstinate or even dangerous he seemed to walk more steadily if anything was to be done every moment was of consequence and the risk the vision of that pocketbook and the crisp white notes flashed across durfys memory by way of answer yes to durfy the outcast the dupe the baffled adventurer the risk was worth running he quickened his step and opened the blade of the penknife in his pocket as he did so not that he meant to use it but in case faugh the fellow was staggering as helplessly as ever he never even heeded the pursuing steps but reeled on muttering to himself now close to the palings now on the kerb his hat back on his head and the cigar between his lips not even alight durfy crept silently behind and with a sudden dash locked one arm tightly round his victims neck while with the other he made a swift dive at the pocket where lay the coveted treasure it was all so quickly done that before blandford could exclaim or even gasp the pocketbook was in the thiefs hands then as the arm round his neck was relaxed he faced round terribly sobered and made a wild spring at his assailant thief he shouted making the quiet square ring and ring again with the echo of that word his hand was upon durfys collar so fiercely that nothing but a hand tohand struggle could release its grip unless durfys hand dropped to his pocket there was a flash and a scream and next moment blandford was clinging groaning to the railings of the square while durfys footsteps died away in the gloomy mazes of a network of back streets when pillans got home to his lodgings that night he found his comrade in bed with a severe wound in the shoulder unable to give any account of himself but that he had been first garotted then robbed and finally stabbed on his way home from the shades mr durfy did not present himself at mr medlocks hotel at the appointed hour next morning nor although it was a fine calm day and their luggage was all packed up and labelled did mr medlock and his friend mr shanklin succeed in making their promised trip across the channel a deputation of police awaited them on the victoria platform and completely disconcerted their arrangements by taking them in a cab to the nearest policestation on a charge of fraud and conspiracy chapter twenty samuel shuckleford finds virtue its own reward it was just as well for horaces peace of mind during his time of anxious watching that two short paragraphs in the morning papers of the following day escaped his observation atpolicecourt yesterday two men named medlock and shanklin were brought before the magistrate on various charges of fraud connected with sham companies in different parts of the country after some formal evidence they were remanded for a week bail being refused a youth named reginald was yesterday charged at liverpool with conspiracy to defraud by means of fictitious circulars addressed in the name of a trading company he was remanded for three days without bail pending inquiries it so happened that it fell to boomss lot to cut the latter paragraph out and as he was barely aware of the existence of crudens brother and in no case would have recognised him by his assumed name the news even if he read it could have conveyed no intelligence to his mind horace certainly did not read it even when he had nothing better to do he always regarded newspapers as a discipline not to be meddled with out of office hours and just now with his mother lying in a critical condition and with no news day after day of reginald he had more serious food for reflection than the idle gossip of a newspaper the only other person in london whom the news could have interested was samuel shuckleford but as he was that morning riding blithely in the train to liverpool reading the law times and flattering himself he would soon make the public sit up to a recognition of his astuteness he saw nothing of them he found himself on the liverpool platform just where scarcely three months ago reginald had found himself that dreary afternoon of his arrival but unlike reginald it cost the young ornament of the law not a moments hesitation as to whether he should take a cab or not to his destination if only the cabman knew whom he had the honour to carry how he would touch up his horse shy street put me down at the corner said samuel swinging himself into the hansom so this was liverpool he had never been there before and consequently it was not to be wondered at that the crowds jostling by on the pavement without so much as a glance in his direction neither knew him nor had heard of him he could forgive them and smiled to think how different it would be in a few days when all the world would point at him as he drove back to the station and say there goes shuckleford the clever lawyer who first exposed the select agency corporation dont you know dont you know what a question to ask respecting ss at the corner of shy street he alighted and sauntered gently down the street keeping a sharp lookout on both sides of him without appearing to regard anything but the pavement humph the odd numbers were on the left side so ss would walk on the right and get a good survey of number from a modest distance what thought he would the precious cruden reginald ha ha think if he knew who was walking down the other side of the road ah he was getting near it now here was a bakers a greengrocers and eh a chemists ah yes he noticed that the first floors of all the shops were let for offices and the first floor of the chemists shop was the place he wanted he could see through the grimy window the top rail of a chairback and the corner of a table on which stood an inkpot and a tattered directory no occupant of the room was visible doubtless he found it prudent to keep away from the window or he might possibly have seen the figure of ss advancing down the street samuel crossed over no name was on the chemists sidedoor but it stood ajar and he pushed it open and peered up the gloomy staircase there was a name on the door at the top so he crept stealthily up the stairs to decipher the word medlock in dim characters on the plate medlock ho ho he was getting warm now not only was his man going about with his own name turned inside out but he had the effrontery to stick up the name of one of his own directors on his door samuel knew mr medlockwhom didnt he know he had been introduced to him by durfy and had supped with him once at the shades a nice pleasantspoken gentleman who had made some very complimentary little speeches about samuel in samuels own hearing this was the man whose name cruden had borrowed for his doorplate in the hope of further mystifying the public as to his own personality ah ah he might mystify the public but there was one whose initials were ss whom it would need a cleverer cheat than cruden reginald esquire to mystify he listened for a moment at the door and hearing no sound made bold to enter had reginald been in he was prepared to represent that being on a chance visit to liverpool he had been unable to pass the door of an old neighbour without giving him a friendly call but he was not put to this shift for the room was empty gone out to his dinner i suppose said sam to himself well ill take a good look round while i am here which he proceeded to do much to his own satisfaction but very little to his information for scarcely a tornup envelope was to be found to reward the spy for his trouble the only thing that did attract his attention as likely to be remotely useful was a fragment of a pink paper with the letters gerskin on ita relic love would have recognised as part of the cover of an old favourite but which to the inquiring mind of the lawyer appeared to be a document worth impounding in the interests of justice as nobody appeared after the lapse of half an hour samuel considered his time was being wasted and therefore withdrew he looked into the chemists shop as he went down but the chemist was not at home so he strolled into the greengrocers next door and bought an orange which he proceeded to consume making himself meanwhile cunningly agreeable to the lady who presided over the establishment fine christmas weather said he looking up in the middle of a prolonged suck yes said the lady plenty of customers she shrugged her shoulders sam might interpret that as he liked i suppose you supply the corporation next door said sam digging his countenance once more into the orange eh said the lady thewhatshisnamemr reginaldi suppose he deals with you he did if you want to know i thought soa friend of mine you know oh is he said the lady finding words at last and bridling up in a way that astonished her crossexaminer then the sooner you go and walk off after him the better oh very well said sam hes not at home just now though oh aint he said the woman thats funny why what do you mean oh nothingwhat should i if youre a friend of his youd better take yourself off thats what i mean all right no offence old lady perhaps hes come in by this time the lady laughed disagreeably the corporation had bought coals of her three months ago samuel returned to the office but it was as deserted as ever he therefore resolved to try what his blandishments could do with the chemists boy downstairs in the way of obtaining information that young gentleman as the reader will remember had been a bosom friend of love in his day and was animated to some extent by the spirit of his comrade hullo my man said sam walking into the shop governors out then yus got any lollipops in those bottles yus any brandyballs no any aciddrops yus ill take a pennorth then i suppose you dont know when the gentleman upstairs will be back the boy stopped short in his occupation and stared at sam what gentleman he asked mr medlock is it or reginald or some name like that oh yus i do said the boy with a grin when six months all but a day thats what i reckon six months has he gone away then oh nohe was took off took offyou dont mean to say hes dead oh aint you a rum un as if you didnt know hes been beaked beaked whats that the boy looked disgusted at the fellows obtuseness ad up in the plicecourt of course what else could i mean samuel jumped off his stool as if he had been electrified what do you say said he gaping wildly at the boy go on if youre deaf its no use talkin to you hes been up in the plicecourt said he raising his voice to a shout yesterdaythere you areand theres your drops and you aint give me the penny for them samuel threw down the penny and too excited to take up the drops dashed out into the street what yesterdaywhile he was lounging about town fancying he had the game all to himself was ever luck like his he rushed to a shop and bought a morning paper there sure enough was a short notice of yesterdays proceedings and you might have knocked ss down with a feather as he read it anyhow said he to himself crumpling up the paper in sheer vexation they wont be able to do without me ill take care of that i can tell them all about itbut catch me doing it now the snobs unless theyre civil with which valiant determination he swung himself into another cab and ordered the man to drive to the head policestation the inspector was not in but his secondincommand was and to him much against his will samuel had to explain his business well what do you know about the prisoner asked the official oh plenty youd better subpoena me for the next examination said sam the subinspector smiled youre like all the rest of them he said think you know all about it come lets hear what youve got to say young fellow theres plenty of work to be done here i can tell you without dawdling our time thank you said sam id sooner tell the magistrate go and tell the magistrate then shouted the official and dont stay blocking up the room here this was not what samuel expected there was little chance of the magistrate being more impressed with his importance than a sub inspector so he felt the only thing for it was to bring himself to the unpleasant task of showing his cards after all the fact is he began if youre going to say what you know about the case ill listen to you said the subinspector interrupting him if not go and talk in the street i am going to say what i know said the crestfallen sam very well its a pity you couldnt do it at first said the official getting up and standing with his back turned warming his hands at the fire under these depressing circumstances samuel began his story showing his weakest cards first and saving up his trumps as long as he could the subinspector listened to him impassively rubbing his hands and warming first one toe and then the other in the fender at length it was all finished and he turned round thats all you know yesat presenti expect to discover more though in a day or two just write your name and address on one of those envelopes said the subinspector pointing to a stationery case on his table sam obeyed and handed the address to the official very well said the latter folding the paper up without looking at it and putting it into his waistcoat pocket if we want you well fetch you i suppose i had better put my statement down in writing said samuel making a last effort at pomposity can if you like said the subinspector yawning when youve nothing else to do and he ended the conference by calling to a constable outside to tell c he might come in grievously crestfallen samuel withdrew bemoaning the hour when he first heard the name of cruden and was fool enough to dirty his hands with a big job what else was he to expect when once these official snobs took a thing up of course they would put every obstacle and humiliation in the way of an outsider that jealousy could suggest he had very little doubt that this subinspector the moment his back was turned would sit down and make notes of his information and then take all the credit of it to himself never mind they were bound to want him when the trial came on and wouldnt he just show up their tricks oh no ss wasnt going to be flouted and snubbed for nothing he could tell them and so theyd discover it was no use staying in liverpool that was clear the liverpool police should have the pleasure of fetching him all the way from london when they wanted him and possibly with durfys aid he might succeed in getting hold of another trumpcard meanwhile to turn up when they least expected it the journey south next day was less blithe and less occupied with the law times than the journey north had been but as he got farther away from inhospitable liverpool his spirits revived and before london was reached he was once more in imagination the clever lawyer shuckleford dont you know who gave the liverpool police a slap in the face over that agency corporation business dont you know two dont you knows this time on reaching home any natural joy he might be expected to feel on being restored to the bosom of his family was damped by the discovery that his mother was that very moment in next door relieving guard with miss crisp at the bedside of mrs cruden what business has she to do it when i told her not demanded sam wrathfully of his sister shes not bound to obey you said jemima shes your mother she is and a nice respectable mother too to go mixing with a lot of low swindling jailbirds its sickening youve no right to talk like that sam said jemima flushing up theyre as honest as you aremore so perhaps there go it say on said samuel all i can tell you is if you dont both of you turn the cruden lot up ill go and live in lodgings by myself why should we turn them or anybody up for you i should like to know said jemima with a toss of her head what have they done to you youre an idiot said sam or you wouldnt talk bosh your dear reginald well what about him said jemima her trembling lip betraying the inward flutter with which she heard the name how would you like to know your precious reginald was this moment in prison what shrieked jemima with a clutch at her brothers arm he was glad to see there was some one he could make sit up and replied with brutal directness yesin prison i tell you charged with swindling and theft ever since he set foot in liverpool there if thats not reason enough for turning them up i give you up you can tell mother so and say im down at the club and shed better leave supper up for me do you hear jemima did not hear she sat rocking herself in her chair and sobbing as if her heart would break vulgar young person as she was she had a heart and quite apart from everything else the thought of the calamity which had befallen the fatherless family was in itself enough to move her deep pity but when to that was added her own strange but constant affection for reginald himself despite all his aversion to her it was a blow that fell heavily upon her she would not believe reginald was guilty of the odious crimes sam had so glibly catalogued but guilty or not guilty he was in prison and it is only due to the honest warmhearted jemima to say that she wished a hundred times that wretched evening that she could be in his place but could nothing be done she knew it was no use trying to extract any more particulars from samuel as it was she guessed only too truly that he would be raging with himself for telling her so much her mother could do nothing she would probably fly with the news to mrs crudens bedside and possibly kill her outright horace she might tell him but she was afraid the news would fall on him like a thunderbolt and she dreaded being the person to inflict the blow yet he ought to knew even if it doubled his misery and ended in no good to reginald suppose she wrote to him at that moment a knock came at the door followed by the entrance of booms in all the gorgeousness of his evening costume he frequently dropped in like this especially since mrs crudens illness to hear how she was and to inquire after miss crisp and this was his errand this evening no better i suppose said he dolefully sitting down very slowly by reason of the tightness of his garments yes the doctor says shes better a little a very little said jemima and she of course shes quite knocked up said he with a groan no miss crisps taking a nap thats all and mothers keeping watch next door booms sat very uncomfortably not knowing what fresh topic to discourse on but an inspiration seized him presently oh i see youre crying he said youre in trouble too so i am said jemima something ive done i suppose said booms no it isnt its aboutabout the crudens oh of course what about them well isnt it bad enough they have this dreadful trouble said jemima but it isnt half the trouble they really are in you know i cant understand what you mean when you talk like that said booms will you promise if i tell you to keep it a secret oh of course i hate secrets but go on oh mr booms mr reginald is in prison at liverpool on a chargea false charge im certainof fraud isnt it dreadful and mr horace ought to know of it could you break it to him how can i keep it a secret and break it to him said mr booms in a pained tone oh yes ill try if you like oh thank you do it very gently and be sure not to let my mother or his or anybody else hear of it wont you ill try of course every one will put all the blame on me if it does spread no i wont do it first thing tomorrow wont you mr booms oh yes and then as if determined to be in time for the interview he added id better go now and he departed very like a man walking to the gallows shuckleford returned at midnight and found the supper waiting for him but to his relief neither of the ladies he wrote the following short note before he partook of his evening meal dear dcome round first thing in the morning the police have dished us for once but well be quits with them if we put our heads together be sure and come yours s s after having posted this eloquent epistle with his own hand at the pillarbox he returned to his supper and then went somewhat dejected to bed chapter twenty one reginald finds himself dismissed with a caution there is a famous saying of a famous modern poet which runs sudden the worst turns the best to the brave and so it was with reginald cruden when finally the whole bitter truth of his position broke in upon his mind if the first sudden shock drove him into the dungeon of giant despair a nights quiet reflection and the consciousness of innocence within helped him to shake off the fetters and emerge bravely and serenely from the crisis he knew he had nothing to be proud ofnothing to excuse his own folly and shortsightednessnothing to flatter his selfesteem but no one could accuse him of dishonour or point the finger of shame in his way so he rose next morning armed for the worst what that would be he could not say but whatever it was he would face it confident in his own integrity and the might of right to clear him he endeavoured in a few words to explain the position of affairs to love who was characteristically quick at grasping it and suggesting a remedy that there medlocks got to be served and no error he said ill murder im nonsense said reginald you cant make things right by doing wrong yourself and you know you wouldnt do such a thing do i know tell you i would govnor id serve him just like that there pollyon in the book or else id put rat pison in his beer andmy wouldnt it be a game to see the tetnus acomin on im and be quiet said reginald i wont allow you to talk like that its as bad as the tim tigerskin days love and weve both done with them youre right there said the boy pulling his pilgrims progress from his pocket my dont i wish i had the feller to myself in the slough o despond wouldnt i old is ead under oh no not me none o yer mr elpses to give im a leg out if i knows it perhaps hell get punished enough without us said reginald it wouldnt do us any good to see him suffering wouldnt it though would me i can tell yer said the uncompromising love it was evidently hopeless to attempt to divert his young champions mind into channels of mercy reginald therefore for lack of anything else to do suggested to him to go on with the reading aloud a command the boy obeyed with alacrity starting of his own accord at the beginning of the book so the two sat there and followed their pilgrim through the perils and triumphs of his way each acknowledging in his heart the spell of the wonderful story and feeling himself a braver man for every step he took along with the valiant christian the morning went by and noon had come and still the boy read on until heavy footsteps on the stairs below startled them both and sent a quick flush into reginalds cheeks it needed no divination to guess what it meant and it was almost with a sigh of relief that he saw the door open and a policeman enter he rose to his feet and drew himself up as the man approached is your name cruden reginald said the officer no its reginald cruden you call yourself cruden reginald i have done so yes then i must trouble you to come along with me young gentleman very well said reginald quietly what am i charged with conspiracy to defraud thats whats on the warrant are you ready now yes quite ready where are you going to take me well we shall have to look in at the station on our way and then go on to the policecourt wont take long bound to remand you you know for a week or something like that and then youll get committed and the assizes are on directly after the new year so three weeks from now will see it all over the man talked in a pleasant civil way in a tone as if he quite supposed reginald might be pleased to hear the programme arranged on his behalf wed better go said reginald moving towards the door his face was very white and determined but there was a telltale quiver in his tightlypressed lips which told that he needed all his courage to help him through the ordeal before him till this moment the thought of having to walk through liverpool in custody had not entered into his calculations and he recoiled from it with a shiver i neednt trouble you with these said the policeman taking a pair of handcuffs from his pocket not yet anyhow oh no ill come quite quietly all right ive my mate below you can walk between hulloa this last exclamation was addressed to master love who having witnessed thus much of the interview in a state of stupefied bewilderment now recovered his presence of mind sufficiently to make a furious dash at the burly policeman do you hear let him be let my governor go he aint done nothink to you or nobody its me i tell yer ive murdered dozens do you ear and robbed the till and set the manshing ouse o fire do you ear you let im go its me done it and he accompanied the protest with such a furious kick at the policemans leg that that functionary grew very red in the face and making a grab at the offender seized him by the collar dont hurt him please said reginald he doesnt mean any harm tell you its me cried the boy trembling in the grasp of the law me and that there medlock my govnor aint done it hush be quiet love said reginald itll do no good to make a noise it cant be helped goodbye the boy fairly broke down and began to blubber piteously reginald unmanned enough as it was had not the heart to wait longer and walked hurriedly to the door followed by the policeman this movement once more raised the faithful love to a final effort let im go do you ear shouted he rushing down the stairs after them ill do for yer if you dont oh guvnor take me too cant yer but reginald could only steel his heart for once and feign not to hear the appeal the other policeman was waiting outside and between his two custodians he walked sick at heart and faltering in courage longing only to get out of the reach of the curious critical eyes that turned on him from every side and beyond the sound of that pitiful whimper of the faithful little friend as it followed him step by step to the very door of the policestation at the station mr sniff awaited the party with a pleasant smile of welcome thats right said he to reginald encouragingly much better to come quietly looks better look here young fellow he added rather more confidentially the first question youll be asked is whether youre guilty or not take my advice and make a clean breast of it i shall say not guilty which will be the truth mr sniff as the reader has been told had already come to the same conclusion still it being the rule of his profession always to assume a man to be guilty till he can prove himself innocent he felt it was no business of his to assist the magistrate in coming to the decision by stating what he thought all he had to do was to state what he knew and meanwhile if the prisoner choose to simplify matters by pleading guilty well why shouldnt he please yourself about that have you made your entries jones the van will be here directly see you later on added he nodding to reginald reginald waited there for the van like a man in a dream people came in and out spoke laughed looked about them even mentioned his name but they all seemed part of some curious pageant of which he himself formed not the least unreal portion his mind wandered off on a hundred little insignificant topics snatches of the pilgrims progress came into his mind halfforgotten airs of music crossed his memory the vision of young gedge as he last saw him fleeted before his eyes he tried in vain to collect his thoughts but they were hopelessly astray leaving him for the time barely conscious and wholly uninterested in what was taking place around him the van came at last a vehicle he had often eyed curiously as it rumbled past him in the streets little had he ever dreamed of riding one day inside it the usual knot of loungers waited at the door of the policecourt to see the van disgorge its freight sometimes they had been rewarded for their patience by the glimpse of a real murderer or wifekicker or burglar and sometimes they had had their bit of fun over a tough customer who if he must travel at her majestys expense was determined to travel all the way and insisted on being carried by the arms and legs across the pavement into the tribunal of justice there was no such fun to be got out of reginald as he stepped hurriedly from the van and with downcast eyes entered by the prisoners door into the courthouse a case was already in progress and he had to wait in a dimlylit underground lobby for his summons the constable who had arrested him was still beside him and other groups mostly of police filled up the place but he heeded none longingoh how intenselyto hear his name called and to know the worst presently there was a bustle near the door and he knew the case upstairs was at an end six months some one said some one else whistled softly whewold fogeys in one of his tantrums then hed have only got three at dark street then some one called the name reginald and the policeman near him said coming then turning to the prisoner he said fogeys on the bench today and hes particular look alive reginald found himself being hurried to the door through a lane of officials and others towards the stairs your turn next grinder he heard some one say as he passed ten minutes will do this case to reginald the stairs seemed interminable there was a hum of voices above and a shuffling of feet as of people taking a momentary relaxation in the interval of some performance then a loud voice cried silenceorder in the court sit down gentlemen and there fell an unearthly stillness on the place to the right said the policeman coming beside him and taking his arm as if to direct him he was conscious of a score of curious faces turned on him of some one on the bench folding up a newspaper and adjusting his glasses of a man at a table throwing aside a quill pen and taking another of a click of a latch closing behind him of a row of spikes in front of him then he found himself alone what followed he scarcely could tell he was vaguely aware of some one with mr sniffs voice making a statement in which his reginalds own name occurred another voice from the bench breaking in every now and then and yet another voice from the table talking too accompanied by the squeaking of a pen across paper then the constable who had arrested him said something and after the constable some one else then followed a dialogue in undertone between the bench and the table and once more mr sniffs voice and at last the voice from the bench a gruff unsympathetic voice said now sir what have you got to say for yourself the question roused him it was intended for him and he awoke to the consciousness that after all he had some interest in what was going on he raised his head and said im not guilty you reserve your defence then tell him yes said the policeman yes sir very well then i shall remand you for three days bring him up again on friday and the magistrate took up his newspaper the clerk at the table laying down his pen the bustle and shuffling of feet filled the room and in another moment reginald was down the staircase and the voice he had heard before called remand three days now then grinder up you go in all his conjectures as to what might befall him the possibility of being actually sent to prison had never entered reginalds head that he would be suspected arrested taken to the policestation and finally brought before a magistrate he had foreseen that was bad enough but he had steeled his resolution to the pitch of going through with it sure that the clearing of his character would follow any inquiry into the case but to be lodged for three days as a common felon in a police cell was a fate he had not once realised and which when its full meaning broke upon him crushed the spirit out of him he made no resistance no protest no complaint as they hustled him back into the van and from the van to the cell which was to be his dreary lodging for those three days he felt degraded dishonoured disgraced and as he sat hour after hour brooding over his lot his mind already overwrought lost its courage and let go its hope suppose he really had done something to be ashamed of suppose he had all along had his vague suspicions of the honesty of the corporation and yet had continued to serve them suppose with the best of intentions he had shut his eyes wilfully to what he might and must have seen suppose in fact his negligence had been criminal how was he ever to hold up his head again and face the world like an honest man and say he had defrauded no man and then there came up in terrible array that long list of customers to the corporation whom he had lured and enticed by promises he had never taken the trouble to inquire into to part with their money and the burden of their loss lay like an incubus on his spirit till he actually persuaded himself he was guilty i need not sadden the reader with dwelling on the misery of those three days any one almost could have endured them better than reginald he began a letter to horace but he tore it up when halfwritten he drew up a statement of his own defence but when fact after fact appeared in array on the paper it seemed more like an indictment than a defence and he tore it up too at length the weary suspense was over and once more he found himself in the outer air stepping with almost familiar tread across the pavement into the van and taking his place among the waiters in the dim lobby at the foot of the policecourt stairs when at last he stood once more in the dock none of his former bewilderment remained to befriend him it was all too real this time when some one spoke of the prisoner he knew it meant himself and when they spoke of fraud he knew they referred to something he had done oh that he could see it all in a dream once more and wake up to find himself on the other side now mr sniff youve got something to say said the magistrate yes your worship replied mr sniff not moving to the witnessbox but speaking from his seat we dont propose to continue this case what its a clear case isnt it said the magistrate with the air of a man who is being trifled with no your worship theres not evidence enough to ask you to send the prisoner to trial then id better sentence him myself i think not your worship our evidence only went to show that the prisoner was in the employment of the men who started the company but we have no evidence that he was aware that the concern was fraudulent and as he does not appear to have appropriated any of the money we advise dismissing the case the real offenders are in custody and have practically admitted their guilt the magistrate looked very illtempered and offended he did not like being told what he was told especially by the police and he had a righteous horror of cases being withdrawn from his authority he held a snappish consultation with his clerk which by no means tended to pacify him for that functionary whispered his opinion that as the case had been withdrawn there was nothing for it but for his worship to dismiss the case somebody at any rate should smart for his injured feelings and as he did not know law enough to abuse mr sniff and had not pretext sufficient to abuse his clerk he gathered himself for a castigation of the prisoner which should not only serve as a caution to that youth for his future guidance but should also relieve his own magisterial mind now prisoner began he setting his spectacles and leaning forward in his seat youve heard what the officer has said you may consider yourself fortunatevery fortunatethere is not enough evidence to convict you dont flatter yourself that a breakdown in the prosecution clears your character in the eyes of the law you may be clear but morally let me tell you you are far from being so its affectation to tell me you could live for three months the centre of a system of fraud and yet have your hands clean you must make good your account between your own conscience and the hundreds of helpless unfortunate poor men and women you have been the means of depriving of their hard earned money you have already been kept in prison for three days let me hope that will be a warning to you not to meddle in future with fraud if you wish to pass as an honest man if you touch pitch sir you must expect to be denied return to paths of honesty young man and seek to recover the character you have forfeited and bear in mind the warning you have had if you wish to avoid a more serious stain in the future the case is dismissed with which elegant peroration the magistrate much relieved in his own mind took up his newspaper and reginald was hurried once more down those steep stairs a free man slice of luck for you young shaver said the friendly policeman slipping off the handcuffs regular one of sniffs little games said another standing near he always lets his little fish go when hes landed his big ones to my mind its a risky business never mind you can go when you like now said the policeman to reginald and whenever we come across a shilling for a drink well drink your health my lad reginald saw the hint and handed the policeman one of his last shillings then buttoning his coat against the cold winter wind he walked out a free man into the street chapter twenty two the darkest hour before the dawn if the worshipful magistrate flattered himself that the reprimand he had addressed to reginald that afternoon would move his hearer to self abasement or penitence he had sadly miscalculated the power of his own language every word of that caution had entered like iron into the boys soul and had roused in him every evil passion of which his nature was capable a single word of sympathy or kindly advice might have won him heart and soul but those stinging brutal sentences goaded him almost to madness and left him desperate what was the use of honesty of principle of conscientiousness if they were all with one accord to rise against him and degrade him what was the use of trying to be better than others when the result was an infamy which had he been a little more greedy or a little less upright he might have avoided what was the use of conscious innocence and unstained honour when they could not save him from a sense of shame of which no convicted felon could know the bitterness it would go out to all the world that reginald cruden the suspected swindler had been let off for lack of evidence after three days imprisonment the victims of the corporation would read it and regret the failure of justice to overtake the man who had robbed them his fathers old county friends would read it and shake their heads over poor crudens prodigal the wilderham fellows would read it and set him down as one more who had gone to the bad young gedge would read it and scorn him for a hypocrite and a humbug durfy would read it and chuckle his mother and horace would read it yes and what would they think nothing he could say would convince them or anybody they might forgive him but the thought made his blood boil within him he would take forgiveness from no man or woman if they chose to believe him guilty let them but let them keep their forgiveness to themselves rather let them give the dog a bad name and hang him he did not care would that they could such was the rush of thought that passed through his mind as he stood that bleak winter afternoon in the street a free man free he laughed at the word and envied the burglar with his six months what spirit of malignity had hindered mr sniff from letting him lose himself in a felons cell rather than turn him out free into a world every creature of which was an enemy are you disgusted with him reader with his poor spirit his weak purpose his blind folly do you say that you in his shoes would have done better that you would never have lost courage that you would have held up your head still and braved the storm alas alas that the reginalds are so many and the heroes of your sort so few alas for the sensitive natures whom injustice can crush and make cowards of you are not sensitive thank god and you do not know what crushing is pray that you never may but till you have felt it deal leniently with poor reginald as he goes recklessly out into the winter gloom without a friendnot even himself it mattered little to him where he went or what became of him it made no odds how and when he should spend his last shilling he was hungry now since early that morning nothing had passed his lips why not spend it now and have done with it so he turned into a coffeeshop and ordered coffee and a plate of beef my last meal said he to himself with a bitter smile his appetite failed him when the food appeared but he ate and drank out of sheer bravado his enemiesdurfy and the magistrate and the victims of the corporationwould rejoice to see him turn with a shudder from his food he would devour it to spite them how much said he when it was done ninepence please said the rosycheeked girl who waited reginald tossed her the shilling keep the change for yourself said he and walked out of the shop he was free now with a vengeance he might do what he liked go where he liked starve where he liked he wandered up and down the streets that winter evening recklessly indifferent to what became of him the shops were gaily lighted and adorned with christmas decorations boys and girls men and women thronged them eager in their purchases and radiant in the prospect of the coming festival there went a grave father parading the pavement with a football under his arm for the boy at home and here a lad with his mothers arm in his stood halted before an array of fur cloaks and bade her choose the best among them brighteyed schoolgirls brushed past him with their brothers smiling and talking in holiday glee and here a trio of schoolchums arminarm bore down upon him laughing over some lastterm joke he watched them all times were when his heart would warm and soften within him at the memories sights like these inspired but they were nothing to him now or if they were anything they were part of a universal conspiracy to mock him let them mock him what cared he the night drew on one by one the gay lights in the shops went out and the shutters hid the crowded windows one by one the passengers dispersed some to besiege the railwaystations some to invade the trams others to walk in cheery parties by the frosty roads all to go home even the weary shopmen and shopgirls released from the days labours hurried past him homeward and the sleepy cabman whipped up his horse for his last fare before going home and the tramps and beggars vanished down their alleys and sought every man his home home the word had no meaning tonight for reginald as he watched the streets empty and found himself a solitary wayfarer in the deserted thoroughfares the hum of traffic ceased one by one the bedroom lights went out the clocks chimed midnight clearly in the frosty air and still he wandered on he passed a newspaperoffice where the thunder of machinery and the glare of the caseroom reminded him of his own bitter apprenticeship at the rocket they might find him a job here if he applied faugh who would take a gaolbird a letoff swindler into their employ he strolled down to the docks the great river lay asleep the docks were deserted the dockyards silent only here and there a darting light or the distant throb of an engine broke the slumber of the scene a man came up to him as he stood on the jetty now then sheer off do you hear he said what do you want here maynt i watch the river said reginald not here weve had enough of your sort watching the river off you go and he laid his hand on the boys collar and marched him off the pier of course who had not had enough of his sort who would not suspect him wherever he went cain went about with a mark on his forehead for every one to know him by in what respect was he better off when men seemed to know by instinct and in the dark that he was a character to mistrust and suspect the hours wore on even the printingoffice when he passed it again was going to rest the compositors one by one were flitting home and the engine was dropping asleep he stood and watched the men come out and wondered if any of them were like himselfwhether among them was a young gedge or a durfy then he wandered off back into the heart of the town a wretched outcast woman with a child in her arms stood at the street corner and accosted him do kind gentleman give me a penny the childs starving and were so cold and hungry id give you one if i had one said reginald but im as poor as you are the woman sighed and drew her rags round the infant reginald watched her for a moment and then taking off his overcoat said youd better put this round you and he dropped it at her feet and hurried away before she could pick up the gift or bless the giver he gave himself no credit for the deed and he wanted none what did he care about a coat he who had been frozen to the heart already would a coat revive his good name or cover the disgrace of that magisterial caution the clocks struck four and the long winter night grew bleaker and darker it was eleven hours since he had taken that last defiant meal and nature began slowly to assert her own with the poor outcast he was faint and tired out and the breeze cut him through still the rebel spirit within him denied that he was in distress no food or rest or shelter for him all he craved was leave to lose himself and forget his own name is it any use bidding him as we bade him once before turn round and face the evil genius that is pursuing him or is there nothing for him now but to run he has run all night but he is no farther ahead than when he stood at the policecourt door on the contrary it is running him down fast and as he staggers forward into the darkest hour of that cruel night it treads on his heels and begins to drag him back is there no home no voice of a friend no helping hand to save him from that worst of all enemieshis evil self it was nearly five oclock when without knowing how he got there he found himself on the familiar ground of shy street in the dim lamplight he scarcely recognised it at first but when he did it seemed like a final stroke of irony to bring him there at such a time in such a mood what else could it be meant for but to remind him there was no escape no hope of losing himself no chance of forgetting that gaunt empty window of number with the reflected glare of the lamp opposite upon it seemed to leer down on him like a mocking ghost claiming him as its own what was the use of keeping up the struggle any longer after all was there not one way of escape what was it crouching at the door of number half hidden in the shade a dog a woman a child he stood still a moment with beating heart straining his eyes through the gloom then he crossed as he did so the figure sprang to its feet and rushed to meet him i knowed it govnor i knowed you was acomin cried a familiar boys voice its all right now its all right govnor never did sweeter music fall on mortal ears than these broken breathless words on the spirit of reginald it was the voice he had been waiting for to save him in his extremitythe voice of love to remind him he was not forsaken the voice of trust to remind him some one believed in him still the voice of hope to remind him all was not lost yet it called him back to himself it thawed the chill at his heart and sent new life into his soul it was like a key to liberate him from the dungeon of giant despair why love is that you my boy he cried seizing the lads hand it is so govnor whimpered the boy trembling with excitement and clinging to his protectors hand i knowed you was acomin but i was amost feared i wouldnt see you too what made you think i would come said reginald looking down with tears in his eyes on the poor wizened upturned face i knowed you was acomin repeated the boy as if he could not say it too often and i waited and waited and there you are its all right govnor it is all right old fellow said reginald you dont know what youve saved me from go on said the boy recovering his composure in the great content of his discovery i aint saved you from nothink leastways unless you was agoin to commit soosanside if you was you was a flat to come this way that there railwaycuttings where id go and then at the inkwidge they dont know if you did it apurpose or was topped over by the train and they gives you the benefit of the doubt and says found dead we wont talk about it said reginald smiling the first smile that had crossed his lips for a week do you know young un im hungry are you got any browns said love not a farthing more aint i but ill he paused and a shade of doubt crossed his face as he went on say govnor think theyd give us a brown for this ere robinson and he pulled out his robinson crusoe bravely and held it up im afraid not it only cost threepence another inward debate took place then drawing out his beloved pilgrims progress he put the two books together and said suppose theyd give us one for them two dont lets part with them if we can help said reginald suppose we try to earn something the boy said nothing but trudged on beside his protector till they emerged from shy street and stood in one of the broad empty main streets of the city here reginald worn out with hunger and fatigue and borne up no longer by the energy of desperation sank half fainting into a doorstep imso tired he said lets rest a bit ill be all rightin a minute love looked at him anxiously for a moment and then saying stay you there govnor till i come back started off to run how long reginald remained halfunconscious where the boy left him he could not exactly tell but when he came to himself an early streak of dawn was lighting the sky and love was kneeling beside him its all right govnor said he holding up a can of hot coffee and a slice of bread in his hands chuck these here inside yer do you ear reginald put his lips eagerly to the can it was nearly sixteen hours since he had touched food he drained it half empty then stopping suddenly he said have you had any yourself me in corse do you suppose i aint ad a pull at it you havent said reginald eyeing him sharply and detecting the wellmeant fraud in his looks unless you take whats left there ill throw it all into the road in vain love protested vowed he loathed coffee that it made him sick that he preferred prussic acid reginald was inexorable and the boy was obliged to submit in like manner no wile or device could save him from having to share the slice of bread nor when he did put it to his lips could any grimace or protest hide the almost ravenous eagerness with which at last he devoured it now you wait till i take back the can said love ill not be a minute and he darted off leaving reginald strengthened in mind and body by the frugal repast it was not till the boy returned that he noticed he wore no coat what have you done with it he demanded sternly me what are you talking about said the boy looking guiltily uneasy dont deceive me said reginald wheres your coat what do i want with coats do you have you sold it for our breakfast go on do you think have you repeated reginald this time almost angrily maybe i ave said the boy aint i got a right to no you havent and youll have to wear mine now and he proceeded to take it off when the boy said all right if you take that off govnor i slidesi mean itso i do there was a look of such wild determination in his pinched face that reginald gave up the struggle for the present well share it between us at any rate said he whatever induced you to do such a foolish thing love bless you i aint got no sense replied the boy cheerily day broke at last and liverpool once more became alive with bustle and traffic no one noticed the two shivering boys as they wended their way through the streets trying here and there but in vain for work and wondering where and when they should find their next meal but for reginald that walk faint and footsore as he was was a pleasuretrip compared with the nights wanderings towards afternoon love had the rare good fortune to see a gentleman drop a purse on the pavement there was no chance of appropriating it had he been so minded which to do him justice he was not for the purse fell in a most public manner in the sight of several onlookers but love was the first to reach it and hand it back to its owner now loves old storybooks had told him that honesty of this sort is a very paying sort of business and though he hardly expected the wonderful consequences to follow his own act which always befall the superfluously honest boys in the penny dreadfuls he was yet low souled enough to linger sufficiently long in the neighbourhood of the owner of the purse to give him an opportunity of proving the truth of the storybook moral nor was he disappointed for the good gentleman happening to have no less than fifty pounds in gold and notes stored up in this particular purse was magnanimous enough to award love a shilling for his lucky piece of honesty a result which made that young gentlemans countenance glow with a grin of the profoundest satisfaction my eye govnor said he returning radiant with his treasure to reginald and thrusting it into his hand ere lay old eres a slice o luck somethink like that there daily bread you was atellin me of tother day no fear i aint forgot it now i say sassages what do you say reginald said sausages too and the two friends armed with their magic shilling marched boldly into a cosy coffeeshop where there was a blazing fire and a snug corner and called for sausages for two and they never enjoyed such a meal in all their lives how they did make those sausages last and what life and comfort they got out of that fire and what rest out of those canebottomed chairs at the end of it all they had fourpence left which after serious consultation it was decided to expend in a bed for the night if we can get a good sleep said reginald and pull ourselves together were bound to get a job of some sort tomorrow do you know any lodginghouse me dont i that there time you jacked me up i was a night in a place down by the river it aint a dainty place govnor but its ony twopence a piece or threepence a couple on us and thatll leave a brown for the morning all right lets go there soon and get a long night love led the way through several low streets beside the wharves until he came to a court in which stood a tumbledown tenement with the legend lodgings scrawled on a board above the door here they entered and love in a few words bargained with the sour landlady for a nights lodging she protested at first at their coming so early but finally yielded on condition they would make the threepence into fourpence they had nothing for it but to yield up you go then said the woman pointing to a rickety ladder which served the house for a staircase theres one there already never mind him you take the next reginald turned almost sick as he entered the big stifling filthy loft which was to serve him for a nights lodging about a dozen beds were ranged along the walls on either side one of which that in the far corner of the room was as the woman had said occupied the atmosphere of the place was awful already what would it be when a dozen or possibly two dozen persons slept there reginalds first impulse was to retreat and rather spend another night in the streets than in such a place but his weary limbs and aching bones forbade it he must stay where he was now already love was curled up and asleep on the bed next to that where the other lodger lay and reginald stifling every feeling but his weariness flung himself by his side and soon forgot both place and surroundings in a heavy sleep heavy but fitful he had scarcely lain an hour when he found himself suddenly wide awake love still lay breathing heavily beside him the other lodger turned restlessly from side to side muttering to himself and sometimes moaning like a person in pain it must have been these latter sounds which awoke reginald he lay for some minutes listening and watching in the dim candlelight the restless tossing of the bed clothes presently the sick manfor it was evident sickness was the cause of his uneasinesslifted himself on his elbow with a groan and said for gods sakehelp me in a moment reginald had sprung to his feet and was beside the sufferer are you ill he said what is the matter but the man instead of replying groaned and fell heavily back on the bed and as the dim light of the candle fell upon his upturned face reginald with a cry of horror recognised the features of mr durfy already released by death from the agonies of smallpox chapter twenty three lost and found booms was not exactly the sort of man to be elated by the mission which miss shuckleford had thrust upon him he passed a restless night in turning the matter over in his mind and wondering how he could break the news gently to his friend for he was fond of horace and in his saturnine way felt deeply for him in his trouble and on this account he wished jemima had chosen any other confidant to discharge the unpleasant task he hung about outside mrs crudens house for an hour early that morning in the hope of being able to entrap miss crisp and get her to take the duty off his hands but miss crisp had been sitting up all night with the patient and did not appear he knocked at the door and asked the servantgirl how mrs cruden was she was a little better but very weak and not able to speak to anybody any news from liverpool inquired booms this had become a daily question among those who inquired at number dull street no no news said the girl with a guilty blush she knew the reason why reginalds last letter written just before his arrest was at that moment in her pocket has mr horace started to the office no hes agoing to wait and see the doctor and he says i was to ask you to tell the gentleman so can i see him no hes asleep just now said the girl so booms had to go down alone to the rocket as far as ever from getting the burden of jemimas secret off his mind he had a good mind to pass it on to waterford and might have done so had not that young gentleman been engaged all the morning on special duty which kept him in mr granvilles room booms grew more and more dispirited and nervous every footstep that came to the door made him tremble for fear it should be the signal for the unhappy disclosure he tried hard to persuade himself it would be kinder after all to say nothing about it what good could it do now booms as the reader knows had not a very large mind but what there was of it was honest and it told him try how he would there was no getting out of a promise so he busied himself with concocting imaginary phrases and letters by way of experiment as to the neatest way of breaking his bad news still he dreaded his friends arrival more and more and when at last a brisk footstep halted at the door he started and turned pale like a guilty thing and wished jemima at the bottom of the sea but the footstep was not horaces whoever the arrival was he tapped at the door before entering and then without waiting for a reply walked in it was a youth of about seventeen or eighteen with a bright honest face and cheery smile is horace cruden here he inquired eagerly oh no said booms in his most doleful accents isnt this where he works it is indeed well then is anything wrong is he ill no he is not ill said booms emphasising the pronoun is reginald ill then or their mother a ray of hope crossed boomss mind this stranger was evidently a friend of the family he called the boys by their christian names and knew their mother would he take charge of the dismal secret his mother is ill said he do you know them rather i was horaces chum at wilderham you know and used to spend my holidays regularly at garden vale is she very ill very said booms and the worst of it is reginald is not at home where is he horrors told me he had gone to the country booms would tell him for the visitor called his friend horrors a pet name none but his own family were ever known to use they dont know where he is but i do said booms with a tragic gesture where where whats wrong i say tell me theres a good fellow hes in prison said booms throwing himself back in his chair and panting with the effort the disclosure had cost him in prison and horace doesnt know it what do you mean tell me all you know booms did tell him and very little it was all he knew was from jemimas secondhand report and the magnitude of the news had quite prevented him from inquiring as to particulars when did you hear this said harker for the reader will have guessed by this time that the visitor was no other than horaces old wilderham ally yesterday and he doesnt know yet how could i tell him of course im to get all the blame i expected it whos blaming you said harker whom the news had suddenly brought on terms of familiarity with his friends friend when will he be here very soon i suppose and then youll tell him you will please said booms quite eagerly for him somebody must poor fellow said harker we dont know what we may be losing by the delay of course its my fault for not waking him up in the middle of the night and telling him said booms dismally is there anything about it in the papers said harker taking up a times ive seen nothing you say it was a day or two ago have you got the times for the last few days yes its there harker hastily turned over the file and eagerly searched the police and country intelligence in a minute or two he looked up and said had cruden senior changed his name how do i know said booms with a bewildered look i mean had he dropped his surname look here and he showed booms the paragraph which appeared in the london papers the morning after reginalds arrest that looks very much as if it was meant for cruden said harkerall except the name if it is that was tuesday he was remanded and today is the day he is to be brought up again oh why didnt we know this before yes i knew i was to blame i knew it all along said booms taking every expression of regret as a personal castigation it will be all over before any one can do a thing said harker getting up and pacing the room in his agitation why doesnt horace come as if in answer to the appeal horace at that moment opened the door why harker old man he exclaimed with delight in his face and voice as he sprang towards his friend horrors my poor dear boy said harker dont be glad to see me ive bad news and theres no time to break it gently its about reginald hes in troublein prison ill come with you to liverpool this morning there is a train in twenty minutes horace said nothing he turned deadly pale and gazed for a moment half scared half appealing at his friend booms remembered something he had to do in another room and went to the door do you mind getting a hansom said harker the words roused horace from his stupor mother he gasped shes ill we shall be home again tonight most likely said harker i must tell granville said horace your chief well be quick the cab will be here directly horace went to the inner room and in a minute returned his face still white but with a burning spot on either cheek all right inquired harker horace nodded and followed him to the door in a quarter of an hour they were at euston in the booking office i have no money said horace i have plenty for us both go and get some papers especially liverpool ones at the bookstall while i get the tickets it was a long memorable journey the papers were soon exhausted they contained little or no additional news respecting the obscure suspect in liverpool and beyond that they had no interest for either traveller we shall get down at three said harker theres a chance of being in time in time for what what can we do try and get another remand if only for a couple of days i cant believe it of reg there must be some mistake of course there must said horace with a touch of scorn in his voice but how are we to prove it its no use trying just now all we can do is to get a remand the train seemed to drag forward with cruel slowness and the precious moments sped by with no less cruel haste it was five minutes past three when they found themselves on the platform of liverpool station its touch and go if were in time old boy said harker as they took their seats in a hansom and ordered the man to drive hard for the policecourt but you mustnt give up hope even if were late well pull poor old reg through somehow his cheery words and the brotherly grip on his arm were like life and hope to horace oh yes he replied what would i have done if you hadnt turned up like an angel of help harker old man as they neared the policecourt the cabman pulled up to allow a police van to turn in the road the two friends shuddered it was like an evil omen to daunt them was he in that vanso near them yet so hopelessly beyond their reach for goodness sake drive on shouted harker to the cabman it seemed ages before the lumbering obstruction had completed its revolution and drawn to one side sufficiently to allow them to pass in another minute the cab dashed to the door of the court it was open and the knot of idlers on the pavement showed them that some case of interest was at that moment going on they made their way to the policeman who stood on duty courts fullstand back please cant go in said that official what case is it stand back pleasecant go in repeated the stolid functionary please tell us stand back there once more shouted the sentinel growing rather more peremptory it was clearly no use mincing matters at this very moment reginald might be standing defenceless within with his last chance of liberty slipping from under his feet harker drew a shilling from his pocket and slipped it into the hand of the law tell us the name of the case theres a good fellow said he coaxingly bilcherwife murder stand back pleasecourts full bilcher wife murder it was for this the crowd had gathered it was for the result of this that that knot of idlers were waiting so patiently outside bilcher was the hero of this days gathering who was likely to care a rush about such a lesser light as a secretary charged with a commonplace fraud has the case of cruden come on yet asked horace anxiously the policeman answered him with a vacant stare no said harker the name would be reginald you know i say added he to the policeman when does reginalds case come on stand back therereginaldhe was the last but one before thisdont crowd please were too late then what waswhat did he get now the policeman considered he had answered quite enough for his shilling if he went on people would think he was an easy fish to catch so he affected deafness and looking straight past his eager questioners again repeated his stentorian request to the public generally oh pray tell us what he got said harker in tones of genuine entreaty this is his brother and weve only just heard of it the policeman for a moment turned a curious eye on horace as if to convince himself of the truth of the story then apparently satisfied and weary of the whole business he said let off will you keep back please stand back courts full let off horaces heart gave a bound of triumph as he heard the words of course he was who could even suspect him of such a thing as fraud unjustly accused he might be but regs character was proof against that any day harker shared his friends feelings of relief and thankfulness at the good news but his face was still not without anxiety we had better try to find him said he oh of course hell probably be back at shy street but no one was at shy street the dingy office was deserted and locked and a little street urchin on the doorstep glowered at them as they peered up the staircase and read the name on the plate had we better ask in the shop they may know said horace but the chemist looked black when reginalds name was mentioned and hoped he should never see him again hed got into trouble and loss enough with him as it wasa hypocritical young look here said horace youre speaking of my brother and youd better be careful hes no more a hypocrite than you hes an honest man and hes been acquitted of the charge brought against him i didnt know you were his brother said the chemist rather sheepishly but for all that i dont want to see him again and i dont expect i shall either he wont come near here in a hurry unless im mistaken the fellows right im afraid said harker as they left the shop hes had enough of this place from what you tell me it strikes me the best thing is to go and inquire at the policestation they may know something there to the policestation accordingly they went and chanced to light on one no less important than mr sniff himself we are interested in reginald cruden who was before the magistrate to day said harker in fact this is his brother and i am an old schoolfellow we hear the charge against him was dismissed and we should be much obliged if you could tell us where to find him mr sniff regarded the two boys with interest and not without a slight trace of uneasiness he had never really suspected reginald but it had appeared necessary to arrest him on suspicion not only to satisfy the victims of the corporation but on the off chance of his knowing rather more than he seemed to know about the doings of that virtuous association it had been a relief to mr sniff to find his first impressions as to the lads innocence confirmed and to be able to withdraw the charge against him but the manner in which the magistrate had dismissed the case had roused even his phlegmatic mind to indignation and had set his conscience troubling him a little as to his own conduct of the affair this was why he now felt and looked not quite happy in the presence of reginalds brother and friend afraid i cant tell you said he he left the court as soon as the case was over and of course weve no more to do with him he is not back at his old office said horace and i dont know of any other place in liverpool he would be likely to go to it struck me from the looks of him said mr sniff quite despising himself for being so unprofessionally communicativeit struck me he didnt very much care where he went very down in the mouth he was why but he was acquitted his character was cleared whatever should he be down in the mouth about said horace mr sniff smiled pityingly he was let off with a caution he said thats rather a different thing from having your character cleared especially when our friend fogeys on the bench i was sorry for the lad so i was this was a great deal to come from the lips of a castiron individual like mr sniff and it explained the state of the case forcibly enough to his two hearers horace knew his brothers nature well enough to imagine the effect upon him of such a reprimand and his spirits sank within him who can tell us now where we are to look for him said he to harker anything like injustice drives him desperate he may have gone off as the detective says not caring where and then liverpool is a fearfully big place we wont give it up till we have found him said harker and if you cant stay old man i will i cant go said horace with a groan poor reg well let us call round at the postoffice and see if waterford has remembered to telegraph about your mother they went to the postoffice and found a telegram from miss crisp good day better decidedly knows you are in liverpool but nothing more any news do not telegraph unless all right its pretty evident said horace handing the message to his friend we cant telegraph today ill write to waterford and get him to tell the others but what is the next thing to be done we can only be patient said harker we are bound to come across him or hear of him in time hes not likely to have gone home suggested horace how could he with no money or to try to get on an american ship we might try that oh yes we shall have to try all that sort of thing well lets begin at once said horace impatiently every minute may be of consequence but for a week they sought in vainamong the busy streets by day and in the empty courts by night among the shipping in the railwaystations in the workhouses at the printingoffices mr sniff did them more than one friendly turn and armed them with the talisman of his name to get them admittance where no other key would pass them they inquired at publichouses coffeehouses lodging houses but all in vain no one had seen a youth answering their description or if they had it was only for a moment and he had passed from their sight and memory false scents there were in plentysome which seemed to lead up hopefully to the very last and then end in nothing others too vague even to attempt to follow once they heard that the body of a youth had been found floating in the merseyand with terrible forebodings they rushed to the place and demanded to see it but he was not there the dead upturned face they looked on was not his and they turned away feeling more than ever discouraged in their quest at length at the end of a week a man who kept an early coffeestall in one of the main streets told them that a week ago a ragged little urchin had come to him with a pitiful tale about a gentleman who was starving and had begged for a can of coffee and a slice of bread to take to him offering in proof of his good faith his own coat as payment it was a bitterly cold morning and the man trusted him he had never seen the gentleman but the boy brought back the empty can in a few minutes the coffee man had kept the jacket as it was about the size of a little chap of his own but he had noticed the boy before parting with it take two ragged little books out of its pockets and transfer them to the bosom of his shirt that was all he remembered and the gentleman might take it for what it was worth it was worth something for it pointed to the possibility of reginald not being alone in his wanderings and putting one thing and another together they somehow connected this little urchin with the boy they saw crouching on the doorstep of number shy street the day of their arrival and with the officeboy whom mr sniff described as having been reginalds companion during his last days at the office they would neither of them believe reginald was not still in liverpool and cheered by the very feeble light of this discovery they resumed their search with unabated vigour and even greater thoroughness happily the news from home continued favourable and equally important the officials at the rocket made no demur to horaces prolonged stay as for harker his hopefulness and pocketmoney vied with one another in sustaining the seekers and keeping alive within them the certainty of a reward sooner or later for their patience ten days had passed and no fresh clue once or twice they had heard of the pale young gentleman and the little boy but always vaguely as a fleeting vision which had been seen about a fortnight ago on this day they called in while passing to see mr sniff and were met by that gentleman with a smile which told them he had some news of consequence to impart i heard today said he that a patienta young manwas removed very ill from a low lodginghouse near the riverto the smallpox hospital yesterday his name is supposed to be cruden a common name in this country but he was too ill to give any account of himself it may be worth your while following it up in less than half an hour they were at the hospital and horace was kneeling at the bedside of his longlost brother chapter twenty four love fights his way into the beautiful palace reginald recollected little of what happened on that terrible night when he found himself suddenly face to face with his dead enemy he had a vague impression of calling the landlady and of seeing the body carried from the pestiferous room but whether he helped to carry it himself or not he could not remember when he next was conscious of anything the sun was struggling through the rafters over his head as he lay in the bed beside love who slept still heavily but uneasily the other lodgers had all risen and left the place and when with a shudder he glanced towards the corner where the sick man last night had died that bed was empty too he rose silently without disturbing his companion and made his way unsteadily down the ladder in search of the woman she met him with a scowl she had found two fivepound notes in the dead mans pocket and consequently wanted to hear no more about him took to the mortuary of course said she in answer to reginalds question where else do you expect can you tell me his name or anything about him i knew him once she looked blacker than ever at this it seemed to her guilty conscience like a covert claim to the dead mans belongings and she bridled up accordingly i know nothing about himno more than i know about you dont you know his name said reginald no do i know your name no and i dont want to dont be angry he said no one means any harm to you how long has he been here i dont know a week and he was bad when he came he never caught it here did any doctor see him doctor no snarled the woman isnt it bad enough to have a man bring smallpox into a place without calling in doctors to give the place a bad name and take a bodys living from them i suppose youll go and give me a character now i wish id never took you in i hated the sight of you from the first she spoke so bitterly and at the same time so anxiously that reginald felt half sorry for her ill do you no harm said he gently goodness knows ive done harm enough in my time the last words though muttered to himself did not escape the quick ear of the woman and they pleased her she was used to strange characters in her place seeking a nights shelter before escaping to america or while hiding from justice it was neither her habit nor her business to answer questions all she asked was to be let alone and paid for her lodgings she knew reginald had her in a sense at his mercy for he knew the disease the man had died of and a word from him out of doors would bring her own pestiferous house about her ears and ruin her but when he muttered those words to himself she concluded he was a criminal of some sort in hiding and criminals in hiding as she knew were not the people to go and report the sanitary arrangements of their lodgings to the police so she mollified towards him somewhat and told him she would look after her affairs if he looked after his and as he had not had a good night last night well if no one else wanted the bed tonight he could have it at halfprice and after that she hoped she would have done with him reginald returned to the foul garret and found love still asleep but tossing restlessly and muttering to himself the while he sat down beside him and waited till he opened his eyes at first the boy looked round in a bewildered way as though he were hardly yet awake but presently his eyes fell on reginald and his face lit up govnor he said with a smile sitting up well old boy said reginald what a long sleep youve had are you rested i ave ad sich dreams govnor andmy aint it cold and he shivered the room was stifling scarcely a breath of fresh air penetrated through its battered roof still less through the tiny unopened window at the other end well get some breakfast to make you warm said reginald this horrible place is enough to make any one feel sick the boy got slowly out of bed we ave got to earn some browns he said afore we can get any breakfast he shivered still and sat down on the edge of the bed for a moment then he gathered himself together with an effort and walked to the ladder reginalds heart sank within him the boy was not well his face was flushed his walk was uncertain and his teeth chattered incessantly it might be only the foul atmosphere of the room or it might be something worse and as he thought of it he too shivered but not on account of the cold they descended the ladder and for a little while the boy seemed revived by the fresh morning air reginald insisted on his taking their one coat and the boy seemed to lack the energy to contest the matter for an hour they wandered about the wharves till at last love stopped short and said govnor i dont want no breakfast ill just go back and the sentence ended in a whimper and but for reginalds arm round him he would have fallen reginald knew now that his worst fears were realised love was ill and it was only too easy to surmise what his illness was especially when he called to mind the boys statement that he had been taking shelter in the infected lodginghouse ten days ago during his temporary exile from shy street he helped him back tenderly to the placefor other shelter they had noneand laid him in his bed the boy protested that he was only tired that his back and legs ached and would soon be well reginald inexperienced as he was knew better or rather worse he had a battle royal as he expected with the landlady on the subject of his little patient at first she would listen to nothing and threatened to turn both out by force but reginald with an eloquence which only extremities can inspire reasoned with her coaxed her flattered her bribed her with promises and finally got far enough on the right side of her to obtain leave for the boy to occupy durfys bed until some other lodger should want it but she must have a shilling down or off they must go it was a desperate alternativeto quit his little charge in his distress or to see him turned out to die in the street reginald however had little difficulty in making his choice are you comfortable said he to the boy leaning over him and soothing the coarse pillow yes govnorall rightthat there ache will be gone soon and see if i dont pick up some browns afore evening do you think you can get on if i leave you a bit i think i know where i can earn a little and ill be back before night never fear maybe youll find me up and about when you comes said the boy mayhap the old gal would give me a job sweeping or somethink you must not think of it said reginald almost sternly mind i trust you to be quiet till i come how i wish i had some food with heavy heart he departed appealing to the woman for pitys sake not to let harm come to the boy in his absence where should he go what should he do half a crown would make him feel the richest man in liverpool and yet how hard how cruelly hard it is to find a halfcrown when you most want it he forgot all his pride all his sensitiveness all his own weariness everything but the sick boy and left no stone unturned to procure even a copper he even begged when nothing else succeeded nobody seemed to want anything done there were scores of hungry applicants at the riverside and dozens outside the printingoffice there were no horses that wanted holding no boxes or bags that wanted carrying no messages or errands that wanted running no shop or factory window that he saw had a notice of boys wanted posted in it no junior clerk was advertised for in any paper he caught sight of not even a scavenger boy was wanted to clean the road at last he was giving it up in despair and coming to the conclusion he might just as well hasten back to his little charge and share his fate with him when he caught sight of a stout elderly lady standing in a state of flurry and trepidation on the kerb of one of the most crowded crossings in the city with the instinct of desperation he rushed towards her and lifting his hat said can i help you across maam the lady started to hear words so polite and in so wellbred a tone coming from a boy of reginalds poor appearance for he was still without his coat but she jumped at his offer and allowed him to pilot her and her parcels over the dangerous crossing it may be worth twopence to me said reginald to himself as he landed her safe on the other side how circumstances change us at another time reginald would have flushed crimson at the bare idea of being paid for an act of politeness now his heart beat high with hope as he saw the ladys hand feel for her pocket youre a very civil young man said she anddear me how ill you look im not ill said reginald with a boldness he himself marvelled at but a little boy i love isvery illand i have no money to get him either food or lodging i know youll think im an impostor maam but could you for pitys sake give me a shilling i couldnt pay you back but id bless you always dear dear said the lady its very sadjust at christmastime too poor little fellow heres something for him i think you look honest young man i hope you are and trust in god and to reginalds unbounded delight she slipped two halfcrowns into his hand and walked away he could only say god bless you for it it seemed like an angels gift in his hour of direst need and with a heart full of comfort he hastened back to the lodgings calling on his way at a cookshop and spending sixpence of his treasure on some bread and meat for his patient he was horrorstruck to notice the change even a few hours had wrought on the sufferer there was no mistaking his ailment now though not delirious he was in a high state of fever and apparently of pain for he tossed incessantly and moaned to himself the sight of reginald revived him i knowed you was comin said he but i dont want nothing to eat govnor ony some water i do want some water reginald flew to get it and the boy swallowed it with avidity then somewhat revived he lay back and said i ave got em then yes im afraid its smallpox said reginald but youll soon be better maybe i will maybe i wont say govnor you dont ought to stop here youll be cotchin em too no fear of that said reginald ive been vaccinated besides whod look after you my youre a good un to me said the boy think of that there medlock dont lets think of anything so unpleasant said reginald seeing that even this short talk had excited his patient unduly let me see if i can make the bed more comfortable and then if you like i can read to you how would you like that the boy beamed his gratitude and reginald after doing his best to smooth the wretched bed and make him comfortable produced the pilgrims progress and settled down to read that there robinson aint a bad un said love before the reading began i read im while i was awaitin for you but e aint so good as the christian read about that there pallis agin govnor and reginald read itmore than once the evening closed in the room grew dark and he shut the book the boy was already asleep tossing and moaning to himself sometimes seeming to wake for a moment but dropping off again before he could tell what he wanted or what was wrong with him once or twice reginald moistened his parched mouth with water but as the evening wore on the boy became so much worse that he felt at all hazards he must seek help i must bring a doctor to see him said he to the landlady hes so ill youll bring no doctorunless you want to see the boy chucked out in the road said she the idea just when my lodgers will be coming home to bed too its only eight oclock no one will come till ten therell be plenty of time whats the use you know as well as i do the child wont last above a day or two in his state whats the use of making a disturbance for nothing said the woman he wont diehe shall not die said reginald feeling in his heart how foolish the words were at any rate i must fetch a doctor i might have fetched one without saying a word to you but i promised i wouldnt and now i want you to let me off the promise the woman fretted and fumed and wished ill to the day when she had ever seen either reginald or love he bore her vituperation patiently as it was his only chance of getting his way presently she said if youre bent on it go to mr pilch round the corner hes the only doctor ill let come in my house you can have him or nobody thats flat in two minutes reginald was battering wildly at mr pilchs door that gentlemana small dealer in herbs who eked out his livelihood by occasional unauthorised medical practicehappened to be in and offered for two shillings to come and see the sick boy reginald tossed down the coin with eager thankfulness and almost dragged him to the bedside of his little charge mr pilch may have known very little of medicine but he knew enough to make him shake his head as he saw the boy regular bad case that smallpox and half a dozen things on the top of it i cant do anything can you give me no medicine for him or tell me what food he ought to take or what surely theres a chance of his getting better mr pilch laughed quietly about as much chance of his pulling through that as of jumping over the moon the kindest thing you can do is to let him die as soon as he can he may last a day or two if you want to feed him give him anything he will take and that wont be much youll find its a bad case young fellow and it wont do you any good to stop too near him no use my coming again goodnight and the brusque but not unkindly little quack trotted away leaving reginald in the dark without a gleam of hope to comfort him govnor said the weak little voice from the bed that there doctor says i are agoin to die dont he he says youre very ill old boy but lets hope youll soon be better meno fear ony i wish it would come soon im afeared of gettin frightened and the voice trembled away into a little sob they lay there side by side that long restless night the other lodgers rough degraded men and women crowded into the room but no one heeded the little bed in the dark corner where the big boy lay with his arm round the little uneasy sufferer there was little sleep either for patient or nurse every few minutes the boy begged for water which reginald held to his lips and when after a time the thirst ceased and only the pain remained nothing soothed and tranquillised him so much as the repetition time after time of his favourite stories from the wonderful book which happily reginald now knew almost by heart so the night passed before daylight the lodgers one by one rose and left the place and when about halfpast seven light struggled once more in between the rafters these two were alone the boy seemed a little revived and sipped some milk which reginald had darted out to procure but the pain and the fever returned twofold as the day wore on and even to reginalds unpractised eye it was evident the boys release was not far distant govnor said the boy once with his mind apparently wandering back over old days whats the meaning of jesus christs sake amen what comes at the end of that there prayer you taught me at the officeis he the same one thats in the pilgrim book yes old boy would you like to hear about him i would so said the boy eagerly and that afternoon as the shadows darkened and the fleeting ray of the sun crossed the floor of their room love lay and heard the old old story told in simple broken words he had heard of it before but till now he had never heeded it yet it seemed to him more wonderful even than robinson crusoe or the pilgrims progress now and then he broke in with some comment or criticism or even one of his old familiar tirades against the enemies of his new hero the room grew darker and still reginald went on when at last the light had all gone the boys hand stole outside the blanket and sought that of his protector and held it till the story came to an end then he seemed to drop into a fitful sleep and reginald with the hand still on his sat motionless listening to the hard breathing and living over in thought the days since heaven in mercy joined his life to that of his little friend how long he sat thus he knew not he heard the voices and tread of the other lodgers in the room he heard the harsh groan of the bolt on the outer door downstairs and he saw the candle die down in its socket but he never moved or let go the boys hand presentlyabout one or two in the morning he thoughtthe hard breathing ceased and a turn of the head on the pillow told him the sleeper was awake govnor you there whispered the boy yes old fellow its dark im most afeared reginald lay on the bed beside him and put an arm round him the boy became more easy after this and seemed to settle himself once more to sleep but the breathing was shorter and more laboured and the little brow that rested against the watchers cheek grew cold and damp for half an hour more the feeble flame of life flickered on every breath seeming to reginald as he lay there motionless scarcely daring to breathe himself like the last then the boy seemed suddenly to rouse himself and lifted his head govnorthat pallisim gettin ini hear them callingcome there too govnor and the head sank back on the pillow and reginald as he turned his lips to the forehead knew that the little valiant soul had fought his way into the beautiful palace at last and was already hearing the music of those voices within as they welcomed him to his heros reward chapter twenty five there is no place like home it is strange how often our fortunes and misfortunes which we are so apt to suppose depend on our own successes or failures turn out to have fallen into hands we least expected and to have been depending on trains of circumstances utterly beyond our range of imagination who for instance would have guessed that a meeting of half a dozen business men in a firstfloor room of a new york office could have any bearing on the fate of the cruden family or that an accident to major lamberts horse while clearing a fence at one of the shire hunts should also affect their prospects in life but so it was while reginald tenderly nursed by his old school friend was slowly recovering from his illness in liverpool and while mrs cruden and horace in their shabby london lodging were breaking into their last hundred pounds and wondering how even with the boys improved wages and promise of literary success they should be able to keep a comfortable home for their scattered but shortly to be reunited family at this very time a few of the leading creditors of the wishwash and longstop railway assembled in the old office of that bankrupt undertaking and decided to accept an offer from the grand roundabout railway to buy up their undertaking at halfprice and add its few hundred miles of line to their own few thousand a very important decision this for the little dull street family for among the english creditors of this same wishwash and longstop railway mr cruden had been one of the most considerableso considerable that the shares he held in it had amounted to about half his fortune and when the division of the proceeds of the sale of the railway came to be divided it turned out that mr crudens administrators heirs and assigns were entitled to about a third of the value of that gentlemans shares or in other words something like a sixth of their old property which little windfall after a good deal of wandering about and search for an owner came finally under the notice of mr richmonds successors who in turn passed it over to mrs cruden with a very neat little note of congratulation on the good fortune which had made her and her sons the joint proprietors of a snug little income of from l to l a year of course the sagacious reader will remark on this that it is only natural that towards the end of my story something of this sort should happen in order to finish up with the remark that they lived happily ever after and his opinion of me will i fear be considerably lowered when he finds that instead of reginald dying in the smallpox hospital and mrs cruden and horace ending their days in the workhouse things looked up a little for them towards the finish and promised a rather more comfortable future than one had been led to expect it is sad of course to lose any ones good esteem but as things really did look up for the crudensas reginald really did recover as mrs cruden and horace really did not go to the workhouse and as the grand roundabout railway really was spirited enough to buy up the wishwash and longstop railway at halfprice i cannot help saying so whatever the consequences may be but several weeks before mr richmonds successors announced this windfall to their clients the accident to major lamberts horse had resulted in comfort to the crudens of another kind which if truth must be told they expected quite as little and valued quite as much that worthy nimrod once an acquaintance and neighbour of the garden vale family in the days of their prosperity was never known to miss a winters hunting in his own county if he could possibly help it and during the present season had actually come all the way from malta where his regiment was stationed on short leave for the sake of two or three days of his favourite sport in the old country such enthusiasm was worthy of a happier fate than that which befell him for on his first ride out his horse came to grief as we have said over a hedge and left the gallant major somewhat knocked about himself with nothing to do for half a day but to saunter disconsolately up and down the country lanes and pay afternoon calls on some of his old comrades among others he knocked at the door of an elderly dowager named osborn who was very sympathetic with him in his misfortunes and did her best to comfort him with afternoon tea and gossip the latter lasted a good deal longer than the former one after another the majors old friends were mentioned and discussed and talked about as only folk can be talked about over afternoon tea by the way said the caller i hear poor cruden didnt leave much behind him after all is mrs cruden still at garden vale no indeed said the lady its a sad story altogether mr cruden left nothing behind him and garden vale had to be sold and the family went to london so i was told in very poor circumstances bless me said the honest major havent you looked them up cruden was a good sort of a fellow you know well ive always intended to try and find out where they are living but really major you have no idea how ones time gets filled up ive a very good idea said the major with a groan i have to sail in a week and theres not much spare time between now and then i can tell you still id like to call and pay my respects to mrs cruden if i knew where she lived i daresay you could find out but i was going to say that only yesterday i saw something in the paper which will hardly make mrs cruden anxious to see any of her old friends at present the eldest son i fear has turned out badly who youngwhat was his namereginald cant believe it he always seemed one of the right sort a bit of a prig perhaps but straight enough what has he been up to youd better see for yourself major said the lady extracting a newspaper from a heap under the dinnerwaggon he seems to have been mixed up in a rather discreditable affair as far as i could make out but i didnt read the report through the major took the paper and read a short report of the proceedings at the liverpool policecourt you didnt read it through you say observed he when he had finished you saw he was let off yes but im afraidwell its very sad for them all of course it is blurted out the soldier especially when none of their old friends seem to care anything about them excuse me mrs osborn added he seeing that the lady coloured i wasnt meaning you but myself cruden was on old comrade who did me more than one good turn i must certainly take a day in town on my way back and find them out as for the boy i dont believe hes got it in him to be a blackleg the major was as good as his word he sacrificed a day of his loved pastime to look for his old friends widow in london after a good deal of hunting he discovered her address and presented himself with not a little wonderment at the shabbiness of her quarters at dull street barely convalescent and still in the agony of suspense as to reginalds fate mrs cruden was able to see no one but the major was not thus to be baulked of his friendly intentions before he left the house he wrote a letter which in due time lay in the widows hands and brought tears to her eyes dear mrs crudeni am on my way back to malta and sorry not to see you we all have our troubles but you seem to have had more than your share and what i should have liked would be to see whether there was anything an old friend of your husband could do to serve you i trust you will not resent the liberty i take when i say i have instructed my agent whose address is enclosed to put himself at your disposal in any emergency when you may need either advice or any other sort of aid he is a good fellow and understands any service you may require and emergencies often do arise is to be rendered on my account as to your eldest son about whom i read a paragraph in the papers the other day nothing will make me believe he is anything but his honest fathers honest son my brotherinlaw whom you will remember is likely shortly to have an opportunity of introducing a young fellow into an east india house in the city i may mention this because should you think well to tell reginald of it i believe there would not be much difficulty in his getting the post but you will hear about this from my brotherinlaw whom i have asked to write to you i dont expect to get leave again for eighteen months but i hope then to find you all well believe me dear mrs cruden yours truly thomas lambert this simple warmhearted letter came to mrs cruden as the first gleam of better things on the troubled waters of her life things were just then at their worst reginald lost horace away in search of him herself slowly recovering from a sad illness into a still more sad life with little prospect either of happiness or competency nothing to look forward to but a renewal of the old struggles possibly singlehanded at such a time major lamberts letter came to revive her drooping spirits and remind her of a providence that never sleeps less than when we are ready to consider ourselves forgotten all she could do was to write a grateful reply back and then await news from horace trusting meanwhile it would not be necessary to draw on the majors offered help a few days later horace was home again jubilant at having found his brother but anxious both as to his immediate recovery and the state of mind in which restored health would find him he told me lots about the past mother said he no one can conceive what a terrible three months he has had since he left us or how heroically he has borne it he doesnt think so himself and is awfully depressed about his trial and the way in which the magistrate spoke to himthe brute poor boy he is the very last to bear that sort of thing well hes got a sort of idea hes a branded man and is to be dragged down all his life by it perhaps when he hears that an old friend like major lambert believes in him he may pick up you know mother i believe his heart is in the grave where that little officeboy of his lies and that he would have been thankful ifwell perhaps not so bad as that but just at present he cant speak or even think of the boy without breaking down according to the letter from major lamberts brotherinlaw the post that is offered him is one he will like i think said mrs cruden i do hope he will take it to have nothing to do would be the worst thing that could happen to him to say nothing of the necessity of it for you mother said horace for theres to be no more copying out manuscripts mind even if we all go to the workhouse mrs cruden sighed she knew her son was right but the wolf was at the door and she shrank from becoming a useless burden on her boys shoulders i wonder horace said she presently whether we could possibly find less expensive quarters than these they are hullo theres the postman said horace who had been looking from the window ten to one theres a line from harker and he flew down the stairs just in time to see the servantgirl take a letter from the box and put it in her pocket none for us said he the girl who till this moment was not aware of his presence turned round and coloured very violently but said nothing show me the letter you put into your pocket just now said horace who had had experience before now in predicaments of this kind the girl made no reply but tried to go back to the kitchen horace however stopped her be quick said he youve a letter for me in your pocket and if i dont have it before i count twenty ill give you in charge and he proceeded to count before he had reached ten the girl broke out into tears and took from her pocket not only the letter in question but three or four others there you are thats all of them ive done with it sobbed she horace glanced over them in bewilderment one was in reginalds writing written three weeks ago two were from himself to his mother written last week and the last was from harker written yesterday why exclaimed he too much taken aback almost to find words what does it mean how do you come oh ill tell you said the girl i dont care what they do to me id sooner be sent to prison than go on at it he told me to do it and threatened me all sorts of things if i didnt oh dear oh dear who told you why mr shuckleford he said mr reginald was a convict or something and if i didnt mind every letter that came to the house from liverpool id get sent to prison too for abetting him im sure i dont want to abet no one and i cant help if they do lock me up you mean to say mr shuckleford told you to do this saidor rather roaredhorace yes he did and he had them all before that one said the girl pointing to the letter from reginald but hes never been for these and i didnt dare not to keep them for him please sir look over it this time horace was too agitated to heed her tears or entreaties he rushed from the house with the letters in his hand and made straight for the shucklefords door but with his hand on the bell he hesitated mrs shuckleford and her daughter had been good to his mother he could not relieve his mind to samuel in their presence so he resolved to postpone that pleasure till he could find the young lawyer alone and meanwhile hurried back to his mother and rejoiced her heart with the good news of reginald contained in harkers letter how and when horace and shuckleford settled accounts no one exactly knew but one evening about a week afterwards the latter came home looking very scared and uncomfortable and announced that he was getting tired of london the air of which did not agree with his constitution he intended to close with an offer he had received some time ago from a firm in the country to act as their clerk and although the sacrifice was considerable still the country air and change of scene he felt would do him good so he went much lamented by his mother and sister and club but of all his acquaintances there was only one who knew the exact reason why just at that particular time the country air promised to be so beneficial for his constitution three weeks passed and then one afternoon a cab rolled slowly up to the door of number dull street horace was away at the office and mrs cruden herself was out taking a walk so the two young men who alighted from the cab found themselves monarchs of all they surveyed and proceeded upstairs to the parlour with no one to ask what their business was now old man said the sturdier of the two i wont stay ive brought you safe home and you neednt pretend youll be sorry to see my back i wont pretend said the other with a smile on his pale face but if youre not back very soon in an hour or two i shall be very very sorry never fear ill be back and he went the pale youth sat down and looked with a strange mixture of sadness and eagerness round the little room he had seen it before and yet he seemed hardly to recognise it he got up and glanced at a few envelopes lying on the mantelpiece he took into his hands a piece of knitting that lay on one of the chairs and examined it he turned over the leaves of a stray book and read the name on the titlepage it all seemed so strangeyet so familiar then he crept silently to the half open door of a little bedroom and peeped in and his heart beat strangely as he recognised a photograph on the dressingtable and by its side a letter written in his own handwriting from this room he turned to another still smaller and more roughly furnished a walking stick stood in the corner that he knew well and there was a cap on the peg behind the door the sight of which sent a thrill through him yet he felt he dared touch nothingthat he scarcely dare let his foot be heard as he paced across the room or venture even to stir the little fire that was dying out in the grate the slight flush which the excitement of his first arrival had called up faded from his cheeks as the minutes wore on presently his ears caught a light footfall on the pavement outside and his heart almost stood still as it halted and the bell rang below it was one of those occasions when a man may live a lifetime in a minute with a mighty rush his thoughts flew back to the last time he had heard that step what goodness what hope what love did it not bring back to his life he had taken it all for granted and thought so little of it but now after months of loveless cheerless drudgery and disappointment that light step fell with a music which flooded his whole soul he sat almost spellbound as the streetdoor closed and the steps ascended the stairs the room seemed to swim round him and to his broken nerves it seemed for a moment as though he dreaded rather than longed for what was coming but as the door opened the spell broke and all the mists vanished he was his own self once morenothing but the longlost boy springing to the arms of the longlost mother mother my boy that was all they said and in those few words reginald crudens life entered on a new era when horace half an hour later came flying on to the scene they still sat there hand in hand trying to realise it all but not succeeding horace however helped them back to speech and far into the night they talked about ten oclock harker looked in for a moment and after them young gedge unable to wait till the morning but they stayed only a moment and scarcely interrupted the little family reunion what those three talked about it would be hard for me to say what they did not talk about in the past the present and the future would be almost easier to set down and when at last mrs cruden rose and in her old familiar tones said its time to go to bed boys the boys obeyed as in the days long ago and came up to her and kissed her and then went off like children and slept like those who never knew what care was all the happy night chapter twenty six turning over leaves new and old a very few words more reader and my story is done the trial of medlock and shanklin took place in due time and among the witnesses the most important but the most reluctant was reginald cruden it was like a hateful return to the old life to find himself face to face with those men and to have to tell over again the story of their knavery and his own folly but he went through with it like a man the prisoners who were far more at their ease than the witness troubled him with no awkward crossexamination and when presently the jury retired he retired too having neither the curiosity nor the vindictiveness to remain and hear their sentence on his way out a familiar voice accosted him cruden old man will you shake hands ive been a cad to you but im sorry for it now it was blandford looking weak and pale with one arm still in a sling reginald took his proffered hand eagerly and wrung it ive been bitten over this affair as you know continued blandford and ive paid up for my folly i wish i could come out of it all with as easy a conscience as you do thats all among them all ive lost a good deal more than money but if you and horrors will take me back in your set therell be a chance for me yet im going to university college you know so i shall be staying in town harker and i will probably be lodging together and it wont be my fault if its far away from your quarters and arm in arm the old schoolfellows walked with their backs on the dark past and their faces turned hopefully to the future had reginald remained to hear the end of the trial he would have found himself the object of a demonstration he little counted on the jury having returned with their expected verdict and sentence having been passed on the prisoners the counsel for the prosecution got up and asked his lordship for leave to make one observation he spoke in the name of the various victims of the sham corporation when he stated that his clients desired to express their conviction that the former secretary of the corporation whose evidence that day had mainly contributed to the exposure of the fraud was himself entirely clear of any imputation in connection with the conspiracy i should not mention this my lord said the counsel had not a certain magistrate in another place at an earlier stage of this inquiry used languagein my humble opinion harsh and unwarranted calculated to cast a slur on that gentlemans character if not to interfere seriously with his future prospects i merely wish to say my lord that my clients and those of us who have gone fully into the case and may be expected to know as much about it even as a north country magistrate are fully convinced that mr cruden comes out of this case with an unsullied character and we feel it our duty publicly to state our opinion to that effect the counsel sat down amid signs of approval from the court not unmixed with amusement at the expense of the northcountry magistrate and the judge calling for order replied i make no objection whatever to the statement which has just fallen from the lips of the learned counsel and as it commends itself entirely to my own judgment in the matter i am glad to inform mr cruden if he be still in court that he will quit it today clear of the slightest imputation on his character unbecoming an upright but unfortunate gentleman reginald was not in court but he read every word of it next day with grateful and overflowing heart three months have passed the winter has given way to spring and number dull street is empty jemima shuckleford still nurses her sorrow in secret and it will be a year or two yet before the happy man is to turn up who shall reconcile her to life and disestablish the image of reginald cruden from her soft heart meanwhile she and her mother are constant visitors at the little house in highbury where the crudens now live and as often as they go they find a welcome samuel writes home from the country that he is doing great things and expects to become lord chancellor in a few years meanwhile he too contemplates matrimony with a widow and four children who will probably leave him among them very little leisure for another experiment in the amateur detective business the shuckleford ladies were invited but unfortunately were unable to go to a little quiet housewarming given by the crudens on the occasion of their taking possession of the new house but though they could not go miss crisp could and as a matter of course mr booms in all the magnificence of last years spring costume and waterford came too and young gedge as did also the faithful harker andwith some little trepidationthe now sobered blandford the company had quite enough to talk about without having to fall back on shouting proverbs or musical chairs indeed there were several little excitements in the wind which came out one by one and made the evening a sort of epoch in the lives of most of those present for instance young gedge was there no longer as a common compositor he had lately been made youth as he was overseer in the room of durfy and the dignity of his new office filled him with sobriety and good humour its no fault of mine said he when mrs cruden congratulated him on his promotion if cruden hadnt stood by me that time he first came to the rocket i should have gone clean to the dogs i mean it i was going full tilt that way but i went off and left you after all said reginald i know you did and i was sorry at the time you hadnt left that cab horse to finish his business the evening you picked me up but horace here and mrs cruden picked you up again said waterford regular fellow for being picked up you are all comes of your habit of picking up types one of natures revengesand the last to pick you up is the rocket what an appetite shes got to be sure i should think so from the way she swallows your and horaces lucubrations every week says gedge laughing why i actually know a fellow who knows a fellow who laughed at one of your jokes come none of your chaff said horace looking not at all displeased you never laughed at a joke i know because you never see one no more i do thats what i complain of replied the incorrigible young overseer never mind we shall have our revenge when he has to put our joint novel in print said waterford ah i thought youd sit up there my boy never mind youll know about it some day the first chapter is half done already jolly work that must be says harker more fun than higher mathematics and locke on the understanding eh bland perhaps they would be glad to change places with us before they are through with it though observes blandford never knew such a beggar for grinding as bland is turning out says harker he takes the shine out of me and im certain hell knock me into a cocked hat at the matric you forget ive lost time to make up replies blandford gravely and im not going to be content if i dont take honours dont knock yourself up thats all says reginald especially now crickets beginning we ought to turn out a good eleven with four old wilderhams to give it a backbone eh and at the signal the four chums somehow get together in a corner and the talk flies off to the old schooldays and the battles and triumphs of the famous wilderham close meanwhile booms and miss crisp whisper very confidentially together in another corner what they talk about no one can guess it may be collars or it may be fourroomed cottages or it may be only the weather whatever it is boomss doleful face relaxes presently into a solemn smile and miss crisp goes over and sits by mrs cruden who puts her arm round the blushing girl and kisses her in a very motherly way on the forehead it is a curious piece of business altogether and it is just as well the four young men are too engrossed in football and cricket to notice it and that gedge and waterford find their whole attention occupied by the contents of the little bookcase in the corner to have eyes for anything else jolly lot of books youve got says waterford when presently the little groups break up and the big circle forms again i always think they are such nice furniture in a room dont you mrs cruden yes i do says mrs cruden especially when they are all old friends some of these seem older friends than others says waterford pointing to a corner where several unbound tattered works break the ranks of greencloth giltlettered volumes look at this weatherbeaten little fellow for instance a bit of a pilgrims progress that must be a very poor relation surely you dont count him in dont i says reginald taking the book in his hands and speaking in a tone which makes every one look up at him this little book is worth more to me than all the rest put together and as he bends his head over the precious little relic and turns its wellthumbed pages one by one he forgets where he is or who is looking on and a tear steals into his eyes as his mind flies far away to a little green grave in the north country over which the soft breezes of spring play lovingly and seem to whisper in a voice he knows and loves to remembercome there too guvnor the end
