tom dick and harry by talbot baines reed another of this authors wellwritten and entertaining school books in this case the hero is young master jones to prepare for entry to the school he had been given some tuition by a lady who was a teacher at a girls school of course the other boys at the boys school soon found out that he had come to them from a girls school and he became known albeit affectionately by the nickname of sarah but he is well respected and enjoys his various friendships with the other boys noticing even at one point that they seemed to be vieing with one another for his friendship towards the end of the story his mother visits the school and is a great hit with the other boys there some moments of drama amusingly told such as when our hero is unwittingly involved in almost blowing the school up the boys involved off are hauled off to the magistrate by the local village policeman who comically had imagined that a blazer the top garment worn by schoolboys of that era and mine was a kind of lucifer which in turn was a kind of match used before the invention of the safetymatch this is a particularly amusing episode terminating in the magistrate awarding the schoolkeeper who had been slightly injured one guinea costs to pay for his bandages which he pays out of his own pocket there are no mountainside dramas as in several other books by this author and the rowing episodes on the river are quite tame there are no wicked local beerhouse owners but it is a good story quietly and evenly told best listened to rather than read nh tom dick and harry by talbot baines reed chapter one who shot the dog a shot a yell silence such as soon as i could collect myself sufficiently to form an idea at all were my midnight sensations as i sat up in my bed with my chin on my knees my hair on end my body bedewed with cold perspiration and my limbs trembling from the tips of my fingers to the points of my toes i had been peacefully dreamingsomething about an automatic machine into which you might drop a latin exercise and get it back faultlessly construed and written out i had in fact got to the point of attempting nefariously to avail myself of its services i had folded up the fiendish exercise on the passive subjunctive which plummer had set us overnight and was in the very act of consigning it to the mechanical crib when the shot and the yell projected me all of a heap out of dreamland into the waking world at first i was convinced it must have been the sound of my exercise falling into the machine and plummers howl of indignation at finding himself circumvented no machine and all had vanished but the noises rang on in my waking ears was it thunder and storm no the pale moonlight poured in a gentle flood through the window and not a leaf stirred in the elms without was it one of the fellows fallen out of bed no on every hand reigned peaceful slumber there was dicky brown in the next bed flat on his back openmouthed snoring monotonously like a muffled police rattle there was graham minor on the other side serenely wheezing up and down the scale like a kettle simmering on the hob there opposite among the big boys lay faulkner with the moonshine on his pale face his arms above his head smirking even in his sleep and there was parkin just beyond with the sheet half throttling him as usual sprawling diagonally across his bed and a bare foot sticking out at the end and here lay hullo my eyes opened and my teeth chattered faster where was tempest his bed was next to parkins but it was empty in the moonlight and in the midst of my fright i could see his shirt and waistcoat still dangling on the bedpost while the coat and trousers and slippers were gone the bed itself was tumbled and had evidently been lain in but the sleeper had apparently risen hurriedly partly dressed himself and gone out if only i could have got my tongue loose from the roof of the mouth to which it was cleaving i should have yelled aloud at this awful discovery as it was i yelled silently for of all terrors upon earth sleepwalking was the one i dreaded the most not that i had ever walked myself or indeed enjoyed the embarrassing friendship of any one who did but i had read the books and knew all about it i would sooner have faced a dozen ghosts than a somnambulist i had no doubt in my mind that the duxs empty bed was to be accounted for in this uncanny manner and that the shot and yell were intimately connected with his mysterious disappearance now i thought of it he had not been himself for some time for a whole week he had not licked me ever since he had got his entrance scholarship at low heath he had been queerer than ever he had not broken any rule of importance he had been on almost friendly terms with faulkner he had even ceased to plot the assassination of plummer he was evidently in a low state and suffering from unusual nervous excitement thus violently to interrupt the usual tenor of his way and as i knew such a state lends itself readily to the grisly practice of somnambulism what was to be done yell i couldnt do it for the life of me get up and look for him wild horses could not have dragged a toe of me out of bed stay where i was till the unearthly truant returned no thank you at the bare notion my rigid muscles relaxed my erect hair lay down and i collapsed a limp heap on to the pillow with every available sheet and blanket drawn over my tightly closed eyes and yet in my unimpassioned moments i do not think i was a notorious coward i had stood up to faulkners roundarms without pads and actually blocked one of them once and that was more than some of the fellows could say i could take my header into the pool from the same step as parkin and once i had not run away from hector when he broke loose from his kennel even now but for the dim recollection of that awful automatic machine i might have pulled myself together sufficiently to strike a light and jog my nextbed neighbour into wakefulness but somehow my nerves had suffered a shock and since there was no one near to witness my poltroonery and as moreover the night was chilly enough to warrant reasonable precautions against cold i preferred on the whole to keep my head under the clothes and drop for a season so to speak below the surface of human affairs but existence below the sheets when prolonged for several minutes is apt to pall upon a body and in due time i had to face the problem whether after all the vague terrors without were not preferable to the certain asphyxia within i had put my nose cautiously outside for the purpose of considering the point when my eyes thus uncovered chanced to fasten on the door as they did so paralysis once more seized my frame for at that precise moment the door softly opened and a figure tall pale and familiar glided noiselessly into the dormitory it was tempest he stood for a moment with the moonlight on him and glanced nervously round then apparently satisfied that slumber reigned supreme he stepped cautiously to his deserted couch my eyes followed him as the eyes of the fascinated dove follow the serpent i saw him divest himself of his semitoilet and then solemnly wind up his watch after which he slipped beneath the clothes and all was silent i lay there moving not a muscle till the breathing of the truant grew long and heavy and finally settled down to the regular cadence of sleep then i breathed once more myself my staring eyes gradually drooped my mind wandered over a large variety of topics and finally relapsed into the happy condition of thinking of nothing at all when i awoke next morning in obedience to the summons of the bell the first thing i was aware of was that tempest was complacently whistling a popular air as he performed his toilet poor dux thought i he little dreams what a terrible night he has had good morning dux i said deferentially tempest went on brushing his hair till he had finished his tune and then honoured me with a glance and a nod something in my appearance must have attracted his attention for he looked at me again and said what makes you look so jolly fishy eh youngster oh said i a little flattered to have my looks remarked upon i had a nightmare or something comes of eating such a supper as you did replied the dux wouldnt he open his eyes thought i if i told him what the nightmare was but i wont do it i therefore relapsed into my toilet and as time was nearly up left the unconscious sleepwalker to finish his in silence dr plummers select young gentlemen only numbered thirty all told chiefly sons of the trading community who received at the establishment at hampstead all the advantages of a good commercial education combined with some of the elegances of a highclass preparatory school tiptons father who was an extensive draper in an adjoining suburb was rather fond i believe of telling his friends that he had a boy at dangerfield college it sounded well especially when it was possible to add that my boy and his particular chum young tempest son of the late colonel tempest you know of the guards did this and that together and might perhaps spend their next holidays together at tempest hall in lincolnshire if he could spare the boy from home and so on it was an awful fascination for some of us to speculate what the dux would have to say if he could hear this sort of talk we trembled for tiptons father and his shop and the whole neighbourhood in which he flourished tempests presence at the college did however add quite a little prestige to the place no one seemed to suppose that it had anything to do with the fact that the terms were exceptionally moderate and that his gallant father had left very slender means behind him even dr plummer had a habit so people said of dragging his aristocratic head pupils name into his conversation with possible clients while we boys mingled a little awe with the esteem in which we held our broadbacked and welldressed comrade within the last few weeks especially the school had had reason to be proud of him he had taken an exhibition at low heath one of the crack public schools and was going up there at midsummer this was an event in the annals of plummers which had never happened before and in all probability would never happen again to do the dux justice he set no special store by himself he believed in the tempests as a race but did not care a snap whether anybody else believed in them or not any boy who liked him he usually liked back and showed his affection as he did in my case by frequent lickings boys he did not like he left severely alone and there were a good many such at dangerfield as to the exhibition that had been entirely his own idea he had not said a word about it to plummer or any of us and it was not till after he had got it and plummer in the fulness of his heart gave us a holiday in celebration of the event that we had any of us known that the dux had been in for it the second bell had already sounded before i had completed my toilet the finishing touches of which consequently i was left to add in solitude when i descended to the refectory i was struck at once by an unusual air of gloom and mystery about the place something unpleasant must have occurred but what it was nobody appeared exactly to know unless it was the principal himself dr plummer was just about to make a communication when i made my belated entry jones said he as much in sorrow as in anger this is not the first time this term that you have been late it certainly was not what is the reason please sir said i stammering out my stereotyped excuse i think i cant have heard the first bell perhaps the first six sums of compound proportion written out ten times will enable you to hear it more distinctly in future we will try it if you please jones then turning sternly to the assembled school he said i was about to say something to you boys when this disturbance interrupted me a shameful act has been done by some one in the night in which i sincerely hope no one here has had a hand the dog has been killed a whistle of consternation went round the room what hector killed hector the colliethe beastthe brutethe sneakthe traitorthe archenemy of every boy at plummers hector who was reported to be worth thirty guineas hector the darling of mrs p and the young ps hector of the teeth and the snarl and the snap the incorruptible the sleepless the unforgiving what miscreant hero had dared perform this sacrilegious exploit perish hector had been an immemorial warcry at plummers but hector had never yet perished no one had been found daring enough to bell the catthat is to shoot the dog to what scoundrel was dangerfield college now indebted for this inestimable blessing dead silence followed the doctors announcement boys faces were studies as they stood there rent in twain by delight at the news and horror at the inevitable doom of the culprit i repeat said the head master hector was found this morning shot in his kennel does any boy here know anything about it dead silence the masters eyes passed rapidly along the forms but returned evidently baffled i trust i am to understand by your silence that none of you know anything about it there is no doubt whatever that the guilty person will be found i do not say that his name is known yet if he is in this roomhere he most unjustifiably fixed me with his eyehe knows as well as i do what will be the consequence to him now go to breakfast i shall have more to say about this matter presently if dr plummer had been anxious to save his tea and breadandbutter from too fierce an inroad he could hardly have selected a better method dangerfield college was completely off its feed this morning indeed ramsbottom the usher had almost to bully the victuals down the boys throats in order to get the meal over the only boy who made any pretence to an appetite was the dux who ate steadily much to my amazement in the intervals of the conversation its a bit of a go aint it observed dicky brown who despite his educational advantages could never quite master the politest form of his native tongue rather said iawkward for somebody then as my eyes fell once more on tempest complacently cutting another slice off the loaf an idea occurred to me you know dicky said i feeling that i was walking on thin ice i almost fancied i heard a sound of a gun in the night dicky laughed trust you for knowing all about a thing after its happened it would have been a rum thing if you hadnt this was unfeeling of dicky i am sure i have never pretended to know as much about anything as he did oh but i really dida shot and a yell too said i go it youre getting on said dicky you can pile it up tom why dont you say you saw me do it while you are about it because i didnt all i can say said the dux buttering his bread liberally im precious glad the beast is off the hooks i always hated him which of you kids did it we both promptly replied that he was quite under a wrong impression we were pained by the very suggestion all right said he laughing in his reckless way and talking quite loud enough for plummer to hear him if he happened to come in youve less to be proud of than i fancied if you didnt do it who did eh that was the question which was puzzling every one except perhaps myself who was undergoing a most uncomfortable mental argument as i slowly recalled the events of last night give it up ask another said faulkner im precious glad ive not got a pistol here the dux coloured a little and relapsed into silence he disliked faulkner and objected to his cutting into the conversation one comfort said i endeavouring to change the topic we may get off that brutal latin exercise if plummer takes on hard about this affair poor old hector said dicky if thats so we shall owe him one good turn at leasteh old compound proportion this pointed allusion to my misfortunes disinclined me to hold further conversation with richard brown and the meal ended in general silence as we trooped back to the schoolroom i overheard faulkner say to another of the seniors i say did you see the way tempest flared up when i said that about the pistol just now rather awkward for him i fancy if hes got one whats the odds if he didnt shoot the dog was the philosophical reply for all that i had observed the duxs confusion and the sight of it made me very uncomfortable on his account faulkner was right it would be precious awkward for any one who might be discovered to possess a pistol the fact that firearms were expressly forbidden at dangerfield college was itself i am sorry to say a strong presumption in favour of tempest having one besides i had myself once heard him speak about shooting rooks at home with a pistol oddly enough chance was to put in my way a means of setting my mind at rest almost immediately i say kid said the dux as i entered the schoolroom just before the time ive left my latin grammar in my locker upstairs look sharp or youll be late again and catch it that was his style all overinsult and injury hand in hand he only practised it on fellows he really liked too i say i cant pleaded i plummer will give it me hot if he catches me again ive got it pretty bad as it is i know you have thats why i tell you to look sharp it was no good arguing with tempest i knew he would risk his neck for me any day that would be much less exertion to him than running upstairs so i went the duxs locker i grieve to say was a model of untidiness cricket flannels eatables letters toothpowders books and keepsakes were all huddled together in admired disorder to the full extent of the capacity of the box the books being well in the rear of the heap and time being precious i availed myself of the roughandready method of emptying out the entire contents at one fell swoop and extracting the particular object of my quest from the debris i had done so and was proceeding to huddle up the other things into a compact block of a size to fit once more into the receptacle when something fell from the pocket of one of the garments with a clatter to the floor it was a pistol with a face as white and teeth as chattering as if i had seen a ghost i instinctively pounced upon the telltale weapon and whisked it with a shudder into my own pocket then with decidedly impaired energy i punched the bundle back into its place slammed down the lid and returned to the schoolroom just in time to regain my place before dr plummer made his entry youll give yourself heartdisease if you rush up and down stairs like that said tempest as i handed him the book you look fishier than ever latin grammar juniors announced the doctor close books jones stand up and decline gradus i declined and fell the excitements of the past six hours had demoralised me altogether i could not remember who or what gradus waswhether it was an active noun or a feminine verb or a plural conjunction or what in vain the faithful dicky prompted me from behind and graham minor from the side as they both prompted at the same time and each suggested different things i only floundered deeper i felt myself smiling vacantly first at one then at the other then at the doctor i moved one hand feebly behind me in token of my despairing gratitude to dicky and the other i laid convulsively on the collar of grahams coat it was all of no avail and finally when i had almost reached the stage of laughing aloud my mother wit came to my rescue and i sat down this was the beginning of a tragedy of errors with the ghost of hector haunting us none of us except the dux who always kept his head could do anything the doctors favours were lavishly and impartially distributed watkins the baby of the class made an ingenious calculation that if all the lines which were doled out as the result of that mornings work were to be extended in one unbroken length they would reach exactly from plummers desk to the late hectors kennel hector again every ones thoughts veered round to the unlucky quadruped and the storm that was brewing over his mangled remains morning school passed however without any further official announcement on the subject when class was dismissed half an hour earlier than usual it was tacitly understood that this was in consequence of the obsequies of the late lamented which were attended by the plummer family and the errand boy not indeed in crape but amid every sign of mourning we young gentlemen were not invited had we been it is doubtful whether the alacrity with which some of us would have obeyed the summons would have been altogether complimentary to the memory of the deceased as it was we loafed about dismally discussing the topic of the hour in corners and wished the storm would break and be done with we had not long to wait chapter two a conspiracy of silence as for me i was very poor company for any one that afternoon of hectors funeral something was burning a hole in my pocket and i felt myself in a most uncomfortable fix its all up with old dux said i to myself if its found out but suppose its found on me still more precious awkward id either have to lump it or let out dont see much fun in either myself seems to me the sooner i get rid of the beastly thing the better fancy his letting it lie about in his locker hed give me a hiding for interfering i know if he only knew but i wouldnt for anything he got lagged old dux is one of those chaps that has to be backed up against himself shant be my fault if he isnt the reader will have judged by this time that i belonged to the species prig in my youthful days let that pass i was not a unique specimen full of my noble resolve of saving the dux from himself i went out to take the air and strolled aimlessly in the direction of the pond a professional burglar could not have ordered his footsteps more circumspectly i perambulated the pool whistling a cheerful tune and looking attentively at the rooks overhead not a soul was in sight i began to throw stones into the water small to begin with then larger then bits of stick about six inches long then i smuggled the unlucky pistol out of my pocket in my handkerchief and whistled still more cheerfully although no one was looking it seemed prudent to adopt an air of general boredom as if i was tired of throwing sticks into the pond i would only throw one more even that was a fag but i would do it what a plump noisy splash it made sending out circles far and near and gurgling in a sickening way as it sank in a very unsticklike fashion to the bottom my whistling ceased my air of dejection increased i must be unsociable no longer let me rejoin my dear schoolfellows making a little detour in order to appear to reach them from the direction not of the pond but of the orchard i was sheering off by the lower end of the pond when to my horror i perceived a boy groping on the grass on all fours apparently digging up the ground with a trowel on closer inspection i found that it was dicky oh its you is it said he as i came upon him have you done chucking things into the pond why said i taken aback why dicky what on earth are you up to never mindan experiment thats all im glad its only you i was afraid it was some one else you must be jolly hard up for a bit of fun to come and chuck things into the pond oh said i with telltale embarrassment i just strolled down for the walk i didnt know youd taken to gardening there goes the bell said dicky cut up ill be there as soon as you i obeyed mystified and uncomfortable suppose dicky had seen the pistol i found the fellows hanging about the school door waiting to go in been to the funeral kid said the dux as i approached i wished he would speak more quietly on such dangerous topics when plummer was within earshot no ive been a stroll said i its rather hot walking i guess it will be hotter before long said some one plummer looks as if he means to have it out this afternoon i hope he wont go asking any awkward questions said dicky who had by this time joined us whats the odds if you didnt do it demanded the dux look out said faulkner here he comes hes beckoning us in now were in for it thought we all plummer evidently meant business this time the melancholy ceremony at which he had just assisted had kindled the fires within him and he sat at his desk glowering as each boy dropped into his place with the air of a wolf selecting his victim as i encountered that awful eye i found myself secretly wondering whether by any chance i might have shot the dog in a fit of absence of mind brown i think was troubled by a similar misgiving some of the seniors evidently resented the way in which the head master glared at them and tried to glare back faulkner assumed an air of real affliction presumably for the departed tempest on the other hand drummed his fingers indifferently on the desk and looked more than usually bored by the whole business now boys began plummer in the short sharp tones he used to affect when he was wont to administer justice about hector ah that fatal name again it administered a nervous shock all round and the dead silence which ensued showed that every boy present was alive to the critical nature of the situation i have already told you what has occurred and have asked if any one here knows anything about the matter said the doctor i repeat the question if any of you know anything let there be no hesitation in speaking up no reply boys looked straight in front of them and held their breaths very well said the doctor his voice becoming harder and sterner i am to understand no boy here is able to throw any light on the mystery is that so if silence gives consent no question was ever more emphatically answered in the affirmative i hoped it would be unnecessary to ask the question twice said dr plummer i decline to accept silence as an answer let the head boy come forward tempest left his place and advanced to the desk tempest do you know anything of this matter no sir said tempest i felt the skin on the top of my head grow tight and my breath catch in my throat never had i known the dux to tell a he to any one what was i to do when my turn came go to your seat the next boy come forward parkin obeyed and answered the question with a clear negative the next boy the next boy was faulkner who i suspected would fain have been able to say he knew anything but for once he was at fault and had to reply with an apologetic no in due time it was dickys turn do you know anything of the matter brown no sir said brown almost noisily the doctor looked at him keenly and then ordered him to his place jones come forward i felt the blood fly out of my cheeks and my heart jump to my mouth as i obeyed as i passed up the room i glanced nervously at the dux where he sat listlessly regarding the scene but he took no notice of me jones said the doctor do you known anything of this matter the words would not come and i glanced around again for succour turn your face to me sir thundered the doctor and answer my question what could i say where could i look the question was repeated once more i only know i fancy i heard a shot in the night i stammered at last a flutter of interest went round the room failing all other clues it evidently seemed to be something to most of those present to elicit even this why did you not say so when you were asked this morning no answer do you hear me sir please sir i couldnt be sure i had not been dreaming when did you hear this sound i dont know what time sir i had been asleep was it light or dark dark is that all you heard i thought i heard a yell too did you get up or wake any of the others no sir did you do nothing at all i was frightened sir and hid under the clothes is that all wasnt it about enough i thought yes sir i staggered back to my seat like a wounded man after a fray i knew i had lost caste with the fellows i had seriously compromised myself with the head master at least i told myself i had escaped the desperate fate of saying anything against the dux for the sake of that i could afford to put up with the other two consequences the grand inquest came to an end one candid youth admitted that all he knew of the matter was that he was very glad hector was dead and for this impious irrelevance he was ordered to write an appalling imposition and forfeit several halfholidays but that for the time being was the worst thunderbolt that fell from the doctors armoury the dux was kindly waiting for me outside if he was grateful to me he concealed his feelings wonderfully for he seized me by the coat collar and invited me to step with him to a quiet retreat where he administered the soundest thrashing i had had that term without interruption explanation i knew would be of no avail tempest made a point of always postponing an explanation till after the deed was done when at length i gathered myself together and inquired as pleasantly as i could to what special circumstances i was indebted for this painful incident he replied for being an idiot and a sneak get away or ill kick you brown whom i presently encountered put the matter rather more precisely well said he you told about as much as you could how sorry you must have been not to tell more dont dicky said i ii youre almost as big an ass as you look said dicky and thats saying something come and see my experiment i was not in a scientific mood but anything was welcome to change the subject so i took dickys arm and went dicky was a queer boy he was of an inventive turn of mind and given up to science his experiments rarely succeeded and when they did they almost invariably landed him in disgrace still he persevered and hoped some day to make a hit he explained to me as we walked down the garden that he had lately been taking an interest in the pond it was all i could do to appear only moderately interested in this announcement had not i an interest in the pond too what followed was even more uncomfortable you know lesseps and all those chaps said he he left before i came i think said i dicky laughed unfeelingly i mean the chap who cut the suez canal said he oh i beg your pardon said i no i dont know him well ive been having a go in at the same kind of job continued dicky you know what a drop there is at the end of the pond where you saw me yesterday in the shrubbery well it struck me it wouldnt take much engineering to empty it what i exclaimed empty the pond youll get in an awful row dicky dont think of it thinkits done i tell you said the man of science that was what i was at when you saw me i thought you were digging up primroses digging up grandmothers i was letting in a pipe to drain it it was a rare job to shove it in from the bottom corner of the pond through the bank into the shrubbery but i managed it it was coming through like one oclock when i left i expect the pond will be empty by this time i quailed with horror if so i should be discovered i was tempted to turn tail but that would be even worse the only thing was to stay and see it through i confronted myself with the reflection that dickys experiments so rarely succeeded that in all probability the pistol still lay safe under four feet of water if not hooray exclaimed dicky as we came in sight of the place its done the trick this time see tom i did see in place of the water i left there in the morning was a large empty basin of mud with a few large puddles of water lying at the bottom and a few hillocks of mud denoting the places which had once been shallows my quick eye hurriedly took in the dismal landscape for a moment my spirits rose for i could nowhere discern the compromising object i dreaded to see it was no doubt buried in the mud and as safe as if the pond were full to the brim isnt it ripping said dicky it wasnt easy to do but it only wanted a little management i mean to go in for engineer hullo whats that rummy stone out there or is it a stone or a fish or i say tom he added clutching my arm im bothered if thats not a pistol my white face and chattering teeth made reply unnecessary there snugly perched on a little heap of stones as if set up for inspection lay the unlucky pistol gleaming in the afternoon sun dicky looked first at the pistol then at me and began slowly to take in the state of affairs he took a cautious step out in the mud in the direction of the weapon but came back i thought you could hardly be chucking in all those things for fun said he presently i stood gaping in an imbecile way and said nothing i know whose it is he had it up here once before i say gulped i cant you let the water in again dick had not considered this his triumph had been letting the water out however he would see what could be done we went down into the shrubbery about a foot of water lay on the ground promising great fertility some day but decidedly muddylooking today the thing will be to bung up the hole first said dicky so we set to work to hammer up the end of the zinc pipe and stuff the aperture round with sods and stones i even sacrificed my cap to the good cause the bell began to ring before we had well completed the task that ought to keep any more from running out said dicky if were lucky the water will come in on its own hook at the other end the theory was not exactly scientific for scientific men do not believe in luck still it was the best we could think of as we turned to go stop a bit said i as we were leaving may as well tidy up a bit in there before we go eh in there was the bed of the pond it might look better said dick turning up his trousers we decently interred the pistol in the mud and raised a small heap of stones to keep it down and then cautiously obliterating our footsteps in the mud we made for terra firma and scuttled back to school as fast as our legs would carry us fortunately we entered unobserved and disencumbered ourselves of our muddy boots without attracting attention to their condition ten minutes later we were deep in our work in the big schoolroom preparation that night was a solemn and gloomy ceremony dicky and i kept catching one anothers eyes and then glancing on to where the dux cool as a cucumber sat turning over the leaves of his lexicon hes got a cheek of his own has dux said i to myself if i didnt know it was him signalled the ungrammatical dicky across the room i should never have believed it you may make as many faces as you like at young brown glared tempest at me but if i catch you making any more at me your mother will need some extra pockethandkerchiefs jones observed dr plummer aloud a double poena for aggravated inattention all right i was getting pretty full up with engagements for one day and began to think bedtime would be rather a relief it came at last in the dormitory ramsbottom successfully interfered with conversation by patrolling the chamber until the boys were asleep no one doubted that he had been set to the task by the head master and it augured rather badly for the resumption of the inquest next day however even patrols go to sleep sometimes and when i woke early next morning the usher had vanished to his own chamber my first thought was not hector or the doctor or my poenas or the dux but the pond how i wondered was it getting on i routed up dicky and very quietly we dressed and slipped out i knew that my early rising if it were discovered would probably be set down to my zeal for discharging impositions but even they must wait now till we were sure about the pond for dicky and i stood liable to as big a row as the assassin of hector himself if anything went wrong with our experiment in engineering luckily very few fellows haunted this particularly muddy corner of the grounds and now that hector was above a daily bath there was little chance of plummer himself discovering the remarkably low tide on his premisesstill less of his poking about among the stones in the bed of the pool to our great relief we found that our dam at the foot was holding out bravely and that comparatively little water was trickling through the bank into the shrubbery the flow at the upper end however was distressingly small and though a whole night had passed we could still see the heap of stones under which the pistol was buried rising up from the shallow puddles around it inviting investigation with astounding industry we worked away that morning widening and deepening the little channel along which the rivulet made its way to the pond and before we had done we had the satisfaction of seeing a fairly brisk inflow we would fain have waited to see the fatal little island disappear below the surface but the first bell was already an sounding when the water completed the circle leaving it standing up more prominent than ever to our horror at this precise moment tempest strolled down hullo what are you two after fishing one way to catch them letting all the water out it was an experiment said dicky who like myself was very pale as he looked first at the dux then at the guilty hillock in the pond so it seems in other words youre making a jolly mess and are enjoying yourselves i hope youll enjoy it equally both of you when plummer sees what youve done shall you tell him i asked somewhat breathlessly the dux laughed scornfully you deserve a hiding for asking such a thing come here jump out on to that little island there and stay there till i tell you oh dux please not said i in a tone of terror which was quite out of proportion to the penalty the pistol was only two inches below the surface do you hear look sharp or ill chuck you there that might be worse it might hurt me and cut up the soil so i jumped gingerly out and stood poised with a foot in the water on either side dreading at any moment to see the stones slip and the telltale gleam of the buried weapon if you dont stand properly said the dux ill make you sit down come along young brown its time we went up to school how long am i to stay please i inquired till youre in water up to the knees said the dux as he turned away with the faithless dicky beside him up to the knees i stood loyally for five minutes during which the water gained about an eighth of an inch up my ankles then the second bell rang and things became desperate accordingly i knelt in the water until i could confidently assert that i was wet very wet indeed up to the knees which done i posted as fast as my illused legs would carry me to morning school chapter three when shall we three meet again once more dr plummer reserved himself for the afternoon perhaps it was the haunting tyranny of the defunct hector perhaps it was pique at being baffled so far in finding the culprit whatever may have been the reason he was in an ominously uncompromising mood when at last he returned to the fateful question come up the first boy said he abruptly the dux was evidently getting tired of all this business and no wonder it seemed to me and obeyed the summons not in the best of humours tempest said the doctor i repeat my question of yesterday do you know anything whatever of this matter no siri said so replied the dux in a clear voice dr plummer scowled somewhat at this tart reply he rather liked his head boy and was not prepared to find him of all others recalcitrant i do not ask what you said sir i ask what you say said he i said no im not a liar replied the dux rather fiercely the doctor received this rather more meekly than most of us expected and proceeded with his next question have you the slightest reason to suspect any one of having done it or of knowing anything about it tempest remained silent with flushed and angry face do you hear me sir asked the doctor now thoroughly roused yes sir then why dont you answer at once i would not answer the question if i could said the dux defiantly dr plummer stared at the boy as if he had been a wild beast how dare you say such a thing to me he demanded you heard my question have you the slightest grounds for suspecting any one the dux bit his lips and remained silent do you hear tempest no reply go to your seat sir i will speak to you presently tempest obeyed with head erect and a red spot on either cheek we gazed at him in amazement we had always given him credit for hardihood but we had never believed him capable of mutiny of this kind especially seems to me whispered dicky he might as well tell right away hell get expelled either way anyhow brown come forward dicky started as if he had been detected in the act of holding a pistol to hectors head he was not in the least prepared to be summoned thus out of his turn and morally he went to pieces as he rose to obey mums the word whispered i encouragingly as he started for the front the doctor was on the alert with a vengeance today jones come forward too said he it was my turn to jump now now sir what was that you said to brown just now my back went up instinctively at his tone i said mums the word i replied as doggedly as i could the doctor changed colour this was getting serious he had no precedents for such a case at dangerfield and for a moment was evidently at a loss how to proceed perhaps he regretted for once in a way the policy of believing a boy guilty till he can prove himself innocent whether he did or no it was too late to surrender it now go to your seat jones i shall deal with you presently i marched off with all the blood of the joneses tingling in my veins the ingenuous dicky was left to his ordeal singlehanded now brown said the doctor you have heard the question to which i mean to have an answerand i caution you before i repeat it to be carefuli shall know what interpretation to put on any attempt to prevaricate tell me brown do you know anything at all of this matter or have you grounds for suspecting any one of being concerned in it dicky shut his mouth with a snap and looked as if he wished devoutly some one could turn a key on it and keep it so speak sir said the doctor coming down from his desk by one of those strange freaks of perversity which are so hard to account for dickys spirits went up higher every moment and when the doctor stood over him and repeated the question a third time he almost i believe enjoyed himself he had never imagined courage was so easy to his surprise dr plummer did not strike but returned quietly to his desk brown said he you may go tell the housekeeper to pack your box in time for the early train tomorrow what exclaimed poor old dick fairly electrified into speech am i expelled sir you will be unless you speak at once i give you a last chance dicky looked up at the doctor then down at the floor i knew the struggle in his mind the thought of his people at home of the disgrace of being expelled of the suspicions he would leave behind then i could see him steal a doubtful glance at the dux and at me and then pass his eye along the rows of faces eagerly waiting for his decision then he held up his head and i knew dear old dicky was as sound as a bell no one had the right to make him turn sneakand no one should do it ill go and pack said he quietly and turned to the door neither the dux nor i saw the last of poor dicky brown at dangerfield we were otherwise engaged when he departed home in a fourwheeled cab in charge of mr ramsbottom that evening we were in point of fact in durance vile ourselves with every prospect of speedily requiring the services of two more fourwheeled cabmen on our own accounts the duxs fury at dickys summary expulsion had been quite a surprise even to me its a shame he had shouted as the door closed a caddish shame who said that asked dr plummer i did i say its a caddish shame so do i yelled i at the top of my voice and quite carried away by the occasion this was getting very embarrassing for plummer perhaps he behaved in the best way open to him under the circumstances he ignored us both and proceeded to call up faulkner to answer his precious questions much depended on faulkner then if he had refused to answer as the dux had done and brown had done and others were prepared to do plummer might have seen that his case was hopeless and have given it up faulkner was nothing like such a favourite with the head master as tempest nor had he such a following among the boys still he led his party and if he chose now to leave us in the lurch plummer was saved and we were lost i know nothing of the matter sir said faulkner and i have no reason at all to suspect any one it sounded a simple answer but it was rank treason for it was as good as saying plummer had a right to ask these questions and that he faulkner would inform if he only knew who the culprit was after that it was evident the game the duxs game and mine was up boy after boy was called up and interrogated and one by one they followed faulkner in his submission a fewlike graham junior attempted to hold out but broke down under pressure a few feebly compromised by explaining that had they known the culprit they would not have answered but as they did not they saw no reason for not saying so it comes to this then said the doctor that out of the entire school three boys and three only are silent the only conclusion i can draw from their conduct is that they dare not deny that they know something of this shameful outrage tempest you are the head boy i have always looked on you as a credit to the school and a good example to your youngers you see your present behaviour involves trouble to others than yourself i do not wish to be hasty in this matter and am willing to give you one more opportunity of answering my question do you know anything of this affair or have you any grounds for suspecting any one of being connected with it the dux flushed with indignation glared straight at the head master by way of reply and closed his lips very well sir jones i now repeat the question to you you are a little boy and there is more excuse for you as you were led astray by the bad example of a senior i caution you now to do as the others have done and give me a plain answer to a plain question otherwise you must take the consequences i am afraid i blushed and looked far less determined than i would have liked but i did my best to glare back and tighten my lips like the dux very well tempest and jones go to my study and remain there till i come we had not long to wait for our doom the doctor was in the study almost as soon as we we stood there while he wrote some letters and put away some books on the shelves then he rang the bell and handed the letters to the servant to post after that he sat in his chair for a quarter of an hour in silence evidently ruminating at last he deigned to notice our presence tempest he said i am very grieved at this i had hoped better things of you you know what the consequence must be to you im to be expelled i know said the dux the sooner the better the doctor raised his eyebrows there was no dealing with a reprobate like this i have written to your grandfather to say you will return home to morrow im sorry its not tonight said the dux and you jones said the doctor to me not heeding the last speechi am more sorry for you you are a foolish misguided boy even now if you atone for your fault by replying to my questions i am willing to spare your mother the misery you seem bent on bringing upon her this was a cruel thrust the thought of my mother had crossed my mind once or twice already and almost brought the tears to my eyes it would be hard to explain all to herand yet and yet anything was better than turning sneak i wont answer said i id sooner be expelled your desire shall be gratified said the doctor drily tomorrow you will go too thank you sir tempest you will remain here for the rest of the dayjones you will go to the dormitory and remain there i forbid you either of you to hold any communication with your late schoolfellows while you remain here next morning after breakfast we were finally brought up before the whole school and harangued publicly by the head master our punishment he told us we had deliberately brought on our own heads aggravated insubordination like ours was not to be tolerated in any school he was sure we should soon regret and be ashamed of our conduct if we were not so already for his own part he would try to forget the unfortunate affair and to think kindly of us both mr ramsbottom would see tempest to the station and the matron would escort me goodbye tempest said he holding out his hand goodbye said the dux not heeding the hand and walking to the door goodbye jones i shook hands after all plummer i thought meant to be kind though he took an odd way of showing it i was thankful when the ceremony was over and the dux and i found ourselves with our luggage in the hall waiting for our cabs all at once the old school we were leaving seemed to become dearer than i had thought the hall where we stood was full of the memory of jolly comings and goings the field out there seemed to echo with the whizzing of balls and the warwhoops of combatants the very schoolroom we had just left from which even now came the hum of work in which we were no more to join had its pleasant associations of battles fought friends gained difficulties mastered how i would have liked to run down to get a last look at the pond or upstairs for a farewell glance round the dormitory but now we were out of itdux and i the place belonged to us no more we were outsiders visitors whose time was up and whose cabs were due at the front door at any moment and what was it all for if it hadnt been for that beast hector said the dux rather dismally we shouldnt have been out here tommy he rarely called me by my christian name it was always a sign he was out of sorts i do wish youd missed him said i missed him what on earth do you mean not made such a good shotthats what i mean shot young brown are you crazy most likely said i beginning to get hot and cold at the same time why do you mean to say you didnt then didnt what shoot him shoot him me shoot i no more shot the beast than you did the perspiration started to my forehead but the pistol dux what pistol the one i found in your locker when i went to get your book you know that thing its been there all the term it hasnt even got a trigger its not there now its at the bottom of the pond the dux looked at me as if he were about to eat me up i looked back as if i were ready for it you didnt shoot hector then i faltered what do you take me for you young ass of course not then brown and i have both brown what about him he didnt think id done it he wouldnt have been expelled if he hadnt the dux gave a whistle of mingled dismay and fury you know said i i saw you come in that night just after id heard the shot and made sure oh youyou beauty cried the dux with a bitter laugh why id just gone down for my watch which id left in my blazer so as to wind it upand youyou actually go and set me down as a murderer oh dux im so awfully sorry let me go and tell plummer if you do ill wring your neck i wouldnt stay in this hole another day if he came on his knees and asked me what right has he to want to make sneaks of us do you mean to say you and young brown thought all along i had done it and that i was telling lies when i said i didnt i thought perhaps youd done it in your sleep and didnt know he laughed scornfully thats why you two were mum asked he didnt want to let out on me well yes partly im awfully sorry dux will you ever forgive me forgive you kid if id time id thrash you within an inch of your life for being such a fool and then id thank you for being such a trumpyou and brown too is it too late to do anything now asked i again not for menothing would keep me here but i dont see why you should be expelled ill tell plummer it was a mistake no you wont said i catching his arm i wouldnt stay here now for worlds its rough all round said tempest looking profoundly miserable as the rumble of a cab came up to the hall door what will your mater say kid shell understand i hope she wont send me back though get her to send you to low heath she couldnt afford it youll write to me dux most likely tell brown how sorry i am now tempest ready said mr ramsbottom goodbye kid i shant forget you next minute he was off and i was left alone i do not deny that for a moment or two i found it convenient to rub my eyes it was a hot day and the light through the window was dazzling i think then to my relief up came my cab and under the stalwart escort of mrs potts the matron i quitted dangerfield for good my journey home was as may be imagined not a festive one what would my mother say or my guardian what version of the story had plummer given them it consoled me to work myself up into a fury as i sat in the corner of the railway carriage and prepare an indictment of his conduct which should make my conduct appear not only justifiable but heroic alas heroism can rarely endure the rattle of a long railway journey long before we reached fallowfield my heart was in my boots and my fierceness had all evaporated but a year ago my father had died leaving me his only child to be the comfort and support of my mother what message of comfort or support was i carrying home today what would my guardian who had given me such yards of stern advice about honouring my betters say when he heard should i be sent to an office to run errands or passed on to a school for troublesome boys or left to knock about with no one to care what became of me with such pleasant misgivings in my mind i reached fallowfield and braced myself up for the interview before me chapter four brushingup the classics my guardian i am bound to say disappointed me i had rather hoped as i travelled home that i would be able to put my conduct before him in such a way that he would think me rather a fine young fellow and consider himself honoured in being my guardian that my mother would take on i felt sure women said i to myselfi was thirteen and therefore was supposed to know what women thought about thingswomen cant see below the surface of things but old girdler was a boy himself once and knows what it is for a fellow to get into a row for being a brick my sage prognostications were falsified doubly my mother though she wept to see me come home in this style did me justice at once to think i could ever have doubted her of course sonny dear said she kissing me it was very hard still i am sure it would have been a shabby thing to tell tales i wasnt going to do it at any rate said i growing a little cocky and deciding that some women at any rate can see more than meets the eye but mr girdler when he called in during the evening was most disappointing so this is what you call being a comfort to your mother began he without so much as giving me a chance to say a word oh but you dont understand sir began i dont understand said he i understand you are a naughty little boyto think that i should live to be called a little boyand that the mischief about your schooling is that youve not been smacked as often as you ought understand indeed what do you suppose your mothers to do with a boy like you thats wasted his time and then tells people they dont understand i dont think tommy meant began my mother but my guardian was too quick for her no thats just it they never do and yet you pay fifty pounds a year to teach him it doesnt matter to some children who else is troubled as long as they enjoy themselves children and i had once caught parkin at coverpoint go up to bed now said my guardian your mother and i must see whats to be done with you dont i understand indeed the conceit was fairly taken out of me now to be called a little boy was bad enough to be referred to as a child was even worse but to be sent to bed at a quarter to eight on a summer evening was the crowning stroke certainly plummers itself was better than this what my mother and guardian said to one another i do not know my mother i think had great faith in mr girdlers wisdom and although she tried not to think ill of me would probably feel that he knew better than she did i knew my fate next morningit was worse than my most hideous forebodings i was to work at my guardians office every morning and in the afternoon i was to go up and learn latin and arithmetic atoh how shall i say ita girls school for an hour after this discovery i candidly admit that i was sorry unfeignedly sorry i had not turned sneak and informed against harry tempest i think even he would have wished me to do it rather than suffer this awful humiliation i had serious thoughts of running away of going to sea or sweeping a london crossing but there were difficulties in the way the chief of them being my mother you mustnt worry about it tommy said she mr girdler says it will be the best thing for you it will be good for you to learn some business you know and then in the afternoon you will find miss bousfield very nice and clever its not the work i mind mother said i itsits going to a girls school theres nothing very dreadful about it im sure said my mother with a smile i was at one myself once but argued i you are only a nothat wouldnt quite do to ones own mother so i stopped short besides said she mr girdler thinks it the best thing and he is your guardian this was unanswerable and i gave it up but i was not at all consoled the bare idea of tempest or brown or any of the other fellows getting to know that i thomas jones aged thirteen who had held my own at plummers and played in my day in the third eleven was going to attend a girls school and be taught latin and sums by aa female was enough to make my hair stand on end how they would laugh and wax merry at my expense how they would draw pictures of me in the book covers with long curls and petticoats how they would address me as jemima and talk to one another about me in a high falsetto voice how they would fall into hysterics when they met me and weep copiously and ask me to lend them hairpins and parasols i knew what it would be like only too well and i quaked as i imagined it my one hope was that at fallowfield nobody knew me at least nobody who mattered at least said i to myself if i am to go and herd with a parcel of girls ill let them see im something better than a girl myself when i presented myself at my guardians office on the appointed morning in order to start on my commercial career i met with a reception even less flattering than i had pictured to myself mr girdler was out and had left no instructions about me so for two hours i sat in the waitingroom balancing my cap on my knee and trying to work up the spots on the dingy wallpaper into geometrical figures when at last he came so far from commending my patience he had the face to reproach me for sitting there idle instead of getting some one to set me to work you are not at school here remember said he by way of being sarcastic you come here to work i worked at school said i meekly so i hear said he now go to mr evans and tell him you want a job whereupon my genial guardian quitted me but he came back a moment after remember you are to be at the girls school at tell miss bousfield you are the little boy i spoke to her about and mind you behave yourself up there was ever a young man in such a shameful disgrace three days ago i had imagined myself everybody two days ago i had at least imagined myself somebody yesterday i had discovered with pain that i was nobody and today i was destined to wonder if i was even that mr evans raised his eyebrows when i delivered my message to him are you the governors little ward he inquired whos just finished his education all right my little man well find a job for you run up high street and bring me the time by the market clock and heres a halfpenny to buy yourself sweets on the way it occurred to me as odd that mr evans should want to know the time by a clock which was quite ten minutes walk from the office still perhaps he had to set the office clocks by it so i set off wondering whether i ought to take the halfpenny but taking it all the same i decided that the dignified course would be to buy the sweets but to take them all back to him so as to impress him with the fact that i was not as devoted to juvenile creature comforts as he evidently thought me is that all you have left said he when after accomplishing my errand i presented them to him my eye youve made good use of your time and no mistake ive not eaten a single one said i it would have been better for your digestion if you had only eaten a single one instead of swallowing half the lot i know the ways of you boys well whats the time it was twentyfive past ten i didnt ask you what it wasi want to know what it is it then occurred to me for the first time that mr evans was a humourist it seemed to me a feeble joke but he evidently thought it a good one as did also the other clerks to whom he communicated it the worst of it was that the more i tried to explain that not having a watch of my own i could not answer for the time by the market clock at any moment but that at which i saw it the more they seemed to be amused some suggested i should go back with a bag and bring the time in it others that i should put it on ten minutes and then come back so as to arrive at the exact moment it was when i left it others were of opinion that the best way would be for me to go and fetch the market clock with me mr evans however decided that my talents were not equal to the task of bringing the time in any shape or form and that the best thing i could do was to sit down and lick up envelopes which i accordingly did feeling rather small i cut my tongue and spoiled my appetite over the operation and was heartily glad when after a couple of hours mr evans said master tommy were going to lunch youve had yours so you can stop here and keep shop till we return i have to go to miss bousfields at said i to go where they all inquired and as i blushed very red and tried to explain myself away they made a great deal out of my unlucky admission youre young for that sort of thing said one i didnt go courting myself before i was fifteen id made up my mind sarah bousfield was going to be an old maid said another heigho its never too late to mend i hear she keeps sugarplums for good little girls said another and the bad little ones get whipped and put in the corner he mustnt go like that anyhow said mr evans who for a responsible head clerk of a big business was the most flippant person i had ever met look at his hairall out of curl come here little girl and be made tidy once at plummers i had come in second for the halfmile under fourteen and been captain of my side in the junior tug of war now i was to have my hair curled publicly it was no use resisting i was held fast while evans with a long penholder made ringlets of my back hair and scroop with his five fingers made a fringe of my front my hat moreover was decorated with quills by way of feathers and a fan made of blottingpaper was thrust into my hands then i was pronounced to be nice and tidy and fit to go and join the other little girls i fear that the energy with which as soon as i was released i deranged my locks and flung the feathers from my hat amused my persecutors as much as it solaced me i was conscious of their hilarious greetings as i strolled up the street trying to walk in a straight masculine way but hideously conscious of blushing cheeks and nervous gait i so far forgot myself that in my eagerness to display my male superiority i jostled against a lady and disgraced myself by swaggering on without even apologising for my rudenesswhen to my consternation the lady uttered my name tommy it was my mother i was still within sight of the office how evans and his lot would make merry over this contretemps they wouldnt know who it was who was putting her hand on my shoulder and yet i am glad to say that i was spared that day the disgrace of being ashamed of my own dear mother let the fellows think what they liked if they had mothers like mine they wouldnt be the cads they were so with almost unnecessary pomp i raised my hat to my parent and put my hand in her arm youre going up to miss bousfields said she i thought i should meet you what a hurry you were in yes im sorry i knocked against you mother im glad you did im longing to hear how you got on today oh pretty well was it very hard work not particularly youll soon be quite a man of business it occurred to me that if my business career was to be based on no better experience than that i had hitherto had in my guardians office i should not rank as a merchant prince in a hurry would you like me to go with you to miss bousfields if you like mother but i can go alone all right she was a brick she guessed what i hoped she would say and she said it well ill be looking out for you at teatime dear boy said she and she patted my arm lovingly as i started on i wished those fellows could have heard her voice and seen her kind face she treated me like a manwhich was more than could be said for them i went on my way soothed in my ruffled spirits but my perturbation revived when i stood on the doorstep of the girls high school and rang the head mistresss bell it was a bitter pill i can tell you for a fellow who had once been caned by plummer for practising on the horizontal bar without the mattress underneath to fall on miss bousfield was a shrewd not disagreeablelooking little body who saved me all the trouble of selfintroduction by knowing who i was and why i came well jones said shei liked that i had dreaded she would call me tommyhere you are how is your mother why what a state your hair is in i really think youd like to go into the cloak room youll find a brush and comb there it looks as if your hair were standing on end with horror at me you know little she knew what my hair was on end about i was almost grateful to her for the way she put it and meekly retired to the cloak room wherei confess itwith a longtailed girls comb and a soft brush and a big lookingglass i contrived to restore my truant locks to their former masculine order when i returned to the room miss bousfield was sitting at a table at which was also seated a young lady of about twenty with an exercise book and dictionary in front of her was it a trap was i to be taught along with the girls after all miss bousfield evidently divined my perturbation and hastened to explain miss steele this is master jones who is going to read latin with us miss steele is one of my teachers jones and we three are going to brush up our classics together you see oh all right that wasnt so bad i had no objection to assist miss steele or miss bousfield for the matter of that in brushingup their classics as long as the girls at large were kept out of the way i acknowledged miss steeles greeting in a patronising way and then looked about for a chair i wished mr evans and his lot could see how far removed i was from the common schoolgirl here were two females actually going to pick my brains for their own good if women must learn latin at all they could hardly do better than secure a public schoolboy to brush them up now let us see said miss bousfield how far we have all got miss steele you have read some cicero i know already cicero that girl read cicero when i had barely begun caesar this was a crusher for me how about the brushingup now and you jones have you begun cicero yet well no i said not yet caesar then i think we shall both be ready to take that up again how far were youor shall we begin at the beginning better begin at the beginning said i anxious not to have to confess that i had not yet got through the first chapter but before we had gone many lines miss bousfield i could see began to have her doubts about my syntax and after a little conference about syntax the question of verbs came up unpleasantly for me and after deciding we had a little brushingup to do there the conversation turned on declensions a subject on which i had very little definite information to afford to these two females in distress i verily believe we should have come to exchanging views on the indefinite article itself had not miss bousfield taken the bull by the horns and said i think the best thing jones will be for us to assume we know nothing to begin with and start at the beginning we shall easily get over the ground then and it will be all the better to be sure of our footing let us take exercise in the grammar miss steele pouted a little as if to indicate it was hardly worth her while as a reader of cicero to waste her time over a high tree a bad boy a beautiful table and so on but i felt sure the exercise would do her good and was glad miss bousfield set her to it she irritated me by having it all written down in a twinkling and going on with cicero on her own account while i plodded on up the high tree and around the beautiful table i hoped miss bousfield would rebuke her for insubordination but she did not and i began to think much less of both ladies as the afternoon went on it did not add to my satisfaction to get my exercise back with fifteen corrections scored across it in bold red pencilwhereas miss steeles was not even looked at i thought of suggesting that it would be only fair that she and i should be treated alike when miss bousfield capped all by saying to her governess perhaps miss steele you will go through the exercise with jones and show him where he has gone wrong then he can write it out again for you and try not to have any mistake this time this was really too much to be passed on to a girl who was learning latin herself and for her to score about my exercises it was a conspiracy to degrade me in the eyes of myself and my fellowmortals but protest was rendered impossible by miss bousfield quitting the room and leaving me to the mercies of her deputy why said miss steele not at all unkindly but with a touch of raillery in her voicewhy were you such a goose jones as to pretend you knew what you didnt i didnt i forgot thats all said i well look here jones said she in a friendly wayand by the way she was not at all badlookingif you really want to get up latin and mean to work ill do my best to coach you but if youre only playing at learning ive something better to do im not playing said i i dont know why ive got to come and learn latin at all i suppose you are going to a school some day arent you ive been to one and ive left said i left said she with a little laugh well then i was expelled said i tell me all about it and i did and found her not only interested and sympathetic but decidedly indignant on my account it was a great shame said she especially as your friend never shot the dog at all hes all right lucky chap said i hes got an exhibition to low heath and is going there after the holidays why dont you get an exhibition too jones the question astounded me i get an exhibition i who had been licked once a week for bad copies and had been told by every teacher i had had anything to do with that i was a hopeless dunce why not said the siren at my side youre not a dunce i can tell that by the way you picked up some of the caesar just now youre lazy thats all thats easily cured but id have no chance at low heath tempest was a dab at lessons hes older than you besides the junior exhibitions are not as hard to get when will you be fourteen july next year just twelve months why not try jones ill back you up ive coached my young brother and he got into rugby you neednt tell any oneso if you miss nobody will be any the wiser it will make all the difference to have an exam to aim at i stared in wonder at miss steele that young woman could have twisted me round her finger ill try said i not unless you mean to work like a horse said she all serene said i honour bright then its a bargain mark my word well pull through whereat we fell hammer and tongs on exercise number of the grammar chapter five a coach drive if any one had told me two days ago that it would be reserved to an assistant teacher in a girls school to inspire me with an ardent interest in latin and arithmetic i should have laughed him to scorn miss steele however succeeded in achieving the impossible i am bound to confess that my newborn ardour was not mainly due to affection for the dead language in question or even to esteem for my preceptress but the idea of taking low heath so to speak by storm had fairly roused my ambition the glory of rising superior to my fate of shaking off the illtutored mr evans and his works and rejoining my old schoolcomrade with all the prestige of a fellowexhibitioner captivated my imagination and steeled me to the endurance of hardships of which i had hitherto conceived myself utterly incapable miss steele had no notion of letting me off my bargain she procured particulars of the examinations and very formidable appeared the list of subjects as we conned them still she was firm in her belief that i could do it if i only worked and since her eagerness fully equalled my own there was not much chance of my work dropping slack if any other incentive was wanted it was the supreme discomfort of my position at my guardians office my comrades there persistently misunderstood me they put me down as an opiniated young prig with whom all sorts of liberties might be taken and out of whom it was lawful for their own amusement to take unlimited rise i was of course unmercifully chaffed about the girls school hes getting on said one of them on the very morning after my debut they walk out together that was not miss bousfield you saw me with at all i explained that was my mother quite time she came to look after you too how did she like your curls you should put them in papers overnight then we shouldnt have to do them every day where upon i was seized and had my locks tied up in wads of blotting paper and ordered to sit down and lick envelopes and not dare to put my hand to my head till leave was accorded me from headquarters in this plight my guardian came in and discovered me please mr girdler said i not waiting for him to remark on my curious appearance but mr girdler who was not ordinarily given to mirth abruptly left the room with a smile on his face before i could proceed when he reentered he was stern and severe make yourself decent at once sir said he no i dont want any of your explanations no doubt they are highly satisfactory i begin to understand now why you were sent away from school it strikes me an idiot asylum is the proper place for you i dismally tore my curlpapers out of my hair and went on with my work till the blessed hour of release came then i hied straight to the nearest barber i want my hair as short as you can cut it said i very good sir we can give you the county crop if you like is that the shortest you do inquired i not knowing what the county crop was well sir we aint asked to take more off as a rule unless it is a clean shave you want no the county crop will do said i and to do the barber justice i got it i barely knew myself in the glass when the operation was over i had some misgivings as to the remarks of evans company in the morningat any rate they wouldnt curl my hair any more miss bousfield and miss steele regarded me with something like dismay when they saw me but were polite enough to make no remark beyond giving me permission to wear my hat if i felt a draught miss steele has been telling me of your plan of work said miss bousfield and i fully approve on the understanding you are serious about it i am not so sanguine as miss steele is still i do not wish to discourage you jones but understand it means a years hard work i assured her i was prepared for any amount of work and miss steele whose ambition was as keenly aroused as mine gave a general promise on my behalf that i would work like a horse now said she when miss bousfield had left us youre in for it jones if you dont work mind it will be a disgrace to me as well as you i fear during the months that followed this ardent young coach was frequently on the point of disgrace for a week or two i surprised myself with my industry then i caught myself wondering at odd times whether i was really as sure of passing as i fancied and whether if i failed it would not be a horrible sell to have worked so hard for nothing then for a day or so i came in a little late and took to grumbling over my tasks now look here jones said she one day you were five minutes late on monday ten minutes late on tuesday and wednesday and a quarter of an hour late today how much is that in the week forty minutes said i mental arithmetic was a strong point with me very good theres forty minutes lost the examination may turn on the very lesson you might have learned in that time now im not going to threaten you but what should you say if i were to call at the office and fetch you every day i nearly jumped out of my chair oh dont please dont miss steele said i ill be here to the second in future i promise all right said she with a smile and the subject dropped this dreadful threat kept me up to the mark for the next few weeks but even it lost its terrors in time and my preceptress had to apply the spur in other ways as the time went on once after i had been particularly slack and had moreover been so rude to her that she ended the lesson abruptly i thought it was all up for when i presented myself next day i was informed by the servant that miss steele was busy and had no time to see me i was locked out my dismay knew no bounds suppose she had chucked me altogether what would become of my chance of getting into low heath i retired home in great perturbation and confided the state of the case to my mother who advised me there and then to sit down and write an apology i had never done such a thing in my life once i had verbally begged tempests pardon for some error but to commit myself in writing to a girl my dear miss steele i wroteim sorry yours truly t jones that will do very well said my mother its not too long at the same time it says what you want to say i wasnt altogether pleased with it myself but allowed the maid to take it up to the school with instructions to wait for an answer in due time she returned with a missive from miss steele my dear jonestomorrow as usual yours truly m steele i am sure no model letterwriter ever said as much in as few words this little correspondence cleared the air for the time no reference was made to it when i turned up as usual the next day but from the way i worked and the way she taught it was evident we had both had a shake my next relapse was even more serious it came early in the spring after our work had proceeded for about nine months i really had made good progress all round not in latin only but in greek grammar arithmetic and english and was naturally inclined to feel a little cocky of the result dont crow jones she said youve a lot to do yet but i did not altogether agree with her and was inclined to indulge myself a little of an evening when i was supposed to be preparing my work in an evil day i fell across an old bookshop and found two books which helped to undo me one was a rollicking story of a pirate who swept the western main and captured treasure and seized youths and maidens and ran blockades and was finally brought to book in a sportsmanlike manner by a jolly young english middy amid scenes of terrific slaughter amidships that was one purchase the other was even more disturbing it was a crib to the arithmetic i was doing with all the sums beautifully worked out and the answers given soi must make the confessioni astonished miss steele greatly for a while by my extraordinary proficiency in arithmetic and during the same time spent my evenings in imagination on the high seas flying aloft the black flag and shooting across the bows of her majestys ships wherever i sighted them this career of duplicity could not be expected to last long one afternoon miss steele brought matters to a crisis by calling upon me to work a sum on the spot which was not in the book i failed egregiously thats singular said she its far simpler than those you brought with you today how long did it take you to do them i looked hard at miss steele and she looked hard at me the pirate game was up at last about two minutes each said i two minutes yesas fast as i could copy them out of the crib im sorry miss steele she shut up her book abruptly i didnt expect it of you jones said she youve been making a fool of me ive lost confidence in you now you can go oh i say miss steele im so awfully be quiet sir and go said she more fiercely than i had ever known her i took up my cap and went she was in no humour to listen to explanations but it was clear i had done for myself now after what had happened she was not likely to give me another chance i did not care to tell my mother how matters stood this time it would be difficult to put my case in a favourable light and i was quite sure my mother could not help me out of my difficulty i solemnly burned my crib that night in the parlour fire after every one was in bed it took ages to consume and nearly set the chimney on fire in the operation but when that was done i was as far off a solution of my difficulty as ever i hardly slept a wink and in the morning my mother added to my discomfort by remarking on my looks youre working too hard dear boy said she i must ask miss steele to give you a little holiday or youll be quite knocked up please dont said i im all right here the postmans knock caused a diversion a letter for you tommy said my mother it was from tempest of all peoplethe first he had condescended to write me since we had parted company in plummers hall nearly a year ago it was a rambling patronising effusion in his usual style but every word of it in my present plight had a sting for me its a pity youre not here wrote he its a ripping place everything about the place is ripping except the drilling master and the dumplings on mondays which are both as vile as vile can be im in the upper fifth and shall probably get my ribbon and perhaps my house after summer plummers was regular tomfooling to this weve a match on with rugby this term and im on the reserve for the eleven i suppose you know young brown is coming here though im sorry to say as a day boy his people are going to live in the town so hell be able to come on the cheap i shall do what i can for him but i expect hell have a hot time for the day boys are rather small beer the exhibitioners have the best time of it if brown could get a junior exhibition and live in school he could fag for me and have a jolly time but poor dicky hasnt got it in him i got rather lammed after i got home from plummers but it was all right when plummer wrote to say that a burglar had shot the dog and he was sorry there had been a mistake and hoped id go back catch me its better fun hereas much cricket as you like and a river and gymnasium and all sorts of sprees it wouldnt be half bad if you were here kid but i suppose youre a young gent with a topper and a bag at your guardians office i hope it suits youwouldnt me and so on how this letter made me long to be at low heath and how it made me realise what an ass i had been to go in for that crib i really felt too bad to go that day to miss steele even if she would have let me and wandered about cudgelling my brains how on earth i could get her to take me back again she wouldnt believe my protestations i knew but she might believe deeds not words so i shut myself up in my room and took down my arithmetic and worked out sum after sum all off my own bat till my brain reeled and i could hardly distinguish one figure from another some i knew were wrong others i hoped were right all were bona fide i stuck to it till nearly midnight and then merely writing my name on the top put them into an envelope under the flap of which i wrote ive burnt the crib try me this once and posted them to my offended teacher no answer came for twentyfour hours which i spent on pins and needles working away frantically during my leisure hours and occupying part of my business time in personally avenging an insult offered to miss steeles name by one of my guardians junior clerks i wished she could have seen me i got a terrible blow on the eye but i gave him two and caused him to regret audibly that he had spoken disparagingly of my cruel fair next morning a note came to my mother please tell your boy i shall be in this afternoon in fear and trembling i presented myself and confronted not miss steele but miss bousfield who addressed me in terse and forcible language and gave me to understand that i was a person of extremely secondrate character and attainments i acknowledged it but hoped for an opportunity of improving her impressions i shall leave it to miss steele to do as she thinks best said the head mistress i am sorry indeed her time has been wasted over a worthless pupil you had better wait till she comes i waited grimly like a culprit for the jury when she came in and saw as i suppose my woebegone face i read hope in her manner i got your note jones said she oh i say miss steele im really frightfully sorry i know it was a caddish thing to do especially when you had been so kind look here i did all those sums myself without help and heres another batch ive done since andand here i resolved to play a trump card and i got this black eye sticking up for you that settled it she smiled once more and said well jones ill say no more about it this once i had made up my mind it was no use our going on together but ill try if you will tryill kill myself working said i to make up that wouldnt do much good said she but ill try to forget all this ever happened and well go on just where we left off that was page said i eagerly and i say miss steele you remember my telling you about tempest and dicky brown you know well is that on page or is it something which we can talk about when work is done so i got my chance once again and this time i stuck to it the nearer the time came the more desperately we worked sometimes miss steele had positively to hunt me out for a walk or if i would not go alone to drag me along with her to some place where regardless of our possible detection by evans and his friends we could combine fresh air and education the fatal day came at last when i had to go off to my ordeal i was obliged at the last moment to disclose my wellkept secret to my mother and my guardian the former fell on my neck the latter grunted incredulously and embarrassed me by presenting me with a fiveshilling piece miss steele came down to see me off at the station keep cool said she sit where you can see the clock and dont try to answer two questions at once never did tyro get better advice i was too excited to heed much of the big stately building i was so eager some day to claim as my own school it was holiday time and only a little band of combatants like myself huddled into one corner of the big hall and gazed up in an awestruck way at the portrait of the jacobean knight to whom low heath owed its foundation to me it was all like a dream i woke to discover a paper on the desk before me a paper bristling with questions each of them challenging me to get into the school if i could then i remember dashing my pen into the ink and beginning to write keep cool keep your eye on the clock try one question at a time echoed a voice in my ear how lonely i felt there all by myself how i wished i could turn and see her at my side the clock crawled round from eleven to three and i went on writing then i remember a hand coming along the desk and taking the papers out of my sight then a bewildered train journey home and a hundred questions at the other end i went on dreaming for a week conscious sometimes of my mothers face sometimes of miss steeles sometimes of mr evanss but what i did with myself in the interval i should be sorry to be called upon to tell at last one morning i woke with a vengeance as i held in my hand a paper on which were printed a score or so of names third among which i made out the words jones tmiss m steele high school fallowfield exhibition l so i was a low heathen at last chapter six up to form i have reason to fear that for a fortnight after i received the astounding news of my scholastic success i was an intolerable nuisance to my friends and a ridiculous spectacle to my enemies i may have had some excuse i had worked hard and got myself into a tilted state of mind altogether still that was no reason why i should consider that the whole world was standing still to look on at my triumph still less why i should patronise my mother and miss steele and miss bousfield as three wellintentioned persons who had just had an objectlesson in the inferiority of their sex my mother and miss steele were too delighted to mind my airs they were really proudone to be my mother the other to be my coach and when i strutted in and talked as if they barely knew how honoured they were by my company they laughed goodhumouredly and said to one another no wonder hes pleased with himself dear boy miss bousfield was less disposed to bow the knee i hope you wont forget what you owe to miss steele said she i never hoped she could make as much as she did of such unpromising material its what i always have saidgood teaching can make a scholar of a dunce ah said i you thought i was a dunce i determined you should see i wasnt i am glad your school gets the credit of the exhibition ill wait and see how you turn out before i am glad said she i hope the high school will not get a reputation for turning out prigs jones i couldnt quite understand miss bousfield she was not as cordial as i thought she might be considering the honour i had brought upon her school my guardians clerks were even less impressed by my distinction than she whats the matter this morning said mr evans on the day of my triumph as i sat smiling inwardly at my desk nothing particular said i it looks as if it was bad stomachacheid try camomile pills if i were you thank youi dont require pills if you want to know ive been up for an exam and passed been up where up for an examan examination said i surprised at their density where at the girls school girls school no at low heath mr evans looked grave and beckoned his comrades a little nearer awfully sad isnt it said he with a seriousness which surprised me yes its a good institution though my uncle tried to get a case in there once but failed i wasnt surprised to hear that they only let the very dotty ones in said mr evans besides itll be a part payment caseat least i should think the governor will plank down something its worth l a year for four years said i understanding very imperfectly the drift of these remarks but pleased at least to find i had succeeded in impressing my fellowclerks ah so muchthey cant treat cases like yours for nothing when are you going in in september its a splendid placefive hundred fellows there so many its rather sad to think about isnt it hodges five hundred what a lot of trouble there is in the world to be sure i cant say i shall be sorryi know one or two chaps there already very likely if it runs in the family at all what runs said i not taking him mr evans tapped his forehead never mind said he its not your fault i expect four years will do marvels with you well come and see you sometimes on visiting days ah i dont suppose there are visiting days except for parents said i i know one or two of the staff though said one of the party i shall be able to hear about you from them oh all right said i i hope things here will go on all right when im at school school said mr evans stooping with his hands on his knees and looking into my face did you say school is low heath a school rather what did you think it was we thought it was an idiot asylum said mr evans and a shout of laughter at my expense confirmed his statement i did not deign to explain and for the few days i remained at the office i made no further reference to my academic triumphs though my comrades rarely failed to make merry over the asylum at the end of a fortnight i began to come to myself and realise that i had not exactly borne my honours blushingly and i was glad when my mother proposed a week or two at the seaside to brace up before plunging into the ocean of public school fife my guardian who had of late grown fairly civil to me in the prospect of getting me off his hands was good enough to release me from the office and i shook the dust of that detestable place off my feet with unfeigned thankfulness mr evans wanted to get up a farewell supper for me and i was very near allowing myself the honour when i accidentally discovered that all the provisions were to be ordered in my name and the bill sent to me whereupon i declined the invitation with thanks and regretted that a previous engagement would prevent my having the pleasure of joining their party once in the quiet of the seaside with my mother for companion i recovered my proper frame of mind and began to take sober views of the prospect before me i wrote to tempestrather a cocky letter perhaps but one full of delight at the prospect of joining him at low heath and claiming his patronage and support his reply was characteristic to say the least the examiners for exhibitions here are the biggest muffs out they plough the only men worth having and let in no end of scugs the consequence is low heath is packed full of asses as youll find out im glad they let you in though as it will be sport having you here and making you sing small i do hope though it wont get out that youve been coached by a female or therell be a terrific lark im getting quite a dab at photography and shall have my camera up next term mind you get the rightshaped boiler or i shall cut you the kids are to be stopped wearing round tops like their betters so youd best cut yours square brown was too cute to try for an exhibition its bad enough for him to be a day boy but it would be a jolly sight worse to be an exhibitioner as well when you come up mind youre not to collar me its bad form for a kid to collar a senior wait till i speak to you or else get some chap to bring you and introduce you fellows who shirk form get jolly well lammed so youd better go easy at first bring plenty of pocketmoney and some thick boots for kicking chaps backyours truly ht tempest this letter both gratified and perturbed me it was pleasing to be hailed as one of the inner circle of a fellow like tempest but it made me suspect that i should not be taken into the fold at my own valuation but that of my betters which in a public school is a very different thing the little details too about dress and manners rather startled me for supposing i had gone up not knowing these things what mistakes i should have made suppose for instance i had gone up in a billycock with a round instead of a square top or suppose i had hailed tempest without his first speaking to me what would have become of me i trembled to think of it and was glad to feel i had a friend at court who would see i didnt shirk form what made me still more uneasy was the reference to my connection with a girls school the prize list had made it appear to any one who did not know better that i was a pupil from miss steeles high school fallowfield suppose this list should get into the hands of any of the fellows or that some other new boy should carelessly leave his copy about i wished i had had more sense than to mention the high school at all this came of my chivalrous desire said i to myself to give miss steele and her principal the benefit of my distinction now i might have to thank them for endless trouble i did my best to hope the worst would not happen fellows never read prize lists of exams theyve not been in for thought i and when they have been in they never trouble themselves about any ones name but their own why i havent even noticed where a single other chap comes from they may all be girls schools for all i know its not likely any one has noticed mine and to avoid all accident i dropped mine into the fire and had to stand my mothers reproaches for destroying a document she had intended to treasure till her dying day as the time for my going to low heath approached i began to turn my attention seriously to my trousseau my first care was to get the squaretopped boiler and a rare job i had to procure it none of the hatters in fallowfield knew of such a shape in young gents hats and the shopkeepers in wynd whither i went over on purpose were equally benighted my mother too protested that she had never heard of such a kind of hat and that it would be hideous when i got it that was no fault of mine it was the low heath form and that was enough for me at length i heard of a hat of the kind at deercut five miles off and walked thither it had been made said the hatter for a young sporting party who attended to a gentlemans stables and knew a thing or two he had got into trouble it was explained and was doing his time on the circular staircase which i took to mean the treadmill that was the reason the article had been thrown on the makers hands it seemed just the thing tempest described the top was as flat as the lid of a workbox indeed it was precisely like a somewhat broadbrimmed chimneypothat cut down to half height and after a little pinching in at the sides fitted me beautifully the maker was delighted to be able to suit me and smiled most graciously when i paid him my five shillings and walked out of the shop with my junior exhibitioners boiler on my head i set down to envy or ignorance the jeers of the village youths who encountered me on my way home some people will laugh at anything they do not understand my mothers protests when she saw me however were not so easy to dispose of why tommy it makes you look like a common cheapjack said she its not a gentlemans hat at all im sure they would not tolerate it at low heath on the contrary said i its the form there you might say the same of mortar boards or bluecoat dresses it all depends on the school but are you sure tempest was not exaggerating tempest is the most particular chap about form i know said i well dear promise me you wont wear this dreadful hat till you go to school wear your nice cap that suits you so well till then i humoured her indeed i was a little shy myself of meeting mr evans or any of that set in my new garb they would be sure to pass their nasty personal remarks upon it it would be better to preserve it in its virgin purity for my entrance to low heath i took the precaution to write to tempest and mention that i had got it appending to my letter a rough sketch of the hat so that if there were anything wrong about it he would be able to correct me he wrote back in great good spirits just the thing kid itll take the shine out of all the boilers up here did i tell you about gloves the knowing ones mostly sport lavender but the outsiders dont wear any except at the first call over in the term when of course its compulsory one muff last term got pretty well lammed because he only had twobutton gloves instead of six i believe one or two others were just as bad only they didnt get kotched but it was a lesson to them i wonder if young brown will be up to the tips or whether hell turn up in black boots instead of tan i shant write to him because hes a townboy and it would be low tata dont forget to wear your collar outside your greatcoat or i shant speak to youyours till then ht i kept this letter carefully from my mother i knew it would only distress her and suggest all sorts of difficulties for dear soul it would be so hard to explain to her the exigencies of school form what would have become of me without old tempest i should have come utterly to grief i felt my only fear was that he might have forgotten something which it was as important i should be made aware of as the hat or the sixbutton lavender gloves or the tan boots i am afraid i must plead guilty to a little duplicity in the matter of purchasing these highly necessary articles of my kit i had to persuade my mother to allow me to choose my own gloves and boots and expended the money in such a manner that i could show her an ordinary pair of each while the special articles were carefully concealed in my box she thought the cheap black shoes and dogskin gloves i paraded before her dear at the price but she little knew that i had safely stowed away an elegant pair of light lavender gloves and a pair of tan boots of the most fashionable appearance i had some difficulty about the former for sixbutton gloves for young gents was not a stockline in any of the shops i had finally to get a ladys twelvebutton pair and cut them down to suit my requirements the tan boots were more easily procured although it grated somewhat against my feelings to be sent over to the ladies side of the shop to get them as they were not kept for boys on the mens side as it was i feared they did not come up to tempests description of thick boots for kicking back in but they were the thickest i could procure at length my preparations were all complete my mother had been an angel about them all she had let me have my own way and forborne criticism when my tasteor rather my conjecture as to what the low heath form might demandran counter to hers on this account she made no remark about my check shirts or the steel chain which after the most approved fashion came out from under the side of my waistcoat and supported the weight of my keys in my side trouser pocket i confess it was an inconvenient arrangement it was impossible to unlock my portmanteau without either half undressing or kneeling down so as to bring the end of the chain on a level with the keyhole or else standing the portmanteau on a chair or table to bring it up to the key but it was undoubtedly the smart way of carrying keys so the tailor said and so one or two friends in whom i confided also assured me i was really quite glad when i had sat down on the floor beside my trunk for the last time and knew i should not have to perform with the key again till i was unpacking at low heath my handbag for certain reasons i carried with me unlocked it contained to tell the truth the hat and gloves and tan boots and other articles de rigueur which i did not exactly like to start off in but which i was resolved to don during the journey so as to dawn on the low heath horizon altogether up to cocker as tempest would say at the last moment my spirits failed me a little i had been so taken up with my own plans that i had almost forgotten i was leaving my mother solitary and turning my back on the sunshine of affection which during the last year had come to be such a natural and soothing feature of my surroundings dont forget the old home tommy she said god bless you and keep you good and innocent and honest dont be led astray by bad companions but try to help others to be good and tommy dear dont try to be a man just yetbe the dear boy you aredont try to be anything else and but here the train began to move and there was barely time for a farewell kiss what she said ran rather in my head especially the last exhortation which i was sorry she had uttered for i was quite sure she was referring to my nervous desire to do everything correctly at the new school and it grieved me that she should speak of it as trying to be something i was not of course i would remember all she said there was not much fear of my being led astray it was much more likely that i as an exhibitioner would be looked up to by some of the ordinary small boys to show them a lead what with tempest to befriend me at headquarters and my prestige as a scholar and the fact that i knew a pretty good deal about school already it was as likely as not i might be instrumental in helping one or two lame dogs over the stiles of their first term my only travelling companion was a motherly sort of person of the farmer class who eyed me affectionatelytoo affectionately to please meand attempted to condole with me on the sorrow of leaving home never mind dearie said shecheek for a stranger to call a chap dearie youll be a bit lonely at first so you will but youll get used to it and it wont be so long to holiday time and then youll see mamma again i wished she wouldnt she misunderstood me i wasnt thinking about the holidays at all the fact was i was thinking about my boots and hat in the bag and wondering when i should put them on bother it why should i mind her or her remarks some other new chap might get in at the next station and i couldnt change before him id better get myself up to form now and so be ready so to the old ladys surprise i proceeded to take off my shoes and put on the thick tan boots in their place she watched me in mingled admiration and surpriseno doubt the fresh yellow was very imposing and made me look as if i was shod in gold but the high street at low heath would presently be sparkling with a hundred pairs of such boots so what mattered an old ladys temporary astonishment it was the same about the hatindeed worse for at the sight of that particularly sporting adornment she threw up her hands and exclaimed what a funny little fellow to be sure i tried to look grave and as if i had not heard her but i felt very conscious of the hat all the same and only hoped another new boy would get in presently so that she might see that a thing might be the fashion and yet she not know it i was a good deal perplexed about the lavender gloves of course i had not to wear these until callover that afternoon or possibly next morning but i might as well try them on now and the difficulty was that it was very difficult to button the six buttons all the way up without baring my arm halfway at least to the elbow i made a feeble attempt but it presented so many difficulties and evidently so seriously perturbed my companion that i abandoned the attempt resolving to try them on under the bedclothes that night at the first station a youth of about my own age with a hatbox and bag got into the carriage was he i wondered a low heath chap evidently not he wore a straw hat and boots of the ordinary colour andwhew what a lucky thing i had not forgotten it he wore his white collar inside the velvet of his greatcoat and so should i have continued to do had not the sight of him called tempests injunction to wear it outside to my memory i availed myself of the next tunnel to rectify this serious omission and had the satisfaction when we emerged into daylight of noticing that neither of my fellowtravellers appeared to pay much heed to the change they both stared at me now and then but the boy evidently grew tired of that and curled himself up in a corner of the carriage and read a boys own paper i presently followed his example and what with reading and speculating on my coming entry into low heath and an occasional thought for the little home at fallowfield the time went quickly by is this low heath station inquired i as the train began to slacken speed yes said the boy regarding me from head to foot with evidently increased curiosity are you a new kid at the school yes said i oh my what a lark said he i was glad he thought it so are you at the school inquired i looks like it said he getting together his traps hurriedly and bounding from the carriage with what i fancied was a broad grin on his face so here i was at last chapter seven coming down a peg or two i had half hoped tempest would be down at the station to meet me but he was not and i had to consider on the spur of the moment how to make my entry into low heath either i might walk as i noticed a good many of the fellows who got out of the train did or i might charter a private fly as a few of the swells did or i might go up in one of the school omnibuses which was evidently the popular mood of transportation i was so earnestly desirous to do the correct thing that i was nearly doing nothing at all and finally found myself standing almost alone on the platform with the last omnibus ready to start surely they might make some arrangement thought i for meeting exhibitioners and taking them up how did i know this omnibus was not a townboys vehicle or one dedicated to the service of the inferior boys perhaps it would be better right away jimmy off you go called one of the youths on the knifeboard whom i recognised as my late travelling companion at this point i decided i would risk it and go up by omnibus after all wait i called im coming too fire away jimmy cut along shouted the youth they could not have heard me surely the omnibus was actually moving hi called i beginning to follow bag in hand wait for me lamm it on jimmy was the delighted cry from the knifeboard as a score of heads craned over to witness the chase the spectacle of an ordinary youth giving chase to an omnibus crowded with roystering schoolboys is probably amusing enough but when that youth has his white collar outside the collar of his greatcoat and wears brilliant tan boots and a flattopped billycock it appears at least so it seemed to me to be exceedingly funny for the people on the omnibus put it on called one or two encouragingly youre gaining forge ahead jimmy here comes the bogey man cried another whip behind suggested a third anybody got a copper for the poor beggar asked a fourth by a desperate effort at last i succeeded in coming up with the runaway omnibus when to my disgust i discovered that it was one of those forbidding vehicles of which the step disappears when the door is closed so that i had nothing to hold on to still less to climb on to and to continue to run with my nose at the door like a welltrained carriage dog suited neither my wind nor my dignity so i gave up the chase and dropped behind covered with dust and perspiration amid frantic cheers from the knifeboard and broad grins from the passengers on the pavement in such manner i an exhibitioner and a living exponent of the latest form entered low heath i was almost more grieved for the school than for myself those fellows on the omnibus evidently didnt know who i was tomorrow when they found out and saw me arminarm with tempest they would be sorry for what they had done i confess that as i walked up the steep street and caught sight at last of the chimneys of the school peeping up over the trees i half wished myself back at home with my mother i hadnt expected to feel so lonely i had indeed looked forward to a little pardonable triumph in being recognised at once as the fellow who had taken the entrance exhibition and who evidently knew what was what of course it was foolish i told myself to expect such a thing fellows could hardly be expected to know who i was until they were told still it was a littlejust a littledisappointing and i could not help feeling hurt i tramped on till presently i came to the bridge and loitered for a moment to rest and watch the boats flitting about below there went a four smartly manned by youngsters no older than myself there lolled a big fellow in a canoe there swished by a senior in a skiff calling on the fouroar to get out of the way as he passed there too stood a master in flannels with the oxford blue on his straw talking to a group of boys i wish i could have overheard what they were saying perhaps they were discussing the merits of some of the new boys i strolled on passing on the way inquisitive stragglers who stared hard at me till i came to where the road skirts the cricket field here at a broken paling i stood a moment and glanced in fellows were bowling and batting at the nets others were strolling arminarm up and down hailing new arrivals others were enjoying a little horseplay others were critically examining the last seasons pitch others impatient of the seasons were punting about a brandnew football how out of it i was and yet how sure i felt that if some of those fellows only guessed who was on the other side of the palings they would feel interested i strolled on farther and began now to pass the outbuildings there was a lecture room empty at present should i be there tomorrow i wondered answering to my name and seeing fellows open their eyes as they heard it there was the gymnasium i supposedthe place presided over by the drill master whom tempest so much detested i meant to back tempest up in that feud ah there was the lion gate standing open to receive me little i had expected when once before i entered it on my way to examination that i should so soon be coming back so to speak in triumph like this it took some little selfpersuasion i must confess to feel that it really was a triumph i did think tempest might have been on the look out for me i did not know where to go or of whom to inquire my way the boys i met either took no notice of me at all or else stared so rudely at my hat and boots that i could not bring myself to accost them at length i was beginning to think i had better march boldly to the first masters house i came to when as luck would have it i stumbled up against my old travelling companion who having safely arrived a quarter of an hour before was now prowling about on the lookout for old acquaintances please said i would you mind telling me the way to mr sharpes house are you a sharper then he inquired my word what are we coming to why didnt you come up by the bus i tried to said i you wouldnt stop jims horses were a bit shy said he with a grin they cant be held in when they see a moke you should have got in quietly without their spotting you i didnt like this fellow he appeared to me to think he was funny when he was not do you know if tempest has come said i hoping to impress him a little who tempestharry tempest hes at sharpes too what sort of looking chap is he demanded the youth who i suspected could have told me without any detailed description hes one of the seniors said i he was in the reserve for the eleven last term oh that lout i hope you arent a pal of his that would about finish you up if you want him youd better go and look for him i dont know whether every snob in the place has come up or not and he departed in chase of a friend whom he had just sighted this was depressing not that i believed what he said about tempest but i had hoped that my acquaintance with my old schoolmate would redound to my own dignity whereas it seemed to do nothing of the kind presently i encountered a very small boy of chirpy aspect whom i thought i might safely accost i say said i which is mr sharpes house over there said he pointing to an ivycovered house at some little distance higher up the street then regarding me attentively he added i say youll get in a jolly row if he sees you in that getup oh said i feeling that the youngster was entitled to an explanation im an exhibitioner a who all i know is hes down on chaps playing the fool youd better cut in on the quiet before they bowl you out in that thing said he pointing to my hat that thing true i had not observed many hats like it so far at low heath but that was probably because i had not encountered any other fellowexhibitioner tempest knew more about the form than this kid thanks said i mr sharpe will know who i am oh all right said he dont say i didnt tell you thats all i say said i feeling that enough had been said on a matter on which we evidently misunderstood each other do you know tempest rather hes in our house youll get it pretty hot from him if you cheek him oh i know him well hes an old chum the boy laughed incredulously hed thank you if he heard you say so oh my fancy tempest hullo i say there he is cut away kid before he sees you and the youth set me a prompt example i was sorry he had not remained to witness the fact that i was not quite the outsider he took me for tempest was strolling across the road arminarm with a friend he certainly was not got up in the form which he had prescribed for me he wore a straw hat on the back of his head and boots of unmistakable blackness but then though an exhibitioner himself once he had now attained to the dignity of a senior and was probably exempt from the laws binding on new boys as he approached i crossed the road to meet him full of joy at the prospect of encountering at least one friend and marching under his protection into my new quarters but i was doomed to a slight disappointment for though for a moment when he looked up i fancied he recognised me he did not discontinue his conversation with his friend but drew him out into the middle of the road they seemed to be enjoying a joke between them his companion looked round once or twice at me but tempest who was looking quite flushed apparently did not take me in and walked on looking the other way it was a little shock to me or would have been had i not remembered his friendly warning about the etiquette of a junior not accosting a senior till the senior accosted him i wished he had spoken to me for just then his help would have been particularly patronising as it was i was tantalised by seeing him pass by close to me and yet being unable without shirking form in a reprehensible way to bring myself to his notice in due time i reached mr sharpes house to my dismay the door stood wide open and the hall was crowded with fellows claiming their luggage as it was being deposited by the railway van as i arrived there was an ominous silence in the midst of which i stood on the step and carefully rung the bell marked not servants but visitors no one came so after a due interval and amid the smiles of the onlookers i mustered up resolution to ring again rather louder this time i had not to wait long a person dressed as a sort of butler very red in the face emerged from a green baize door at the end of the passage and advanced wrathfully which of you young gents keeps ringing the bell demanded he hes to be made an example of this time oh it was you was it said he catching sight of me yes said i is mr sharpe at home at home demanded the official redder in the face than ever you seem to be pretty much at home then apparently struck by my appearance he pulled himself up and honoured me with a long stare in which all the assembled boys joined who is it one of the porters from the station i should say from the looks of him suggested a boy whoever it is dont you ring that visitors belldo you hear said the manservant if you want anything go round to the side door and dont interfere with the young gentlemen but im a new boy said i imim an exhibitioner at which there was a great roar of laughter which even my selfsatisfaction could hardly construe into jubilation i began to have a horrible suspicion that i had committed some great faux pas by ringing the visitors bell and blushed consciously to the increased amusement of my fellow sharpers can i see mr sharpe i inquired thinking it best to take the bull by the horns cant you wait said the servant do you suppose the master has nothing to do but run out and seewild indians here followed another laugh at my expense hell see you quite soon enough here a shove from behind precipitated me into the bosom of the speaker who returned me with thanks and before i could apologise into the hands of the sender thence i found myself passed on by a side impetus to a knot of juveniles who not requiring my presence passed me on to a senior standing by who shot me back to a friend who sent me forward among the boxes into the arms of the matron who indignantly hustled me up the passage where finally i pulled up short in the grasp of a gentleman who at that moment emerged from the green baize door in the confusion i had lost both my hat and my presence of mind i was far too confused to observe who the newcomer was and far too indignant to care all that i called to my mind as i reeled into his clutches was tempests directions about kicking back which accordingly i proceeded to do with all the vigour of which my new tan boots were capable mr sharpe suffered this assault meekly for a second or two then he held me out stiffly at arms length like a puppy in a fit and demanded what do you mean sir by behaving like this i was bound to admit that it was a natural inquiry from a person whose shins had been considerably barked by my new boots i felt as if i owed mr sharpe an apology please said i i didnt mean to do it the boys shoved me and i didnt know where i was going really sir mr sharpe seemed inclined to believe me he was a floridlooking spectacled young man with sandy whiskers and a gripoh that grip that could have lifted me easily over the lion gate boys said he let us have none of this nonsense or i must set a house theme is mrs smiley here mrs smiley looking anything but the moral of her name appeared in due course mrs smiley will you please take charge of this new boy and keep him out of trouble run away with mrs smiley my little man and you boys as soon as you have claimed your boxes clear out till register bell what i did my ears deceive me was i an exhibitioner a scholar who had come up to low heath in all the eclat of the latest form the friend of tempest the fellow who had made things too hot for himself at dangerfieldwas i i say to be handed over to a sort of washerwomanly person to be kept out of mischief and called my little man in the presence of the whole house was this my triumphant entry then no sooner had mr sharpe retired than greetings of my little man spiteful sarah run along with his smiley then beset me on all sides i would fain have explained and corrected any wrong impression but they only laughed when i tried finally when mrs smiley grabbed at my hand and walked me off the scene like a baby my humiliation was complete mrs smiley who was far too busy with the young gentlemens luggage to relish the extra duty put upon her by mr sharpe had a very summary way of dealing with cases of my kind sit down there and dont move till youre told said she pointing to a little threelegged stool in a corner in the boxroom but began i hold your tongue how dare you speak to me she retorted i only stand in the corner with your hands behind you for disobedience said she this was getting serious the little threelegged stool would not have been exactly luxurious but to be stood in the corner with my hands behind me by a person of the feminine gender called smiley was really too bad the worst of it was that if i made any further protest i might be smacked in addition and that possibility i hardly dared risk so rather to my own surprise i found myself standing in the corner with my hands at my back scrutinising a blue and pink rose on the wall paper and wondering whether it would not be worth my while to write to the times about the whole business i could not help thinking that mrs smiley did not hurry herself on my account i was conscious of box after box being dragged to the front emptied of its contents and put back to be removed presently by a porter who probably looked at me every time he came in but i am bound to say received very little encouragement from my studiously averted head after nearly an hour i began to get tired and the blood of the joneses began to rise within me i was seriously meditating mutiny or at least a definite explanation with mrs smiley when at last she broke silence now young gentleman this way please and she led me to a small comfortablelooking apartment which i surmised to be her particular sanctum whats your name jones said i ahyoure the boy whos brought down a rubbishy speckled waistcoat and loud striped shirtseh well yes said i did your mother buy them for you or did you buy them i did i can see your mothers a lady by the way she has everything else done youll find your own trash just where you put it in the bottom of your trunk you will not be allowed to wear it we expect our boys to dress like young gentlemen whether they are such or not whats that in your hand jones my hat said i hoping i was coming in for a little credit at last hat here she was rude enough to laugh what made you bring a thing like that here for a hat but said i im an exhibitioner all the more shame on you not dressing like a gentleman look at those boots i am sure your mother did not buy them for you take them off at once sirand put on your proper ones arent theyisnt it the thing the form you know for form fiddlesticks the thing at low heath is to behave and dress like gentlemen not like vulgar publichouse potmen said she with an access of indignation which surprised me to think that you with a nice mother like yours should come up here a fright like that there put the shoes and hat in the trunk with the speckled waistcoat and shirts and get yourself up decently and then ill speak to you i was under the impression she had spoken to mepretty strongly too this then was the end of my elaborately prepared toilet a horrid suspicion began to come over me at last not only that tempest had been having a little joke at my expense but that i had lent myself to it with an alacrity and eagerness which had almostnay very nearly whollybeen ridiculous what does the reader think my further conversation with good mrs smiley after i had to use her own expression made myself decent only tended to confirm the painful impression i even went to the length of adding of my own accord my sixbutton lavender gloves to the pile of sacrificed finery which strewed the bottom of my trunk and when in due time a bell rang and mrs smiley said there now go down to callover and dont be a silly any more i obeyed with a meekness and diffidence of which i could hardly have believed myself capable had i not been quite sure of the fact chapter eight tempest talks to me like a father as i entered the hall in which were already assembled most of my fellow sharpers the first idea which occurred to me was that low heath was not such a big place after all i had expected to encounter the whole school instead of some fifty boys of my own particular house and it was a relief to me to find that for the present at any rate i was to blush before only a limited company the next thing that struck me was that these fellows evinced wonderfully little interest in my appearance which considering the active interest they had shown in me not long since was quite a shock i had made up my mind to be howled at and laughed out of countenance instead of which they contented themselves with a halfglance to see who the new comer was and then went on talking together as if nothing had happened the conceit was already sufficiently knocked out of me to enable me to take this indifference in good part possibly when my name was called reference would be made to my exhibition which would make a few of them look twice at me but for the present i was glad to be left alone at first i could distinguish nobody but in a little i caught sight of tempests head among the seniors of the house he did not see me nor did he appear to be looking out for me suddenly some one called seats an order that was so promptly obeyed that it left me standing alone near the door at which i had entered seatscant you hear said some one near me i made promptly for the first empty desk i could see the youth at the end of the row had his back partly turned and it was necessary to push vigorously past him to arrive at my destination look out you mule said he you trod on my hullo sarah how are you and a friendly kick on the shins helped me wonderfully on my way it was my old acquaintance of the railway carriage and next to him was the small youth who had been so terribly concerned about my costume in the morning he put his feet up on the desk in front and gave me the option of climbing over or crawling under he was about threequarters my size but he had such an air of authority about him that i hardly liked to suggest a third alternative namely that he should put down his feet and let me pass so i climbed over much to his indignation which he expressed by sticking a nib into me as i passed i say he began youll catch it thats not your desk i was aware of that and devoutly hoped the real owner would not arrive on the scene if tinker kotches you hullo what have you done with your patent boots ive changed them said i but do you think tinkers coming well keep him out if he does just then one of the seniors on the front form who had been talking to tempest leant back and said in a loud whisper to the boy at the end of the form in front of ours white see all the new kids have their gloves on properly gloves i felt my teeth begin to chatter in my head had i not flung my gloves along with my hat and boots into my trunk thinking they would not be needed i had considered them as part of tempests little joke but evidently i had made a fearful mistake for the senior who had given the admonition was not tempest at all but his next neighbour and the fact that it was not given to me but to a monitor made it clear that however i had been humbugged over the other details of form gloves were the order of the day for new boys at first callover in a panic i rose and tried to go out with the wild idea of rescuing my gloves from my trunk but it was impossible to escape not only had my companion his feet up more uncompromisingly than ever but my sudden movement called down upon me general remarks shut up i sit down cant you said my neighbour what are you up to my glovesiveive left them upstairs your what gloves i thought it was a mistake about new boys having to wear them and didnt bring them the boy looked grave oh youll catch it you cant go now theres sharpe coming in havent you got any at all only my ordinary gloves what colour yellow stick them on then but theyve only two buttons cant be helped youre bound to catch it but theyre better than nothing so in dire agitation i drew on my new dogskin gloves the smiles of the boys near me i interpreted as a grim recognition that i had shirked form and did not know any better i longed to explain that i did and that i had not come to low heath as ignorant as they supposed but it was impossible mr sharpe was already in his place and register had begun register a ceremony with which i was destined to become painfully familiar in time consisted in the calling over of the names of all the boys in the house in order of place by the minor prefect who took his stand at the side of the masters desk for the purpose instead of answering here or adsum in the usual way the boy whose name was called stood in his place and held up his hand i had been so preoccupied with the lack of my sixbutton lavender gloves and the remarks of my two lefthand neighbours that i had failed altogether to observe the boy on my right who now quietly nudged me and presented to my astonished gaze the serene and serious countenance of dicky brown what have you got your gloves on for inquired he as if he had seen me daily since we parted its the form havent you got any i say youll get in a jolly row said i quite delighted to be able to lord it a little over an inferior whywho told you tempest tempests a regular humbug he tried to stuff me up by making me bring a cheesecutter cap but i wasnt such a fool as i look alas it was my turn to colour up had dicky i wondered seen my square billycock at that moment tempests name was called and we saw our old dux rise complacently in his seat and hold up his hand it was difficult to feel angry with him he looked so cool and determined his shoulders were so square and the year that had elapsed since we met had added three good inches to his stature it was a feather in a fellows cap to know tempest even if he did have his little joke at ones expense now and then i came to the conclusion that dicky and i must be the only two new boys in the house for none of the numerous hands grimy and otherwise which went up were cased in anything but their native skin presently the register clerk came to an end of his list and i was beginning to congratulate both myself and brown on our probable escape from detection when mr sharpe said new boys come forward my lefthand neighbour interposed no obstruction now as followed by dicky i sidled out of my place and advanced along with five other youths to the front i was conscious of smiles as i went past the desks some of recognition of the late owner of the tan boots some of appreciation of my blushes and others as i supposed of the greenness which had led all my companions to commit the fatal error of not appearing in gloves and of my error though in a smaller degree of appearing in bright yellow twobutton goods instead of lavender of the regulation halfdozen i exchanged glances with tempest among others who looked very serious and was evidently chagrined that after all his kind trouble on my behalf i should now land myself in this dilemma good old tempest it wasnt his fault answer to your began mr sharpe when suddenly catching sight of me he said why sir what nonsense is this what do you mean by wearing those gloves i beg your pardon sir i faltered and felt that not a word of my speech was being lost by the assembled house ive left my lavender sixbutton gloves in my trunk mr sharpes mouth curled at the corner in a curious way and a general titter greeted my explanation from the benches behind i was fully convinced now that after all my care the very solecism i had planned so carefully to avoid had tripped me up at last take them off at once sir and let me have no more of this foolishness you are making a bad start were you not the boy i had to speak to in the hall this afternoon yes sir i am sorry i kicked your shins i hope i didnt hurt much i thought you were one of the boys i am sure i meant no harm by it but he seemed to regard this as a studied insult and visited me with his wrath not only for it but for the smiles from the boys behind which accompanied it what is this boys name he inquired severely looking round i wondered who would answer the question it was evidently not intended for me it astonished me that mr sharpe should not apply at headquarters i am sure i could have told him i think said a voice which i recognised as tempests his name is jones sir think surely tempest might have had a little more confidence than that perhaps you will see what you can make of him presently tempest if he has any intelligence at all nice wasnt it for an exhibitioner you may be able to make him understand some of the rules of the place if not i am afraid we shall have to put him down as a silly little boy and bear with him accordingly go to your seat now sir and report yourself to tempest after register it was not a very dignified end to the interview still i felt myself lucky to be handed over to the tender mercies of my old comrade and retired to my place a puzzled but not an amused boy what perplexed me most was to notice that brown and the other new boys who had no gloves at all and did nothing but answer the questions put to them in the plainest possible way not only passed muster but received words of approval and encouragement from the master such as i would have given a great deal to have got myself but such is life the fellows who take the most pains and deserve most get least and the fellows who have least to boast of receive more than they expect i was glad when register was over and the time came for me to have an explanation with tempest look here said the candid youth next to me youd better sit up when you go to tempest i can let you know hes cock of our house this term and hes not overtender with idiots i can let you know what has he been down on you i inquired meekly the only reply i got was a touch on the calf which made me exclaim oh rather more loudly than i should have chosen to do under ordinary circumstances luckily the general movement of the class somewhat deadened the sound and if mr sharpe heard me he did not consider it worth his while to deprive tempest of the task of elucidating the reason of it i kept my man carefully in view and followed him upstairs into a little study about the size of a commodious sentry box with a window book case sofa table chairs and all the requirements of a single man of few needs it seemed to me a delightful little sanctum and for a moment i began to wonder whether being an exhibitioner i might not be entitled to one like it for myselfperhaps this was mine tempest soon disabused me of that notion light the fire and stick on my kettle kid said hethey were the first words after more than a yearand cut and get us a muffin from the shop i say said i longing for rather more cordial a recognition i am jolly glad to see you again tempest just then another senior popped his head in have tea with me tempest come on wales is coming too is crofter coming no all right im on thanks pridgin blow that fire out kid is that kid your fag not likely is he all there sharpe seemed to doubt it tempest shrugged his shoulders how soon ten minutes yesnot longer now kid said tempest when we were left alone how long are you going to play the fool take your time but let us know when youve done thats all really im not fooling i know i ought to have had on the lavender tempest laughed a jolly laugh it was though it frequently preceded a licking you mean to say you sucked in all that rot i thought id just see how far youd let yourself be humbugged im sorry i didnt tell you to stand on your head i dont doubt youd have done it i had painful reason to think he might be right why even dicky brown was too old a bird for that sort of chaff said tempest he twigged it at onceand hes a day boy hand me that cane out of the cricket box theres a good fellow and hold out your hand dont yell only muffs do that what i exclaimed am i to be licked dux dont call me dux here yes ratherthree on each hand but mr sharpe only said sharpewhats he got to do with it come on look alive or i shall be late for tea i could barely be angry with him he didnt seem to be able to see the matter from my point of view at all and was so genuinely friendly with it all the third will be a hot one said he as i held out my hand but i dont want to break the caneits a good one the third was a hot one hurt you much said tempest carefully examining his weapon middling said i now the other hand i suppose youve not got to know many chaps yet did you get any cricket in the vac no said i extending my left in a deprecating way we did said he we were jolly near licking ow feel that much good cane isnt it now the other two will be easy to do him justice they were or would have been had they not fallen uncomfortably near the site of the first stick the cane back said heand look here he added in the old friendly way which always captivated me if youll take any advice youll drop playing the fool it may be funny but it doesnt pay fellows get bored by it but i really i know you cant help it your best dodge is to lie low for a bit and keep out of everybodys way i never meant of course you didnt you cant help being an ass but dont swagger or brag about it go easyand by the way whatever you do forget youre an exhibitioner its not your fault i know but its a sort of thing to be lived down up here be nobody thats the rule then youll worry through but you were an exhibitioner tempest i suggested werent you yes but i kept it dark do you know the chap who asked me to tea no hes pridginin the elevenmakes beastly bad jokes but not a bad chap youll like fagging for him whatam i to fag said i undergoing another shock i had made quite sure exhibitioners were exempt from that indignity there you go again what did i tell you said tempest in tones of mild menace youre putting it on again already youd better fish out that cane again theres a good chap oh please donti didnt mean tempest all right ill fag for him tempest regarded first me then the cricket box where the cane lay doubtfully i tell you hes not half a bad chap bother it added he picking up the cane i must do it kid awfully sorry but it would be low to let you off because i know you look alive one middling warm on each hand thats all thanks he was quite unnecessarily grateful his idea of middling warm i could not help thinking was not very different from hot and yet i felt i could stand it better from him than from most some chaps said he after returning me the cane to put back in its place would say that this sort of thing pained them more than it does you it didnt me i fancy you felt it more than i did anyhow youll remember what i said wont you pridgins not half a bad chap if you want any one to fag for you tempest i began oh ive got onea beautyyoung trimble he sat next to you at register today youll hit it off with him to a t talking of tea by the way its time we showed up at pridgins come along and ill introduce you the reader may not believe it but my interview with tempest helped to knock the nonsense out of me more than any treatment i had yet undergone it was not so much the caning which by the way i afterwards discovered to be a wholly unauthorised proceeding on my old comrades part but his plain advice and the friendly way in which it was all given it made me realise that he really meant to stick by me and pull me through my troubles and the sense of his interest in me made up wonderfully for the loneliness which had been growing on me ever since i entered low heath that morning pridgin as became a member of the eleven received me with dignity quite devoid of curiosity he informed tempest that he considered it was playing it pretty low down on him to let an idiot like me loose on him still times were bad and one must put up with what one could get whereat i had the good sense to grin appreciatively and was thereupon permitted to boil my new masters eggs and stand by the kettle until it was ready for the tea chapter nine acquaintances high and low i was at first too much concerned in my important culinary occupations to bestow much attention on the company it was only when the eggs were boiled and the teapot filled that i had leisure to make a few observations the host pridgin my new master was not a very formidable sort of person at first blush true he was in the eleven and a fine allround athlete true he was fairly well up in the sixth and one of the boys low heath was proud of these things did not strike one in beholding him what did strike one was his air of lazy humour which seemed to regard life as a huge joke if only one could summon up the energy to enjoy it pridgin did indeed enjoy his share of it but one could not help feeling that were he to choose that share would be a great deal larger than it really was it was plain to see he was fond of tempest a weakness which reconciled me to him from the first tempest however seemed if anything to prefer the third member of the party present who was in every way a contrast to his genial host wales struck one as a far more imposing person than pridgin but not quite as attractive he was dressed in what seemed to me the top of the fashion and had the appearance of a youth who made a point of having everything of the best he had the reputation as i discovered afterwards of possessing the most expensive bats and racquets the bestbound books the bestfitting clothes of any one in low heath it was also rumoured that he spent more than any boy in the town shops and gave the most extravagant entertainments in his study fellows were a little shy of him for this very reason he forced the pace in the matter of money and there were only a few fellows who could stand it tempest was not one of these and yet he seemed very thick with wales it was certainly not for the sake of his money for tempest was one of those fellows who never care for a fellow for the same reason that any one else would he had begun by being amused with waless dandyism and extravagance and had ended in encouraging him in them i expect said wales as the three heroes sat discussing their tea were in for a pretty lively term if its true what i hear that redwood is to be captain why shouldnt he be asked pridgin hes a hot man in the fields as well as in classics my dear fellow hes a townboy what of that what of that first of all the townboys are most of them snobs sons of hardup people who come to live at low heath so as to get them into the school cheap then they cant possibly keep up with what goes on in school when they are away every evening theres more in the second objection than the first said tempest i dont see why a fellow should be out of it because hes poor if so i can cut my lucky here but it does seem a swindle to stick a townboy over all of us i dont see it said pridgin hes one of us the only difference is he goes home to sleep instead of tucking up in a cubicle here no what seems to me the cool thing is this talk of a townboys club that brags its going to lick the school clubs into fits i hope its not true for if it is we shall have to sit up and i loathe sitting up his guests laughed it was notorious that pridgin when he did bring himself to sit up was a person worth reckoning with for the matter of that said wales redwoods not likely to trouble himself much hell take all the glory and do none of the work the captain of low heath ought to have his hand in everything and not let everything slide youll find redwood can be awkward enough when he chooses you can never tell how far hell let things go on but when his back once gets up hell stiffen pretty hard all i can say is said tempest if im to be cock of this house this termand ive no right to be yes you have old chap said pridgin you know you purposely ran for second place last term so as to get out of the fag of cocking the house retorted his friend anyhow if i am to be cock i mean to stand up for our rights and see were not done out of them by townboys of all people hear hear said pridgin stick up for your rights i dont exactly know what rights were got more than any other low heathens but stick up for them certainly nothing like having a grievance if you can only find one what do you say to jarman for one said wales the faces of all three clouded at the mention of this name ah id forgotten about that is it true hes to be a sort of general discipline master and have the right of pulling up any fellow senior or junior without even saying a word to his house prefects he wont do it here if i can help said tempest with a frown well have some more tea said pridgin before you begin operations here kid make a fresh brew sharp and then cut what i had heard had been quite enough to satisfy me that things were not running altogether smoothly at low heath and that tempest was not beginning his new duties as head of his house in the best of tempers i confess i felt a little uneasy for i knew my old chiefs impulsive generous nature well enough to be sure that he might easily get himself into trouble for the sake of other people his friends were evidently glad enough to let him fight their battles but were not likely at least so it seemed to me to take much trouble to help him through with them i was wandering rather disconsolately down the passage when it occurred to me i did not know what i was expected to do or where i was expected to go i therefore ventured to accost a senior who was lounging about at the head of the stairs if you please said i im a new boycan you tell me where to go the senior a bland goodlooking sort of youth surveyed me carefully and replied to bed i should say all right thanks said i which way is that he laughed pleasantly whats your name thomas jones you neednt mind about the thomas up here where have you come from do you mean where do i live or where have i been just now i inquired anxious to avoid any misunderstanding look here said he hadnt you better take a seat if you want to tell me all your family history im sure its very interesting but its rather late in the day to begin now where have you come from not originally but just now i flushed up very much at this polite rebuke whatever made every one so anxious to assume that i was an ass pridgins said i im his fag and hes having a tea party oh said the youth whos there only tempest and wales i replied feeling more at my ease no one else no i answered then guessing he might have the same antipathies as tempest i volunteered crofters not asked my companion opened his eyes indeedwhy i dont know only i know tempest wouldnt have gone if he had been please which way do i go what objection has tempest to crofter i dont knowi suppose hes a beast tempest hates beasts the boy laughed he must be very fond of you said he yes said i were old chums we were at dangerfield together and both got ex there i was after tempests warning about keeping my exhibition dark both got what expelled inquired the senior with interest wellyes said i thinking that the best way of getting out of it it was this way really jones its getting late said the senior ive no doubt its an interesting story there go and inquire in the fourth room on the left theyll show you the way to bed and he departed i was very sorry he had not given me time to explain the little matter at dangerfield it would be a pity for any one to get a wrong impression about it still what a lucky escape i had had from blabbing about my exhibition the fellow too seemed a nice sort of chap and disposed to be friendly so there was no harm done after all i could tell long before i reached it that the room which had been indicated to me as the place where i might get the information for which i thirsted was to say the least inhabitedfor the noise which penetrated through the keyhole and the cracks of the door was appalling either thought i a free fight is going on within or there is a steam engine at work or the builders are shooting bricks through the window i was mistaken it was only five boys of about my age talking the silence which greeted my appearance was rather more formidable than the noise which had preceded it in the midst of it however i observed the form of master trimble also that of my travelling companion of the morning and concluded therefore that i had come to the right place for information full up cut was the cordial greeting of the company generally hullo its sarah cried my travelling companion what a lark collar him you chaps thats the idiot i was telling about he came down in the train with his ma she wasnt said i she was no relation a loud laugh greeted this disclaimer well his nurse or aunt or washerwoman or something no she wasnt shut up and dont tell crams its you who are telling crams said i for the blood of the joneses was getting up look here do you mean to call me a crammer demanded the speaker looking very imposing if you say it again i will said i i tell you that woman had no more to do with me than you there it was a critical situation and the key to it was in my accusers hands if he insisted that the lady in question had anything to do with me i was committed to call him a crammer and if i called him a crammer he was equally committed by all tradition to punch my head and in the humour i was then in he was not likely to do that without getting one back for himself i know who it was suddenly cried trimble of course tempest told me last term there was a young ass coming up whod been at a girls school and had got an exhibition or something of course this was his old school dame good old sarah at this terrific exposure the spirit leaked out of me my telltale blushes confirmed what was true in the story and my silence lent countenance to what was untrue the delight of my tormentors was beyond words they danced the mulberry bush round me overwhelmed me with endearing expressions offered me fans and smelling salts and cushions and hairpins simulated hysterics and spasms trod on my skirts and conversed to me in shrill treble till i was sick of the business only one course was open to me it was an unpleasant one but on it depended i felt my future welfare at low heath i seized the nearest who happened to be master trimble and pulling him gently but firmly by the nose demanded if girls generally treated him that way he kicked vigorously and ordered me to release the imprisoned member i declined to do so until i had kicked back and finally deposited him on the floor amidst the laughter of his perfidious comrades who told him it served him right and that sarah was evidently one too many for him this little protest stood me in good stead it put an end to all direct aspersions on my sex although it was a long while before i was destined to hear the last of delicate insinuations on the topic and it advanced me very considerably in favour with the four whose noses i had not been fortunate enough to engage look here stop fooling you chaps said one of them when in due time master trimble was permitted to regain his feet this new kid had better make up our sixth man here no other faggery would be likely to take him so we may as well i concluded from this remark that the juniors of mr sharpes house were permitted to herd together in half dozens and on the whole i was disposed rather to bear the ills i had than fly to others i knew not of i dont mind said i if you let me be who wants to touch you with a pair of tongs you may as well pull in with us and help us kick the others itll be a change after the girls school i wasnt at a girls school said i i told you all i did was to coach with one of the teachers about the same thing i fancy said trimble blowing his outraged nose somewhat defiantly sarah if you call me sarah again said i hotly ill pull your nose again all right miss jones then no not miss just jones all serene just jones then shut up stick on your lavender gloves and keep your hair on there was a general laugh at this which vastly solaced the aggrieved trimble and encouraged him to refer jocularly to my late hat and boots topics which i had not the spirit to resent as soon as these personal matters were disposed of i was tacitly admitted as a member of the honourable faggery and invited to express my opinion on a matter which had been engaging the attention of the fraternity before i arrived we were thinking said my late travelling companion whom his friends addressed as langrish that it would be a score to get up a philosophical society in the school what do you say what to do i ventured to ask oh discussions and picnics and larks what do you suppose we should do theres a senior club of the kind already they go in for dry rotscience and history and that sort of thing awful slow and nobody knows what hes talking about i flatter myself we should we ought to draw up some rules oughtnt we said trimble ratherforge ahead whereupon we crowded solemnly round the small table and put our heads together one of the party by the way answering to the name of purkis appeared to be the leading spirit and made the most valuable suggestions rule dictated he that this club be called the low heathen conversation club hold on said trimble youve got club coming twice in the same sentence bad grammar besides i thought there was to be something about philosophy suggested langrish and keeping out the day cads said warminster another of the party of course if you make the rule long enough said purkis with lofty contempt you can get something in it about the man in the moon but said i thinking to make a little joke just to show i had no illfeeling we dont want him in the club do we no said langrish who had evidently been on the lookout for his chance no more do we want pretty sarahs washerwoman do we you chaps i subsided gracefully the time was not yet ripe evidently for me to assert myself i tell you what said warminster whats the use of every one making each rule let old purkis make the first and ill make the second and langrish the third and so on it will be ever so much quicker and give each chap a fair innings it seemed a good idea and as it allowed purkiss rule to stand unchallenged he acquiesced so in due time the following wonderful code of rules was drawn up and adopted that this club be called the low heath conversation club purkis that the object of the club be and are periodical picnics and meetings for the discussion of philosophy etcetera warminster there was some debate as to whether the ninth word should be is or are but are as agreeing with the plural was carried by a large majority that each member bring his own grub alias provisions trimble that no day boy be eligible on to the club langrish that any member breaking the rules is hereby expelled coxhead that the subscription be two shillings a term payable in advance jones warminster was anxious for consistencys sake to add the words and are after be but was overruled after which we honourably drew lots for the various posts of emolument and honour in connection with the club to my surprise i was drawn for president at first i was disposed to disclaim the honour on account of my youth and inexperience but my fellowphilosophers assured me that was no excuse and that my name would undoubtedly draw i did not exactly see how but they were probably better judges than i and perhaps as an exhib no i was bound to keep that dark at any rate it would be a nice thing to be able to write home to my mother that on the day of my arrival i had been appointed president of the philosophical conversation club with a right to add the initials plhcc after my name it sounded well and would give me a better footing in low heath than my tan boots langrish was drawn for treasurer and purkis for secretary while to obviate any cause for jealousy trimble was selected as auditor warminster as librarian and coxhead as registrar a levy of subscriptions was made forthwith by the treasurer and the secretary was ordered to expend part of the amount in a handbill setting forth the object and personnel of the society for distribution through the school the auditor undertook to check the printers bill the librarian to keep a copy of the document among the archives of the club and the registrar to prepare a book for entering the names of the new members altogether it was a most businesslike proceeding and one which reflected as it seemed to me great credit on the young life of low heath after this a peremptory summons from the bell dismissed us precipitately to bed i had the indignity of being conducted to my cubicle by mrs smiley who had the bad taste to adjure me in the hearing of my comrades to behave myself like a good boy and go to sleep directly the lights were out this was not altogether easy for my cubicle happened to be between those of trimble and langrish and the partitions were not particularly high i was indeed allowed to undress and say my prayers without interference which was more than i had hoped for but no sooner was i in bed and lights out than i was favoured with all sorts of missiles pitched over the partitions on either side with extraordinary accuracy a book from langrish hit me on the ear and a wet sponge from trimble moistened my cheek and when i sought shelter under the sheets the buttend of a fishingrod in the ribs drew me from my hidingplace and a clever cast with a hooked pin by langrish relieved me of my outer covering altogether the footsteps of the monitor on duty deprived me of the privilege of making an audible protest all i could do was to send trimbles sponge quietly over to langrish and langrishs book across to trimble and as well as i was able recover my abstracted sheet with the aid of the rod it took a long time and laid me open to dire penalties for disturbing the public peace but it had to be done and fortunately for me a row at the other end of the room called the monitor away in the nick of time when he returned all was still and i was dreaming that mr evans was selling a pair of secondhand sixbuttoned lavender gloves to my mother in the hall of mr sharpes house chapter ten special service my introduction to low heath at large next day turned out to be a far less formidable affair than i had anticipated i had long since given up the notion that the whole school would rise at my appearance and salute me i had even ceased to expect that they would all stare and make remarks but i was hardly prepared for the absolute indifference with which i was permitted to answer to my name at great register not a soul took any notice of me even when dr england explained to me publicly that as there were already three other joneses in the school i would please answer in future to the title of jones iv which i humbly promised to do brown i was not sorry to hear was to be designated as brown iii for similar reasons the ceremony being over the new boys were trooped up to the head masters library and there told off to their respective forms with a few words of warning and encouragement it surprised me that in spite of my scholastic honours i was entered in the same form as brown but on the whole i was more pleased than disappointed for i loved my old comrade dearly and after all if he was placed above his merits it wasnt his fault its a pity you arent a day boy said he as he walked across afterwards we could have larks together its a pity you arent in the school said i oh our chaps say its rather stale to be in the school i dont see why your fellows should be looked down on but they are pooh you should hear our chaps talk about the day boys do you know dicky im president of a club a philosophical club and day boys arent eligible im awfully sorry i should have liked to have you in thats just what i thought about the urbans they dont let in any fellow whos in the schoolonly day boystheyre obliged to draw the line somewhere you know do you know redwood the captain is a senior urban i know our chaps say its a soak for the school having a day boy for captain oh we dont think so i say do you see that chap there the youth at whom he pointed was the friendly senior of whom i had inquired the way to bed last night rather hes a sharper why and what about him hes a hot man they say and the most popular chap at low heath hes captain of the rifles whats his name do you know crofts or crofter or something like that whats up he might well ask crofter exclaimed i my word dicky ive been and done it done what why i called him a beast yesterday you did youre getting on jones iv no without humbug i did i didnt know it was crofter and i told him tempest thought he was a beast if tempest says so he probably is remarked the unemotional dicky but whats to become of me how was i to know i dont know perhaps youd better go and tell him you were mistaken i dont like to i say what a downer hell have on me i half wish i was a day boy after all its a pity you arent weve a jolly lot in the urban minors quite a literary lot bother the urban minors said i looking dismally after the retreating form of crofter itll take you all your time to bother some of them theres flitwick hes hang flitwick whatever am i to do dicky i wouldnt advise you to hang flitwick oh about that fellow crofter oh itll be all right hes plenty else to think about it was poor comfort but the best i could get and our arrival at our class room cut short further discussion on this most unfortunate incident but it weighed on my mind all day when class was over i was summoned by my fellow philosophers to come out into the playing fields i went in fear and trembling lest i should encounter crofter but he was nowhere to be seen my companions were evidently hand and glove with most of the juniors in the school and i was favoured with a bewildering number of introductions not always of the most gratifying kind what have you got there trim a tame monkey asked one gorgeous youth whose cap bore the badge of mr selkirks house not exactly said trimble havent had time to tame him yet whats his name sarah allow me muskettsarah jones jonessilly muskett now you know one another hes only fooling about my name said i its thomas oh is it delighted to see you sarah thomas and before i could put him right he was off and i was led away by my rejoicing comrades look here trimble said i its time you knew my name by now trimble laughed as did the others they all thought it was high time but everybody we met i was introduced to as sarah awfully sorry said langrish after the fourth or fifth offence ive such a bad memory for nameswell kicked sir this exclamation was addressed not to me but to a senior who had just appeared on the scene and was kicking about the practice football with a friend prior to a match which was evidently due it was a splendid kick and the author of it was a splendid fellow brawny of limb and light of foot with fair hair and clear blue eyesas one might picture one of the norsemen of the storybooks you could see by the way he moved and the spirit he put even into this practice kicking that he was a sportsman every inch of him and his goodnatured laugh as he exchanged greetings with this and that arriving friend proclaimed him even before you heard him speak as good a gentleman as he was an athlete redwoods in form today said some one wed better stop and see the play is that redwood the captain inquired i in an awestruck way of warminster rather was the reply in a tone of pride which convinced me that low heath was proud of its chief even though he had the misfortune to be a day boy just then redwood turned and waved his hand to somebody near us look out he wants you said langrish me said i flabbergasted dont you see him beckoning look alive or youll catch it i could hardly believe it and yet everybody near looked round at me in apparent wonder at my delay perhaps redwood had heard something about me from tempest and wanted to go on said trimble giving me a shove if he wants to stick you in the fifteen tell him its not good enough look sharp called the others encouragingly as i started to obey the summons by this time redwood was strolling our way mahomet thought i is coming to the mountain so to save him trouble i trotted up to meet him at first he didnt notice me then when i said did you want me he stared me over from head to foot as a newfoundland dog would inspect a pug it was on the whole a benevolent stare not unmingled with humour especially when the cheers of my late comrades called his attention to my ingenuous blushes i didnt said he but youll do if you dont mind cut home to my house number bridge street and ask them to send my leather belt look alive theres a good chap this speech the first really polite speech i had heard since i entered low heath took me by storm and captivated me at once to the service of the captain of the school i galloped off as proud as a non commissioned officer who has been sent to fetch his regimental flag on to the field of battle the chaps behind might cheer and jeer and cry geeup sarah and mad dog as much as they liked they would have been only too proud to be sent on my errand it was a good ten minutes run to bridge street and i was fairly out of breath when i rang at the bell of number it seemed a long time before any one came and i was beginning to be afraid i should forfeit the reputation i hoped to acquire when hurried footsteps announced that my ring had been heard mrs redwood was out said the servant and she had been down the garden with the children when i delivered my message she asked me to wait and with her little charges evidently on her mind ran upstairs to fetch the belt it was a nice house although a small one the garden door was open and gave a beautiful peep over the little sloping lawn to the river and the woods beyond i was not sure that after all a townboy might not have a good time of it living in a place like this instead of in school suddenly my reflections were disturbed by a shrill scream from the garden followed by a little girl of five or six crying annie annie mamies tumbled in mamies tumbled in for a wonder i had my wits about me and divined the truth at once with a bound i was down the steps and across the lawn half knocking down the panicstricken little messenger on the way and at the rivers edge floundering piteously in about two feet of water found the unfortunate little mamieevidently a twinsistermore frightened than hurt but perilously near to getting into deep water her yells redoubled when she found herself grabbed by the sash by a stranger and lugged most unceremoniously on to terra firma scarcely had i achieved this gallant rescue without even wetting my own shoes when annie as white as a sheet came flying on to the scene its all right said i shes not hurt whereupon annie most inconsiderately leaned up against a post clapped her hands to her heart and went or threatened to go off into hysterics and there was i a poor unprotected male left to face the squalling of two infant female children and a fullgrown female nurserymaid look here said i appealingly mamies soaking wet youd better take her and dry her before she gets her death of cold this appeal had the desired effect it stopped the nurses spasms and let loose her tongue oh dear oh my and i told her not to go through the gate oh you naughty girl you and you miss gwen for letting her do it come in directly you little hussies it struck me as grossly unfair of annie but i did not venture in her present state of mind to protest for fear she should call me hussy too i followed indoors somewhat guiltily at the tail of the procession feeling myself in a very unpleasant situation in which i would not on any account be caught by redwoods mother or by redwood himself to my delight on the floor of the hall where annie had dropped it lay the belt at which i sprang greedily and not waiting to say thank you or put in a word for the doomed infants which would have been quite inaudible in the volume of annies philippics i saved myself as the frenchman says and ran at racing speed with my prize back to the school field to my mortification i found the match had just begun and it would be impossible to deliver my missive till halftime what would the captain think of me would he suspect me of having dawdled to buy sweets or look over the bridge or gossip with a chum i would not for anything it had happened and felt not at all amiably disposed to miss mamie as the inconsiderate cause of my delay however there was nothing for it but to wait i resolved not to put myself into the clutches of the philosophers till my mission was discharged for fear of accident so i seated myself on one of the pavilion steps and watched the play it was evidently a hot match for a scratch one as far as i could make out the remnants of last seasons fifteen amounting to eleven veterans only were playing the next fifteen who having the best of the wind were giving a dangerously good account of themselves they were acute enough to make all the use they could of the favouring element by keeping open order and kicking whenever they had the chance whereas of course the other side played a tight game and ran with the ball even for a novice like myself it was interesting to watch a contest of this kind the fifteen evidently hoped to rush the thing and carry their goal before halftime deprived them of the wind whereas the eleven were mainly concerned to keep on the defensive and risk nothing by over haste among the veterans i could distinguish the big form of redwood always close to the ball and near him with a shudder i recognised crofter working hard while hovering on the wing of the scrimmage was the genial pridgin looking as if he would fain be in bed but when the time for action came making it very uncomfortable for the enemy on the other side i was not long in finding out tempest with the glow of enthusiasm on his cheek as now and again he broke through the ruck and sent the ball into quarters wales too was there spick and span as usual playing neatly and effectively and withal elegantly as time wore on it was evident the veterans were being penned closer and closer by their antagonists presently a dangerous scrimmage was formed just in front of their goal for some minutes the ball was invisible then by an apparently preconcerted movement the forwards of the fifteen loosened and let it dart back into the open behind them where lurked tempest ready to receive it he did not wait to pick it up but ran to meet it with a flying kick for a moment it seemed doubtful whether it would clear the onward rush of redwood and his forwards but it did and rose steadily and beautifully over their heads and with the wind straight upon it reached the goal and skimmed over the bar amid the loud shouts of every one conspicuous among which was my shrill voice halftime now was my chance and before the shouting had ceased or the discomfited eleven had quite realised their misfortune i darted into the sacred enclosure and presented the captain with his belt im awfully sorry i wasnt in time said i youd just begun when i got back thanks youngster its all right said redwood wonderfully cheerful as it seemed to me here take care of this for me and he divested himself of the belt he was wearing and donned the new one youll have the wind with you now i ventured to observe yes said he with a nod i think we shall do the trick this time eh rather said i and departed elated not so much to have been spared the rebuke i expected but to be talked to by such a hero as if i was not a junior at all but a comrade my chums when i rejoined them were anxious to prevent my being too much puffed up by my exploit good old sarah toady cried trimble as i approached is he coming who where i inquired i thought you were asking redwood to tea or something no i wasnti only theres jarman cried langrish run and cadge up to him perhaps hell pat you on the back too despite these taunts i could not fail to notice the depressing effect of the new arrival on the onlookers generally mr jarman the gymnasium master was a ruddy restlesslooking man of about thirtyfive with cold grey eyes and the air of a man who knew he was unpopular but was resolved to do his duty nevertheless if i had heard nothing about him before i should have disliked him at first glance and instinctively tried to avoid his eye and yet as he stood there talking to mr selkirk the melancholy master of the reputedly fast house at low heath he did not look particularly offensive look out now theyre starting again there was no mistaking the veterans now their backs were up and the order had evidently gone out for no quarter to be given to the audacious fifteen redwoods kick off all but carried the goal from the middle of the field and from that moment it never got out of the thirties as the imaginary line between the two distance flags was called to crofter belonged the honour of first wiping off scores with the enemy and after him redwood dropped a goal first from one side line then from the other pridgin too scored a smart run in but unluckily the kick fouled the goal post and saved the fifteen a further disaster then but before time was called a fourth goal was placed to the credit of the veterans the vanquished fought gamely to the end once or twice tempest broke away but for want of effective backing was repulsed and once a smart piece of dribbling down the touch line by wales gave the elevens halfbacks an anxious moment but that was all the match ended as every one expected in a slashing victory for the old hands together with a general verdict that tempest and wales at any rate had won their laurels and were safe for two of the vacant caps in the stampede which followed i missed my opportunity of restoring redwoods property as he vanished immediately after the game and my comrades would by no means allow me out of their sight indeed it was not till after evening chapel that i contrived to elude their vigilance and start on my second run to bridge street but if i eluded them i was less fortunate with another sentinel for at the gates i encountered the forbidding presence of mr jarman what are you doing here please sir this is redwoods belt and i promised to give it to him go back what is your name jones sir whose house are you in mr sharpes do not let me find you out of bounds again jones and he fixed me with his eye as if to impress me with the fact that he would certainly know me again but sir redwood did you hear me sir i capitulated cowed and indignant i was beginning to understand what the fellows said about mr jarman its all rot said the philosophers when i confided my grievance to them its not out of bounds before and if it was its no business of his its the house masters business or the house captains if you get lagged by them all right but hes got no right to lag fellows the cad in my present humour i was far from disputing the appellation chapter eleven cheap advertising extraordinary i spent a bad quarter of an hour that evening before bedtime in inditing a letter of explanation to crofter i had come to the conclusion this would be easier and safer than a personal interview and that the sooner it was done the better how to do it was another problem to write a letter in the raggery was out of the question i tried it but failed miserably for either my paper was twitched away from under my pen or some one looked over my shoulder and pretended to read expressions of endearment which were not there or some one got under the table and heaved it about tempestuously to the detriment of my handwriting or some one drew skeleton figures of spiderlegged bipeds on the margin of the paper worse still it was evident every word i wrote would be common property which i did not desire i had therefore to abandon the attempt till later on when finding myself in pridgins study i ventured to inquire if i might write there pridgin was good enough to express admiration of my cheek but said if i spread one newspaper over his carpet and another over his tablecloth to catch the blots and didnt ask him how to spell any word of less than four letters or borrow a stamp i might all which i faithfully undertook to do and sat down to my delicate task it took me a long time considering the result and i was by no means satisfied with the performance when it was done dear crofter i wrote but that seemed too familiar whereas dear sir from one schoolfellow to another was too formal so i attempted my explanation in the oblique oration jones iv is sorry he accidentally told crofter he was a beast yesterday he did not know it was him when he saw him or he would not have told him what tempest said about him which was quite unintentional he also must explain that what he said about his being expelled was in consequence of a dogs death about which there was a misunderstanding he hopes crofter will not tell him he told him as he would be very angry with him done said pridgin who comfortably ensconced in his easychair with his feet upon the windowledge was reading a comic paper yes thanks said i half terrified lest he should demand to read my not too lucid epistle all right go and tell crofter i want him will you look alive and then cut to bed here was a blow i had been at all this labour in order to avoid the painful necessity of an interview with crofter and here i was as badly off as ever cant you hear said pridgin as i hesitated if you please pridgin said i resolved to take the bull by the horns im awfully sorry but i dont want crofter to catch me the fact is pridgins goodhumoured reply was to shy a book at me which i was fortunate enough to miss but which tempest who entered the study at the moment caught fairly on his forehead hullo are you and the kid playing catch said he sorry to disturb you really but my fags skulking somewhere and i want to borrow yours to take a message to crofter was it a plot or what i had far better have written in the faggery after all that was exactly the subject about which the kid and i were playing catch just now said pridgin i asked him to go to crofter too what has he been sending you a billetdoux said tempest well yes he seems to be sore i didnt ask him to tea yesterday and says hes afraid some one has been libelling him though how he knew i had any one here last night i cant imagine thats funny said tempest he writes to me to say he is sorry i should take the trouble to call him a beast in public he understands a fellows right to his private opinion he says and would be sorry not to be allowed his about me but he thinks it imprudent to shout it out for every one to hear just his style i was going to send him word to ask him to come in and make himself a cup of tea out of my pot just to show there was no illfeeling said pridgin and i was going to say that i hope he wont trouble to think better of me in private then i think of him in public though for the life of me i cant imagine what he refers to the fact is tempest said pridgin putting his feet up on the windowledge again its just as well to be above board with crofter hes a slippery customer and if he knows what we think of him and we know what he thinks of us we shall get on much better if hed only give a chap a chance of a row with him said tempest but he wont the more down on him you are the more affectionate he is and the sweeter he smiles ugh but who on earth has been blabbing to him said pridgin not wales wales said tempest rather not hes not that sort i dont think he is said pridgin and yet old manthe fact is i you dont fancy wales i know hardly that i dont mind him but hes more of a pull over you than he has over me i cant be bothered with his fashions its too much grind but you arent lazy like me andwellyou know he runs you into a lot of expense that picnic last term for instance we could have had quite a jolly day for half the cost chicken and hams all very well but cold boiled eggs are just as good for keeping a chap going but wales cant stand things not being dear said pridgin dont flare up old chap youve got your work cut out for you this term and cant afford to spend all your time paying bills even if you had the tin all very well for you whove let me in for cocking the house said tempest with a laugh anyhow youve a right to talk to me like a father all the same i fancy youve a little downer on old wales hes a good sort of chap and theres nothing of the eel about him which brings us back to crofter said pridgin some one has told him that hes not popular in this study and he doesnt like it i wonder who our candid friend is it was me said i coming out at last with my pentup confession im awfully sorry tempest it was this take a seat said tempest putting me off in the identical way that crofter had done yesterday but i was not to be put off i took a seat and continued i met him and didnt know who he was and i mentioned that id come from here and that a tea was going on and that crofter was out of it and the reason was because tempest thought him a beast andim awfully sorry tempesti let out to him that wed been expelled from dangerfield and id not the least idea it was him he suggested pridgin he and ive just been writing to him to explain rather a tough job eh said tempest you may see the letter said i the two seniors read it with a gravity which scarcely seemed genuine i think it may pass said tempest coming out at last with a laugh there are only about twelve hes and hims in it and as it will be absolutely unintelligible it cant possibly do harm if crofter has the least sense of literary taste he will frame it said pridgin i trust no dogs deaths will occur here my confusion was tempered by the relief i felt that they took my indiscretion in such good part and saw onlywhat i failed to see myselfthe humorous side of the incident i begged hard to be allowed to tear up my letter but this they would by no means allow on the contrary i was compelled to address it and stamp it then and there and place it in the postbox in the hall then with compliments and good wishes i was dismissed to bed and left the two friends talking school politics i felt a good deal more humbled by the manner in which they had received my confession than if they had as i had expected roundly abused me to be let down easy as if i was barely responsible for my actions was not conducive to my vanity and if that was the object they had in view it was amply attained i went to bed on my second night at low heath with as little vanity in me as i could decently do with and even that as i lay awake for an hour or two oozed away and did not return till in a happy moment i fell asleep and once more and for a few unconscious hours became a hero to myself the next morning i tumbled out of bed at the call of the bell in no very lighthearted way first of all crofter would receive my letter secondly i had still got redwoods belt thirdly i had not done my preparation and fourthly i felt concerned about tempest and his alliance with the expensive wales strangely enough this last trouble weighed on me most as i dressed tempest i knew was not well off but he was proud and not the sort of fellow to shirk a thing on account of the cost i could remember at dangerfield his spending all his money at the beginning of the term on an absurdly expensive cricket bag and having to go without spikes in his shoes because he could not afford a set at low heath where seniors were allowed to run up bills in certain shops i was certain his ignorance about money matters added to the friendly encouragements of an exquisite like wales would make it all the worse for him why even i knew more about money than he did and could reckon that if i brought thirteen shillings up at the beginning of the term i should have just a shilling a week to bless myself with till breakup whereas he i verily believe would consider that he had thirteen shillings a week and the worst of it was he would never let any one know how hard up he was or tolerate any remarks except from a privileged chum like pridgin on the subject as i joined my comrades in the faggery in the fond hope of snatching a precious quarter of an hour for my neglected studies i found great excitement and jubilation afoot the printer had sent home the handbills of the conversation club that ought to do our business said langrish flourishing one of the documents in my face i took it and read it with mingled pride and concern it ran as follows under the distinguished patronage of the nobility and gentry of low heath a philosophical conversation club has been started for conversation on philosophy

bridled up at the record of my own name look here said i youve stuck it down wrong again awfully sorry said langrish the printer chaps made a little slip over the christian name but all the rest seems right its wonderful how sharp they are isnt it but youre going to have it corrected surely said i why it would cost a frightful lot protested the company we might alter it in ink but that would only call attention to it bless you no one will notice it theyll put it down to a printers error i was by no means satisfied but their delight at the whole performance was so unbounded that it was impossible to be as angry as i felt itll draw and no mistake said trimble who had evidently never seen his name in print before jolly well drawn up of you lang oh said langrish modestly when you know what you want to say its easy enough to stick it down thats why you stuck down sarah i suppose said i rather crossly i never knew such a kid as you retorted langrish you seem to fancy nobody can think of anything but you and your washerwoman the conversation was drifting on to dangerous ground and warminster promptly changed the subject the thing now will be to put the papers about i vote we each take a batch and give them round we might shove them under the fellows doors said coxhead the best way will be to do it in big hall said the more practical purkis one or two of us can easily get in ten minutes early and stick one on every chaps place but suppose you stick one on a day boys place i suggested whats the odds the paper tells him hes out of it replied purkis it occurred to me that this would not cheer the day boy very much still on the whole purkiss suggestion seemed the best i tell you what said langrish i beg to move and second that the president be authorised to stick round the papers i third and fourth that said trimble carried unanimously said langrish look here one of you had better do it said i feeling a little alarmed at this imposing honour you know the way better thats where youve the pull said purkis youre a new kid they wont interfere with you big halls at five and you can easily slide in at a quarter to and do the trick hullo theres bell school that morning went uncomfortably for me i escaped being lagged for my neglect of preparation chiefly owing to the friendly prompting i received from dicky brown but it was a time of anxiety and trepidation and my nerves were somewhat strained before it was over the shock of the day however awaited me as i got outside on my way to the fields a small youth of my own size accosted me i say are you the new chap what new chap the new chap that redwood told to fetch his belt yes said i turning a little pale all right youve got to go to him sharp i tried to give it him back yesterday really i did but i was stopped said i do you think ill get in a row i wouldnt be in your shoes thats all i know remarked the messenger brutally itll be all the worse if you dont cut where is he in the captains room at the school house i went off with my heart in my boots and i had hoped so much to show up well to redwood it was all jarmans fault and i wrote down yet another grudge against him in my mental book the captain was alone and evidently expecting me as he rose and came to meet me when i appeared here you are then youngster said he in a tone which if it meant a licking was a very deceptive one im very sorry said i i tried to bring the belt round yesterday evening but hang the belt said the captain thats not what i want you for why didnt you tell me what happened at home yesterday afternoon then it was another row altogether i was in for what i wondered had i done surely he didnt suspect me of having pushed his young sister into the water i didnt like while the match was on i didnt know mamie had tumbled in or i would have stopped her but you fished her out he asked i told annie to take her and dry her said i wondering where the blow was going to fall you see she went upstairs for the belt and it was when she had gone it happened i dont think it was her fault to my amazement redwood laughed and clapped me on the back you young donkey dont you know you saved mamies life and i want to say thank you to you this unexpected denouement alarmed me almost as much as my previous misgivings oh no really i didnt said i she was close to the edge another inch or two and she would have been in six feet of water said he then with a friendly laugh he added you may not have meant to save her life but you did and must take the consequences my mother wants you to come to tea tomorrow call here for me after evening chapel and well go together goodbye now and thanks youngster i could hardly tell if i was on my head or my heels as i walked back it had never occurred to me till now that i had done anything out of the common in fishing miss mamie out of her muddy bath indeed i still felt i was getting credit i did not deserve and blushed to myself as to the invitation for tomorrow that seemed to me a burst of glory quite past my present comprehension and i resolved to treasure it as a secret in my own bosom until at least i had made sure it was not a dream before then however i had less pleasant work on hand my comrades did not fail to remind me several times during the afternoon of my promise as they called it to distribute the conversation club circulars in great hall and adjured me not to run it too fine the consequence was that at a quarter to five i was convoyed with the bundle of papers under my arm to the door of the dininghall and gently shoved inside with all retreat cut off until my task was done some of the servants who were laying the tables objected to my presence but on my explaining i had been sent to do it they allowed me without interruption to lay a copy of the precious document on each of the five hundred plates i had barely concluded this arduous duty when the bell commenced to ring and the fellows in twos and threes began to drop in it was all i could do to affect unconsciousness as from a modest retreat near the door i marked the effect of the announcement on low heath generally at first there was a note of surprise then as one after another read on a titter and finally a general laugh which was only checked by the entrance of the masters and the call to grace i hadbeing a stranger to the placedistributed my favours among the masters quite as liberally as among the boys and presently with horror perceived dr england rise in his place with his copy in his hand whew whistled langrish theres a row on i fancy serve you right if there is said trimble why ever did you put them on that table how was i to know groaned i what boy said the doctor when silence prevailed what boy has been putting this foolish paper round the hall oh dear how i wished i was safe at home please sir i did said i rising meekly in my place your name jones iv please sir then come at once jones iv and collect them again every one and write out two hundred lines let dinner proceed now if the object of the promoters of the philosophical conversation club had been cheap advertisement they must have been amply gratified hercules never performed any labour equal to mine that afternoon the masters handed me up their copies gravely and reproachfully but the low heathens generally made sport of my misery scarcely one in ten would part with his rare broadside and those who did made it manifest that they had the contents by heart the unfortunate misprint of my christian name moreover was the occasion for much ribald comment when finally i reached the quarters of my own particular comrades i received more kicks than papers they were unkind enough to say i had mulled the whole thing and to promise me untold penalties when they got me in the privacy of the faggery at last when the pudding was almost vanishing i sat down to my hard earned meal but it mattered little for i could have eaten nothing be that as it may the philosophical conversation club was able to boast that afternoon that it had attracted the attention and interest of every member of the school from the headmaster down to the junior fag and few school clubs can boast as much as that chapter twelve a committee of ways and means where are you going demanded the faggery next afternoon as i tried to desert them after afternoon chapel to take up your lines to england i should have preferred that they had not asked me the question but having asked it i felt bound to answer no im going to tea at a fellows who the washerwomans no to redwoods i tried to pronounce the name with the unconcern of a man who is in daily communion with heroes but i fear i betrayed my emotion at least their laughter made me think so i was instantly greeted with all sorts of mock salutations and obeisances and whether i liked it or not rushed off to the faggery to be tidied up it was in vain i struggled and explained that redwood was waiting for me they would not be put off you must wash your face for the credit of the phcc said langrish and put on a clean shirt for the credit of your wash here by a frantic effort i broke loose and made off followed by the pack in full cry with shouts of stop thief welsher clear the course hurry up for tea there and other exclamations of a similar nature it was not certainly a very dignified way of accepting a friends invitation still it would have been worse had i remained in their clutches as it was i only just made the schoolhouse door before warminster and coxhead were up to me and presented myself to my host painfully out of breath and red in the face been having a trot over said he with a nod yes a little i gasped im ready come along my heart sunk within me as on reaching the door i saw my five comrades all apparently by accident hovering round to see me go out they did their best and very successfully too to stare me out of countenance and encourage my blushes by allusions to sarah and my tin sleevelinks and the smudges on my face and by cries of shrimps and muffins and other awkward allusions redwood as became the cock of the school affected not to hear their ribald remarks though he must have caught a word or two and inquired been playing football since you came no not yet said i painfully aware that trimble and langrish were walking behind us critically that is yes a little i was glad when we reached the big gates and were able to shake off the enemy who continued audible comments till i was out of earshot and finally went off on some new quest at number bridge street i found myself much to my discomfort quite a hero mrs redwood a gentlelooking lady kissed me effusively so did little miss gwen who having once begun could scarcely be prevailed upon to leave off the servants smiled approvingly as did a lady visitor who shook me by the hand the only person who did not appear to rejoice to see me was the heroine of the occasion miss mamie who declined altogether to kiss me and added i was a naughty big boy to spoil her nice sash and ought to be sent to bed to her mothers protests and brothers encouragement she was quite obdurate no she hated me she said for spoiling her nice sash and wild horses would not draw from her a contrary declaration after which we were summoned to tea and i was consoled for this base ingratitude by plum jam and sallylunn and sultana cake and other delicacies which only a schoolboy well on in the term knows how fully to appreciate the talk was limited first because i made it a rule not to talk with my mouth full and secondly because had that difficulty been removed i had nothing to say redwood fine fellow that he was did not try to pump me and the ladies who kept up most of the talk most conveniently worded their observations in such a form as not to call for a reply after tea however i did find myself talking to mrs redwood about my mother and presently to redwood about dangerfield and my previous acquaintance with tempest and brown brown iii is a townboy said the captain i wish wed had him in is he a member of your wonderful club by the way i blushed of course redwood had seen that fatal document yesterday ahwell you know that is only for chaps in the school rather rough on us townboys said redwood with a laugh im sure theyd be delighted to have you said i ah well our fellows have a club of their own said he although they dont talk philosophy by the way is your christian name correctly printed asked he oh no said i that was languishs fault he says it was a printers error but im sure he did it on purpose it helps to call attention to the club said the captain laughing your lot seems to be fond of its little joke to judge by the specimens that came to see us off just now im awfully sorry said i they do fool about soi say i hope you arent in a wax about it he certainly did not look it i went up with him to his den and we had quite a long talk and somehow without seeming to mean it he managed to knock a great deal of nonsense out of my head and incite me to put my back into the work of the term i suppose said he you mean to back up tempest now hes cock of sharpes you kids can make it pretty hot in a house if you choose oh were all backing up tempest said i especially now hes got his colours all serene said the captain hell pull through well then i stayed till it was time for redwood to go over to the school for a committee of the sports club i did not leave number without a standing invitation to come in whenever i liked or without painful apologies for the contumacy of mamie redwood and i had just reached the bridge when some one confronted us whom i recognised at once as mr jarman ah redwood youve a meeting on whos this boy ah i remember jones iv what did i say to you yesterday jones jones has been to tea at my house said the captain with a flush and looking less amiable than i had yet seen him its after hours said mr jarman coolly i cautioned him yesterday a hundred lines jones iv by tomorrow evening its not his fault said redwood i gave him leave sir we need not discuss this redwood said mr jarman and walked away i felt quite sufficiently avenged when i saw the captains face he strode on some distance in silence and then said im sorry youngster it cant be helped though jarmans strictly in the right though its sharp practice youd better cut in now good night good night said i making off but he called me back youd better do the doctors lines tonight leave jarmans till the morning all right and i departed not a little impressed with the incident the captain had disappointed me a little i should have liked to see him knock jarman down or at least openly defy him whereas he seemed to back him up although much against his will the net result to me was that i had three hundred lines to write on my third day at school and that for a wellmeaning youth was tribulation enough i took redwoods advice and wrote the doctors lines that evening trusting to a chance next forenoon of satisfying the demands of mr jarman to their credit be it said some of the faggery helped me out with my task and as we all wrote in the same style of penmanship namely a backhanded slope spread out very wide to cover as much ground as possible it was very difficult when all was done to believe that the performance was a cooperative one before going to bed i told tempest of my adventure and had the satisfaction of receiving his complete sympathy thats the worst of redwoodhell let it all slide i wish id been with you when it happened thered have been a row there will some day too all which was very consoling to me and helped me to sleep soundly but the surprise of surprises happened next morning when i encountered the captains fag at the door before breakfast with a letter in his hand here you are said he thrusting the document on me i dont see why you cant come and fetch your own things instead of me having to run after you you can walk said i i suppose i meant to be conciliatory but he was highly offended and began to kick and it took some little time to pacify him and induce him to return to the bosom of his house when he had gone i opened the envelope with some little curiosity what was my astonishment when i found it enclosed one hundred lines written out in a bold clear hand which it was easy to guess was that of the captain himself there was no letter or message but the explanation was clear enough redwood having got me into my row had like a gentleman paid the penalty and as i realised this i could have kicked myself for the unworthy thoughts i had indulged about him i only wished jarman to whom in due time i handed the precious document could have known its history he evidently gave me credit for being an excellent writer and perhaps for having an unusual acquaintance for a boy of my age with the works of the immortal bard for redwood had grimly selected the following passage to write out over and over again for the policemasters benefit it is excellent to have a giants strength but it is tyrannous to use it like a giant i fear the satire was lost on its victim and that he meekly concluded i had selected the passage because it happened to be in my lesson for the day and was probably the first to come to hand tempest laughed when i told him its all very well said he but its encouraging the enemy redwoods a dear old chap but hes too much of an anythingforaquiet life fellow for captain by the way has crofter replied to your polite letter no said i not a word and i havent seen him well take my advice kid if he wants to kick you consider yourself lucky if hes extra civil cut him like mischief some day you may thank me for the tip it seemed queer advice at the time but i had occasion to call it to mind later on as the reader will discover by the end of my first week i was pretty well domesticated at low heath my chief regret was that i saw so little of dicky brown and when we did meet the only thing we had in common was our lessons which were not always congenial topics of conversation dicky was fully imbued with the superiority of the townboy over the house boy and irritated me sometimes by his repeated regret that i was not eligible for the junior urbans what do you do i inquired oh hosts of things we go in for geology and part songs and antiquities and all that sort of thing and have excursionsat least were going to have one soonto look for remains ah its a pity you couldnt come to our picnic next week its to be no end of a spree oh weve heard all about that said dicky with a grin mens sano in corpore sanaeyou should hear some of our chaps yell about that im sure its not a bad motto ventured i i dont know about that but its not the motto its the grammar i wasnt quite pleased with dicky for this it seemed as if he thought he knew more than other people which i held to be a reprehensible failing in any oneparticularly a day boy i flattered myself that as an exhibitioner he had hardly the right to talk to me about grammar but it was dickys way and i knew he couldnt help it for all that i referred to the subject in the faggery that evening my comrades were in high glee half a dozen subscriptions had come in with requests to be allowed to join the picnic and a considerable number of others had asked to be allowed at half price or on the deferred payment system its going like anything sarah said langrish thumping me violently on the back wheres the picnic to be i inquired wouldnt you like to know said the secretary i said i would and as president considered i was entitled to the information were not as green as we look are we you chaps said trimble why you dont suppose were going to let out and give you a chance of blabbing to the dayboy cads do you im not any more likely to blab than you are said i warmly all serene you keep your temperyoull know time enough suppose i resigned said i feeling i must support my dignity resign away weve got your subscription i dont mean i shall said i but shut up and dont disturb the committee meeting if im president i suppose ive a right to speak not till youre asked all right said i playing my trump card desperately when you do ask me whats wrong with the grammar of your latin motto i shant tell you ha hacorpore sanae you should hear the fellows yell the effect of this announcement was electrical langrish turned white and trimble turned red the others bit their nails in silence it was a season of delicious triumph to me i was master of the situation for once and resolved to remain so as long as possible why whats wrong with it said warminster presently wouldnt you like to know said i corpores feminine isnt it asked coxhead common gender i fancy said purkis depends on who the chap is you mean if it was sarah it would be feminine and if it was one of us it would be masculine said langrish this was a nasty one for me but i held my ground youd better look it up in the dictionary said i this was diplomatic for although i knew the motto was wrong i could not quite say what it should have been after much labour it was decided that corpore was neuter and that the adjective in consequence must be sanum a resolution to that effect was proposed and seconded but an amendment to the effect that as the document had gone out in the name of the president and every one knew it was his work it was no business of the present company to help him out of the mess was carried by a large majority with which delightful solution of the difficultydelightful to every one but myselfwe proceeded to the order of the day which was to arrange the details of our picnic next halfholiday my colleagues remained obdurate on the question of revealing the place if the day fellows get wind of it theyll be sure to try to do us was the unfailing reply why shouldnt i know as well as you demanded i whereupon it was explained that nobody knew where the place was to be yetnor indeed was he likely to know till the morning of the day when lots would be drawn every member of the council would then be permitted to write the name of a place on a piece of paper which would be shuffled in a hat and drawn forthe last paper drawn to be the place i could not help admiring the elaborateness of the precautions which had only this drawback as far as i was concerned that i did not yet know one place from another i casually asked dicky one day if he knew any of the places round what for picnics and that sort of thing he demanded wellthat sort of thing said i anxious not to betray my object too precisely i dont know i heard some chaps talking about camp hill bottomwhere the battle was you know i did not know but it sounded a likely place and i made a mental note of it for the eventful day meanwhile there was much to be decided first as to the applicants for admission on reduced terms it was agreed if these brought their fair share of provender and in consideration of their being taken on the cheap would undertake to row or tow the boats up stream they might come then as to the bill of fare it was resolved that no one should be allowed to take more than he could carry in his pocketsgreatcoat pockets not to be used then as to the programme this was drawn up with a view to combine entertainment and instruction in even quantities for the entertainment was set down the presidents inorguralthe spelling was langrishs address a part song of the committee and a public openair debate or conservation on beauty the credit of the last suggestion really belonged to tempest whom i unofficially consulted as to some good subjects for philosophical discussion for the instructive part of the days proceedings there was to be the dinner a boat race a tug of war and if funds permitted a display of fireworks what concerned me chiefly in the arrangements was that i as president was held responsible for everything of a difficult or hazardous nature for instance i was sent down to select the two boats and drive a bargain for their hire then again when owing to the prompt payment of two or three of the paupers as the applicants for reduced terms were politely styled rather than submit to the terms imposed it was discovered that halfacrown of the club funds remained unused it was i who was sent into low heath to buy squibs and roman candles and it was i who was appointed to take charge of the explosives in my hatbox under my bed till the time arrived for letting them off i began to be anxious about my numerous responsibilities to which by the way was added that of replying in the negative on the question of beauty for every day something fresh was put on my shoulders and every day i found my school work falling into arrears tempest and pridgin both mildly hinted to me that i didnt seem to be knocking myself up with work and succeeded in making me uncomfortable on that score what concerned me still more was to find that dicky brown although not an exhibitioner kept steadily above me in class and put me under frequent obligations by helping me out of difficulties never mind thought i it will soon be all rightwhen once the conversation club picnic is over the morning of the eventful day dawned at last fair on the whole but not brilliant the faggery was astir early and before breakfast the solemn ceremony of drawing lots for the scene of our revels took place i faithfully set down camp hill bottom on my paper and committed it to the hat tempest who chanced to look in with an order for his fag was requested as a favour to officiate as drawer which he goodnaturedly did it was anxious work while he pulled out the first five papers and tossed them unopened into the fireplace then he drew the sixth and opened it camp hill botton he read every one seemed pleased first because every one had written it on his paper and secondly because it was the only really good place for a river picnic theres one comfort about it said tempest as we thanked him for his services we shall have a little quiet in this house for an hour or two take care of yourselves goodbye chapter thirteen the picnic at camp hill bottom jorrocks the school boatman was a careful person and suited his accommodation to his company he knew something about the expeditions of learned societies to camp hill bottom and elsewhere and the conclusion he had evidently come to was that the boats best suited for their purpose were craft broad in the beam and deep in draught in which it would be possible to argue out any subject without danger to life or limb by a coincidence which afforded more pleasure to my fellowvoyagers than to me one of the two boats reserved for the use of the conversation club was named the sarah the other rejoicing in the inappropriate name of firefly i was of course voted to a place of honour in the former along with langrish trimble and seven other philosophers of the same kidney while coxhead warminster and purkis took official charge of the firefly with an equal number of passengers it was noticeable by the way that at starting it was impossible for any two boys to sit close together by reason of the stoutness of their pockets which stood out on either side like rope buoys on the side of a penny steamer indeed some of the party seemed to me to be exceeding the limits laid down by the committee as not only were they prominent on either side but unusually stout in front which led one to suspect that they had converted their entire waistcoats into pockets for the time being and stowed the with provisions but as the chief delinquents in this respect were the members of the executive committee it was hardly for us to take official notice of it a hitch occurred at starting owing to the uneven distribution of the paupers in the two boats the sarah boasted of six of these whereas the firefly only possessed one who when called upon to fulfil his part of the bargain and row the whole company up stream singlehanded showed an inclination to rat the crew of the firefly also began to be concerned as to the length of the voyage under such conditions and clamoured for at least two of our paupers a claim which trimble and langrish indignantly repudiated at length however after a little judicious splashing and a threat to go off on a picnic of their own the point was yielded and two of our paupers were ignominiously ejected to make room for an equal number of passengers this being done the question arose as to whether we should row up stream or tow it was decided to proceed by the latter method at least until the towingpath became impracticable whereupon both bands of paupers were turned ashore and harnessed to the end of their respective rope and the rest of us settled down to enjoy our well earned leisure and stimulate the exertions of our tugs with friendly exhortations i regret to say that the philosophy of our galleyslaves failed to sustain them in their arduous efforts they began well the sarah led the way the firefly following close in our wake as long as the friendly emulation between the two teams endured we made fair progress but when it was discovered that the firefly had meanly hitched itself on to the stern of the sarah and was permitting our four paupers to pull the whole cavalcade a difference of opinion arose the firefly tugs having nothing to do amused themselves by peppering the inoffensive crew of the sarah with pebbles from the bank while the outraged pullers of the sarah finding themselves tricked struck work altogether and alter pulling our head round into a bed of tall bulrushes cast off the yoke and went for their fellowpaupers to add to the general confusion a real barge towed by a real horse came down to meet us threatening with its rope to decapitate the whole of our party and whether we liked it or not to drag us back to low heath in the midst of all this trouble i as president was loudly and angrily appealed to to look out and make them shut up and port the helm you lout as if it was all my fault i tried to explain that it wasnt but nobody would trouble to listen to me how we avoided the peril of the barge i really cannot tell it lumbered past us in a very bad temper deluging us as it did so with the splashing from its suddenly slackened rope and indulging in remarks on things in general and schoolboys in particular which were not pleasant to listen to and quite impossible to repeat however as has been truly said a common danger is often a common blessing and it turned out so in the present case the mutinous paupers brought their arguments on the bank to a close and it was decided for the rest of the way to attach the firefly officially to the sarah and allow the seven tugs to pull the lot they were quite sufficiently alive to their own interests to see each pulled his fair share and the progress we made although not racing speed was compared at any rate with our bad quarter of an hour in the bulrushes satisfactory no further adventure happened till langrish pointed to a wooded hill a quarter of a mile further up stream and said thats camp hill jump in you chaps and row whereupon the tugs glad to be relieved came on board the two boats cast loose and the oars were put out botheration said trimble theres a boat ahead of us only some fishermanhe wont hurt said langrish but as we approached the spot we perceived not one boat only but two drawn up under the trees and both empty what was worse they were low heath boats and bore the name of jorrocks on their sterns the committee looked glum as our party stepped ashore and proceeded to make fast our boats to the trees why cant jorrocks send his excursionists somewhere else growled langrish i shouldnt wonder if theyve bagged the bottom the camp hill bottom was a curious dell among the trees almost in the shape of a basin with heather and gorse all round the top and beautiful velvety grass in the hollow for a picnic it was an ideal place close to the water sheltered from the wind with plenty of room to sit round and an expanse of delightful heath and wood behind and on either side it was on this heath the legend went that one of the most furious battles in the wars of the roses was fought and the camp hill marked the place where earl warwicks standard waved during the engagement the bottom was popularly supposed to have been hollowed out by some monks as a burial place for the slain but their benevolent intention had been thwarted by the swoop of a band of marauders who preferred robbing the slain to burying them and left most of the monks dead in their own grave there is little sign now of this tragic story about the quiet grass grown hollow with its fringe of overhanging bushes and carpet of mossy velvet just at present however as we made our way to the spot we had something more important on our minds than earl warwick and the unlucky monks what if the bottom was already bagged by a crowd of common holidaymakers and all our carefully planned picnic was to be spoiled by their unwelcome intrusion it was too true as we advanced we could hear sounds of revelry and laughter interspersed with singing and cheers who could it be the voices sounded suspiciously youthful supposejust suppose that the yes it was too true as we reached the edge and looked down on the coveted dell the first sight which greeted our eyes was a party of low heathens sporting the day boys colours spread out luxuriously on one of the sloping banks solacing themselves with provender and songs and leapfrog i never saw twenty philosophers look more blank than we did when slowly we realised the horror of the situation we were done there could be no doubt that the enemy had got wind of our purpose and had deliberately forestalled us and was now only waiting to enjoy our discomfiture and make merry over our disappointment as to the possibility of their being as sick at the sight of us as we were at the sight of them it never even occurred to one of us our first impulse was to eject them by force our next was to expostulate our third was to ignore them come on you chaps said langrish leading the way to the bank facing that in the occupation of the enemy heres our place squat down and make yourselves comfortable the philosophers followed the cue and apparently unaware of the presence of any strangers took possession of their slope and tried to be as jolly as possible i wonder where the dayboy cads go for their tucks said trimble in an audible voice evidently intended for the opposition some one was saying they were trying to get up a kids club ha ha id like to see it such a joke quin said a voice over the way evidently pitched to carry across to us you know those kids in sharpes theyve started a society what do you think their motto is oh my its a screamer what is it asked the voice of quin keep it dark i wouldnt like it to get out i told you its mens sani in corpore sanorum or something like that you should have seen redwood yell over it now you fellows lets have our grub said langrish encouragingly chaps must eat you know corpore sanum is our motto you know ha ha what do you think i heard one of the day louts call it corpore sanorum ha ha ha shrieked we ho ho ho shrieked the urbans in the midst of which hilarities we produced our provender greatly to the relief of our pockets and fell to the operation evidently did not pass unheeded by the other side i say flitwick cried some one do you know what philosophers eat no what i never knew till just now inky bread and cold baconfat sandwiches or else sherbet if their tongues are long enough to reach to the bottom of the bottles have some of this fizzing pork pie jones asked coxhead ostentatiously thanks you have some of my sardines replied i rummy name for a chap sarah isnt it said the voice of the captains fag opposite theres a new chap in sharpes house this term one of the biggest mules you ever sawhis names sarah what replied his friendis he an ugly little cad with a turnup nose and yellow kid gloves that gets lines every day from the doctor and cant kick a football as high as his own head rather i know him it was impossible to go on much longer at this rate the atmosphere was getting warm all round and the storm evidently might break at any moment fortunately for them the urbans of their own accord averted the peril if youve done lunch said quin wed better get to business our fellows go in for something besides tuck dont they flitwick rather said flitwick we havent got a latin motto that wont parse but we meet to improve our minds not stuff our bodies i vote mr quin takes the chair all serene said quin perching himself on a hamper i now call upon mr brown iii to read us his paper on remains this was the first mention of my old comrade during the interchange of courtesies during lunch he had kept steadily silent anxious no doubt to spare my feelings but now his chance was come it was reserved to him to show off the urbans on their intellectual side but before he could come to the front and clear his throat for action langrish had loudly called the philosophers to order now you fellows said he we have our programme to get through and we are not going to give it up even if our place of meeting was swarming with day idiots mr president you had better lead off thus called upon i loudly summoned mr philosopher trimble to open the debate on the subject of beauty venturing to add some fellows ive been told discuss subjects they know nothing about such as remains and that sort of thing but the conversation club makes a point of sticking to what they are familiar with and that is why we speak today of beauty it would not be easy to give a verbatim report of the proceedings which followed for each party was evidently more attentive to what fell from the other side than to what fell from its own and each speaker was evidently less concerned to impress his friends than his enemies but any one who had chanced to stand on the ridge above halfway between the two parties would have heard a medley somewhat of the following kind gentlemen in addressing you on the subject of remains i need hardly explain what we mean when we speak of beauty remains are things dug up out of the earth where they make a great mistake in calling things people eat beautiful in fact very few of them are to be found unless you know where they are but when we talk of a beautiful face we mean a face that is plastered over with mud and grime and hardly recognisable till it is scraped clean or people differ very much about itwhat one person thinks beautiful another generally digs for with spades and shovels and may spend days trying to look less ugly than they really are some people find this quite impossible and have to employ persons to make personal remarks about their neighbours gentlemen i need not remind you that among the urbans are to be found some of the most hideous types of ugliness imaginable what we need is a little common sense to enable us to tell the difference between shams like ourselves and the baboons which is not always easy in conclusion gentlemen i beg to point to our dirty hands and faces which no one who is really interested in hunting for remains of his native ugliness ought to be ashamed of and so on we were too busy cheering our own orator and listening to the enemys to take in the full humour of the medley at the time the opening speeches were evidently prepared beforehand a good part of them possibly copied bodily out of some book but as soon as the chairman on either side declared the subject open for discussion the interest thickened flitwick led off on remains whereas it fell to my lot to reply on beauty by a little sharp practice i got the lead which as it happened turned out more to the enemys profit than my own gentlemen shouted i for the breeze made it necessary to speak out i beg to disagree with all that the last speaker has said gentlemen came the answering voice of flitwick in consequence of a donkey braying somewhere near i fear i shall find it difficult to make myself heard when people have nothing to say continued i the less they try to say the better i will not imitate the idiots who call themselves philosophers and yet dont know what gender a simple latin word like corpore is it is sad to think how many afflicted ones there are close to us who cannot possibly be as big fools as they look or look as big fools as they are the one kind of remains you cant find are the remains of a philosophers lunch greedy is a mild word to use for their sickening gluttony if you want to look for beauty gentlemen you should look anywhere but straight in front of you cheers gentlemen as i hear some geese quacking as well as the donkey braying i find it difficult to say what i want laughter i deny that there is any beauty in the laugh of a pack of hyenas if there was anybody here called sarah continued flitwick wandering farther and farther from his point who has been brought up in a girls school and wears tan boots and lavender gloves in school loud and derisive shouts and is wellknown as the dunce of his house hear hear i should advise him never to look in the lookingglass if he is afraid of chimpanzees this was too much for the pentup feelings of the philosophersnot that they particularly resented flitwicks facetious allusions to myselfbut in my capacity as president of the club they felt called upon to support me shut up cheapjack cried trimble defiantly we had given ourselves away at last hullo cried flitwick theres somebody here i wonder if those little cads of sharpes have found out our place your place thundered warminster you knew it was ours and we mean to kick you out ho ho when are you going to begin shouted the twenty urbans now yelled the twenty philosophers a battle now seemed imminent as fierce and disastrous as that fought four centuries before on the adjoining heath the blood of both parties was up and i might even have found myself engaged in a handtohand combat with my old chum dicky had not tempest unexpectedly appeared on the scene like a bolt out of the blue he was pushing along his bicycle and had evidently been attracted to the bottom by the noise whats up he inquired taking advantage of the temporary silence those dayboy cads have come and bagged our places and spoiled our fun said we no its your kids who have come and stopped ours protested the enemy and youre all going down into the middle to have a mill said tempest just as you like but why dont you try a tug of war across instead youre pretty evenly matched and ill umpire it was not a bad idea and took beautifully the only drawback was that tempest being a sharper was presumably prejudiced in favour of the philosophers however he had the reputation of being addicted to fair play the side thats pulled down said he clears out and goes somewhere else and the side that wins ill photograph in a group it was a tremendous prize to offer and served to stimulate both teams to the uttermost we had a rope with us which easily stretched across the dell and admitted the twenty pairs of hands on either side to grasp it tempest carefully saw that neither side started with the least advantage and waited till we were all ready before giving the signal a tug of war in which each side is ranged up the steep slope of a hollow is very different work from a tug on the level as we soon found out indeed as soon as the rope was stretched those lowest down were hanging on to it by their finger tips while those higher up were obliged to sit down to get within anything like reach under these circumstances the contest was short and sharp and ended in a draw for each side lost its footing the moment the strain was applied and almost before tempest had given the signal the whole forty of us were sprawling in a confused heap on the grassy floor of the bottom this abortive contest had the effect which probably tempest intended of smoothing over to some extent the angry dispute which was on foot and which was still further allayed by his undertaking to take a monster joint photograph of the two clubs provided we stood or sat still for the process after that he goodnaturedly remained at our invitation to officiate as judge in some impromptu sports in which once again the rival parties proved most evenly matched finally as evening was drawing on he consented just to witness a hurried display of our joint fireworks after which he told us we must at once take to our boats and repair home it was an imposing display twelve roman candles were set up at regular distances round the hollow with a fellow in charge of each two rockets were set in position one on either side and green and red lights alternately were planted on the banks above at a given signal from tempest all were simultaneously lit and in a perfect blaze of glory accompanied by a babel of cheers we concluded our programme at least not quite one unrehearsed incident was yet to come for as the smoke cleared off and the noise ceased and our eyes once more grew accustomed to the twilight we became aware of the presence of mr jarman standing in our midst chapter fourteen extra drill mr jarman must have felt flattered at the gloomy dead silence which fell on philosophers and urbans alike as we looked round and saw him it was of course impossible to believe he had found us by accident still less that he had come with any friendly purpose he advanced into the middle of the bottom watch in hand this is contrary to rules said he it is now a quarterpast six and you are half an hour from low heath in addition to which i have already said that fireworks are only to be had with leave tempest you should have put an end to this you will kindly send me in the name of every boy here and each of you boys must attend an extra drill to morrow and write out one hundred linesexcept added he catching sight of me except jones iv whom i have already had to punish and who must write two hundred lines it was a study to watch tempests face during this speech it was all he could do to wait to the end its not fair said he with pale cheeks and angry brow its a halfholiday and boys always get half an hours grace that is not the rule said the master its the practice sir half these boys are in my house and i have given them leave to stay i also allowed the fireworks tempest we will speak of this presently no sir blurted out tempest the fellows have done nothing wrong and if they have im responsible to dr england about it mr jarman was not the man to give himself away in a public discussion and coolly walked off observing i shall expect the list of names tonight tempest tempests reply was a short defiant laugh which made the master turn a moment as if about to notice it but he departed silently and left us to recover as well as we could from the surprise of the whole scene the general opinion was that the policeman had met his match at last in tempest and the more enthusiastic of us tried to express our feelings in words but tempest was by no means inclined to discuss the situation shut up he replied angrily when i ventured to applaud his courage cut back to school at once and dont speak to me this was a blow to some of the party who had calculated on a general revolt to be headed by the rock of sharpes house in person and celebrated by general orgies on the spot i shant do my lines shall you said dicky as we trotted down to the boats rather not and i dont think our chaps will turn up for extra drill just like old tempest said brown he enjoys a row of this kind he didnt look as if he did remarked i perhaps that was because such a lot of day chaps are mixed up in it brown looked a little glum at this he neednt bother about us unless he likes said he we can take care of ourselves i fancy luckily at this stage we reached the boats and further discussion was interrupted the voyage home was comparatively uneventful it was of course enlivened by a desultory race with the urbans all the way in which i regret to say mr jorrockss boats received a few scratches owing to the desire of each boat to take the water of its opponent before it was clear ahead the townboys unrighteously claimed in the end to have won by a quarter of a length but as in passing our leader they had pulled away one of our bow oars and further turned the nose of the sarah into the bank we stoutly resisted their claim and a very lively argument ensued in which mr jorrocks lost a good deal of varnish and most of the combatants became rather wet however we were back in school within half an hour of embarking which on the whole was not a bad record curiosity to know what tempest would do prevented us from so much as thinking of our lines i took an early opportunity of presenting myself in pridgins study feeling sure i should be likely to hear something of the matter there as it happened tempest and wales were there too in deep confabulation look here old chap pridgin was saying dont spoil your term for a parcel of yelping young puppies like this kid here and his lot theyre not worth it for all that said wales its a question of whether the cock of a house is to be allowed his rights or not its more a question whether jarman is to be allowed his rights said tempest i quite agree that these young muffs are a nuisance and its all the more aggravating to be dragged into a mess by them but hed no right to interfere strictly speaking i suppose he was right said pridgin there is a rule about juniors being in by although every one knows half an hours grace is given on halfholidays and i suppose hes right about the fireworks you think i ought to cave in asked tempest i dont say that but id let the matter alone we shall never stop jarman at that rate said wales i should say fight it out all very well for you and me said pridgin who are comfortably out of it but it means a big job for old tempest hell have to bear the brunt of it i cant well drop it when hes told me to give him a list of the youngsters present said tempest you certainly are not called upon to give him a list of the day boys well as i only know one of them it wouldnt be easy if hed only lagged me and given me extra drill and lines it wouldnt have been so bad but it was playing it low down to here came a knock at the door and the school messenger entered with a letter no answer said he handing it to tempest it was plain to see by the flush on tempests face as he read it that it contained anything but pleasant news its from jarman said he throwing it down on the table wales took it up and read it mr jarman informs tempest that the list of names required in connection with this afternoons incident will not be required as mr jarman already has it tempest will please attend the extra drill with the other boys of his house tomorrow as his conduct this afternoon was neither respectful nor a good example to others whew exclaimed pridgin rising for a wonder out of his chair thats a nasty one if you like hes taken you at your word old man whos given the list of names did you you young sweep he demanded of me oh no said i glad to be recognised under any term of endearment i wouldnt think of doing such a thing but ill tell you what i think really jones iv its nice to know you do think but if you dont mind we would rather not hear if you know anything let us hear it but spare us your thoughts pridgin was rather crushing sometimes i meant we were marked off by the porter at the lodge as we came in said i perhaps thats how hes got the names evidently said pridgin hes had you for once tempest he guessed thered be a bother about the list and he has taken the wind out of your sails youll attend extra drill of course certainly so that said wales all you will score by the affair will be a public disgrace before the juniors tempests half dismal half wrathful face was answer enough we shant consider it a disgrace said i thank you very much jones iv if that is so we shall feel it was worth living for to have your approbation now you had better go and write out your lines what said i i thought we were none of us going to do that i have warned you once against the perils of thinking its a bad habit for little boys off you go or you wont get your poena done in time what am i to tell the others i inquired you may tell them its a fine evening cutdo you hear it was a great comedown the philosophers thought so when i reported the case some were inclined to be angry with tempest others to pity him and every one was unanimous i do not know why in expressing a burning desire to kick me the expectation of a general revolt headed by tempest in person and reinforced by the urbans faded dismally away as the company saw itself going down to knock off mr jarmans lines this comes said langrish rather illogically i thought of getting mixed up with the dayboy cads i knew it would land us in a mess and so it has anyway theyre in the mess too said trimble its a little rough on tempest having to show up for them as well as for us said i shut up and let a fellow write his lines cant you growled coxhead when we want sarahs advice well ask for it the reader will gather from this that the philosophers were in bad tempers and that their president was in imminent danger of losing his at noon next day when most of the school was turning out after morning class into the fields a melancholy band might have been seen dropping in in irregular order at the door of the school gymnasium all except one were juniors some looked as if they were used to the thing other betrayed the shy and selfconscious embarrassment of the first delinquents none looked cheerful not a few looked savage the exception in point of age was a well setup squareshouldered proud faced senior who entered with an air of reckless disgust which was not comfortable to look at and might be dangerous if provoked none of us spoke to tempest and he vouchsafed no sign of recognition of us a squad of the school volunteers chiefly composed of smart boys from mr selkirks house were concluding drill as we entered and of course took stock of our dejected looks and of tempests unwonted appearance as they filed out a row on eh whispered one as he passed us it doesnt look like fun does it snarled langrish where does tempest come in persisted the inquirer by the door and the sooner you get out by it the better ha hapoor little naughty boys an extra drill will do you good come on you chaps lets leave them to enjoy themselves theyll get used to it in time ho ho fall in called mr jarman and painfully conscious not only that a few of the volunteers were hanging about to look on but that the school porter was at the moment conducting a party of visitors through the building we obeyed listlessly and dismally tempest taking his place at the end of the line are these some of the volunteers we heard one of the lady spectators ask no madam this is an extra drill for breach of rules replied the official number from the right cried mr jarman we numbered answer to your names said the discipline master producing a paper we could not help noticing that tempests name was mixed in along with ours and that no difference was made on account of his age or status we were then formed into double rank and fours and open order and put through a hideous series of extension exercises irksome enough at any time but under present circumstances specially so i heard dicky brown beside me groan as he stood leaning over with his left knee bent his right leg stretched out behind and his two arms doubled up at his side i wonder they dont all kick he whispered not easy like this said i how tempest must be enjoying it dick murmured poor beggar its a nasty dose for him but if mr jarman counted on any protest or resistance from his senior victim he was disappointed tempest went patiently and impassively through the drill with the rest of us but as we could see with a blazing eye fixed all the while on the master but i could guess the struggle that was going on in my friends breast mr jarman may have flattered himself he was taking it out of him dicky and i knew better we all took our cue from tempest that morning and any inclination to rebel or mutiny was suppressed we contented ourselves with glaring at our tormentor and denying him the excuse he probably desired of prolonging the agony my impression is that mr jarman was never so happy as when he realised that he was absolute master of the situation the roman emperors were not in it with him attention front said he at last when the proceedings were becoming dull even to him stand at ease attention stand at ease attention left turn dismiss as you were dismiss it was a prolonged insult and we knew it but tempest stood it and so consequently did we but as we filed from the place we felt that mr jarmans turn would come some day tempest contrary to general expectation evinced no haste to leave the scene of his tribulation there was yet a quarter of an hour to next bell and this he evidently decided to spend as he had the right to do where he was mr jarman was evidently annoyed to find not only that the senior was apparently unaffected by the humiliation through which he had passed but that now the drill was over he evinced an entire unconcern in the masters presence tempest was one of the best gymnasts in the school and it was always worth while to watch him on the trapeze and horizontal bar so the philosophers and urbans by one consent trooped back into the gymnasium to look on and what must have been particularly annoying to the master because he had no authority to stop it to cheer how we did cheer and what good it did us had tempest been the meanest of performers and done nothing but swing with his legs doubled up under him from one ring to the next we should have applauded but today his flights were terrific no fellow was less given to show off and he probably objected to our applause as much as mr jarman but he was bound to relieve his feelings somehow and the trapeze was just what he wanted when finally the bell rang and we were hoarse with cheering which was our way of relieving our feelings he came to earth decidedly better for his exercise mr jarman evidently was impressed and to our surprise even ventured on a compliment you did that well tempest tempests reply was to walk away putting on his coat as he went it was plain to see by the angry twitch of mr jarmans mouth that the shaft of this public snub had gone home and we who looked on and witnessed it all had little need to tell ourselves that civil war had already been declared it is hardly necessary to state that the extraordinary meeting of the conversation club that evening was lively and that there was no lack of a topic besides our own contingent a few of the outsiders including muskett and corderoy from selkirks house and a few of the paupers dropped in as the faggery would only conveniently hold six persons and as at least twenty were present it was considered advisable to adjourn to the shoeroom where in the dim light of a small candle several particularly revolutionary motions were discussed the company sitting on the floor for the purpose the meeting opened by my calling on langrish to read the minutes which he accordingly did the inaugural picnic of the phcc was held the other day present all the usual lot and seven paupers the president had chartered the sarah and firefly two of the vilest crocks at jorrockss he said they were the best they had got i explained shut up or youll be kicked out young sarah ive a right to speak no you haventunless you hold your tongue if i held my tongue i couldnt possibly speak i explained turn him out cried the paupers whereat i subsided the paupers continued the minutes had beastly little go in them and ought to have had a meal of hay before starting interruption and will be badly kicked if they dont shut up the firefly had the best of the race up here there were most indignant protests from the crew of the gallant sarah and the question was argued out with some energy on the floor of the shoeroom before langrish could proceed nature was dressed in her most pristine colours and the incandescent hues of the autumn leaves brought cries of enjoyment out of the mouths of the phcc except the paupers whose mouths were too full for utterance this paragraph was not likely to pass unchallenged coxhead impeached its grammar trimble its taste and the paupers its accuracy and a very heated argument ensued at the end of which it was agreed to let the door stand open a few minutes to get rid of the dust arrived at camp hill a flock of jibbering apes were discovered headed by the presidents archenemy brown iii no hes not my enemy protested i i never said so the minutes say so theyre more likely to be right than you but i like dicky brown said i that sounds like poetry said warminster ho ho i like dicky brown his cheek is so cool and if i dont kick him you call me a fool i can do that whether you kick him or not said i quite unmoved by this brilliant impromptu here i was compelled to vacate the chair for a few moments in order to discuss the matter further with warminster on order being restored the minutes proceeded the philosophers soon made it too hot for these mules and they were only allowed to stay on the ground as it amused us to see their idiotic sniggers the paper on beauty was rot and invoked welldeserved hisses say that again ejaculated the outraged trimble that there you are said langrish hurriedly but trimble had more to say on the subject and once again the meeting became warm and dusty order please lets hear the rest said i when both had been brushed down by their friends as for sarahs speech in reply it was the drivellingest balderdash you ever heard it made the club blush that speaks well for it i suggested mildly the meeting did not seem to know how exactly to take this but concluded it was meant to be complimentary and contented themselves with ordering me to shut up if i didnt want to be kicked out tempest loud cheers turned up presently and backed us up cheers the baboons werent in it in the sports we pulled off the tug of war on our heads cheers and their speeches were even drivellinger than trims and sarahs interruption just at the end a howling sneak and cad and outsider called jarman came and lagged us all including tempest groans our president behaved like a muttonhead throughout going home the philosophers led by several miles the meeting then adjourned for extra drill in the gym today and mean to pay jarman out cheers the patriotic sentiment with which the minutes concluded did away with any little difference arising earner is the evening and they were carried unanimously it was then moved seconded thirded fourthed and fifthed that jarman be and is hereby hung and ought to be kicked it was further agreed that tempest be elected an honorary philosopher and be let off entrance fee also that the town cads are about the biggest outsiders going also that trimble be requested to wash his face this last was not carried without some opposition trimbles amendment that you be hung being lost only by a narrow minority finally it was resolved unanimously that the philosophers conversation club make it hot all round for any one who doesnt want to kick jarman or back up tempest with which highly satisfactory piece of business accomplished we adjourned to our own studies and finally to bed chapter fifteen explosive material it was plain to be seen that tempest although he had borne his humiliating penalty like a man had been badly bruised by it not that he broke out into any wild rebellion or tried to make for himself a party to avenge his wrongs but he seemed to have either lost interest in his work as house captain or to enjoy disturbing the sensibilities of his friends by a reckless indifference to its affairs the story of his extra drill had become public property in low heath most of the fellows sympathised with him but could not understand why he had not appealed to the head master a few a very few suggested that he had come badly out of the business but no one particularly cared to discuss the matter with him to pridgin and wales he insisted that it was no use referring to dr england the head was bound to support his policeman why not get redwood to take it up suggested pridgin redwood he wouldnt go a yard out of his way what does it matter to hima day boy no old chap we can take care of ourselves therell be a return match one day it concerned me to hear my old friend talk like this still more to notice how he began to lose grip in sharpes house no news flies so fast in a school as that of a responsible head boy being slack or out of collar and when once it is known and admitted it takes a good deal to keep the house from going slack and out of collar too in our particular department the relaxing of authority was specially apparent it destroyed some of the interest in our philosophical extravagances for the dread of coming across the powers that be lends a certain flavour to the routine of a junior boy it also tended to substitute horseplay and rowdyism for mere fungreatly to the detriment of our selfrespect and enjoyment on the whole then sharpes house had a heavier grudge against mr jarman than it suspected the worst of the whole business was that tempest himself seemed not to see the effect of his attitude on the house at large he did not realise how much the juniors were impressed by what he said and how he looked or how much his example counted with others of a less imitative turn he looked upon his grievance as his own affair and failed to give himself credit for all the influence he really possessed one curious result of the upset was that crofter was now and then to be found in his fellowseniors rooms he had blossomed out as an ardent antijarmanite and belonged to the party who not only vowed revenge but was impatient at delay tempests wrongs he seemed to feel as keenly as if they had been his own and the insults put upon sharpes house he took to heart as warmly as any one tempest could hardly help tolerating this effusivelyoffered sympathy although he made no profession of liking it and continued to warn me against having more to do than i could help with crofter pridgin was even less cordial but his laziness prevented his taking any active steps to cut the connection wales on the other hand though tempests chum took more kindly to the newcomer and amused himself now and again by defending him against his detractors the wonder to me is said crofter jarman has not caught it before now were not the only house hes insulted although i dont think hes tried it on with any of the others as he has with us some day hell find hes sailing a little too near the wind said tempest with a pleasant confusion of metaphors and then hell get bowled out upon my word though said wales i think weve a right to get that extra drill of yours wiped out it stands against you on the register and its a scandal to the house they seem to think it so observed pridgin as just then a loud chorus of warwhoops came up from the region of the faggery somebody had better stop that row jarman had better come and do it said tempest laughing hes got charge of the morals of sharpes house now when in due time i returned somewhat depressed by what i had overheard to the faggery i discovered that the particular occasion of the triumphal shout referred to had been a proposal by langrish to celebrate the approaching fifth of november by hanging and if possible burning mr jarman in effigy for which purpose an overcoat of mine had already been impounded i had the greatest difficulty in rescuing it from the hands of the marauders who represented to me that it was my duty to sacrifice something for the public good why dont you let them have your coat then i asked because was the insinuating reply it wouldnt burn as well you wont have mine i insisted but i tell you what ive got an old hat and pair of boots ii dont often wearyou can have them a shout of laughter greeted this ingenuous offerbut it saved my top coat and when in time my flattopped pothat and tan boots were produced there was general rejoicing each philosopher present tried them on in turn and finally i was compelled to wear them as well as my topcoat for the rest of the evening and assist in a fulldress rehearsal of the proposed hanging of the discipline master in which greatly to my inconvenience i was made to personate mr jarman the following day i was enjoying a little hardearned solitude and amusing myself by leaning over the bridge and watching the boats below when a voice at my side startled me ah my polite letterwriter is that you the very chap i want it was crofter my instinct at first especially on the sly reference to my letter of apology was to fly on second thoughts it seemed to me wiser to remain crofter and tempest were on better terms now it would be best to be civil what is it i asked can you steer a boat a little said i does that mean you can run it into the bank every few yards oh no ive often steered tempest and pridgin come along then im going to have a spin up to middleweir if there was one thing i enjoyed it was steering a boat and i was not long in accepting the invitation crofter was not conferring a favour on me only making a convenience of me so that i was not in any way making up to him our relations were that of senior and fag only and tempests and pridgins warnings to beware when he was particularly friendly even if it had not already been cancelled by the fact that they now frequently had crofter in their rooms could hardly apply now for all that i did not feel quite comfortable and was glad on the whole that the embarkation did not take place under the eyes of my patrons for some time crofter sculled on in silence giving me directions now and again to keep in the stream or take the boat well out at the cornerswhich i considered superfluous presently however when we were clear of low heath he slacked off and began to talk i enjoyed that letter of yours said he did you write it all yourself yes said i feeling and looking very uncomfortable you and tempest must be quite old chums yes its very rough on him all this business yes isnt it said i somewhat won over by this admission the worst of it is it makes the house run down i expected we were going to do big things this term its not tempests fault if we dont said i of course not its jarmans every one knows that its rather a pity tempest takes it so meekly though fellows will think hes either afraid or doesnt care and neither would be true i should think not there was a pause during which crofter sculled on then he said tempest and i dont hit it somehow he doesnt like me does he wellno i dont fancy he does i admitted i dare say he advises you to fight shy of me and that sort of thing eh this was awkward but i could not well get out of it yes crofter laughed sweetly i wish hed let me be friends i hate to see a fellow coming to grief and not be allowed to give him a legup tempests not coming to grief said i well not perhaps that only its a pity hes adding to his other troubles by getting headoverears in debt i hear hes been going it pretty well in the shops you should give him a friendly tip this was a revelation to me i had gathered some time ago from what pridgin had said that there was some fear of it but i had hoped i had made a mistake who told you said i a good many people are talking about it including some of the shopmen its just one of those things that a fellow himself never dreams anybody knows about till its public property thats why i wish i were on good enough terms to give him the tip if hes owing anybody hell pay said i feeling a great sinking in my heart look out for that stake in the water there pull your left narrow shave that of course he means to pay what im afraid of is jarman or england or any of them getting to hear of it ever since sweeten last year got turned out of the headship of his house and afterwards expelled its seemed to me to be a risky thing for a fellow to run into debt these shopmen are such sneaks if they cant get their money from the fellow they send their bills in to the house master and sometimes to the head master and then its a precious awkward thing how are you getting on in your form i had not much spirit to tell him and if i had there was no time for just then the swish of a pair of sculls came round the corner behind us and presently a boat at almost racing speed appeared in sight pull your right said crofter hallo its one of our fellows looks like tempest himself i wished myself at the bottom of the river then what would he think of me if he saw me and if he knew what i had been listening to in my perturbation i overpulled my line and sent our boat into the bank tempest who evidently was relieving himself with a spin of hard exercise after his fashion and imagined he had the river to himself was bearing down straight upon us hallo there keep her out shouted crofter tempest looked round in a startled way and held water hard to avoid a collision then as he suddenly took in who we were his face lengthened and he came to a halt alongside you there jones iv yes would you like me to come and steer you said i considering the difficulty into which i had just landed my present boat it was difficult to natter myself any one would exactly compete for my services but tempest answered shortly come along hullo i say said crofter suavely but with a flush on his cheeks hes steering me tempest hes doing no good hes stuck you in the bank already come along jones i havent done with him yet said crofter flushing still more deeply as his voice became sweeter i want him to stay with me and i dont want him to stay with you blurted out tempest losing his temper ive told him so already he can do as he likes though and he began to dip his sculls again in the water no said i i want to come in your boat tempest come along then and he backed his stern up towards me crofter made no further protest but greeted my desertion with a mellifluous laugh which made me more uncomfortable than a storm of objurgations tempest said nothing but dug his blades viciously in the water and spun away with grim face and clenched teeth for a quarter of a mile he sculled on before he lay on his oars and exclaimed you young fool why pleaded i i didnt think youd mind hes been friendly enough to you lately bah what do i care what he is to me i told you to fight shy of the fellow and there you go and give yourself away to him i did not quite like this tempest spoke to me as if i had not a soul of my own and had no right to do anything without his leave he was speaking quite kindly about you persisted i tempest checked the contemptuous exclamation which came to his lips and said more earnestly than i had heard him yet look here jones that fellows a cad and hell make a cad of you if you let him dont believe a word he says to you unless he calls you a fool i hope what hes been saying today will turn out to be lies said i oracularly to my disappointment tempest evinced no curiosity as to my meaning and relapsed into gloomy silence for the rest of the voyage for the first time in my life i felt out of humour with my old dux he had no right to treat me like a baby or dictate to me whom i was to know and whom i was not to know in low heath no doubt he thought he was doing me a good turn and honestly thought ill of crofter but it did not follow he was not doing him an injustice and demanding that i should join in it at any rate i felt heartily miserable and wished i had never put foot outside the faggery that day about a mile from home tempest got out on the towingpath and said he would trot to the school while i paddled the boat home it was some relief to be left alone a relief however which was considerably tempered by the fear of meeting crofter and having to explain matters to him that difficulty fortunately did not occur and i got back to the bosom of the philosophers without further adventure in their sweet society i gradually recovered my spirits their enthusiasm for tempest was still unabated and their avowed contempt for his enemies all the world over was refreshing a nights reflection further repaired my loyalty after all thought i tempest meant well by me and was willing to make an enemy for my sake he might be wrong of course but suppose he was right the result of all these inward musings was that i offered trimble to do tempests fagging in his place next morning he seemed half to expect me and the old friendly look was back in his face as he saw me enter im sorry i offended you yesterday tempest said i i fancied it was i offended you said he but i couldnt stand seeing you in that cads clutches is he really a cad then i asked you dont suppose i asked you into my boat for fun do you said he shortly i went on for some time with my work and then said would you like to know what he was saying about you not a bit said he so decisively that i relapsed again into silence look here kid said he presently and with unwonted seriousness im not a saint and dont profess to be and i may not be able to manage my own affairs to judge by what you and half a dozen other of the fellows seem to think but i dont want to see youwell come to griefand thats what youre likely to do if you let that fellow get hold of you hes not got hold of me said i feeling a little hurt once more maynt i be civil to a fellow even why he was saying if you shut up didnt i tell you i dont want to hear said he oh all right if he had only vouchsafed to tell me why he disliked crofter or if he had given his counsel in a less authoritative way it would have been different he would not even let me repeat the friendly remarks crofter had made about him and was determined neither to say a good word for the fellow himself nor let me say one the consequence was that our interview ended in my wishing once more i had confined myself to my own quarters and let ill alone my companions were not long in discovering that something was on my mind and in their gentle way tried to cheer me up whats the rowearache demanded trimble hes blue because hes not had lines today suggested langrish perhaps his washerwoman has sent in her bill said coxhead youll get kicked out of here if you look so jolly blue said warminster its stale enough this term without having a chap with a face like a boiled fish gaping at you look here said i resolved to be candid as far as i dare im in a jolly mess never knew you out of it whats up said langrish really though no larks said i tempests down on me because i went out with crofter and crofters down on me because i cut him for tempest thats enough to give a chap blues isnt it there seems to be a run on sarah said trimble anybody got a halfpenny what for i inquired as the requisite coin was planked down on the table heads tempest tails crofter said langrish it was heads and i was solemnly ordered to adhere to crofter well square it with tempest said they hell probably keep his shutters up for a day or two but hell soon get over it but said i i mean to stick to tempest as well the fact is from what i hearlittle i realised the fatal error i was makinghes in rather a bad way himself how well dont tell but hes owing a lot in the shops and if he cant pay hell get shown up there was a whistle of dismay at this sweetens fate was still fresh in the memory of some of the faggery well have to give him a legup was the general verdict oh dont let out i told you said i beginning to get alarmed at the interest my revelation had evoked whos going to say a word about you we can back up the cock of our own house i suppose without asking your precious leave you go and black crofters boots well see old tempest through this was not at all what i wanted i had at least hoped to be recognised as tempests leading champion in this company whereas here was i coolly shunted my revelation coolly appropriated and my services unceremoniously dispensed with i did not like it at all this dodge about stringing up jarmans guy said trimble ought to help our man a bit itll show were taking the matter up by the way sarahs not heard the latestwere going to blow him up as well as hang him and they proceeded to explain that the guy was to be filled chockfull of fireworks and gunpowder and his tongue to be made of touchpaper altogether he was to be a most dangerous and explosive effigy and i as president of the philosophical conversation club was naturally selected to take charge of him i pleaded hard for a subcommittee to assist me but they would not hear of it itll only be a day or two said they to the fifth of november well have his stuffing all in tomorrowtheres almost enough fireworks left over from the picnic to load him then you can stow him away quiet somewhere till the day couldnt you stick him under your bed oh no he might go off you know said i or some one might see him besides hell be too stout to go under botherwhere can he go then i vote we stick him in the lumber room under the gymnasium nobody ever goes there and you can get into it any time by the area outside said coxhead this was voted an excellent idea at any rate if he was discovered or did go off there the gymnasium was far enough away from sharpes so with much rejoicing the guy was duly loaded with his explosive internals and clad in an old derelict overcoat of some late senior my famous hat adorned his hideous head and my unappreciated tan boots lent distinction to his somewhat incoherent legs a train of touchpaper connected with a roman candle was cunningly devised to protrude in the form of a tongue from his mouth while gingerbeer bottles filled with gunpowder served as hands and the whole work of art was one dark evening conveyed by me tenderly and deposited among a wilderness of broken forms empty hampers and old bottles in the lumber room under the school gymnasium to be called for in a few days time chapter sixteen gunpowder treason one result of my boating excursion was that crofter ceased to frequent his fellowseniors studies there was no declaration of war or indeed any formal breaking off of relations but crofter had sense enough of his own dignity to feel that he had been slighted by tempest and tempest and his friends had no inclination to heal the trouble or assume an attitude of friendliness they did not feel as for me i found it very hard to steer an even course between the competing parties crofter nodded and spoke to me just as usual and was evidently amused by my panic lest these pacific overtures should be observed or misconstrued by tempest tempest on the other hand did not refer again to the subject but took a little more pains than before to look after me and help me in my work and an evening or two later much to my surprise when i went as usual to tidy up in pridgins room while tempest was there too my lord and master said abruptly let my things alone kid tempest appreciates a mess in his place more than i do so ive swopped you for trimble what said i in tones of mingled amazement and pleasure am i youre to go and fetch my blazer said tempest that i left on the parallel bars in the gymnasium this afternoon look alive or i shall stick to trimble i really began to think there must be something unusually desirable about me that fellows should be so anxious to possess me the philosophers had with one accord sought me for president pridgin had wanted me crofter had wanted me even redwood had wanted me and now here was old tempest putting in his claim he should have mei would not be so selfish as to deprive him of the coveted privilege in a somewhat tilted condition i went off on my errand not even delaying to announce the great news to my fellowphilosophers it was a dark evening and the gymnasium was some way off but i knew the way by this time i had daily walked past the area door and glanced down at the dangerous guy where it lay with its lolling tongue under the grating to assure myself of its welfare it was all right up till now and in two days it would be off my hands the square was empty as i crossed it and to my satisfaction i found the gymnasium door unlocked i groped my way to the corner where the parallel bars stood and there found the blazer which i carried off in triumph as i emerged from the door and came down the steps i became aware of two points of light in front of me and a voice out of the darkness which caused me to jump almost out of my skin who is that it was mr jarmans voiceand i could just discern his shadowy form accompanied by that of mr selkirk standing before me the two masters were evidently taking an afterdinner turn with their cigars and had heard my footsteps jones iv sir i came to fetch tempests blazer who gave you leave tempest sir take the blazer back where you found it and tell tempest if he leaves his things in the gymnasium he must fetch them at proper hours this is the third time i have had to speak to you jones iv you must attend an extra drill tomorrow and learn fifty lines by heart this constant irregularity must be stopped so saying he took his companions arm and strolled off i returned dismally into the dark gymnasium and flung the blazer on to the nearest seat and then hurried back to report the result of my mission to tempest as i guessed our poor guy downstairs was likely to be nowhere in the explosion which this last insult called forth with clenched teeth tempest sprang from his seat and snatched his cap its awfully dark said i if youre going youd better take some matches fetch me some said he with a harsh dry voice i fled off and returned with a box of fusees which the philosophers had laid in for the approaching celebration of guy fawkes day tempest snatched them from my hand and strode off i wished he had let me go with him i heard his footsteps swing heavily across the quadrangle as if challenging the notice of the enemy whether the enemy heard or answered the challenge i could not say the steps died away into silence and i listened in vain for further sign presently i returned to the faggery where the philosophers were just preparing to obey the summons to bed hurriedly i recited the event of the evening and for once was honoured with their rapt and excited attention my eye what a shame we cant go out and see the fun cried langrish i hope he makes jelly of him said trimble im jolly glad im his fag this brought on a crisis i had rather feared youre not said i pridgin has swopped me for you what screamed trimble taking a running kick at my shins i didnt do it shut up trim thats my leg youre kicking it was pridgin go and kick him said i but trim was in no mood to listen to reason i always said you were a sneak snarled he now i know it come and kick the beast you fellows its all a low dodge kick him i say the company showed every disposition to respond to the appeal look here said i its not my faultbut if you kick me ill tell him about your precious guy and you can look after him yourself i shant there this rather fetched them as custodian of that illicit effigy i had my uses and they hardly cared to dispense with me so trimble was ordered not to make an ass of himself and the discussion went back to tempest and his blazer i tell you what said warminster i vote we hang about a bit and cheer him when he comes in theres no one to lag us for not going to bed and we may as well stay and back him up with which patriotic resolve we resumed our seats and occupied the interval with auditing the accounts of the cluba painful and tedious operation which gave rise to much dispute and recrimination particularly when it was discovered that on paper we were shillings to the good whereas in the treasurers pocket we were shillings to the bad the treasurer had a bad quarter of an hour of it till it was discovered that the auditors had accidentally forgotten to carry the total of one column to the top of the next an oversight which nearly brought about the dissolution of the club so fierce was the storm which raged over it more than half an hour was spent over these proceedings and we began to wonder why tempest had not come back it was certain he must have been stopped by somebody or he would have been back in ten minutes had he and jarman had an encounter was mr jarman at that moment begging for quarter or was our man answering for his riot to the head master half an hour passed threequarters an hour then just as we were giving him up hurried footsteps came across the quadrangle and tempest with pale face and disordered guise carrying his blazer on his arm entered and passed rapidly to his room his countenance was too forbidding for us to venture on our promised cheer something unusual had happened how we longed to know what it was i was thrust forward to follow him to his study on the chance of ascertaining and was on the point of obeying when a terrific sound broke the silence of the night and sent us back with white rigid faces in a heap into the faggery the sound proceeded from the direction of the gymnasiumfirst of all a dull spasmodic thunder then a fierce burst followed almost immediately by two tremendous reports which shook us to the soles of our boots it reminded me of that fearful night at dangerfield when tempest i clung on to langrish who was next to me in mute despair and langrish in turn embraced trimble those gasped the voice of coxhead were thegingerbeerbottles whatshallwedo cut to bed sharp said the resolute though quavering voice of warminster and lie low there wont be much of him left whispered trimble thats one good thing as we huddled off our clothes in the dark in the dormitory it was a gleam of comfort certainly effigies of that kind when they do go off leave few marks of identity behind them who let it off i ventured to ask no one knew about it except us look out theres somebody coming it was mr sharpe who looked in candle in hand to see if any one had been disturbed by the noise but every one was sleeping peacefully blissfully unconscious that anything had happened narrow shave that said langrish when the master had retired i say said trimble i wonder if tempest here he pulled up but a muffled whistle of dismay took up his meaning if he did he must have found it out by himself i never said a word to him said i you were bound to make a mess of it said coxhead why ever couldnt you stick the thing where nobody could find it so i did it was leaning up against the cellar wall no one could possibly get at it why not the area doors open no it aint i locked it and hid the key said i triumphantly for fear of accident under the scraper good old sarahthats lucky but what about the grating in the gymnasium floor couldnt you twig it through that not unless you were looking for it and if you could you couldnt get at it well said trimble rather brutally i hope its all right for your sake fellows who keep guys must take the consequences it would have been much safer if youd kept it under your bed you may keep the next growled i ive done with it considering the probable condition of the luckless effigy at that moment nobody was inclined to contradict me and the philosophers relapsed into gloomy silence and eventually fell asleep i was probably the last to reach that blissful stage for hours i lay awake a prey to the most dismal reflections to do myself justice my own peril afflicted me at the timeperhaps because i did not realise itless than tempests whether he had blown up the guy or not things would be sure to look black against him and my recollection of the episode of hectors death told me he would come out of it badly how if he had done it he had contrived to get at the explosives i could not fathom i was sure even with his grudge against jarman he was not the sort of fellow to take a revenge that was either mean or dastardly and yetand yetand yet when with one accord we woke next morning it needed no special intimation to be aware that something had happened at low heath masters and school attendants were talking in groups in the quadrangle boys were flitting across in the direction of the gymnasium and seniors in twos and threes were deferring their morning dip and hovering about in serious confabulation something up said trimble with illconcealed artlessness i wonder what it is looks like a row of some sort said langrish what are all the chaps going across to the gym for i wonder lets go and see said coxhead we neednt all go together said warminster significantly so one by one casually and at studied distances from our comrades the philosophers dropped into the crowd and made for the scene of last nights accident i felt terribly nervous suppose some one had been killed or suppose the gymnasium had been burnt and suspicion fell on any one what a fix it would be in my distress i met dicky brown full of news hullo jones i say have you heard some chaps been trying to blow up the gym in the night and theres a row and a half on the front door is smashed and the floor all knocked to bits come and have a look any one killed or hurt ive not heard didnt you hear the noise yes our chaps heard a row in the night we could hear it at our place said brown they say the chaps known who did it too who how do i know some chap whos been extra drilled most likely theres plenty of them suggested i well yes they say a lot of gunpowder had been stowed in the lumber room just under the door there do you see we had reached the scene of the tragedy and i was able to judge of the mischief which had been done the door was broken but whether by the explosion or ordinary violence it was hard to say the floor and grating over the lumber room were broken away and one or two windows were smashed that was all my first feeling was one of relief that the damage was so slight i had pictured the whole building a wreck and a row of mangled remains on stretchers all round compared with that our poor guy had really made a very slight disturbance of him i was thankful to be able to observe no trace except one tan boot and a fragment of a gingerbeer bottle in the area that indeed was bad enough but i argued the lumber room was full of old castoff shoes and bottles and these would probably be set down as fragments of the rubbish displaced by the explosion brown however and others to whom i spoke failed to share my view of the slightness of the damage if the fellows found it will be a case of the police court for him the blood left my face as i heard the awful words it had never occurred to me yet that the matter was one of more than school concern visions of penal servitude and a brokenhearted mother swam before my eyes oh why had i ever left the tranquil seclusion of fallowfield for this awful place as soon as possible i edged quietly out of the crowd and made my way dismally back to sharpes where i met not a few of our fellows all eager for news i was too sick to give them much information and sent them to inspect for themselves while i made my way dismally to tempests room he was up reading hullo youngster said he whats all the row about what was that noise in the quad last night were some of your lot fooling about with fireworks dont you know gasped i fairly taken aback with the question why some ones been trying to blow up the gymnasium what he exclaimed why i was there not long before the noise whos done it thats what nobody knows im afraid therell be a row about it any fool could tell that said tempest with troubled face i wish you hadnt been there said i they may think it was you let them said he with a laugh which was anything but merry i was longing to hear what had happened to him last night but he did not volunteer any information and i did not care to question him horribly uneasy i was about to seek the questionable consolations of my comrades when the school messenger entered with a long face master tempest the head master wants to see you at once all right said tempest he said i was to bring you if you want to carry me you may said tempest with a short laugh if not wait a moment and ill come jones tell pridgin i want to speak to himwait ill go to him the school messenger looked as if he felt it his duty to take the senior at his word had tempest been a smaller boy he might have done so as it was he repeated at once please sir tempest took no notice but went across the passage to his friends room when he reappeared in a minute or two pridgin was with him and without taking further notice of the messengers presence the two walked armin arm out of the house and across the quadrangle the news of the summons spread like wildfire the philosophers when in due time they mustered in the faggery after their inspection of the scene of the outrage were not slow in taking in the seriousness of the situation of course hes suspected its all your fault you ass for being such a muff and letting jarman catch you you cant do a thing without making a mess of it how could i help it i pleaded couldnt you have fetched his blazer for him without running into that cads way what i cant make out said langrish is how tempest knew about the guy and was able to let it off i dont believe he did said i im sure he didnt youd believe anything things like that dont go off by themselves do they i was bound to admit they did not but persisted in my belief that tempest had nothing to do with it but the logic of the philosophers was irresistible didnt we see him go over and come back and didnt it blow up the moment he got into the house said trimble and didnt he go over on purpose to have it out with jarman said coxhead and hadnt he got his blazer with him when he came backso he must have been in the gym said warminster who else was likely to do it said langrish i suppose youll try to make out jarman tried to blow himself up i never said so all i said was that im positive tempest never did it and all we say is that youre about as big an ass as you look and thats saving a good deal chimed in the philosophers how long the wrangle might have gone on i cannot say for just then the school messenger appeared on the scene once morethis time in quest of me young master jones iv youre to go to the head master at once what for said i feeling a cold shudder go down my spine ask a policeman replied the ribald official youve had a short time and a merry one my young gentleman but its over at last but i never sharps the word interrupted he youd better cut said the philosophers well give you a lift if we can it was poor consolation but such as it was i valued it never criminal walked to the gallows with as heavy a heart as i followed the school messenger across the quadrangle and past the fated gymnasium to the head masters study there i found four people waiting to see me tempest looking very sullen the head master looking very grave mr jarman looking very vicious and a policeman looking very cheerful chapter seventeen before the beak at the sight of the policeman i gave myself up for lost the sins and errors of my youth all rose in a hideous procession before me i recalled vividly the occasion when years ago i had borrowed dicky browns nicker without acknowledgment and lost it i recalled a dismal series of assaults and libels in my guardians office i recollected with horror once travelling on a halfticket two days after my twelfth birthday above all the vision of that illfavoured effigy under the grating rose gibbering and mocking me to my face and claiming me for penal servitude if not for the gallows itself how well i remember every detail of that scene as i entered the doctors study the bust of minerva looking askance at me from above the book case the quill in the doctors hand with its fringe all on end tempests necktie crooked and showing the collar stud above mr jarmans eye coldly fixed on me and the policeman helmet in hand standing with his large boots on the hearthrug the picture of content and prosperity jones said the doctor we have sent for you to tell us what you did at the gymnasium last night you were there i understand after dark i looked first at the doctor then at tempest i would have given worlds to be able to have two minutes conversation with him and ascertain what he wished me to say if indeed he wished me to say anything at all the memory of a similar dilemma at dangerfield only served to confuse me more and make it impossible to decide how i should act now while the presence of the policeman drove from my head any ideas that were ever there would tempest like me to say that i went there at his bidding and if not how could i explain the matter i wished i only knew what had been said already so that at least i might put my evidence on the right side yes sir said i i saw mr jarman there what were you doing there eh young master said the policeman this was an unexpected attack from the flank of the battle for which i was wholly unprepared i could have told the doctor or even mr jarman but to be questioned thus by a representative of the law was too much for my delicate nerves really it wasnt me said i i didnt do it and dont know who did i only went to get a blazer and left it there directly mr jarman told me to do so a blazer said the policeman with the air of a man who has made a discovery what sort of a thing is that a blazer was it alight here tempest laughed irreverently much to the displeasure of the policeman i was however thankful for the cue what said i dont you know what a blazer is anybody knows that its what you have in the fields come young gentleman said the officer whom tempests laugh had put on his dignity no prevaricating what were you doing with that there blazer what was i doing with it fetching it the policeman was evidently puzzled he wished he knew what a blazer was but in the present distinguished company did not like to show his ignorance that blazer must be produced said he itll be evidence i looked at tempest as the person best able to deal with the matter and said i left it in the gym mr jarman made me how long was that before the explosion was it alight when you left it the blazer oh no a blazer explained the head master blandly is a flannel jacket i dont see what use it can be as evidence i suppose said tempest jauntily who was evidently recovering his presence of mind he thought it was a lucifer match youll laugh on the wrong side of your face young gentleman said the policeman wrathfully this here matter will have to be gone into theres been a party injured and itll be a matter for the magistrate youll have to come along with me i tell you said tempest becoming grave once more ive had no more to do with it than you have and yet said mr jarman speaking for the first time the explosion took place immediately after you were there and when it was impossible for any one else to be there i say i know nothing at all about it said tempest shortly and i dont care what you think come tempest said dr england no good will be gained by losing temper it is very necessary to get to the bottom of this business especially as some one has been injured it seems almost impossible the explosion could have happened by accident at the same time knowing what i do of you i do not myself believe that you are the boy who would commit an outrage of this sort as the policeman intends to report the affair to the magistrate you had better go with him and let him investigate the matter dont do yourself injustice by losing your temper mr jarman your attendance will probably be necessary and jones had better go too although so far he has not thrown very much light on the matter constable if you will take my compliments to captain rymer and ask him when he can see us beg pardon sir said the constable evidently sore about the blazer the young gent must come along with me now thats my duty and i cant take no instructions contrary very well said the doctor stiffly we will go to captain rymer at once hadnt you better handcuff me said tempest who appeared to be seized with a wild desire to exasperate the man of the law the policeman glared as if he was disposed to take him at his word none of your imperence i can tell you my beauty said he i aint agoing to stand itstraight come stir yourself it is not necessary said the head master for you to come with us i give my word that we shall be at the police court immediately but i wish to avoid the public scandal of one of my boys going through the streets in charge i aint agoing to let him out of my sight said the ruffled constable i know his style tempest smiled provokingly id sooner walk sir said he if the policeman holds me on one side and mr jarman on the other silence sir said the doctor sternly while mr jarman raised his brows deprecatingly am i to come too said i yes i should like pridgin and some of the fellows to be there too sir said tempest they saw me just before and just after the explosion it does not seem necessary to have more boys said mr jarman not to you said tempest hotly the fewer you have the better but if you choose to accuse me i shant ask you whom to have to speak for me tempest said the head master you are only doing yourself harm by this jones go and fetch pridgin and any of the others he speaks of to the police court and kindly do not say a word of what has passed here how constable are you ready the school was fortunately all within doors at the time so that except to the few who chanced to be gazing from the windows the little procession headed by the doctor and mr jarman with the policeman and tempest bringing up the rear passed unobserved i was full of apprehensions whatever the result i knew tempest well enough to be sure that the effect on him would be bad and would call out in him all that spirit of insubordination and defiance which had before now threatened to wreck his career a strong sense of responsibility was all that had hitherto held it in check if that were now shatteredand how could it help being upset by this chargeit would break out badly and dangerously i was not long in speeding over to sharpes where i found pridgin just going over to class he heard the doctors message with a groan of weariness whats the use of my goingi cant tell them anything said he you can tell them tempest never did it said i if they dont believe him they wont me anyhow i am coming thereupon i was inspired to tell him the secret history of the effigy of mr jarman and my theory as to the cause of the explosion namely that tempest might have dropped a match through the grating not knowing on what it would fall and that in the natural perversity of things it had lit on the projecting tongue of the guy youd better make a clean breast of that guy said pridgin if you want to get tempest out of this mess youll probably get expelled or flogged but low heath can spare you better than it can tempest it strikes me youd better fetch down one or two of your lot to corroborate you it sounds too neat a story as it is whereupon i sought out langrish and trimble and had the satisfaction of making their hair stand on end for once at first they flatly refused to come and reminded me that as president of the conversation club the entire responsibility for the guy rested on me all serene said i only come and let them know how jarman brought it all on the more we go for him the better for our man they failed to see the force of my logic but curiosity and love of adventure induced them to venture into the lions den on our way moreover we captured dicky brown who to do him credit was only too eager to come with us and stand by his old dux contrary to our expectations when we arrived instead of finding a crowded court we were ushered into the magistrates parlour where to judge by appearances a comfortable little party was going on the captain a cheery old boy familiar to all low heathens for his presence on speech day sat at a table with his clerk beside him the doctor and mr jarman were also sitting down and tempest was standing restlessly near the window the lodgekeepers son with his head bound up for he was the victim of the explosion and i suppose the prosecutor was standing beside the policeman cap in hand on the mat at the sight of the three juniors the doctor frowned a little and mr jarman scowled what are these boys doing here said the former please sir we thought you wanted to hear how it went off said langrish so we do said the magistrate sit down my lads well hear what you have to say in time please sir said tempest may i speak to pridgin certainly my lad said the captain again so the two friends hastily conferred together in the window while we stared round with an awestruck and apparently disconcerting gaze at the gentlemen on the doormat who severally represented the majesty of the law and injured innocence now then said the magistrate presently let us hear what this is all about one of your boys doctor i see is charged with attempting to blow up part of the school gymnasium last night and injuring this poor fellow here who makes the charge by the way do you no said the doctor i understand mr jarman does which is mr jarman said the captain looking blandly round ah you well sir this is a serious charge to make let us hear what you have to say this is not a sworn examination but what you say will be taken down and the boy you accuse will have a right to ask any question now sir mr jarman thereupon with very bad grace for he felt that the magistrates tone was not cordial related how he was walking in the court at such and such an hour when he saw a boy attempting to enter the gymnasium that he stopped him and demanded his name that the boy pushed past him and entered the gymnasium upon which mr jarman turned the key on the outside in order to detain him there by way of punishment that the boy began to kick at the door and after half an hour broke it open and made his escape that the boy was tempest and that scarcely two minutes after he had left and just after mr jarman having stayed to examine the damage to the door had turned to go away the explosion occurred that he heard a cry from young sugden the lodgekeepers son who was passing at the time and was thrown violently forward against the railings cutting his head badly how do you know the boy was tempest asked the magistrate i recognised him in the dark said mr jarman in fact i expected him expected him yes he had sent his fag for a jacket just previously and i had sent the fag back why boys are not allowed to enter the gymnasium after dark is that a rule of the school it is my rule does it apply to senior boys as well as juniors asked tempest i am responsible for the gymnasium and that is not the question said the magistrate have you ever allowed senior boys in the gymnasium after dark i may have but i forbade tempest to enter last night what harm was there in his fetching his coat if it was not against rules it was against rules to go in when i told him not well well said captain rymer that is a matter that need not detain us have you any more questions mr tempest yes please sir you said you were expecting me mr jarman what made you do that i expected from my knowledge of your conduct that you would come and try and get the blazer when have i disobeyed you before you know as well as i do tempest yes but i dont said the magistrate answer the question mr jarman thereupon gave his version of the affair at camp hill bottom the offence being said the magistrate that the boys tempest among them were out on the afternoon of a holiday half an hour from the school with only a one quarter of an hour to get back you punished the boys i understand yes and tempest took his punishment with the rest yes i suppose it is a special indignity to a senior boy captain of his house to be paraded for extra drill with a lot of small boys eh dr england i should consider it so said the doctor i did not feel myself called upon to make any difference said mr jarman apparently not and on account of this affair you say you expected tempest would attempt to defy you last night mr jarman bit his lips and did not reply tempest resumed his questions with a coolness that surprised us you were smoking i think mr jarman what if i was nothing only i wanted the magistrate to know it and you locked me into the gymnasium for half an hour till i kicked myself out i say you had no right to do that what did you do while i was inside i walked up and down did you try to stop me when i got out no why asked tempest with a sneer that made us all contrast his broad shoulders with the masters slouch i decided to deal with the matter today how did you see what i had done to the door in the dark i saw by the light of a match you say it was two minutes after i left that the explosion took place and immediately after you left thats what i said and you were striking matches during the interval yes and yet you suggest that it was i who blew the place up i say it was suspicious knowing your frame of mind and the passion you were in at the time how could i blow up the place without explosives there must have been some there already he didnt know anything about that that was our affair wasnt it you chaps blurted out trimble rather chimed in all of us the sensation in the court at this announcement may be better imagined than described the magistrate put on his glasses and stared at us mr jarman looked startled the doctor looked bewildered you see it was this way said trimble who had been working himself up to the point all through the previous crossexamination we had wait a moment my boy said the magistrate but the witness was too eager to listen to the remark it was this way we had a guy belonging to the phcc you know and he was chockfull of fireworks we were keeping him for guy fawkes day you know you wouldnt have known he was jarman mr jarman i mean to look at him but he was and sarah being president offered to look after him it was too big to stick under the bed so so continued i i thought the safest place to stick him would be in the lumber room under the gym and i never thought any one would be dropping matches through the grating on his touchpaper tongue tempest didnt know anything about it and you see said langrish taking up the parable we meant to keep it dark and only the philosophers were in it he had on sarahs hat and boots and a topcoat we found somewhere about hed have never gone off of himself and he wouldnt have done any harm on the fifth when we should have hung and blown him up in the open tempest tempest broke in dicky brown putting in his oar isnt the kind of chap to do a thing like that on purpose and it must have been mr jarman blew him up by mistake with one of his matches or the end of a cigar or something it was a mulish thing of sarah to stick him there said trimble but he knows no better and thought it was all right so did we and pridgin says it was quite an accident sir and and if any ones to get in a row said i wed better because he was our guy and the mistake we made was letting his touchpaper tongue hang out so far hed have never blown up if it hadnt been for that here there was a general pause for breath and the magistrate who evidently had a sense of humour said and pray who is sarah my man thats what they call me when theyre fooling its not my real name really sir jones iv is my real name thats right said trimble hes only called sarah because he looks like it hes not more in it than the rest of us because he only had to take care of the guy because he was president were all sorry the tongue was made so long the magistrate did his best to look grave as he turned to mr jarman does this explanation help to clear up the mystery mr jarman bit his lips and said if it is as they say it may account for the explosion i certainly dropped several matches through the grating it is as we say isnt it you chaps said langrish we wouldnt tell a cram about it rather not chimed we very well then i dont see that i can do much good said the magistrate dr england will know better how to deal with the matter an accident is an accident after all and if i may give an opinion these boys have done quite properly in coming here and telling all about it little boys should not be allowed to play with explosives at the same time you must allow me to say mr jarman that it is unfortunate for a master to put himself in the position of being made the subject of an effigy as for tempest there is absolutely nothing against him unless according to the rules of the school it is an offence for a boy who is locked up in a dark room at night to do his best to get out it is a great pity the matter was brought to me at all but as it has been my advice is to let it rest where it is meanwhile this poor fellow who has been injured has some claim and i dare say this sovereign will help get him the necessary bandages and plaster for his forehead good morning dr england good morning mr jarman good day my lads let this be a lesson against touchpaper tongues so ended the famous affair of mr jarmans guy chapter eighteen going down stream if any one supposed that low heath had heard the last of mr jarmans guy they little knew mr jarman or tempest or the philosophers the ghost of that unhappy effigy was hardly likely to be laid by a simple magisterial decision mr jarman it was rumoured had a bad quarter of an hour with the doctor that evening and went about his ordinary work for the next few days with a scowl which boded no good to any one who chanced to cross him least of all to those of us who had contributed to his defeat tempest on the other hand took his victory coolly he talked it over with his chums and came to the conclusion that they were quits with the enemy and could afford to leave him alone but it was plain to see that he had suffered a jar which found expression in his reckless unconcern for the duties of his position as head of his house and an increased disinclination to make any exertion for the credit of a school which he considered had treated him ill what troubled me most was to notice that his spirits had flagged and that he was dropping slowly into the listless indifference which had made pridgin only a term ago shirk his responsibilities to the school towards us juniors he was utterly easygoing perhaps in token of his gratitude for the assistance we had rendered him at a critical time but chiefly i fear because he was slack to check anything which seemed to defy constituted authority or promised to give an uneasy time to the representatives of law and order to do us credit we availed ourselves of his licence to the uttermost sharpes rapidly became known as the rowdy house at low heath and we grew almost proud of the distinction mr sharpe an amiable bookworm made periodical mild expostulations which were always most deferentially received and most invariably neglected if any reader thinks as we flattered ourselves at the time that mr jarman was the cause of all this state of things let me tell him he is as stupid as we young fools then were its all very well to stand up for your rights but the way to do it is not by letting everything go wrong if poor old tempest had taken a bigger view of things he would have seen that the way to pay jarman out was by making sharpes house the crack house of low heath in spite of him but how hard it is to see just what the right thing is at the time so i do not propose to throw stones at anybody whatever the reader may do the philosophers of course duly entered a record of the transactions just related in their minutes the reading of which occupied the whole of one of the extraordinary general meetings of their club one could never say what line langrish would take up and i as president always had my qualms in calling upon him to read the minutes of the previous meeting on the present occasion our meeting was held one halfholiday late in the term in midstream on a barge which in the course of a scientific ramble we found in a forlorn condition about a mile above low heath it was empty and neither horse nor man nor boy was there to betoken that it had an owner being capacious though dirtyfor it was evidently in the habit of carrying coalit struck us generally that in the interests of philosophy we should explore it the result being satisfactory it was moved and seconded and carried that the club hereby hold an extraordinary meeting objection was taken to the proximity of our meetingplace to the bankin case some of the day louts should be fooling about as warminster explained thereupon with herculean efforts we shoved out the stern across stream the prow being still tethered and catching on to a stake we had the satisfaction not only of feeling ourselves in an unassailable position but of knowing that we were effectually blocking the river for any presumptuous wayfarer who wanted to go either up stream or down after exploring the bunks and lockers and hold of the unsavoury vessel trimble proposed that it would be best for the club to occupy seats on the floor of the barge where quite invisible to any one on shore or stream we could hold our meeting undisturbed in a few introductory remarks which were listened to with some impatience i explained that things had reached a critical state at low heath it was the duty of everybody to back up tempest and make it hot for jarman cries of why dont you whats the use of you we didnt intend to be interfered with by anybody and if coxhead didnt shut up shying bits of coal hed get one for himself derisive cheers from coxhead and more coal coxhead and i were both warm when a quarter of an hour later i resumed the chair and called upon our excellent secretary to read the minutes which he accordingly did owing to the asinine mulishness of sarah here an interruption occurred look here said i youve got to drop that langrish ive told you already im not going to stand it stand what being called sarah or an asinine mule i explained that i was particularly referring to sarah oh all serene said the secretary well start again owing to the asinine mulishness of sh and three between nothat wont do said i fiercely owing to the asinine mulishness of here the speaker pointed at me with his thumbof the asinine mule in the chair i was weak enough to let this pass and the applause with which it was received quite carried the secretary off his feet when he got on them again he resumed jarmans guy was mulled all through even trimble couldnt have made a bigger mess of it here trimble mildly interposed but langrish who had hooked one arm through a ring in the side of the vessel and had a firm grip with his feet up against a rib in front of him was inflexible a bigger mess of it he repeated when at last he was free to proceed it was stuck just under the grating of the gym and was neatly blown up by jarman at on november the cost of the fireworks was four andsix which the asinine mule as it was his fault is going to hand over to the club or know the reason why i said i would know the reason why whereupon a long socratic argument ensued do you mean to say it wasnt your fault demanded langrish i couldnt tell jarman would drop his cigar down but if youd tried you couldnt have stuck him in a better place thats what i thought what have you got to growl at you offered to put it in a safe place no i didnt i didnt want to have it at all but you did have it you cant deny that nobut hold on and you stuck it there under the grating well and if i did and thats how jarmans cigar got on to it yesbut and thats how it blew up wasnt it you havent the cheek to say that wasnt the way it blew up of course it was only therefore if you hadnt stuck it there it wouldnt have blown up you cant deny that i dont say that what i say therefore it was you who blew it up and its youve got to pay for the fireworks qed and if you dont shut up young sarah youll get your face washed i felt i was the victim of a very onesided argument but the popular verdict was so manifestly in favour of the secretary that i was constrained to allow the point to pass reason why resumed langrish there was a bit of a row and the doctor and some of the chaps were had up before the beak we got on all serene till a howling chimpanzee whose name is sarah there you are again said i ill pay you now what are you talking about i never mentioned youdid i you chaps rather not chimed in the philosophers assembled of course said langrish if whenever you hear of a howling chimpanzee you think youre being referred to we cant help it can we the cheers which greeted this unanswerable proposition convinced me i had given myself away for once howling chimpanzee whose names sarah put in his oar and spoilt the whole thing if it hadnt been for me protested i youd none of you have been there at all the magistrate proceeded langrish not heeding the interruption treated him with the contempt he deserved and gave him a caution which hell remember to the end of his days i dont remember it now i growled turn him out for interrupting shouted the secretary youd better not try snarled i preparing to contest my seat but langrish eager to continue went on the rest of us pulled tempest through easy if trim hadnt dropped his hs and here there was a real row trim rose majestic and outraged and hurled himself on the secretary and for a quarter of an hour at least any casual passerby glancing at the apparently empty barge in midstream would have come to the conclusion that it was swaying from side to side rather more violently than the force of the current seemed to warrant trimbles hs took a long time to avenge and by the time it was done most of us were pretty much the colour of the coaldust in which we had searched for them langrish was about to proceed with his luckless minutes when warminster who had happened to peep above board for the sake of fresh air exclaimed hullo were adrift instantly all hands were on board and we discovered that our gallant barge probably during the last argument had slipped her boathook at the stern and that the rope which held our prow had evidently been slipped for us by a couple of youths wearing the townboy ribbon whom we could descry at that moment strolling innocently up the towingpath apparently heedless of our existence the great lumbering barge was going down stream side on about halfway between either bank at the breakneck speed of a mile an hour we had lost our boathook and had nothing whatever to navigate our craft with worst of all at the end of the long reach coming to meet us we could see another barge towed by a horse which could certainly never pass up in safety we were in for it and had evidently nothing to do but peer with our grimy faces over the gunwale at our impending doom about a hundred yards off the men in charge of the opposition barge became aware of our presence and a hurried interchange of polite observations took place between the skipper at the helm and the driver on the towpath the result of which was that their towrope was cast off and hauled ashore and man and horse accompanied by a dangerouslooking dog advanced at a quick pace to meet us the rope was hurriedly gathered up in a coil and thrown across our bows and we were invited to hitch the loop at the end over the hook on our front thwart the horse was then put in motion and the downward career of our ark suffered an abrupt check as we found ourselves rudely lugged in towards the bank the situation was an awkward one for not only was the skipper of the opposition barge landed and awaiting us with an uncomplimentary eagerness on the bank but the driver whip in hand was standing beside him and the dog showing his teeth beside him kotched yer are we said the former with a deplorable profuseness of unnecessary verbiage as he jumped on board we thot as much lend me that there whip bill you tip em over tom ill make em jump escape was impossible our exits were in the hands of the enemy we made one feeble attempt to temporise were sorry said i in my capacity as spokesman we didnt know it was your boat really you knows it now said the proprietor over you go or ill elp yer what i was it a case of being pitched overboard we looked round desperately for hope but there was none we might by a concerted action have tackled one man but the other on the bank with the whip and the dog was a formidable second line to carry it needed all our philosophy to sustain us in the emergency come wake up shouted the man ere tike come whereupon to our terror the dog leapt up on to the barge and jumped yapping in our midst tother side if you please said the bargee as i prepared dismally to take my header on the near side wake im up tike i needed no waking up and giving myself up for lost bounded to the other side of the barge and made a floundering jump overboard luckily for us the low heathens could swim to a man and if all that we were in for was to swim round that hideous barge and get ashore we should have been easily out of it but we had yet to reckon with the man and the whip who in his turn made every preparation to reckon with us i was the first to taste his mettle he had me twice before i could get clear and i seem to feel it as i write one by one the luckless and dripping philosophers ran the gauntlet of that fatal debarkation which was by no means alleviated by the opprobrious hilarity of our two castigators and the delighted yappings of tike at last it was all over and dripping and smarting we collected our shattered forces a quarter of a mile down the towingpath and hastily agreed that as a meetingplace for philosophers a barge was not a desirable place it was further agreed that if we could catch the day boys who were the source of all our woes for if our barge had not been let adrift we could have sheered off in time we would do to them as we had been done by by good or ill luck we had scarcely arrived at this important decision when a defiant shout from a little hill among the trees close by apprised us that we were not the only occupants of the river bank and worse still that whoever the strangers were they must have been witnesses of our recent misfortunesa certainty which made us feel anything but friendly who are they said langrish suppose its those urbans said coxhead i heard they were going to excavate somewhere this way i vote we go and see said trimble who was evidently smarting not a little so we went and saw and it was even as coxhead had surmised for as we approached shouts of who got licked with a whip whats the price of beauty why dont you dry your clothes fell on our ears yahwe dare you to come down and have your noses pulled shouted we we dare you to come up and have your hair curled shouted they we accepted the invitation and stormed the hill the battle was short and sharp we were fifteen to ten and had a grievance i found myself engaged with dicky brown who though he did himself credit was hampered by a scathelful of stones which he fondly hoped might turn out to be fossils on his back i grieve to say i made mincemeat of dicky on this occasion in a few minutes the hill was ours and the enemy in full retreat we remained a short time to celebrate our victory and then adjourned to the school a little solaced in our spirits the days troubles however were not over for at the door of sharpes house reinforced by half a dozen recruits stalked the urbans thirsting for reprisals and longing to wipe out scores then ensued a notable battle we failed to dislodge the enemy by a forward attack and for some time it seemed as if our flank movements would be equally unsuccessful at length by a great effort we succeeded in cutting off a few of them from the main body and were applying ourselves to the task of annihilating the rest when tempest appeared on the scene he looked fagged and harassed and was evidently not much interested in our battle a row was now too common a thing in sharpes to be an event and he allowed it to proceed with complete unconcern just however as he was taming to enter the house mr jarman came up it was almost the first time we had met officially since our encounter in the magistrates room and as with one accord we ceased hostilities and stared at him one or two of the more audacious of our party indulged in a low hiss come in you fellows at once said tempest turning on his heel wait you boys said mr jarman taking out his pencil wait tempest but tempest did not wait nor did we but made a deliberate rush into our house and in less than a minute were safely stowed away in our several studies secure from all immediate arrest it was an act of open rebellion such as sharpes had not yet ventured on there was no excuse that any of us had not heard the order we had and had disobeyed it and in the present instance tempest had headed us what would be the consequence we were not destined to know till next morning when a notice appeared on the board stating that mr sharpes house having been reported for riotous conduct and disobedience to orders the head master would meet the boys in the hall at eleven oclock chapter nineteen halting between two opinions there was no mistaking the doctors meaning this time sharpes had had a long rope but had come to the end of it at last i would not for the world have confessed it at the time but i was half glad a crisis had come my conscience had smitten me more than once about my work i had fooled away the good chance with which i had entered low heath fellows far below me in scholarship had got ahead of me by force of steady plodding while i was wasting my time the good resolutions which i had brought up with me had one by one fallen overboard and i had been content enough to take my place among the rowdies without an effort i had counted all through on tempests backing up if he had been keen on the credit of the house i felt i could have been so too if he had been down on me for my neglect of work i felt i should have stuck to it as it was slackness reigned supreme tempest was slack because he was out of humour pridgin was slack because he was lazy wales was slack because he wanted to be in the fashion and all of us were slack because our betters set us the example it needs no little courage for a single boy to attempt to stem the drift of slackness in a school house a dull dogged boy like dicky brown might have done it but i could not afford to be peculiar and therefore succumbed against my judgment to the prevalent dry rot now that a crisis had come i hoped tempest might if not for his own sake for ours pull up and take his house in hand as he well could do if he chose a short conversation i overheard as i was fagging in his study that morning however was not encouraging whats it to be said wales a lecture or a row a row i hope said tempest wearily whats wrong old chap asked pridgin nothing out of curl thats all said tempest trying to assume a laugh youre not going to cave in to jarman at this time of day said wales are you do you think it likely said tempest i tell you what i dont like said pridgin presently thats the way crofters lately taken to do the virtuous thats not the worst of him said wales but hes been chumming up with jarman ive met them twice lately walking together i suppose hes got his eye on the headship of the house said tempest when i get kicked out look here old chap responded pridgin looking really anxious its not to come to that surely it would be intolerable to have him over us come what will you must stick to us all very well said tempest dismally thats englands affair more than mine if knuckling under to jarman is a condition im out of it and crofter is welcome to it this was all and it was bad enough when the summons to assemble in hall came i went there in a state of dejection feeling that the fates were all against me and that the new leaf i hoped for was several pages further on yet my fellowphilosophers i regret to say neither shared in nor appreciated my forebodings look at that ass sarah trying to look virtuous said trimble just like him when theres a row on im not trying to look virtuous said i im sick of all these rows though pity you arent sick when youre getting us into them instead of after you know youve been at the bottom of every row theres been on this term this sweeping statement was not calculated to allay my discomfort dont tell lies said i no more we are who got us into that mess at camp hill bottom sarah did who landed us in the row about jarmans guy old sarah who played the fool with that barge and got us all licked cad sarah who started the shindy last night thats fetched us all in here lout sarah whos going to be expelled howling sarah and wholl be a jolly good riddance of bad rubbish chimpanzee sarah there you are make what you like of it and dont talk to us this tirade took my breath away i knew it said more than it meant still it wasnt flattering and it taxed my affection sorely to sit quietly and hear it out but somehow today i was too anxious and worried to care much what anybody said fortunately the entrance of the doctor mr sharpe and mr jarman made further discussion for the time being unnecessaryand a gloomy silence fell over the assembly dr england was evidently worried secretly i believe he was bored by the whole affair and wished mr sharpe and his prefects could manage the affairs of their own house perhaps too the fact that mr jarman was once more the complainant had something to do with his lack of humour now boys said he this is an unusual and unpleasant interview and i heartily wish it were not necessary when a whole house is reported for rowdiness it shows im afraid that the sense of duty to the school is in a bad way this is not the first occasion this term on which this house has been reported but i have previously refrained from interfering in the hope that the good feeling of the boys themselves would assert itself and make any action of mine unnecessary i am sorry it has not been so as to the scrimmage in the quadrangle yesterday i am not disposed to make too much of that at any rate that weighs less with me than what i understand to have been a deliberate act of disobedience to the master who quite properly interfered to restore order disobedience i am sorry to say encouraged if not instigated by the head boy of the house i hope there may be some mistake about this will the boys who were engaged in the fight stand up the philosophers rose to a man with a promptitude which was almost aggressive bother it all why should we be backward in admitting that we had gone for those day boys and put them to bed for once i ask you boys to say whether you heard mr jarman tell you to wait till he spoke to you i did sir said langrish so did i said trimble we all did said i and why did you not obey tempest told us to come in so we did said i thats right sir said coxhead and the others assented very well said the doctor tempest i ask you to say whether you heard mr jarman tell the boys to wait yes sir and did you tell them in spite of that to come in yes sir why because im head of the house and im responsible for the order of my house i am glad to hear you think so said the doctor drily have you always been equally jealous for the order of your house this term tempest this was a facer as we all felt tempest flushed and glanced up at the head master no sir i have not he said the doctor was a chivalrous man and did not try to rub in a sore tempest had made a damaging admission against himself and might be left alone to his own sense of discomfort unluckily however mr jarman stood by and the matter could hardly be allowed to drop as regards the incident last night said the doctor you know quite well all of you that no boy even the head of his house has the right to set his authority against that of a master your conduct was an insult to him and requires an apology these small boys may have considered they were not doing wrong in obeying you tempest but you can plead no such ignorance i expect you to apologise to mr jarman a struggle evidently passed through tempests mind his conscience had been roused by what the doctor had said and his manner of saying it had the apology been demanded for any one else but mr jarman he could have given it and in one word have put himself on the side of duty but apologise to jarman if mr jarman wants me to tell a lie said he slowly ill say im sorry i cant apologise to him come tempest said the doctor evidently disconcerted at this threatened difficulty you must be aware of the consequences if you refuse to do this i know sir but i cant help it i cant apologise to mr jarman dead silence followed broken only by the hard breathing of the philosophers the doctor twirled the tassel of his cap restlessly mr sharpe looked straight before him through his glasses mr jarman stroked his moustache and smiled tempest stood pale and determined with his eyes on the floor i shall not prolong this scene said the doctor at last for the remaining week of this term the boys concerned in yesterdays disturbance are forbidden to appear in the playing fields you tempest will have a day to think over your determination come to me in my house this time tomorrow id sooner it were settled now said tempest respectfully and dismally i cannot apologise come to me this time tomorrow repeated the doctor as to the other boys of the house i want you to understand that you are all concerned in the wellbeing of your house if as i fear a spirit of insubordination is on foot and your own proper spirit and loyalty to the school is not enough to stamp it out i must use methods which i have never had to use yet in low heath it may need courage and self sacrifice in a boy to stand up against the prevailing tone but i trust there is some of that left even in this misguided house now dismiss it had been a memorable interview the doctor might have stormed and raged and done nothing as it was he had talked like a quiet gentleman and made us all thoroughly ashamed of ourselves and yet as we all of us felt everything now depended on tempest if he surrendered he might count on us to fall in line and make up to him for all he had sacrificed on our behalf if he held out and refused his chance we too refused ours and went out with him if only any one could have brought home to him how much depended on him yet who could blame him for finding it impossible to apologise to jarman who had persecuted him all the term with a petty rancour which so far from deserving apology had to thank tempests moderation that it did not receive much rougher treatment than it had he might go through the words of apology but it would be a farce and tempest was too honest to be a hypocrite there was unwonted quiet in sharpes house that afternoon fellows were too eagerly speculating as to the fate in store for them to venture on a riot the philosophers of course stoutly advocated a policy of no surrender but one or two of us i happened to know would have been unfeignedly glad to hear that tempest had squared matters with his pride and left himself free to take our reform in hand tempest himself preserved a glum silence until after afternoon chapel when he said to me isnt this one of redwoods evenings youngster ill go with you if youre going the redwoods had given me an open invitation to drop in any thursday evening to tea and bring a friend i had been several times with dicky and once in great triumph had taken tempest as my guest it had been a most successful experiment not only had tempest taken the two little girls and therefore their mother by storm but between him and redwood had sprung up an unexpected friendship born of mutual admiration and confidence since then he had once repeated the visit and tonight to my great satisfaction proposed to go again to me it was a miniature triumph to carry off the hero of sharpes from under the eyes of his house and on an occasion like the present to a destination of which he and i alone knew the secret i flattered myself that in spite of their mocking comments the philosophers were bursting with envy it is always a rare luxury to be envied by a philosopher and i think i duly appreciated my blessings and showed it in the swagger with which i marched my man under the faggery window tempest was depressingly gloomy as we walked along and my gentle reminder that we could not take the short cut across the playing fields after the doctors prohibition but should have to walk round did not tend to cheer him up i half feared he would propose to walk over in defiance of all consequences possibly if he had been alone he would have done so but on my account he made a grudging concession to law and order at the redwoods however he cheered up at once he received a royal welcome from the little girlsin marked contrast to miss mamies sulky reception of me as the destroyer of her nice sash redwood himself was delighted to see him and the family tea was quite a merry one when we adjourned to the captains den afterwards i was decidedly out of it indeed it was broadly hinted to me that the little girls downstairs were anxious for some one to teach them consequences would i mind considering there was no game i detested more than consequences and no young ladies less open to instruction than the misses redwood i did not jump at the offer it was evident however tempest and redwood wanted to talk and with a vague sense that by leaving them to do so i was somehow acting for the benefit of low heath i sacrificed myself and sat down to assist in the usual composite stories how for instance the square dr england met the mealyfaced sarah the little girls knew my nickname as well as the philosophers up a tree he said to her we must part for ever she that is i said to him my ma shall know of this the consequence was that there was a row and the world said its all up in present circumstances these occult narratives were full of serious meaning for me and my thoughts were far more with the two seniors above than with the two exacting female juniors below however the time passed and presently tempests come along youngster apprised me that the hour of release had come redwood walked back with us and from certain fragments of conversation which fell on my ears i was able to gather something of the result of the conference if it were only yourself you know said redwood id say stick out but said tempest he knows im not sorry even if i say so its a choice between humble pie and low heath losing you said the captain not much loss thats all you know theres not a fellow we could spare less they walked on in silence then redwood said england ought to see that jarman rots everything the way he goes on well be in a better position to get it altered if you cave in this once i vowed i wouldnt do it hell only chuckle said tempest with a groan let him who cares whether jarman chuckles or not retorted the captain look here old chap dont you think hed chuckle more if you got expelled that would be the biggest score you could give him take my advice and only give him the smallest i dont know ill think about it said tempest of course you will for the sake of low heath next term well go ahead and the fellows will owe you more than they think here by an odd chance just as we came to the school gate we met mr jarman and crofter walking out in deep confabulation i do not know if they saw us if they did they pretended not to have done so and walked on leaving us to proceed do you see that said tempest rather i know what it means too its an extra reason why you should swallow your pride for once in order to sell them i tell you they are probably counting on your sticking out and nothing would disappoint them more well old chap said tempest as we came to our door its not your fault if i dont do it i know youre right but but its a jolly bitter pill and i wish i could swallow it for you good night i had the sense for once to keep what i had heard to myself and retired to bed more hopeful that all would turn out right than i had been for a day or two the next morning i was wandering about aloof from my comrades in the quadrangle waiting for the bell to ring for first school when marple the town bookseller a tradesman familiar to most low heathens accosted me he was evidently not at home in the school precincts and with my usual modesty i felt he had come to the right source for information do you belong to mr sharpes house young gentleman said he with a respectful nod which quite captivated me yes who do you want i want to see mr tempest very particular oh hes up in his room wait a bit till the bell rings and hell come out so mr marple and i stopped and chatted about the holidays which were to begin in a day or two and the football matches and the river you know mr tempest pretty well said he rather im his fag you know a nice gentleman i fancy pretty well off eh oh no hes a swell but his people are poor i know oh indeed not likely to buy much in my way eh rather not hes hard up as it is its not much good your trying to sell him anything said i remembering the rumour about my friends indebtedness and anxious to screen him from further debt ah indeedhes in debt is heall round how do you know that said i bristling up i dont expect he owes you anything mr marple laughed thats just what he does thats why ive stepped over i dont like showing young gents up but look here cried i aghast for mercys sake dont show him up marple its as likely as not hes to be expelled as it is this would finish him up if hes likely to be expelled all the more reason i should get my money before he goes how much is it i gasped a matter of two pounds said the tradesman look here said i ill promise you shall be paid wait till the last day of the term do marple mr marple stared at me the security i fear was not good enough for him on the other hand he probably knew that it would not be good for trade if he were to show up a low heathen he took an envelope from his pocket and handed it to me it contained tempests bill for sundry stationery magazines books postage stamps and so on headed fourth and final application the envelope itself was addressed dr england with w marples respectful compliments the bell rang just then and i was so anxious to get marple off the scene that i wildly promised anything to be rid of him and was finally left just in time to meet tempest unconsciously strolling across the quadrangle on his way to keep his appointment with the doctor chapter twenty deepest depths we did not see tempest again till the afternoon as we most of us surmised he was relieving his feelings after his interview with the doctor by a spin on the river how i wondered had the interview gone had he agreed to the humiliating condition of apologising to mr jarman or had his pride been too much for him after all if so this was probably his last spin on the river had our house been selkirks there would no doubt have been wagers on the event as it was the philosophers contented themselves with bickering the general impression seemed to be that he had refused to surrender that being so the game was upthere was no object in keeping up appearances a spirit of defiance seemed to get hold of us we deliberately sat on the fence of the prohibited playing fields in the hope that mr jarman or some one would see us trimble even went to the length of crossing it at one corner what made it more trying was the conduct of the day boys who with an acuteness which did them credit seemed to have discovered our delicate situation and resolved to make the most of it they paraded the field about twenty yards from our fence jeering at us openly and daring us to set foot on the turf look at them said one hung up like a lot of washing on the palings well make them cut lets have a scientific meeting thatll clear them out whereupon the urbans ranged themselves on the grass under our noses and called upon mr flitwick to address them on the treatment of lunatics this was too much we were few in number and the palings were hard and uncomfortable but if they thought they were going to frighten us away by this demonstration they were mistaken langrish in a loud voice called out chair whereupon i taking the cue and assuming that the philosophers were in congress called upon mr trimble to favour us with his oration on mud oh all serene said trimble who till that moment had had as little notion of his subject as i had had mud is dirty lumps of stuff lying about on the grass like what you see in front of you it has neither brains nor sense its a vile thing to look at and worse to touch if you if you here broke in mr flitwick want to see what lunatics really are you should look on the palings of some of our school playing fields if you happen to see a row of squinneyeyed illdressed mules with large boots and turnup noses and afraid of their lives to move off where they are those are the prize lunatics i have pleasure in exhibiting a few choice specimens collected from various sources the one thing the one thing about mud is it darent come within reach of you continued trimble getting a little random in his statements for fear of getting one in the eye if you want a sample theres one shouted flitwick interrupting our orator with a fragment of mother earth in his face of course it was all up after that doctor or no doctor we couldnt sit by and see our treasurer assaulted so we hurled ourselves on the foe regardless of consequences and a deadly fight ensued some of the more cautious of our number were lucky enough to be able to drag their men off the prohibited field and engage them on the right side of the fence i was not so luckyindeed i was doubly unlucky for not only was my adversary my dear friend dicky brown whom i loved as a brother but he edged further and further afield as the combat went on so that at the last we were cut off from the main body and left to fight our duel conspicuously in the open dicky was not a scientific pugilist but he had an awkward way of closing in with you and getting you round the middle just at the moment that his left foot got round behind your right calf and it grieves me to say that although i boasted of far more talent in the exercise of the fistic art than he did he had me on my back on the grass just as mr sharpe of all persons walked by what are you two doing demanded the master stopping short fighting sir said the stalwart dicky and i licked him why are you fighting because flitwick shied mud at trimble said i the reason did not seem to appeal to mr sharpe who replied you heard the doctors orders yesterday jones iv about keeping off the playing field yes sir said i realising for the first time that i was well out in the middle of the field and that the rest of my comrades were looking on from a safe distance come to me after school for exemplary punishment you are the most disorderly boy in the house and it is evident a lenient punishment is no good in your case please sir said the loyal dicky i lugged him on a good part of the way no you didnt snarled itaking this as a taunt whereas it was intended as a legupi came of my own accord very well said mr sharpe you will come to me jones iv of my accordand he walked away i was reckless and defiant and deaf to dickys sympathy i dont care said i it was a good job for you he came up i should have licked you hollow no you wouldnt old chap i had you over twice said dicky come outside and finish it out so we adjourned to the other side of the palings and finished it out in the presence of the assembled urbans and philosophers and i grieve to say once more dicky had me on my back the wrath of my comrades was even more grievous to bear than the rejoicings of the enemy i was promptly withdrawn from the fray as a bad lot and had it not been for the opportune bell should probably have been kicked all round at any rate i went in disgusted with myself with low heath with everybody what was the use of keeping it up tempest ten to one was expelled dicky brown once my inferior could put me on my back the philosophers hated me mr sharpe had marked me down for exemplary punishment and publicly denounced me as the worst boy in the house and all this in a single term what i wondered would it be like if i remained at the end of a second term i looked dismally into tempests studyhe was not back pridgin was in but did not want me the faggery just now was impossible i never felt more lonely and miserable in my life i was wandering down the passage with my jacket flung over my shoulder and my shirt sleeves still tucked up when the voice of crofter stopped me look here said he the contents of your pocket may be interesting to you but we dont want them littered about the passage here catch hold and he held out a handful of loose letters why whats the matter how blue you look has any one been hurting you rather not ive been licking a young cad thats all well you dont look as if you enjoyed it anyhow has tempest come back noprobably hes expelled said i determined to have things as miserable as possible i sincerely hope not said crofter in a tone which quite softened me to him he doesnt like me but id be sorry if he left all the same he thinks you and jarman would like to see him kicked out thats the one reason why he might stay on crofter laughed sweetly what a notion why ive had a good mind to go to england myself and stick up for him its a good job you havent said i what im afraid is that he is worried about other things i hope by the way you never said anything about what i told you the other day no said i not quite candidly for i had tried to tell tempest but he would not let me thats right i hope hes cleared his debts off by now ii dont think he has stammered i really its a pity the doctor would be much more likely to be down on him for being in debt than he pulled up suddenly as tempest at that moment walked up he must have heard the last few words and if it required looks of guilt and confusion on my part to convince him we had been speaking of him i think i gave him proof positive he had apparently intended to summon me to his study but as he saw with whom i was conferring and overheard the subject of our conversation he thought better of it and with lowering face stalked away i wished i was dead then something told me i had lost my friend and that no amount of explanation could do away with the barrier which had suddenly been erected between us awkward said crofter its a good job we were talking no harm of him he wont fancy our talking about him at all said i i suppose weve as much right to talk about him as any one else hell be awfully down on me i know said i miserably all i can say is if he is youre a young fool if you care two straws tempests a good fellow but hes rather a way of not allowing a fellow to have a soul of his own this failed to console me i made one effort to see tempest and explain but he was occupied with his books and did not even deign to notice my presence in his study later on in the evening all speculation as to the result of the mornings interview was set at rest an unusual summons came to sharpes to meet the doctor in our hall we assembled uncomfortably and with sore spirits the worry of the whole business was telling on us and we heartily hoped while we clamoured for no surrender in words that tempest would disappoint us for once the doctor came presently looking very grave and accompanied by mr jarman from the head masters face we concluded at once that all was up but to our surprise he said i am glad to say in reference to the matter i met you boys about yesterday that tempest has taken a proper sense of his duty and has undertaken to apologise for his conduct to mr jarman that being so tempest you will please take this opportunity of expressing your regret tempest flushed as he rose in obedience to the doctors summons it was evidently as redwood had said a bitter pill and had he been a less brave fellow he could hardly have swallowed it as it was even the knowledge that the welfare of the entire house was somehow dependent on his submission was scarcely able to break down his pride he advanced to mr jarman more like one who comes to administer a thrashing than ask for pardon and after eyeing him almost fiercely for a moment summoned his selfcontrol sufficiently to say hoarsely i apologise sir mr jarman bit his lips it was not the triumph he had expected indeed the whole manner of it was such as to hurt instead of soothe his feelings this is hardly an apology said he to the doctor i trust tempest it means that you regret your action it was an awkward question tempest had gone further than any one expected and his silence now reminded the doctor what the cost had been i think said he not waiting for a reply to his own question tempest has fulfilled his pledgednot cordially i am sorry to say but sufficiently very well sir said mr jarman i accept his apology for what it is worth which seems very little now i regret to say continued the head master producing a letter which made my heart jump to my mouth i have a more serious matter to speak about i wish heartily what we have just heard had been the end of this painful interview but it is necessary to refer to something differenta very serious offence against rules it concerns you tempest is it a fact that you are in debt to some of the tradesmen tempest changed colour again and replied yes sir i am sorry to say i am i held on tight to my desk this was a finishing touch surely and i if any one felt myself the criminal this letter addressed to me but containing a bill for more than two pounds owing by you part of it since last term has been left at my housei presume by the tradesman to whom it is due come here and look at it tempest tempest obeyed is it a fact that you are in debt to this extent yes sirmore you are aware here i could stand it no longer but sprang to my feet and shouted please sir its my fault everybody turned to me in amazement as well they might your fault jones ivcome forward and explain i mean said or rather shouted i speaking while i walked up the room its my fault you got that bill sir i dont know how you got it but it wasnt meant to get to you really i must have dropped it ii was goingto tryto get it paid for him sir really tempest gave me a glare that knocked all the spirit out of me what business had i it seemed to demand to meddle in his private affairs i felt i had done him a real bad turn by my clumsiness but had not the wit to avoid making bad worse yes sir i told marple i purposely refrained from mentioning names jones iv why can you not do so too i told him to keep it dark and got him to give it to me ii knew tempest hadnt enough money to pay itandand an exclamation of anger from tempest cut me short and i was sent ignominiously back to my place tempest said the head master very sternly send me in a list of all you owe before you go to bed tonight and understand that unless all is paid by friday when we break up you will not be allowed to return to low heath after the holidays you must cease in any case to retain the headship of the house even for the few days of the term that remain you i understand crofter come next in form order you will act as head boy in the meantime in the midst of my anguish i could see the look of meek resignation on crofters face and that of quiet satisfaction on mr jarmans at tempest i dared not look or at my fellowphilosophers what had i done what was to become of me how could i get out of it these were the three questions which set my poor brain spinning as i wandered off alone to the remotest corner of the quadrangle and as later on i lay miserably awake in my bed i had done my friend about as much harm as i possibly could i may not have meant it but who cares what a fellow means so long as he acts like a cad as to what was to become of me i had had a taste of that already the faggery door had been locked against me and a missive shoved under the bottom had apprised me of my fate in that quarter to beast sarah take notice that you are kicked out of the philosophers and if you dare show your abominable face within a mile of them youll get it all over with rulers it has been resolved by mr langrish and seconded by mr trimble and passed by all the lot that you be and are hereby kicked whenever any one sees you any one not kicking you will be lammed it is also resolved that the faggery be fumigated and disinfected during the holidays and that any chap seen talking to you be refused to be let in till he has been vaccinated you are about the lowest meanest vilest abominablest unmitigatedest sneak going three cheers for poor old tempest and down with girls schools and washerwomen this fiery document was formally signed by every philosopher in the house together with a particular word of opprobrium addressed to me by each of my former colleagues i was not long in realising that i was an outcast in sharpes no one would look at me still less speak to me pridgin ordered me off like a dog wales slammed his door in my face when i appeared in the preparation hall a long hiss saluted me even though mr sharpe was present even outside fellows seemed to have heard of my crime and looked askance or gave me a wide berth i can truly say that i found myself the most miserable boy in low heath and only longed for the end of the term to come that i might shake the dust of the hateful place from my feet and drop out of the sight of a school full of enemies indeed as i lay awake that night i had serious thoughts of making off there and then if i had only had my boots i think i might have done so but they were in the blackingroom and my desperation drew the line at walking off in my bare feet i was sitting up in bed half whimpering with headache and misery when a light appeared at the end of the dormitory it was crofter in his new capacity of head of the house taking his rounds before turning in the sight of him brought home to me the injury i had done not only to tempest but the whole house for it was my fault and mine only that crofter was at this moment captain of sharpes to my surprise and alarm when he came up to my bed he stopped short and drawing a letter from his pocket put it into my hand saying put that under your pillow till the morning it was more than nature could do to sleep with a mystery like this on the top of my misery i listened to the clock as it struck the hours through the night and thought the day would never come indeed the gettingup bell had sounded before the winter sun struggled in through the dormitory window then by the light of a candle i seized the missive from under my pillow and tore it open a fivepound note fell out and with it the following letter you have made a nice mess of it and ought to be happy the least you can do is to try to make things right for tempest call round on the following six tradesmen giving the six names one of which was marple early tomorrow and pay tempests bill at each and bring home the receipts you neednt mention who sent you send the receipts to me and if tempest asks any questions tell him you paid the money by request of a friend w crofter chapter twenty one i am advised to lie low my first impulse on reading crofters letter was to jump for joy it meant that tempest would stay at low heath and that i was to be allowed to assist in keeping him there but my second thoughts were more of a surprise than pleasure crofter was a mystery to me his fellowseniors disliked him and warned me against him but as far as i could see he was not as bad as they made him out and certainly never said anything as bad about them as they said about him what could be his object now if it was not a disinterested one he would be permanent captain of the house if tempest left and yet he was doing the very thing that would keep tempest at school tempest had openly insulted him during the term and yet here he was helping his enemy out of a very tight place i knew he was well off so probably he could afford the l but at the end of the term pocketmoney was not a plentiful commodity he said nothing about being paid back too surely he did not mean to make tempest a free gift of this magnificent amount the more i thought it over the more i felt crofter was a brick and had been scandalously misunderstood he seemed to me a true type of the virtuous man who when struck on one cheek turns the other and when robbed of his coat offers his cloak too i only hoped tempest might know what he owed him in short in the brief time it took me to dress i had worked myself up into a state of enthusiasm on the subject of crofter as to the mystery of mr marples letter having got into the doctors hands no doubt i had been careless and dropped the compromising envelope which some foolish but honest person it did not occur to me at the time it might have been crofter himself had picked up and dropped in the head masters letterbox supposing he was doing a very clever thing tempest would not be likely to allow me to explain which was hard on me and made it all the more virtuous on my part to assist now in putting things right for him luckily for him he had friends at low heath in spite of himself when i encountered crofter in the morning i requested him with a knowing look of intelligence to give me an exeat into the town to do some shopping it was probably the first recognition he had received of his temporary authority as head of the house and he made no difficulty in granting my request i made my way first of all to marples oh about that bill you gave me how much was it two pounds and sixpence young gentleman i said id see it paid for you didnt i you did i dont want to show up all right you neednt heres the money give me the change please and a receipt mr marple opened his eyes very wide at the sight of a fivepound note within three days of the end of term ii hope its all right said he hesitatingly you neednt have it if you dont want said i mounting my high horse im sure im much obliged to you young gentleman said the tradesman giving the note a professional twitch and proceeding to count out the change from his till i shall always be pleased to attend to any little orders from mr tempest or you you can make out the receipt to tempest said i i expect he wont get much more here dont say that im sure no offence was meant it was a delicious sensation to feel myself master of the situation like this i could have bullied marple if i had liked but i resolved not to be too hard on him im sure im much obliged said he for all your trouble have you seen these pretty little pencilsharpers they are quite new i shall be pleased if you will accept one young gentleman a pencilsharpener was the very thing i wanted all the term i had been wrestling with a blunt penknife which no sooner uncovered the lead at the end of a pencil than it broke it off so in a weak moment i accepted the gift and forfeited my advantage from marples i proceeded to the confectioners where a score of nearly a pound stood against tempest here again i experienced the sweets of being treated with distinguished consideration and being asked to partake of a strawberry ice how rammage by the way continued to have strawberry ices in the middle of december i have never yet clearly understood while the receipt was being made out mr winget the hatter rather disappointed me by offering me nothing more than his sincere thanks for the settlement of his little bill he might at least i thought have offered me a mourning hatband or a new school ribbon his bill however was only five shillings so probably the profit did not permit of any gratuitous allowance in recognition of my distinguished services i was consoled however by mr ringstead the games man who presented me with a netbag for holding tennis balls and urged me whenever i wanted any little thing in the way of repairs to bats or fresh spikes to my running shoes to let him know it was all very pleasant and i grieve to say that the shady side of all this petty bribery and corruption never once occurred to my simple mind i returned to school covered with selfsatisfaction and virtuously clutching in my hand halfacrown the final change out of the fiver this in due course i put in an envelope together with the batch of receipts and laid on crofters table after morning school with the laconic message under the flap all right tj iv i was far too knowing to let out my secret to the philosophers whose agitation and indignation at tempests probable expulsion knew no bounds and somewhat amused me look here sarah said langrish as i entered for the first time after my disgrace of the previous dayi knew my comrades well enough to be sure they would like to see mewe all know youre about the beastliest howlingest cad in low heath so thats all right im glad you think so yes and youve been told to clear out as its your fault tempests expelled is it thats all you know said i yes and youre kicked out of the philosophers and were going to invite dicky brown to join us hes a decent chap this was rather a blow i thought no townboys were eligible no cads are thats why youre out of it look here said i were not going to look here you can cut and go and sit on the stairs we dont want you in here do we you chaps rather not unless weve got our kicking boots on all right said i feeling i must play one or two of my trumps i shant tell you what i was going to pooh we know all about it said coxhead but it was plain by the way they had all pricked their ears they did not oh if you know its all right but you dont know the latest we dont want to unless its that old tempest has got off thats just what it is said i triumphantly good old sarah how do you know never mind its a secret but its a fact honour bright what has he paid all his bills theyre all paid i know that i suppose said langrish as that motion about sarah being kicked out wasnt properly seconded its off isnt it does any gentleman second the motion said coxhead glancing round the assembled philosophers no one seconded it jolly lucky shave for you young sarah said coxhead thanks awfully said i we may as well divide up the pool now suggested warminster with a generosity which was really touching the philosophers had clubbed together the shattered fragments of their terms pocketmoney to assist tempest in his financial troubles they had done it ungrudgingly nay enthusiastically and it was not against them that the enthusiasm remained now as each one unexpectedly received back his philosophers mite from the depths of the kindly pool it is all very well keeping a secret like mine for twentyfour hours it was an effort but i did it and prevailed on my comrades to keep it too it was even harder work to prevail upon them as a matter of policy to accept the temporary supremacy of crofter in the house nothing would induce them to refrain from cheering tempest much to his displeasure on every possible occasion it made it awkward for me sometimes when this happened in crofters presence for as things now were in sharpes a cheer for the old captain meant a hoot at the new and i felt that crofter did the fellows only know all did not deserve their resentment after fortyeight hours i could not restrain myself any longer it was not fair to myself or crofter or low heath that every one should suppose tempest was to be expelled when he really was not so with some misgivings i decided to put myself in his way and break the agreeable news to him and so have everything cleared up before the end of term it was not difficult to find an excuse i had not been to tempests rooms since our unlucky quarrel and had been suffering inconvenience ever since by the fact that my latin gradus was there on the last day but one of the term therefore i developed a burning desire to consult my missing handbook and must needs go in search of it tempest was sitting miserably enough before the fire with his feet on the fender and his hands up to the back of his head as i entered it was not till i was well in the room and had closed the door that he turned round and saw me i thought at first he meant to fly at me his face clouded so angrily but it changed to a look of contempt as he said well tempest im awfully sorry really i am but dont let us have any of that if i thought youd meant it i should precious soon know what to do youve done me about the worst turn a fellow could and if you werent a conceited young ass it would be some use thrashing you as it is somebody else may do that when im gone the wretchedness of his tone quite touched me i forgot my anger and sense of resentment and all the old affection and loyalty came back with a rush how could i ever have imagined a fellow like crofter was worthy to hold a candle to my old dux really tempest began i losing my head and blundering i scarcely knew whither when you saw me talking to crofter he uttered an angry exclamation there now shut up about your friend crofter i dont want to hear about him hes not my friend tempest heshes yours he wheeled round in his chair and laughed bitterly its a queer time to joke said he with a laugh that cut me through its no joke tempest you dont know what hes done for you dont i i fancy i do about the bills said i faltering you know ah i dont come here to tell me about that it was all of his own accord he paid them he what shouted tempest springing from his chair and facing round paid them you know at least i paid them for him you paid and he caught me by the collar and shook me like a puppy you said you knew gasped i paid my bills you say that blackguard had the cheek to he got me to do it it was his money though he groaned as if some one had wounded him a crimson flush of shame and mortification overspread his face and for a moment he stared at me speechless then he pulled himself together and strode out of the room utterly bewildered and half terrified i followed him what had i done to offend him had all the trouble of the term turned his head to my alarm he made straight for crofters study no one was there he turned and saw me tell crofter i want him at once i departed with my heart in my mouth at the foot of the staircase i met crofter tempest wants to see you said i he sent me toto ask you to come he doesnt know inquired crofter yesi told himii thought i ought to let him know crofter laughed his sweet laugh if i had wanted it known all over low heath said he i could hardly have done better than tell you to keep it a secret id much sooner he had not known howeverwhere is he in your study i think i felt constrained to follow crofter evidently was expecting to be the recipient of an outburst of effusive gratitude i had not the courage to disabuse him he walked pleasantly and graciously into his study where tempest stood flushing and biting his lips awaiting him is this true what that youngster says that youve had thethat youve paid bills of mine im sorry he told you tempest i thought it might get you out of a difficulty and i and you expect me to thank you take that for daring to meddle in my affairs and he struck crofter on the cheeknot a hard blow but one which sent the recipient reeling across the room with astonishment for a moment i expected a fight crofter however pale but smiling still declined the challenge youll be sorry im sure said he as coolly as he could i only wanted to do you a good turn and im sorry already said tempest who had already gathered himself together i hoped youd fight like a man as youre afraid to im sorry i touched you i see nothing to fight about said crofter i dont see what there is to be angry about tempest waited motionless for a few uncomfortable moments in the hope that crofter would pluck up spirit to accept the challenge but as crofter only smiled he turned on his heel and strode out of the room as he passed me he beckoned me imperiously to follow him i did so in terror he put a piece of paper and a pen before me write down there an account of every bill you paid and the amount i obeyedmy memory fortunately served me for the task now go youve had the satisfaction of seeing me make an ass of myself in striking that cadhes not worth it you may go and tell him im sorry if you like as for you i dont want to see any more of you go to your captain and leave me alone and he flung himself miserably into his chair leaning forward with his head on his hands and apparently indifferent whether i stayed or went i went leaving him thus and the memory of him sitting there haunted me all that night and for weeks to come when next day the news went round that tempest had escaped expulsion the general delight was tempered with amazement at the rumour which accompanied it that he owed his escape to crofter no one but crofter himself could have put the latter story into circulation and to any one knowing the two seniors as well as i did it was obvious that what had completed the humiliation of one had been the crowning triumph of the other crofter could not have avenged himself for the insults of the term more effectively and tempests proud nature could not have suffered a bitterer wound than to know that he had been put under an obligation in spite of himself and without the possibility of preventing it by his worst enemy the ordinary sharper could hardly be expected to trouble himself about questions of motive it was sufficient for him that his hero was saved and that the credit of the popular act which saved him belonged to crofter consequently both were cheered equally when they appeared in public and of the two crofter accepted his popularity with a far better grace than his mortified adversary but it was all very miserable to me as i slunk home that afternoon in the train all the hopes of the wonderful term had been disappointed i was a recognised dunce and idler at low heath i had lost my best friend and sold myself to his enemy my selfrespect was at a low ebb i knew that in a post or two would come a report which would bring tears to my mothers eyes and cause my guardian to grunt and say i expected as much the worst of it was i could not get it out of my head yet that i was rather a fine young fellow if only people knew it and that my misfortunes were more to blame for the failure of the term than my faults to my relief a letter came early in the holidays from dicky browns people asking me to spend the last two weeks with them i jumped at it for in my present miserable frame of mind even home was dismal but when i found myself back at low heath installed in dickys quiet little family circle i was almost sorry i had come for dicky was all high spirits and jubilation he had won a form prize everything had gone swimmingly for him the urbans looked up to him the head master had patted him on the back the redwoods had taken a fancy to him no one thought of calling him by a feminine nickname i think low heaths a ripping place said he as we strolled past the gate of the empty quadrangle in one of our holiday rambles im jolly glad we got kicked out of dangerfield aint you middling said i the fact is dicky you may as well know it but im rather sick of this place hullo said he looking at me why i thought you were having such a high old time iive come a bit of a howler dicky here i gulped ominously much to dickys concern ive fooled things rather you know i was in for my confession now and gave the penitent horse his head im jolly miserable dicky thats all about it and wish i was dead dont you know and that sort of thing whats up old chappie said dicky taking my arm and evidently in a fright lest i should compromise myself by breaking down on the spot come down by the willows its rather muddy but its quieter so we ploughed through the mud under the willows and i let out on dicky all that was in my heart im sure he thought it a lot of bosh but he was too kind to say so and hung on to my arm and never once contradicted me when i called myself a fool you have rotted it a bit remarked he when the story was complete never mind old chap it cant be helped youll worry through all right this was true comfort if dicky had been a prig like me he would have tried to talk to me like a father and driven me crazy it made all the difference that he understood me and yet believed in me a little it strikes me said he with refreshing candour you fancy yourself a bit too much tommy id advise you to lie low a bit and it will all come round thats just exactly what tempest said to me the first day of term said i with a groan there you are said he bless you youre not going to get done over one wretched term are you i wouldnt if i were you but all the chaps are down on me what do you care said he with a snort who cares twopence about the lot of themchaps like them too youre a cut better than that lot i fancyought to be anyhow what balm it all was to my wounds what miles of mud we ploughed through that afternoon i and how as the water gradually leaked into my boots my heart rose out of them and got back somehow to its proper place and enabled me to look at things in their proper light i think dicky little as he knew it was sent by god to help me pull myself together and i shall always think better of him for his blunt genuine encouragement that day on our way back he pulled up at redwoods door lets see if hes in said he he wont mind all right said i beginning to quail again a little and yet determined to go through with the whole business redwood was in mending a pair of skates in anticipation of a day or twos frost before the holidays were over look here redwood said dicky determined to make things easy for me old jones minimus is in the blues hes been fooling it rather this term you know but hes a bit sick of it and we thought youd like to know didnt we young jones minimus yes if you dont mind redwood said i wait a bitteas just ready well have ours up here said the captain over tea dicky trotted out my troubles secondhand to our host appealing to me every now and then to confirm his statement that id rather mucked it over this and that and so on redwood nibbled away at his tea looking up now and then with a friendly nod to show he agreed with all that was said about me when all was said he remarked i wouldnt worry youngster if i were you its been a poor show last term but youll pull yourself together right enough take my advice and lie low a bit thats the best thing for your complaint why said i thats just exactly what tempest said to me there you are again broke in dicky cutting himself a hunch of cake presently redwood began to draw me on the subject of tempest and looked rather blank when i told him of the dismal circumstances in which the term had closed at sharpes however he did not favour dicky and me with much comment on the matter and finally got us to help him sharpen his skates and talk about other things i went to bed that night at dickys more easy and hopeful than i had been for weeks and felt halfimpatient for term to begin again so that i might put into practice the new and treblypatent specific of lying low chapter twenty two putting on the brake the holidays went by rapidly enough i tore myself away from dickys consoling companionship three days from the end and rushed home to see my mother i wonder what she thought of the difference a couple of weeks had made in me when i started to dickys i had been limp dejected and down on my luck now she found me chirpy and with a stiff upper lip she did not make remarks but i could see how relieved she was my mother was not the person to take a mean advantage of me or get me into a corner to lecture me rather not she took me for what i was and let me see how she loved me that was the proper sort of help for me in some ways she made less of me than usual but i could see why she did that she saw i wanted letting alone and she did it bless her only on the last evening a sunday as we walked back from church she said are you glad or sorry to be going back tomorrow tom sorry for some thingsglad for others i fooled a bit last term you know mother ah well sonny its part of the lessons of school to find out our mistakes now and then it was all new to you at first i expect you tried to do too much you know i knowyou mean id best lie low a bit mother yes i know what you mean said she there you are exclaimed i staggered by this new coincidence thats what every chap has said ill do my best really mother only its jolly hard dont be awfully sorry if i dont get right all at once ill try you know you cant do more than your best sonny dear redwood says continued i that i shall probably tool about more or less to the end of my time its in my line he says but he rather backs me to pull myself together for all that so do i tom and the best friend you have does so too my journey next day was very different from the strange journey of a term ago i had neither tan boots nor squaretopped hat nor lavender gloves and i could afford to smile with langrish who joined me en route at some of the poor little greenhorns on their way to make their entry into low heath how different it was too to be hailed by half a dozen voices from the top of the omnibus at the station and told to hop up beside them and how jolly to ride in triumph up bridge street exchanging shouts with familiar passengers on the way or uttering defiant warwhoops at the day boys and how jolly to tumble in at sharpes door once more and slap one another on the back and crowd up into the old familiar faggery and hear all the old chaff and slang interspersed with stories of the holidays and secondhand christmas jokes and how jolly to hear the organ again in the chapel and the prayers with friends all round you and finally when the day was over tuck up again in the little cubicle and hear your chums voice across the partition droning more and more sleepily till finally you and it dropped off together one of the last to arrive during the day was tempest who had run from the station and came in flushed with exercise but grave and tight about the lips the ovation he received from the philosophers scarcely drew a smile from him and when he reached his own study he slammed the door ominously and cheerlessly behind him we none of us liked it whats it to be said coxhead is he to be cock of the house this term or has he chucked it up that was the question which was agitating us all till the form orders were posted tomorrow no one could tell crofter we knew had been doing all he knew to get ahead and considering the slack way in which tempest had let things go all last term it seemed very much as if he might succeed if he did our duty would be a difficult one crofter had a claim on us for having saved tempest from being expelled and we could hardly refuse to own him should he come out cock of the house on the other hand tempest was the man of our heart and our tender imagination failed to picture him in any secondary position in sharpessecondary to crofter above all other things the day closed with one curious incident langrish came to me after supper in a state of wrathful perturbation look here young sarah said he are you tempests fag or not thats all about it i dont know said i i was but he told me he told you he didnt want a cad like you hanging about his place all very wellthat doesnt follow im his fag as well as crofters here catch hold youve got to take this to crofter im not going to take itit means a licking most likely and i dont see why im to be let in for it he handed me an envelope evidently containing coin addressed crofter in tempests wellknown writing i did not relish the commission for i had my guess as to the contents of the missive curiosity however prompted me to take it and proceed to crofters study well youngster said crofter turned up again have you seen tempest yet yeshe sent this said i crofter took the envelope and opened it five sovereigns and a half sovereign dropped out on the table no letter accompanied the money but its meaning was clear enough crofters brow contracted and his habitual smile deserted him for once what is this some mistake said he its what he owes you suggested i i suppose so but that was only l shillings pence perhaps the rest is something for yourself i remarked making myself scarce in time to escape the task of returning the change bother it crofter must square this part of the business up with his enemy i didnt want to be dragged any more into it there was a rush for the house board early next morning to learn our fate as to the captaincy of sharpes whew said langrish as we reached it bracketed so it was tempests and crofters names were braced together at the head of the list thats a nice go i suppose theyll have to go halves all the worse for us i should think as tempest was captain last term hell go on again this i said he wasnt captain when term ended crofter was i vote they fight it out said warminster two to one on the winner it would save trouble if they made pridgin head hes third man up pridgin the easygoing owner of the name was spared something by not being present to hear the amused contempt with which the suggestion was greeted an hour later the doctor came down to settle matters for us under the circumstances said he it seems right that crofter should take charge of the house i understand that tempests debts on account of which he was removed from the headship last term are now all honourably settled but as he was more than once reported for breaking rules last term it is only fair that crofter whose marks are equal and against whom no complaint was recorded should captain the house that was all tempest on the whole looked relieved crofter smiled a satisfied smile pridgin and wales looked blue and the philosophers took time to consider what they thought as for me although tempest had thrown me over i could guess what a blow this was for him not personally for he would probably be glad to be rid of the responsibility but as a public disgrace it was sure to wound him keenly i longed to be able to go and tell him how sorry i was but after what had happened last term i dare not in that respect whether i liked it or not i must lie low the philosophers were not long in formally exchanging opinions on the situation a meeting was summoned for the same evening to inaugurate things generally i was a little doubtful what i ought to do last term philosophy had not tended to diligent work and with my good resolutions in view i felt that i should be better out of it the little tiff with my comrades before the holidays had almost solved the difficulty but since then i had been formally readmitted to the fold and it would be almost treasonable to scratch now i move and third and old trim seconds and fourths announced langrish that old sal be and is president as before and i carry that motion said warminster who prided himself on his acquaintance with the procedure of public meetings i move an amendment said i shut up or youll be kicked out again said the secretary shut up yourself or youll be kicked in retorted i feeling i must carry everything with a high hand if i was to carry them at all no look here you chaps im not so green as i look then you must look fearfully green muttered coxhead i took no heed of the interruption which was not relevant and proceeded it was all very well last term but it wont wash this what i say is that if the cock of the school is the head boy in the school and the cock of the house is the head boy in the house the president of the philosophers has got to be the chap highest up in the philosophers and thats not me now old warminster is hes a jolly clever chap and got the form prize on his head and hes a rattling good speaker and a middling sprinter and writes a fairly good hand hes the sort of chap we want we want some one who can keep the secretary and treasurer and auditor and registrar and all that lot in their place and doesnt mind telling them theyre idiots when they are i never could do it its rough on the club not to have a chap like warminster continued i waxing warm and undaunted by the murmurs of my audience he can make you all sit up hes not the sort of chap to let the philosophers go rotting about talking what they know nothing about and all that hell see that the louts are kept out of it and only fellows whove got a record of something are let in bless you i used to let in any sort of bounder that asked look round you and see thats the sort of lot i let in it wont wash though fancy having a lot of outsiders who cant translate a latin motto and make corpore a feminine genitive now old warminsters a nailer at latin and can put one or two of us to bed at euclid hell keep us out of blunders of that sort that make all the school grin at us i therefore propose fifth fourth third and second that tip warminster is the president of the philosophers and that the secretary treasurer auditor registrar and all that lot get a months notice to jack it up unless theyre on the front desk there you are of course they wont like itcant help that no backdeskers for us front desk or nothing this oration the longest i ever delivered so far and in all probability the longest i ever shall deliver was listened to with a curious mixture of discomfort and attention at first it was nearly howled down but it took as it went on warminster for whom i really did not feel quite so much admiration as my words seemed to imply but who yet was the hardworking man of our lotwarminster was wonderfully pleased with it the others one by one dropped their noisy protests and looked out of the window trimble attempted a little bravado by sticking his tongue in his cheek but my peroration was listened to with marked attention cuts down the club a bit said coxhead who occupied a desk in class on the third row if its only to be topdeskers cuts old sal out to begin with said langrish who was just on the bench of honour itll cut you out next week old hoss said i me what are you talking about you wait till the weeks order is up youll see langrish glared indignantly if you think an idiot like you is going to look here said warminster i vote we go easy at first and make it any one whos not gone down in order in a month i say nobody whos not gone up one in the term suggested langrish glancing defiantly at me all serene said i thatll suit my book itll be roughish on you though will it see how youll feel when youre chucked out neck and crop my beauty my main object had been to get out of being president but somehow in doing it i had struck a note which made the philosophers sit up it was no credit to me it happened so but it was one of those lucky flukes which sometimes turn out well and do a good stroke without the striker being aware of it warminster was unanimously elected president and bore his blushing honours with due meekness old salthe philosophers had taken to abbreviating my pet name this term i know not on what principle of familiarityold sal piles it on a bit remarked he of course he couldnt help rotting the club a bit last term thats the way hes born but considering what a rank outsider he was i suppose he did his best laughter and cries of what about jarmans guy yes that was a howling mess i vote we keep out of that this term or leave it to the louts i tell you what said he i vote we make a show up at the sports next month and take some of the side out of those dayboy kids they fancy themselves a jolly sight too much dicky brown told me said i they were sure of both the jumps and the quartermile and the tugand that selkirks were going to pull off the others all except the halfmile handicap and we may get that he says because theyll probably give us fifty or sixty yards lead howling cheek exclaimed every one in furious rage the idea of being given sixty yards start in a halfmile by a day boy was too much even for a philosopher whereupon we solemnly considered the list of events under and divided them out among ourselves with a vow to eat our heads if we didnt pull off as many for sharpes as all the rest of the school put together we decided to postpone making our entries till the last moment so as to delude the enemy into the impression that we were shirking the sports altogether then we would as warminster politely put it drop down and rot the lot before we adjourned for the night the question of tempest and crofter came up a propos of a report which some one mentioned that tempest had entered for the open mile against redwood and was expected to prove a warm customer is crofter in nopridgin is but of course he wont come up to scratch and wales only enters for the show of the thing crofter couldnt look in at tempest over the mile said langrish but he ought to enter for all that can he look in at tempest over anything said i dont ask questions and you wont be told no whoppers astutely replied trimble i wonder if he expects us to back him up i shant said one nor shall i said one or two others i vote we let him alone said coxhead whats he got to do with us when does he come across us only when theres a row on hes got nothing at all to say to us at other times you mean if we want to let him alone we shall have to shut up rows inquired langrish rather rough isnt it not if he knows the reason suggested i lets send him a round robin and let him know not half a bad idea whereupon the following candid epistle was concocted and signed by all present to t crofter esquire captain sharpes pro tem etcetera etcetera etcetera dear crofterwe the undersigned philosophers wish to say were going steady this term on our own hooks and hope you will not think its because of you we dont want to be interfered with by any chap except old tempest who ought to be cock of sharpes so weve decided to go steady so as not to be interfered with because we would rather not you interfered with us because were all serene and are backing up tempest and hope hell pull off the mile that youve not entered for we arent down on you because you pulled tempest through last term but its rough youre cock of the house instead of him and therefore on that account we are going steady so as not to give you the fag of interfering with us which we dont mind tempest doing because we consider he has more right to interfere with us than you hoping you are well and in good health as this leaves us believe us with kind regards to all at home yours very kindly and in alphabetical order so that you neednt know who started this letter samuel wilberforce coxhead thomas jones everard langrish jonathan t purkis alfred james remington trimble percy algernon warminster and others this important document the writing of which i grieve to say necessitated frequent reference to the english dictionary langrish as crofters fag undertook to deliver and faithfully discharged his mission by leaving it on the captains table when he was out of his study it was decided to resist the temptation of sending mr jarman a similar explanatory letter for fear it might lead to a row which would call for interference nor was it deemed prudent under the circumstances to commit ourselves in writing to tempest whom we hoped to convince of our loyalty by cheering him on every possible occasion and otherwise making things pleasant for him how crofter enjoyed his letter we none of us knew he was inconsiderate enough to give no sign of having received it and still more inconsiderate to allow himself on more than one occasion to be publicly complimented by the doctor and mr sharpe on the order of the house meanwhile the philosophers stuck to their new programme i had the satisfaction of pulling down langrish from his place on the top desk at the end of the first week and he had the triumph of recovering his seat at the end of the week after in the seclusion of the faggery we indulged in a few mild recriminations which were the natural outcome of our rivalry but they only served to blow off steam and we were too keen to win our selfimposed battles in class to allow personal feeling to interfere much with our work mr sharpe was fairly astonished and took off his glasses and rubbed his mild eyes as he read over our really meritorious exercises and listened to our sometimes positively coherent feats of construing secretly too but with great precaution and in spots far removed from the detection of the day boys we practised grimly at jumping and sprinting and recordbreaking generally and finally as the critical time for making our entries approached agreed upon the particular exploit which each of us was to undertake for the honour and glory of sharpes house in general and philosophy in particular before that time arrived however one awkward incident occurred to remind me i had even yet not quite purged myself of the follies of last term i stumbled against crofter just outside his door come in said he i obeyed guessing that at last we were to hear something of our famous letter i was disappointed however crofter made no reference to it but said those bills you paid for me last term jones ivdid none of the people allow you any discount discount said i whats that we havent got to it yet in syntax dont be a young ass did none of them give you any change rather all of them i brought it back or used it to pay the rest what i mean is you didnt make anything out of it for yourself did you meoh the conscious blushes suddenly mounted as i grasped his meaning yes you well only you see it was come no lies i know all about it did you or did you not not from the hat man said i from all the others only yes or no thats what i want to know yes but that will do now i understand why you were so pleased with the job its a profitable thing to help a friend sometimes tempest will be amused when he hears oh i say dontreally i didnt fancy that will do i say cutdo you hear i only wanted to know whether i was right or not in what i told tempest oh but pleaded i with a groan of misery if you dont cut ill lick you for disobedience this after all my good resolutions and hopes that all was squared and that before long tempest would believe in me again i slunk away in despair and curled myself up in my bed that night the most miserable boy in low heath chapter twenty three pretty warm all round dicky old chap im in a howling mess the same old one or a new one its about those blessed bills of tempestsi wish id let them alone you see it was this way how was i to know im sure i never meant to do anything shady i dare say not but what are you talking about why ive been regularly let in you see i look here old chap lets hear what it is said the practical dicky why the fact is most of the chaps wanted to stand me something when i squared up with them and crofter tries to make out im a thief and hes going to show me up to tempest but you didnt let them well yes one or two you see marple gave me a pencilsharpener and rammage a strawberry ice and ringstead a netbag and spikesjolly bad ones too they all came out in a week and does crofter say you swindled him or tempest i didnt think i was swindling anybody said i evasively you made a pretty good thing out of it though i know i say dicky whats to be done i thought i was going to pull round all square this termreally i didand now im in a regular fix dicky pondered it was a bit shady said he with his refreshing candour the sort of thing ananias and oh for pitys sake dicky if thats all youve got to say its not i think youd best make it good somehow cant you give them back how can i give back the strawberry ice this was a poser certainly and set dicky thinking again have you got the other things asked he no the pencilsharpener smashed first time i used it and the netbag got lost at home awkward youll have to buy new ones who for tempest of course they were his bills but it was crofters money but tempest has paid him back the result of this conversation was that instead of practising for the quartermile that afternoon i went down town with a bag and expended five shillings of my terms pocketmoney in the purchase of a pencil sharpener a strawberry ice a netbag and a set of patent screw spikes dicky like a brick undertook to convey these to tempest with the following letter which i wrote at his suggestion dear tempesti send you back the change i got out of the bills i got last term im sorrier than i can say and hope you wont hate me more than you do dicky will tell you how jolly blue i am and how we all hope youll win the mile we arent backing up crofter and hope youll soon be captain again please excuse me writing but i dont like to come and tell you this as youre so down on me yours truly t jones iv i also penned a further letter for crofter dear crofteryou neednt mind telling tempest as ive done so and paid him back with thanks all the same yours truly tj iv i felt vastly easier in my mind when this polite letter was at an end and when i saw the faithful dicky depart to execute his brotherly mission my one fear was lest the strawberry ice should get warm before it reached its destination i waited in vain for any sign of response from tempest the philosophers went down during the afternoon to watch him training for his race but he vouchsafed us no regard and for all i knew still put me down as a thief and a sharper dicky whom i met later on explained that he had failed to catch tempest in his study but had deposited the articles along with the letter on his table so that if he did not know of them yet he soon would my anxiety was not at all allayed by a casual encounter with crofter in the evening he summoned me into his study where i saw my billet doux lying on the table i suppose you wrote this said he yes and you think everythings clear now do you isnt it said i i dare say dr england will be able to tell you by the way why did you only give me shillings pence change instead of shillings pence there was only shillings pence to give really i thought so too till your clever management of the tips tempted me to look over the bills again i see that what you paid only came to l shillings pence instead of l shillings pence i dont want the other shilling but hope you bought yourself something nice with it you must consider it a present from tempest not me i timed red and white in the sudden confusion of that announcement i was positively certain shillings pence had been the change and that if there was any mistake it must be on the part of the tradesmen not me but how was i likely to convince crofter or for the matter of that tempest that such was the case i promise you said i i only had shillings pence change really crofter do believe me i believe every word you say said crofter with a smile i have every reason to havent i but really and truly whats the use of saying any more of course its all really and truly ive no doubt tempest believes it too please let me see the bills pleaded i ill show you im right unfortunately tempest has them i dare say he will be delighted you havent told him about this have you i gasped in helpless misery im going to its too good a joke to be kept to myself i dont suppose hell mind certainly he wont be surprised oh crofter for goodness sake dont tell him this said i blundering on into an appearance of guiltiness of which i was quite innocent im wanting so awfully to be friends with him again ive given him back all i got out of the shops and it will spoil everything if you tell him this reallyit isnt true either crofter laughed pleasantly its rather likely i should shield you isnt it when all this term you and your friends have been insulting and defying me and setting yourself to upset my authority as captain of the house oh but we arent what does this precious thing mean demanded he producing the famous roundrobin its meant to be all politeness i suppose it only means faltered i that we are sorry tempest is not captain naturally its nice to have a captain one can swindle and rob isnt it i groaned miserablyit seemed no use trying to put myself right if you chose to be civil and back me up it would be different said crofter but we arewere going as steady as anything said i what do you mean by going to pridgin and wales and tempest for exeats and special leave instead of to me he demanded this was a point i was unprepared for it was true that the philosophers in their desire not to be interfered with by the new captain had made a point of applying as they were entitled to do to any of the other prefects of the house in preference to crofter for exeats and occasional leave to go without bounds it had always been considered the prerogative of the captain of the house to grant these but strictly speaking the other prefects had the right too i tried to explain as much of course said he it is a very neat way of ignoring my authority i expect you to come to me i shall not refuse any reasonable request but im not going to be insulted in my own house but said i there is no but about it if you want to prevent your being shown up to your friend as an amiable young swindler you can stop it by undertaking that you and your lot will do what i tell you if not it is your own lookout thats all luckily the school bell enabled me to get away without giving any pledge fool as i was i knew what all this meant it was an attempt to buy us all over at the cost of that unlucky shilling and with it to secure crofter in the authority which he so dearly coveted but so far so imperfectly enjoyed the philosophers as might be expected waxed very indignant when i made a clean breast of the whole matter with their usual frankness they quite admitted that i might have pilfered the shilling that sort of thing they remarked was quite in my line and in keeping with my character generally and they hoped to live to see me hung but as to caving in to crofter as the cost of my shelter they drew the line at that he had no right to impose new rules or take away the immemorial privileges of the sharpers besides if they gave in on this point they would immediately have to go and ask his leave to practise for the sports in callow meadow which was just out of bounds and where in strict seclusion diligent practice had been going on for a week with most promising results i was thereupon ordered to write a laconic rejoinder to the tempting offer the philosophers promising to back me up in the matter of the shilling and see me through it with a heavy heart therefore i sat down and penned the following brief epistle which was approved by the faggery and ordered to be laid on crofters table before bedtime dear crofterwe all think its not good enough its all a lie about the shilling yours sincerely tj iv some of the philosophers demurred to the sentence about the shilling which appeared to commit them to an opinion they did not hold but i had my way for once and retired to bed when all was done wondering whenever peace would come and i and my friend should rejoice to see one another again as of old i do not know how soon i fell asleep it must have been pretty soon for i can remember seeing crofter come into the dormitory and turn out the gas and i can remember in the general stillness hearing voices and the noise of poking the fire in mr sharpes room downstairs after that i forgot everything until suddenly i discovered myself awake again things seemed strange as i slowly turned my head on the pillow and blinked up with halfopened eyes the dormitory seemed hot and stuffy somebody or something was making a noise and i wished they would stop i could see nothing except the hazy outline of my shirt hanging on the back of the chair and even that seemed to come and go as i watched it i was indisposed to move and my mind was half asleep still the one thing i did long for was for the noise to stop and some one to open a window it was simply choking i could hardly breathe and suddenly my shirt seemed to turn red and by the lurid light it emitted i could see smoke coming over the top of the door then the side of the room grew red too and seemed to close in on me getting redder and redder as it did so till finally by a frantic effort i raised myself in my bed and yelled fire the answer was a great volume of smoke which leapt out at me like a savage beast and sent me back on to the pillow a deafening roar outside and a sudden blaze which halfblinded me and stifled the cry that was on my lips that is all i can remember distinctly i was vaguely conscious of hearing my name called of seeing my door move of everything whirling round and round and finally of falling or getting or being dragged out of bed the next thing i was aware of was that i was lying in a strange bed with a headache but otherwise tolerably comfortable though awfully thirsty and as weak as a mouse water please i remarked at large instantly a face bent over mea strangely familiar face which after a moments reflection i told myself was my mothers it was such a surprise that i forgot about the water and took a nap instead in due time i must have woke again this time by candlelight mother are you there yes darling what is it my shirt caught fire and hush dear dont try to talk i didnt quite see why i was really curious about several things in fact i thirsted for information why maynt i talk mother because youve been ill did i get doctors leave yes dear mother well sonny darling how did you get here they sent and told me you you didnt believe about that shilling really there was only shillings pence change yes yes dear hush now theres a good boy mother well tommy dear was there a fire last night it was a week ago sonny who was the fellow called me was he riled at me for not answering oh noyou were almost suffocated where shall i sleep now have they mended my cubicle youll sleep here dear all the boys are over here was all the dormitory on fire then yes but thank god every one was saved is langrish all right oh yes all of them are will he be game for the high jump surely surelybut youre talking too much sonny mother what is it darling does tempest know ive been ill yes and her eyes seemed to fill with tears as she bent over me will you tell him about the shilling yes if you like mother why are you crying is tempest ill too no dearbut tell us mother if it had not been for tempest said she i should have had no boy today did he get me out then said i getting thoroughly aroused yes heaven bless him for it she replied kissing my forehead thatll be a score for him said i im so glad my mother evidently did not quite understand this point of view and concluded i had been talking more than was good for me and once more implored me to be silent but i had no notion of giving up my inquiries at this stage did he get hurt doing it i asked only his hand a little how did he get at me every one thought you were safe out of the burning room with the others when it was found you were not tempest rushed back before any one could stop him and carried you out he had not got outside with you more than a second or two when the roof and staircase and all fell in here she shuddered as once more she bent over me and kissed me this was all i wanted to hear at present and i closed my eyes in order to think it over the better my chief sensation was one of exultation that tempest should risk his life for me it meant that i had won him back in spite of myself then when i recalled the frightful blaze and noise of that night i began to realise what my rescue must have meant to any one no one but a fellow utterly scornful of danger and utterly determined to save a life in peril at all cost could have ventured into that place he would have done it for any one i knew but to come deliberately after me who had ruined his chances last term and whom he despised as a pilferer and a sneakthis was an act of heroism which it baffled me to contemplate and in the contemplation of which consequently i succumbed once more to sleep and forgot everything as i slowly got better and after all i was not much damaged as soon as i had got over the effects of the suffocation and terror of that awful night i heard more about the fire permission was given me to see one friend a day for ten minutes at a time and the reader may imagine the wild excitement of those ten minutes i naturally called for dicky brown as my first man he came looking rather scared and was evidently relieved to find i was something better than a mass of burns and able to do my share in the conversation it was a close shave for you i can tell you he said all the other fellows hopped out long before the fire got bad and no one fancied you werent out too you must have been sleeping jolly sound all of a sudden one of your lot yelled out that you were missing it was so hot then the fellows were all standing back but old tempest almost before the chap had shouted nipped into the middle of it and made a dash for your cubicle my word i wish id been there to see it you were as good as done for when he collared you and hauled you out he fell with you halfway down the stairs but sharpe and pridgin and one or two others caught him and fished him out with you over his shoulder he swears hes not damaged but hes got his hand in a sling i say old chap its no use blubbing its all right how i wasnt blubbing said i when youve got a cold in your head your eyes water sometimes dont they rather buckets said the magnanimous dicky langrish was my next interviewer and his account as an eyewitness was graphic and not calculated entirely to cure my cold in the head you see its this way said he jarman was smoking in sharpes room and chucked his cigar into the wastepaper basket or somewhere by mistake and while he and sharpe toddled across the quad the thing flared up and went up the curtains and when old sharpe came back the whole place was in a blaze i twigged it pretty sharp and so did trim and there was a regular stampede no one ever supposed youd go snoring all through it crofter and wales were first outside looking as white as milk bless you it was such a rush and shindy no one could see anybody of course we made sure you were all serene think of you sleeping through it i was in the end cubicle you see said i for all that you might have stuck your head out to see what the fun was about said langrish in rather an aggrieved tone sharpe turned up presently with his face all grimy with smoke and yelled is every one here yes said croftersilly ass how could he tell then coxhead said to me wheres sarah got to that made me look round and i can tell you i was pretty sick when i couldnt see you just fancy a chap sleeping away through it all why the ant and the sluggard said langrish getting a little mixed in his proverbs werent in it with you so i yelled sarah with all my might you should have seen the chaps sit up when they heard your name then old tempest with his mouth shut and looking middling pasty about the face broke through the scrimmage and sent us right and left and made a regular header into the place sharpe yelled to him to come back some tried to yell but couldnt for lumps in their throats and we all closed up i can tell you it was a hot place the smoke rolled out and got in our eyes and the wood and stuff cracked and blazed and sounded like the waves at dover we never expected to see him or you come back the stairs were going to bits as fast as they could and great bits of burning wood were tumbling off the roof then the smoke shifted somehow and we heard sharpe yell heavens then there was a dull row like something tumbling and pridgin and sharpe dashed in we got kept back or wed have given you a legup too then you strolled in fast asleep stilli never saw such a snoozeron tempests arm he was pretty well done and couldnt have pulled it off if sharpe and pridgin hadnt hiked him out even then he couldnt stand so i hope youre jolly well pleased with yourself i hope it will be a lesson to you young sarah to keep one eye open while youre asleep we were jolly glad you got canted out though you are a bit of a mule but it would have been rough on you to miss the sports they say tempests burned his hand pretty bad but he means to have a shot at the mile i say redwood was asking after you jarmans jolly sick that it was his fault about the fire hes been quite civil and been to ask about you every day look sharp and get right i say or itll rot the sports if you dont hullo there comes your mater ta ta old hoss its rather ripping you scraped through all right he was a good sort langrish he did not tell me what i heard later that at the time of the fire he had to be held back by main force from following tempest in quest of me and that he had rather a cold in his head when he saw me hauled out safe and sound chapter twenty four small and early in the sanatorium my recovery was far too rapid to please me i never had such a jolly time in all my life my mother was in and out all day there were no lessons i was allowed to summon any chum i liked to my bedside i was receiving messages daily from masters and seniors and best of all i had nothing the matter with me except a strong disinclination to exert myself and an occasional headache or dizziness when i sat up i had come up to low heath that term with the honest determination to lie low i little expected however that i should find myself quite so literally adhering to my resolution my one trouble was that all this time i had not seen tempest i did not like to send for him in case he should not appreciate the compliment and he as i guessed would not care to come of his own accord for the uncomfortable ceremony of receiving my thanks my mother told me he had often asked about me but when she asked him to come and see me he had repliedill see him as soon as he gets about again when she inquired about his hand he had replied airily that it was all right and he was only keeping it in the sling to get it right for the sports but said my mother i wish he would let the doctor see it or give up running till it is well but said i hes a chance of winning off redwood this argument which in ninetynine cases out of one hundred in low heath would have been absolutely conclusive failed to impress my mother in the least she attached no importance to winning off redwood compared with a boys health and obdurately protested that if she were tempests mother she would not allow him to think of running it was only my agitated appeals to her not to interpose that prevented her speaking to dr england about the matter and so knocking the race on the head altogether i took it as a compliment to myself that the sports had been put off a fortnight in consequence of the fire that warm event had so upset everything and monopolised so much attention that low heath would not have come up to scratch at all on the day originally fixed and whereas the new date permitted of my being present to assistthough alas i not to competein the days proceedings i felt specially satisfied with the alteration i had naturally heard a good deal of philosophical gossip during my convalescence on my last evening in hospital especially there was quite a symposium my mother in an innocent moment had remarked i should so like to have one or two of your friends to tea sonny before i go home the doctor says it will not do you any harmand we can have them in here as you are the only invalid in hospital thatll be ten with you and me said i do you want quite so many asked she beginning to get a little concerned must have the lot or none said i decisively we can cut out rackstraw and walsh if you liketheyre paupers oh tommy said the dear tenderhearted one if they are not as well off as oh thats not it they can shell out as well as anybody only they got on our club for nothing on condition of towing the boats cleaning up and that sort of thing at any rate let us have them said my mother all serene will you write the invitations i say mother do you mind writing as well as you can our chaps are rather particular you know and i wouldnt like them to snuff up at you my poor dear mother began i think to repent of her hospitable offer but decided to go through with it now so she got eight nice little sheets of scented invitation note with envelopes to match and wrote mrs jones requests the pleasure of mr alfred james remington trimbles company to tea in the sanatorium parlour this evening at pm and so on in each case my suggestion to add rsvp and evening dress de rigueur she thought it best to decline but her kind leniency was thrown away for within half an hour eight notes dropped in upon us couched in the politest phraseology here was langrishs for instance everard langrish esquire begs to thank mrs jones for asking him to tea at six sharp when he will be very pleased to fall in with her wishes and be of service in any other way her better feelings may dictate langrish told me afterwards he cribbed this last sentence out of a story he had read in a weekly newspaper he rather fancied it was on the spot trimbles was less romantic dear madami accept with thanks sarah gets rather outside sometimes but we do what we can for him till then i am yours affectionately ajr trimble warminsters was no doubt meant to be impressivethe president of the philosophical conversation club presents his compliments to mrs jones and desires to inform her of his intention to wait upon her at the hour named in her letter he trusts that mrs jones is in good health and that her ailing child will be spared to her a little longer having several matters to attend to the president of the philosophical conversation club must now abruptly terminate namely percy algernon warminster the ending seemed to me decidedly weak compared with the rest i will only give one morethat of coxhead dear mrs jones ill come to tea at six oclock you shall me see im sorry sarahs been laid up and drinks his physic from a cup unless unto the contrary i hear my eton suit i think ill wear and now farewell as great john knox said yours truly samuel wilberforce coxhead this effusion struck me as rather like cheek but my mother seemed to like it as evening approached i began to grow very nervous and have to confess that my mother was the cause of my concern i was so afraid she was not properly impressed with the gravity of the occasionthat perhaps she would not be dressed at her bestor that the tea might not be up to the markor that for any cause the fellows should consider they had been done im sure i wearied the life out of her by my inquiries as to the nature of the jam as to whether the cake would go round twice whether any of the teacups were cracked whether the nine chairs ranged round the little room were all sound on their legs who would open the door to let them in whether my mother would mind not proposing juvenile games like tableturning or clumps and whether when the time came for them to go she would mind not looking at her watch or yawning for fear they should think it a hint all which points the dear soul faithfully promised should be borne in mind and attended to with a little quiet banter at my expense which helped to remind me that after all ones mother may be trusted not to disgrace a fellow if left to herself in due time she presented herself in her sunday dress looking very pretty and smartquite creditable in fact the tea also as it appeared laid out on the sideboardi had urged by the way that it should be served in party style and not partaken of round a table looked a wellfound meal for the most exacting of philosophers i myself reposed in state in bed arrayed in my eton jacket and best collar and choker the fire in the hearth was both cheerful and adequate and the knowledge that the sanatorium maid was downstairs in her cap and clean apron to show the young gentlemen up finally relieved my anxiety in due time there was a ring and a sound of the funereal tramp of eighteen feet on the staircase and i knew that mrs joness party had begun they all trooped in together looking very grave and shy and spick and span in their fulldress and evidently on their good behaviour my mother shook hands with each in unexceptionable style repeating his name as i announced it from the bed and expressing her pleasure at making his acquaintance the sight of me propped up on my pillows somewhat pale still and as shy as themselves seemed to impress them a good deal and added to the funereal character of the entertainment a long pause ensued broken only by the entrance of the maid with the teapot and langrishs remark to trimble that it was a fine day then my mother had the wit to observe that she hoped it would be equally fine on the day of the sports and she was so sorry she would miss them as she understood mr sharpes house was likely to win a good many of the events and of course her sympathies were entirely that way this went down beautifully and drew from coxhead the remark its a pity sari mean jones ivis out of it he might have got the quartermile are the names down yet i asked yes we stuck them down today said langrish any one else in for the senior mile no only tempest and redwood another pauseeverybody evidently meditating what my mother would like to hear next my mother meanwhile moved to the sideboard and began to pour out tea do you take cream and sugar she said with a pleasant smile to langrish how relieved i was she did not call him everard or dear yes pleasecan i pass round he replied it was admirable i had been in terror lest he would have collared the first cup and stuck to it thank you if you will please i see they are beginning to get your old house ready for rebuilding it wont be ready this term though said warminster it will takea slice of cake thanks no sugar for me thanks said coxhead i wonder if jarman will have to pay for it does your mater take cream and sugar said purkis to me in an aside i shouldnt think so said langrish because he didnt do it on purpose you know thank you very much do you mind putting it down there and wont you sit down said my mother setting the example i expect hed better give up smoking as hes always setting things on fire ventured i mother knows about the guy last term dont you mother yes indeed said she with a laugh which won over the philosophers in a body that was a lucky escape for everybody i was horrified well old sari mean jones iv i think he understands his nickname better than his real name said my clever parent old sarah said langrish getting rapidly at his ease let us in for that you see cake up please it was this way and he launched forth into an account of that famous adventure into which the company one by one cut at my expense of course and highly to the diversion of my mother meanwhile the teapot was kept busy and the jam went its roundssome of it on to coxheads shirtfrontand by the end of it all the philosophers found themselves comfortably at home i say said i when a break came hows the club getting on anything fresh langrish glanced round at my mother ive got the minutebook he said would she oh do said she is it an account of your meetings i would like to hear it immensely debating societies are such capital things i think its a bit down on sarah though said the secretary dubiously why i wasnt there said i werent you thats all lets hear it said my mother i dare say he deserves it i forgave the dear traitress for giving me away like this for i felt sure the minutes would save our evening you see said trimble we try to keep it fair so its down on some of the others too but sarah gets it a little the hottest im used to getting things hot by now said i forge ahead and sit where i can shy the pillow at you whereupon langrish moved his chair to a conspicuous place and read a meeting of the phcc was held in dormitory on february at pm why thats when the fire was said trimble shuti mean whats that got to do with it retorted the secretary well said my mother taking a stitch or two at her needlework owing to the side put on by the expresident who was lately kicked out for being a howling cad and because he was down in form order what a cram i interposed i was on the second desk and should have had you down weeks ago if i hadnt been laid up ha ha i like thatyou did your mater ever hear about corpore being the ablative masculine eh no i never heard about that said my mother all rightsarah will tell youwhere was i ohdown in form order though hes not quite such a crock as coxhead who is champion dunce in low heath me exclaimed coxhead warm with tea and indignation there you are said langrish anybody but a champion dunce would have said i you ask sarahs mater if they wouldnt well you if you like said coxhead what about it look here how can i read the minutes whenhere we arecrock as coxhead who is champion dunce in low heath what happened then said my mother looking a little mixed he was shunted to an outside berth and was out of it i rather think i was in it said i never mind oh if you think so all right the minutes say you were out of it hed not begun to snore many minutes with deafening effect when as might be expected jarman set fire to the show to stop the noise do you think thats why he did it really asked warminster look here young warminster i dont think i pity you dont now and then remarked the newlyelected president langrish looked hard at his colleague and then glanced at my mother whose face was bent over her work whereupon the secretary threw the minutebook at the presidents head and observed look out warminster hand up that book cant youits not yours my mother looked up and warminster meekly surrendered the book stop the noise the club then adjourned all except sarah who hung on contrary to the rules and is hereby fined shillings pence oh i say protested i thats rather rough isnt it but proceeded langrish owing to his mother coming up to buy him off he is hereby let off with a fie i mean a warning thank you so much said my mother gratefully when we thought he was pretty well warmed up we sent tempest in to fish him out which he accordingly did and is hereby elected honorary porter to the club and is backed to win the mile thats the least he deserves surely said my mother with feeling sarah owing to this unprincipled conduct has been suspended for a month and the club hereby hopes some day not far off to see him sus no thats wrongi mean hung suggested trimble in an audible whisper orderturn him out for saying hung instead of hanged said the president shut up cant you said the secretary cant you let me finish the sentence see him sussusceptible of better emotions hear hear said the club breathing again to see the corner turned i hope thats not all said my mother thats as far as weve got but well let him down easy in the next said langrish the next will have the account of the sports i suppose said my mother if our men win said warminster were bound to win the high jump if langrish keeps on his form he did feet and a half inches this afternoon you neednt talkyoure all right for the yards said the modest langrish theres no one in except young brown of the day cads who can touch you and hes sure to go a mucker on the day dont be too sure of that said i dicky brown doesnt go muckers if he can help it there you arebacking the town cads now i move and mrs jones seconds that sarah be and is hereby kici mean sat upon by the club oh dont please said my mother the bed is not strong enough all rightits lucky for sarah if you were half a chap youd see we didnt lose the quartermile rackstraw will have a look in at it but itll puzzle him to beat flitwick walsh is going to cut out for him so we may just do it but itll be a goeh paupers rackstraw and walsh both protested there would be no difficulty about it if only the track was in good order and their wind held out and flitwick muddled his start and finished a yard or two behind we were all prepared to stake the glory of sharpes on these trifling conditions presently the preparation bell began to toll and the party broke up with a cordiality and cheerfulness which contrasted strangely with the solemnity with which it had begun my mother was politely requested to become an honorary member of the club and as politely consented expressing a hope that she might meet with its honourable members many times again when they had gone she told me how much she had enjoyed the evening and how she liked every one of them and hoped they wouldnt think her rude to have laughed now and then but really she said not being used to it she could not help it next day she left and dismally enough i made the first use of my liberty to accompany her in the fly to the station she talked to me as only she could about the future and the spirit in which she thought i would take up once more the work of the term and the thankfulness which she the widow and i the orphan could not help feeling to the heavenly father who had saved us both from such peril and sorrow in the past she urged me to show my gratitude for my escape by seeking to follow more closely in the footsteps of that saviour to whom she had so often taught me to look for help and guidance and at the same time she urged me to pray for the guidance of the holy spirit her goodness only made my sorrow at parting the greater and more than any time since i had entered low heath the pangs of homesickness fell upon me as i saw her into her carriage just before the train started i felt my heart beat suddenly and the blood rush to my cheeks as i saw a figure with one hand in a sling running up the platform looking into one carriage after another mother heres tempest next moment he saw us and ran up i heard you were going by this train said he and i thought i would like to say goodbye goodbye my dear boy and god bless you once more the youngsters all right again i see said he putting his hand on my arm ill see he takes care of himselfgoodbye and the train steamed off leaving us two on the platform i hope your hands not awfully bad said i breaking a silence of nearly three months in the only way which occurred for the moment rather not wed better cab it backyoure not up to walking yet thanks awfully tempest for saving look here dont lets get on to that said he i say said i i was afraid you believed what crofter said and thought you were an ass tommyyou always werei ought to have remembered it of course i never believed a word crofter saidi saw his game but i was idiot enough to get riled at you for giving yourself away to him im sorry now lets forget it after all it was the best thing for me that all that row about my bills came out when it did you did me a better turn than you meant to do just like youif you try to do things the right way its all up with everybody but if you do them your own way they manage to come round somehow but crofters done you out of the captaincy so much the betteri didnt deserve it ill get it back some day perhaps and work it better come in to me to tea redwoods coming and old dicky too but youre against redwood for the mile said i thats no reason why i shouldnt give him a cup of tea is it you young mule the way he said it and the grip of his hand on my arm satisfied me that all was square once more between me and my dear old dux chapter twenty five a dead heat the few weeks during which i had been laid up had witnessed some curious changes in low heathat least they seemed curious to me dropping as i did suddenly into them first of all we poor sharpers were all burnt out the faggery was no more nor was the hall or the dormitory we were being put up temporarily in a town house just outside the school gates a good deal to the wrath of some of our number who felt it was putting them down to the level of the day boys however the sight of the scaffolding round our old quarters and the cheery clink of the trowel reminded us that out exile was not for long and that in a brandnew faggery on brand new chairs and round a brandnew table we should shortly resume our pleasant discussions on the deepest questions with which the human mind can occupy itself somehow apart from the fire things werent going exactly as i had left them pridgin was reported to be working harda most alarming symptom it was commonly surmised that he could not stand playing second or third fiddle to crofter and as tempest was apparently content to be second pridgin had come to the painful conclusion that the only comfortable place for him in sharpes was number one it was extremely inconvenient all round for it made it necessary for crofter to bestir himself while of course it seemed to threaten tempests chance of recovering his place a few of the shrewdest held that pridgin was merely forcing the pace in order to punish crofter for his usurpation it may have been so but whatever the motive it quite upset the normal flow of things at sharpes another change was a marked reaction of public opinion in favour of tempest and against crofter this was probably due in the first place to tempests exploit in rescuing me from the fire and secondly to crofters caution in declining to enter for the mile race at the coming sports a few weeks had dispelled the little glamour which the latter had derived from his apparently publicspirited conduct last term and the attitude of the philosophers had effectually deprived him of any opportunity of exercising his authority and left him to the enjoyment of an altogether barren honour one other change was that tempests necessity to live very economically in order to repay his grandfather for advances made had produced a coolness between him and wales who had now retired from the triumvirate and attached himself to the cause of crofter lastly mr jarman had suffered a shock and taken on badly about his accidental part in the recent fire it had knocked all the vice out of him for the time being at any rate and left him quite meek and limp just now however the only topic about which any one cared was as i speedily discovered the sports unusual keenness was being displayed everywhere the seniors were deeply concerned in the issue of the mile would redwood who had hitherto held his own easily save his laurels this time would tempest with his damaged hand be able to run his hardest would any dark horse at the last moment enter to divide the interest and so on among the middle boys considerable excitement was afoot especially in selkirks house where it was reported a boy of fifteen and a half was going to beat the senior record in the jump and perhaps run the public school record very close but the chief excitement was among us juniors we had modestly set before ourselves the task of winning every event under fifteen for sharpes house to say nothing of pulling the day boys over the chalk in the tug of war and generally bringing the philosophers well before the public notice the secret of our intention had been wellkept till within a week of the day we had been taunted with shirking our sports with being mugs and crocks and cripples with exercising the better part of valour with being afraid of being laughed at and so forth but we heard all with a conscious wink and went on with our practice round the corner then a week from the day we literally pelted the list with our names langrish put down for the high jump cricket ball broad jump and hurdles warminster set down his name under dicky browns for the hundred yards and next to griswolds for the hurdles coxhead entered for the cricket ball against the crack thrower in selkirks and rackstraw and walsh noble pair of paupers put in for the quarter mile which i was to have run against the fleetfooted flitwick altogether it was a big order and made the other houses look a little blue as we hoped it would the great day came at lasta perfect sports day with a light breeze blowing the track like elastic the takesoff clean and sharp and the field crammed with visitors and friends i had my work cut out for me that day it would have been far less exertion to run the quartermile i was to be coatminder timekeeper rubberdown straighttipper clapperontheback and bottleholder to the conversation club at large a sort of mixture of parent footman and retriever dog which flattering as it undoubtedly was to my sense of my own importance promised no little anxiety and exercise before the day was done as i strolled down somewhat early charged with the pleasing commission of bagging nine seats in the middle of the front row of the stand and seeing no one collared them i met redwood fresh as a daisy just returning from a final inspection of the ground hullo youngster youre not running i hear what a pity it doesnt matter said i do you mind my not backing you for the mile he laughed and said he should have thought poorly of me if i had not backed my own man is his hand all right now he asked he says so said i its worth six yards to you though you think so do you said he by the way will you do a job for me my two young sisters awfully want to be on the ground and theyve got leave if some one will look after them i cant how would you like to here was a thunderbolt i had a fair days work mapped out for myself as it was now i was to be saddled with a pair of teasing young female fidgets and held responsible for their good behaviour and general comfort what did people take me for why the mile itself wouldnt take it out of me half as much all right said i where are they im going home ill send them down sharp before the crowd comes thanks awfully youngster and off he went leaving me pretty full up with the cares of this deceitful world i proceeded to bag the nine best seats on the stand which as nobody else had yet put in an appearance was easy enough without the trying necessity of sitting on them all at the same time when the crowd arrived it would be time enough to consider how i should then have to act i had not been long in possession when two dainty little figures in pink bore down handinhand upon me presumably under the protection of a nurse who however was not in it when it came to racing theres horrid sarah remarked mamie who tried to drown me never mind said gladys he was nearly burned to death to punish him for being wicked i hate him because he never gives us sweeties said mamie never mind said gladys bobby says its not his fault that hes a mule i dont like mules though do you i hate them said the uncompromising mamie please master jones said the nurse the mistress says will you see the young ladies behave nicely and dont dirty their frocks be good girls now she added by way of final admonition as she departed i watched her go with the helpless despair of a man on a spar who watches the lifeboat put off with its last load for the shore the young ladies almost before nurse was gone began to run along the rows of chairs falling down once in twelve and rapidly toning down the pretty pink of their frocks to a sombre brick hue i was thankful when the crowd began to drop in and i was able by threats of taking them home before the races began to reduce them at least to the nine seats for which i was responsible how i wished i had some sweets in order to reduce them to only three by good luck dicky brown hove in sight just as i was giving way to despair dicky old chap said i if you love me get sixpennyworth of bulls eyes or something id be grateful to you as long as i live dicky looked at me anxiouslyevidently concerned for my health but a jerk of my head in the direction of the two little vixens who were just then trying to pull a solemnlooking day boy off one of the chairs by main force satisfied him that the case was an urgent one and like a brick he flew off to the rescue the solemn day boy stood his persecution as long as he could and then rounded sharply on his persecutors bother you go away he growled whereupon in floods of tears the misses redwood made for me and insisted on being taken up one on each knee and cosseted because of what the big ugly boy had done i complied with the energy of despair conscious that in so doing i was allowing the reserved seats one by one to be usurped and was at the same time rendering myself a spectacle of contempt to at least eight young persons whom in the gap left between the two wet faces which clung to my either cheek i could see advancing in a body clad in running drawers and blazers in our direction it was vain for me to try to escape from my false position the nearer the philosophers approached the more maudlin and effusive these unprincipled young females became flinging their arms tragically round my neck and bedaubing my face with their dewy kisses sarah can go it a bit when he likes said langrish with a cheerful guffaw standing in a conspicuous place and calling public attention to me in a way which only added to my sorrows rather i wondered why he went down so early said coxhead birds of a feather said the sententious trimble play the fool together i say what about our seats though they are bagged said i getting my face clear for a moment i couldnt keep them i dare say you mean you were so busy spooning about with girls you never thought of it all right miss molly said warminster i think we could squash up a bit here said i meekly looks as if you could said langrish squash away then and to the wrath and indignation of the whole stand the philosophers crowded in in a solid phalanx and proceeded to accommodate their eight persons in the space usually allotted to two it took some time for the other seatholders to appreciate the humour of the manoeuvre and before then the bell had rung for the first race and dicky had returned with the brandyballs which he deftly smuggled into my hand as he trotted past it was now easy to square the misses redwood who for a blessed half hour cried truce it was in vain that i suggested that they had better not plaster their faces and frocks more than could be helped with the sticky substance of their succulent pabulum they contemptuously ignored my right to make any suggestion of the kind and i finally abandoned them to their fate the first few events were trial heats in which we as a body were not specially interested but when the bell rang up for the hundred yards under fifteen the sports had begun for us in earnest leaving the two daughters of eve with the bag of brandyballs between them i clambered out of my place to perform the last rites for warminster who was to carry the colours of sharpes against dicky brown of the day boys muskett of selkirks and another outsider it went a little to my heart to be rubbing down somebody elses calves but dickys on an occasion like this but such is life patriotism goes before friendship and times do come when one must wish confusion to ones dearest brother so i rubbed down one of warminsters calves while trimble rubbed the other and langrish gave him a word of advice about his start and coxhead arranged to call on him for his spurt twenty yards from the finish with the exception of the other evening when he arrived at my mothers party i had never seen warminster so meek and nervous he behaved exactly as if we were taking a last farewell and would i think have embraced us had we encouraged him to do so now then said langrish give us your blazer bend well over your toes for the start and do it all in a breath run straight on your track and dont try to take the other chaps water said trimble dont look round at me when i yell but bucket all you can said coxhead dont pull up till after the pistol has gone said i then we left him to his work and well enough he did it he and dicky went off at the start as if theyd been shot out of a doublebarrelled gun dicky with his head down our man with his head up that was what saved him halfway over dicky had to get his chin up and it lost him a sixteenth of a second and that meant six inches selkirks man made an ugly rush thirty yards from home but he began it too soon warminster wisely waited till he heard coxheads shrill geeup in his ear then he laid on and made his six inches eight and his eight ten and landed so much in front of dicky amid cheers which if the clouds had been a little lower would have assuredly brought on a shower one score to us i was sorry for dicky but it couldnt be helped its your fault said he the brandyballs did it i took one you know never mind i say look at your kids the kids in question had finished the brandyballs and resenting my desertion had decided to follow me into the open as i had reached it by swarming over the front of the stand and dropping a foot or so on to the earth they naturally selected that route as most suitable for them they had half accomplished it to the extent of getting over the edge of the low parapet and beginning to lower themselves on the outside when mamies frock caught in a nail which suspended her between heaven and earth while gladys in her uncertainty whether to scream or assist had toppled to the ground all of a heap and solved the difficulty that way their screeches almost put our loyal cheers to the blush and when i rushed up to extricate the one and pick up the other i was in the centre of a hullaballoo which almost threatened to wreck the sports how they quieted down i know not i believe it was my announced determination to walk them straight home which did it at any rate it was clear to me there was no more rubbing down of sharpes calves for me that day i must remain like casabianca on deck even though it cost us all the events of the day it was a thankless task first of all there was the usual ceremony of cosseting and drying tears then with a pin i had to mend the rent in mamies frock then i had to kiss both of gladyss elbows to make them well and finally i had to stand a fusillade of chaff and jeers from the philosophers which made life a heavier burden that it was already at last to my joy the bell rang up for the high jump under fifteen and public attention was diverted from my lamentable case as everybody who knew anything had anticipated langrish won this metaphorically speaking on his head he knocked out the second man a selkirker at feet and half an inch and went on gamely inches higher clearing the bar as prettily and daintily as wales himself might have done in the open event it was not at all certain he could not have gone higher against an opponent but having no such spur he grew careless and after barely shaking down the bar twice at feet inches kicked it off awkwardly the third time and so retired an easy victor and quite overcome by the applause of the now crowded field then came the event of the daythe open mile for which tempest and redwood were the only combatants i felt myself growing as nervous as if i were running myself for my instinct told me that the welfare of sharpes more or less hung on the issue could tempest but win there would be no doubt that he would return to the headship of the house with an eclat which even crofter would have to yield to if not crofter might still hang on to the reins and claim his doubtful rights a complication of an unexpected kind arose now the misses redwood were quite sufficiently au fait with the etiquette of a racecourse to know that if their brother ran he must win and that everybody else must wish him to win in an unguarded moment i joined in the cheer which greeted tempest as he appeared stripped for action on his way to the starting post this was taken up as a grievous personal affront the young ladies repudiated and flung me from them with an energy and disgust which quite astonished me they loudly clamoured for my removal and failing that made a concerted retreat from my detested vicinity nasty horrid sarah go away they shouted then spying dicky brown in the distance they shrieked on him to deliver them want to go to dickydear dicky get away from sarah and suiting the action to the word they swarmed over the back of the bench and started in full cry for the enviable dicky richard however was an old bird for his years and did not or pretended not to hear their siren voices and sheered off into the open just in the nick of time whereupon the misses redwood redoubled their clamour and could only be allured back to the shelter of my fatigued wing by my going to them and audibly bawling in their faces bravo redwood go it redwood on these terms they surrendered and the difficulty at the cost indeed of my reputation as a loyal sharper was temporarily tided over it was noticed that tempest though cool as ever was pale and carried his left hand while he stood waiting in the opening of his waistcoat i saw redwood go to him and say something pointing as he did so to the hand tempests reply was a flush and a laugh as he removed his hand from its restingplace and waved it about at his side i did not like it but it was too late now mr jarman stood ready with his pistol up the noise of the field suddenly changed to silence and the two athletes with arms out stood straining on the line off it was a good start and the pace was startling for a mile tempest had the inside track he seemed to have the advantage in lightness of step while redwoods strength was more in length of stride the first of the four laps was run almost inch for inch perhaps tempest thanks to his berth had a foot to the good as they entered on the second here our man forged ahead slowly and gradually drew to a clear lead but we trembled as we saw it would he stay apparently he ran as lightly as before but redwood as he lay on at his heels seemed to be going even easier however the halfmile saw tempest three yards ahead and still going then to our concern we saw redwoods stride lengthen a little and watched inch after inch of the interval shrink until at the end of the third lap there was scarcely more difference than there had been at the end of the first yet our man was still to the front and now it was almost difficult for us onlookers to breathe for the tug was at hand the fourth lap had scarcely begun when a wild yell called attention to the fact that tempest was once more putting it on what was still more satisfactory was that he was going as well as ever although in that respect so was redwood the gap opened again the foot grew to a yard and the yard to half a dozen and the halfdozen to at last it was but two hundred yards from home when redwoods stride once more lengthened out and a new shout told us all that the chasm was once more being filled up inch by inch and foot by foot tempest heard the shout and knew what it meant he too lengthened his stride and seemed as if he was going to answer rush for rush but our hearts stood still and our tongues clave to the roofs of our mouths as we perceived that it would not come off he could barely keep up his present pace would it see him through perhaps half the distance was passed and redwood had only recovered a third of his lead then the yells broke out every one wished he could lend his man an inch or the hundredth part of an inch redwoods rush increased and the vanishing inches struck panic into our philosophic breasts could tempest but hold out these few yards we were safe he would no yes no theyre all but level another six yards then suddenly we saw tempest fling his hand behind and reel forward with a blind stagger over the tape and as the simultaneous report proclaimed a dead heat fall sprawling and helpless on the ground the cheers died on our lips for it was surely something more than exhaustion or broken wind redwood was beside him in a moment and drew his head on his knee it was a dead faintnot from fatigue but from pain his burned and blistered hand which he had so carefully concealed from everybody and of which he had made so little betrayed the secret plainly enough for once his pride and determination had overrated his physical strength he had calculated on just being able to win the race all he had done was just to save it at a price which as it turned out was to cost him weeks of illness and even threaten the loss of a hand the news of his calamity spread like wildfire and put an end as far as i at least was concerned to the sports for the day we heard later in the day that he was in the sanatorium in a high fever next day he was delirious and the notice on the board told us that the doctor considered his condition dangerous the next day his old grandfather the only relative he had came down and the next summoned by my urgent message my dear mother then for a day or two we were kept in suspense till one happy afternoon the bulletin reported a change for the better and presently the welcome news came that all danger was past for me at least that was the happiest day of my life except perhaps that a week later when my mother as a special privilege allowed me to see him for a moment he was sitting up in bed smiling but pale tell me he said ive never heard yet did i win the mile dead heat said i what time four four and a half a record isnt it it was worth the grind i had my doubts but knew better than to say so chapter twenty six a good showup all round it was the last day but one of the summer term and the philosophers were in a ferment the lists were to be out in the afternoon and a score of events were to be decided by them was i to get on to the top form of my division and if so was it langrish or purkis who was to be displaced or was i after all my grind to yield a place to the truculent coxhead more than that was warminster to be beaten after all by a day boy called dicky brown who amid all the changes and distractions of the term had stuck doggedly to his work and was reported a hot man for the head place in the junior division all this was exciting enough but it was as nothing to the tussle at the head of the school pridgins alarming burst of work in the easter term had contrary to all expectation not died out every one prophesied he would sicken of it wales laughed at him crofter smiled sweetly tempest inquired frequently after his health and even redwood knocked off some of his extra cricket to keep pace with it what are you trying to do asked tempest one day as his friend looked in nothing my dear fellow only amusing myself i assure you you have a queer idea of fun do you know ive hardly been out on the river all the term owing to you dont let me prevent you old chap the exercise will do you good tempest laughed i hope yours will do you good but two can play at your game two half a dozenive not got my knife into you though who crofter rather i see no other way of taking it out of him he shirks sports and takes his pound of flesh out of the captaincy although he knows hes no right to it and no one not even the rowdies in the faggery respects him thats why were going steady said i just to rile him the only way to take it out of him is to make him sit up and harry him said the amiable pridgin i only hope though it wont land me head of the house im depending on you to beat me but im not going to play second fiddle to crofter it will serve you right if it does land you head responded tempest if it does well have to keep you up to the mark and see you dont shirk dont say that old chap or i shall jack it up said pridgin putting his feet upon the windowledge besides does it occur to you that redwoods leaving and that the second man up if hes one of us is left not only captain of sharpes but captain of low heath i know said tempest quietly but they say leslie of selkirks is in the running for that stuff and nonsense retorted pridgin tempest of sharpes is the man for my money tempest laughed again but it was a sort of laugh which did not bode well for leslie of selkirks this talk had been a fortnight ago since then the examinations had come and gone the philosophers sobered and perspiring had been spread out at twodesk intervals on three fatal days in the large hall with day boys to right of them and selkirkers to left writing for their lives and groaning over questions which only a fiend could have devised and only a doublefirst could have answered how i had got on i could no more tell than the man in the moon my comrades when we compared notes afterwards cheerfully assured me that out of some fifty questions on the three days i had possibly got half a question right but that that was doubtful and depended on the particular crib the examiner swore by redwood to whom i confided some of my answers thought rather more hopefully of my case and told me to keep my spirits up tempest said that if he were to cuff me for every discreditable blunder i had made i should have earache for a month dicky on the other hand confessed that he wished he could believe he had done as well as i as for the other philosophers general discouragement was the order of the day it was moved and seconded that coxhead be kicked for having made amnis feminine and having translated the french impasse as instep and trimble was temporarily suspended from the service of the conversation club because he had put a decimal dot in the wrong place public feeling ran so high that any departure from the rules of syntax or algebra was regarded as treason against the house and dealt with accordingly on the whole therefore we were glad when the time of suspense came to an end how matters had gone with the seniors it was even more difficult to surmise than it had been in our case the day after the end of their exams redwood and tempest with pridgin to cox rowed twelve miles down stream and back and returned cheerful and serene and even jocular leslie of selkirks also spent a pleasant afternoon in the school laboratory whistling to himself as he mixed up his acids crofter and wales mooned about under the trees in the field somewhat limply but showed no outward signs of distress altogether speculation was baffled and it was almost irritating to find the chief actors in the drama refusing to take the momentous question seriously how did you get on i asked tempest youll hear tomorrow said he so shall i do you think youll beat leslie either that or hell beat me or itll be a dead heat said he there was no dealing with frivolity of this kind and tempest ever since his recovery last term had been rapidly regaining all his old frivolity and lightheartedness it was a trying ordeal on result day sitting patiently in hall till the doctor made up his mind to appear all the school was there there was an unusual spirit of orderliness afoot the few irresponsible ones who with nothing to lose tried to get up a disturbance were promptly squashed by the grim anxious competitors to whom the coming results meant so much we philosophers huddled together for comfort but not a joke travelled down the line we sat and drummed our fingers on the desk before us and wondered why on earth the doctor on a day like this should take such an unearthly time to put on his cap and gown at last he appeared paper in hand and glasses on nose i could see dicky just in front of me catch a quick breath and tempest up in the front brush his hair back with his fingers and there arose before my mind in horrible review all the palpable blunders of my own examination papers lower school began the doctor in a hard dry unemotional voice aggregate form orderout of a possible marks brown iii day boy and jones iv mr sharpes bracketed first with marks what me bracketed top with dicky go along with you but a huge thump on the back from warminster followed by a huger from langrish the vision of dickys consciously blushing cheeks as flitwick performed the same office for him and above all a nod across the room from redwood and a grin from tempest convinced me that there was something in it after all of course it was a mistake and when the marks came to be counted again it would be put right but while it lasted it wasnt bad what was the doctor saying a very good performance both of you and the result of honest hard work it was true then there was no humbug about it oh i must write to my mother this very afternoon warminster mr sharpes second good also corderoy mr selkirks third langrish mr sharpes fourth trimble mr sharpes sixth purkis mr sharpes seventh coxhead mr sharpes eighth mr sharpes boys have worked excellently this termquin day boy ninth rackstraw mr sharpes tenth and so the list went on i was too much lost in the wonder of my own success to appreciate all at once the glorious significance of the whole result but as the philosophers crowded in a little closer on one another and the friendly nudge went round it began to dawn on me every one of our men had given a good account of himself even coxhead and the pauper rackstraw not one of the old gang but was eligible for the club not one but had done something to put the day boys and selkirks and everybody else to bed as langrish said just like your side said the latter to me trying to make out youd made a mess of it you can only make a mess of it young sarah when you try not to when you do try you cant do it and with another thump on the back our excellent secretary gave me to know he bore me no malice but on the contrary was pleased to favour me with his general approbation but more was yet to come compared with the aggregates the details of how we had passed each examination were more or less tame and we were impatient to get on to the senior results the middle school had to come first as a rule we were not greatly concerned in them except as belonging to the division into which some of us would probably be promoted next term but such as they were they kept up the credit of sharpes a selkirker did indeed head the list but after him a string of four of our fellows followed after them a day boy and then two more sharpers more back patting crowding up conscious blushes and congratulations then the doctor put down one paper and took up another and every one knew what was coming upper school read the doctor in exactly the same voice as if this announcement were of no more importance than any other aggregate form orderout of a possible marks redwood captain of the school and day boy we were obliged to interrupt a little here there would not be many more chances of cheering old redwood and we couldnt afford to chuck them away so we cheered and gave the doctor time to polish up his glasses and take a sip of water your cheers said he when at last we had relieved ourselves are welldeserved in addition to this capital result redwood takes the low heath scholarship to trinity where i almost venture to prophesy we shall hear even greater things of him some day more cheers but we were too impatient to hear what came next to interpose too long a delay tempest mr sharpes second all the more gratifying when we remember the causes which interrupted his school work for a time last term we fairly gave ourselves away now sharpes had reached the top of the tide with a vengeance there was an end to all uncertainty as to who would be its captain and there was the glorious certainty that the captain of sharpes would also be captain of low heath three cheers rather but still we could not till the rest of the list was read give ourselves up to cheering for as long as we should have liked so we allowed the doctor to proceed pridgin mr sharpes third very close good old pridgin all his discomfort had not been for nothing he had taken it out of crofter after all by how much leslie mr selkirks fourth wales mr sharpes fifth crofter mr sharpes sixth a cool hundred between them we had the decency not to rub it in too hard it was clear by the disconcerted look in the face of our so called captain that he was more surprised than any one he smiled of course and leant across to pat pridgin on the back but that was just his waywe knew well enough that it cloaked a bitter mortification and why worry the poor beggar with letting him see we noticed it so we waited till we got outside and then let ourselves loose on tempest and pridgin and positively injured our voices with cheering that afternoon in the faggery our jubilant review of the situation was combined with a windup meeting of the conversation club for the term jolly good show for us said langrish crofters pretty sick but itll do him good i move and third and sarah seconds and fourths that we send him a resolution of condolence better let him alone suggested i shut up or youll get jolly well kicked out of the club said the secretary if you dont want to be civil its no reason why we shouldnt i had imagined i was on the whole more concerned for crofters feelings than they but putting it in the way they did i could hardly resist so the following resolution was solemnly drawn up and ordered to be conveyed to the late mr crofter that this meeting of the philosophical conversation club is hereby jolly glad to see tempest cock of the house again with pridgin second man up it hereby condoles with crofter in the jolly back seat he has got to take and is sorry he shirked the mile it begs to inform him that he is a hundred and eighteen marks behind tempest and trusts he will in future obey the house captain to whom all applications for exeats and extra leave are to be addressed crofter need not trouble to reply as the club only desires to have communication with the cock of the house this done i was ordered to take the chair as the new president and called upon the secretary to read the minutes these were short and to the point a general meeting of the conversation club was held on monday in the examination hall with his usual mulishness sarah thought hed have a cut in and it was resolved to give him a chance thanks to the drivelling idiotcy of warminster who doesnt even know the feminine genitive of corpus he scraped through and as he couldnt do much worse than coxhead he did a shade better all very well growled coxhead he did a jolly sight better than you coxhead who is hereby expelled for using slang was as usual down with the paupers at the bottom a town cad called brown who managed to conceal his cribs came out first and it was decided to tack sarah on to him trimble as might be expected came a cropper in his english grammar a cram they never examined us in it there you are you dont even know it when you see itcame a cropper in his english grammar i tell you i didnt expostulated trimble shut up shut what up yourself come and shut me a warm argument ensued which knocked over the table and was only composed by my reminding the club that we didnt want to disturb the peace of the new cock of the house on his first night all right said langrish where was ienglish grammar purkis not having paid his subscription naturally came out too low to be classed but to give him a lift he was allowed to be stuck in between trim and coxhead who being outsiders at the best of times had plenty of room for another all very wellwhat sort of howler did you come asked the outraged purkis it being considered well to stick one selkirker into the list the hon secretary made room for corderoy and is hereby thanked on his retirement hullo said i dont say that langrish fact is said langrish dropping the minutes ive got to ive gone down you see oh but youve worked like a carthorse i move trim seconds warminster thirds coxhead fourths purkis fifths and the paupers sixth that old lang be and hereby is perpetual secretary of the phcc and that its all rot his retiring oh all serene said langrish evidently pleased thats your look out where was ithanked on his retirement but as nobody else can read his writing he is hereby asked to hang on which he hereby does the meeting then adjourned we decided to celebrate the evening by a state tea as which the usual loyal and patriotic toasts were given of which i will only trouble the reader with one that delivered by warminster the late president its a sell of course getting down but we all had a good look in and sals come out best man this once we arent going to jack it up though and hell have to mind his eye cheers after all what with the mess he made over tempests bills loud cheers and the shindy about the guy and all that rot about the barge hes shown hes fit for the job laughter but hell have to make a good showup for sharpes now or well let him know weve scored a bit of a record and we dont want to fool it away loud cheers and any fellow who doesnt put it on doesnt deserve to be a phcc or anything like prolonged applause gentlemen with these remarks i beg to give the health of the army and navy and reserve forces loud cheers the reserve forces were the most striking feature after all about the windup of the conversation club that night before i went to bed i looked in at tempests study where to my delight i found dicky brown hullo i was just coming to fetch you said the new captain dont you think this a pretty good show for old plummer rather said dicky i wonder how hes getting on and i wonder if the pond is full up again yet by the way said tempest ive never hided you for collaring that pistol of mine i may as well do it now fire away said i i dont mind taking a licking from the captain of low heath it sounds queer doesnt it said tempest disarmed by this compliment between you and me kids i think we ought to be able to make the thing work next term rather said i only we shall have to keep sitting up to do it so much the better said they the end
