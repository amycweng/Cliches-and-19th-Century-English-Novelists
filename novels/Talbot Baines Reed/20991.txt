follow my leader the boys of templeton by talbot baines reed having now read all of this authors books about school life rather dated even to me i feel that this book is the one i have enjoyed the most it was not published as a book until seven or eight years after the authors death but that was because the book had been published in serialised form in the boys own paper while the original text looked quite nice it suffered from having been typeset either by an apprentice or by someone rather eccentric for example words with an apostrophe representing the o of not had the apostrophe consistently in the wrong place for example wouldnt instead of wouldnt we have very carefully cleaned up this class of error and hope no more are to be found we have heard the audiobook and it is good the main heroes of the story are all lovable gentle little chaps but dreadful things happen like a boat they have used goes missing and a folding pencil one of them desperately desires in the stationers shop goes missing from the shop thus throughout the book there is a constant tension as to whether the police will be called and eventually one of the boys sends for his father to help sort matters out as they had got far beyond his own ability to deal with things follow my leader the boys of templeton by talbot baines reed chapter one the boys of templeton how our heroes enter upon more than one career on a raw damp morning in early spring a rather forlorn group of three youngsters might have been seen on the doorstep of mountjoy preparatory school casting nervous glances up and down the drive and looking anything but a picture of the life and spirits they really represented that they were bound on an important journey was very evident they were muffled up in ulsters and wore gloves and top hatsa vanity no mountjoy boy ever succumbed to except under dire necessity yet it was clear they were not homeward bound for no trunks encumbered the lobby and no suggestion of dulce domum betrayed itself in their dismal features nor had they been expelled for though their looks might favour the supposition they talked about the hour they should get back that evening and wondered if mrs ashford would have supper ready for them in her own parlour and it was equally plain that whatever their destination might be they were not starting on a truants expedition for the said mrs ashford presently came out and handed them each a small parcel of sandwiches and enjoined on them most particularly to keep well buttoned up and not let their feet get wet it will be a cold drive for you boys said she ive told tom to put up at markridge so you will have a mile walk to warm you up before you get to templeton a waggonette appeared at the end of the drive and began to approach them ah theres the trap ill tell mr ashford mr ashford appeared just as the vehicle reached the door well boys ready for the road good bye and good luck dont forget whose son edward the fifth was coote keep your heads and youll get on all right i trust you not to get into mischief on the way all right tom during this short harangue the three boys hoisted themselves one by one into the waggonette and bade a subdued farewell to their preceptor who stood on the doorstep waving to them cheerily until they turned a corner and found themselves actually on the road to templeton not to keep the reader further in suspense as to the purpose of this important expedition our three young gentlemen having severally attained the responsible age of fourteen summers and having severally absorbed into their systems as much of the scholastic pabulum of mountjoy house as that preparatory institution was in the habit of dispensing to boys destined for a higher sphere were this morning on their way in awe and trembling to the examination hall of templeton school there to submit themselves to an ordeal which would decide whether or not they were worthy to emerge from their probationary state and take their rank among the public schoolboys of the land such being the case it is little wonder they looked fidgety as they caught their last glimpse of mr ashford and realised that before they came in sight of mountjoy again a crisis in the lives of each of them would have come and gone whose son was he said coote appealingly in about five minutes his voice sounded quite startling after the long solemn silence which had gone before his two companions stared at him afterwards at one another then one of them said i forget whose son was he said coote turning with an air of desperation to the other richard the thirds said the latter coote mused and inwardly repeated a string of names doesnt sound right said he are you sure dick who else could it be said the young gentleman addressed as dick whose real name was richardson hanged if i know said the unhappy coote proceeding to write an r and a on his thumbnail with a pencil it doesnt look right i believe because your own names richardson you think everybody else is richards son too and the perpetrator of this very mild joke bent his head over his learned thumbnail and frowned it was a point of honour at mountjoy always to punish a joke summarily whether good bad or indifferent for a short time consequently the paternity of edward the fifth was lost sight of as was also coote himself in the performance of the duty which devolved on richardson and his companion this matter of business being at last satisfactorily settled and tom the driver who had considerately pulled up by the roadside during the negotiations being ordered to forge ahead the party returned to its former attitude of gloomy anticipation its a precious rum thing said richardson neither you nor heathcote can remember a simple question like that id almost forgot it myself i know i shant remember anything when the time comes said heathcote i said my latin syntax over to ashford without a mistake yesterday and ive forgotten every word of it now what i funk is the viva voce latin prose said coote i say dick whats the gender of amnis a river dick looked knowing and laughed none of your jokes said he you dont catch me that wayamnis a city is neuter cootes face lengthened as he made a further note on his other thumb nail i could have sworn it was a river said he i say whatever shall i do i dont know how i shall get through it through whatthe river said heathcote bless you youll get through swimmingly there was a moments pause richardson looked at coote coote looked at richardson and between them they thought they saw a joke tom pulled up by the roadside once more while heathcote arranged with his creditors on the floor of the waggonette when at length the order to proceed was given that trusty jehu ventured on a mild expostulation lookee here young geman said he touching his hat youve got to get to templeton by ten oclock and its past nine now i guess youd better save up them larks for when youre coming home none of your cheek tom said richardson or well have you down here and pay you out my boy put it on cant you why dont you whip the beast up the prospect of coming down to be paid out by his vivacious passengers was sufficiently alarming to tom to induce him to take their admonition seriously to heart and for the rest of the journey although several times business transactions were taking place on the floor of the vehicle the plodding horse held on its course and markridge duly hove in sight with the approaching end of the journey the boys once more became serious and uncomfortable i say said coote in a whisper as if dr winter at templeton a mile away were within hearing do tell me whose son he was im certain he wasnt richard the thirds dont be a cad dick you might tell a fellow id tell you if i knew ive told you one father said dick sternly and he didnt have more if you want another stick down edward the sixth cootes face brightened as he produced his pencil and cleaned his largest unoccupied nail that sounds more oh but i say how can edward the sixth be edward the fifths father besides he had no family and oh what a howling howler i shall come his friends regarded him sympathetically and assisted him to dismount we shall have to step out said richardson its fiveandtwenty to ten and its a good mile look here tom youve got to come and fetch us at the school do you hear were not going to fag back here after the exam my orders was to wait here till you pick me up young gentlemen said tom grinning mind what youre up to in them saminations with which parting sally our heroes found themselves alone with their faces towards templeton to any wayfarers less overwhelmed with care that mile walk from markridge to templeton over the breezy downs with the fresh sea air meeting you with the musical hum of the waves on the beach below and the glimmer of the spring sun on the ocean far ahead would have been bracing and inspiriting as it was it was not without its attractions even for the three boys for did they not stand on the precincts of that enchanted ground occupied and glorified by the heroes of templeton was not this very road along which they walked a highway along which templeton walked or peradventure raced or it may be bicycled were not these downs the huntingground over which the templeton harriers coursed in chase of the templeton hares was not that square tower ahead the very citadel of their fortress and that distant bell that tolled was it not a voice which spoke to templeton in tones of familiar fellowship every hour they trembled as they heard that bell and came nearer and nearer to the grand square tower they eyed furtively everyone who passed them on the road and imagined every man a master and every boy a templetonian a shop with mortarboards displayed in its window seemed like a temple crowded with shrines and a confectioners shop in which two young gentlemen in gowns sat and refreshed themselves was like a distant glimpse of olympus where the gods banqueted a boy with a towel over his shoulder lounged past them and surveyed them listlessly as he went by how they cowered and trembled beneath that scrutiny how they dreaded lest their jackets might be too long or that the studs in their shirts might not be visible how they hated themselves for blushing and wished to goodness they knew what to do with their hands how their legs shook beneath them as they came under the shadow of the great tower and looked nervously for the porters lodge they would have liked to look as if they knew the place it seemed so foolish to have to ask any one where the porter lived just go and see if its up that passage said richardson to coote pointing out a narrow opening on one side of the tower coote looked at the place doubtfully hadnt we better all try said he whats the good beckon if its right and well come the unfortunate coote departed on his quest much as a man who walks into a cave where a bear possibly resides his companions meanwhile occupied themselves with examining the gateway and trying to appear as if architectural curiosity and nothing else had been the object of their passing visit to templeton in a few minutes coote reappeared with a long face well is it right no its a dustbin the great clock above them began to boom out ten we must find out somehow said richardson wed better ask at this door and to the alarm of his companions he boldly tapped on a door under the gate a man in uniform opened it well young gentlemen whats your pleasure please can you tell us where the porters lodge is said richardson in his most persuasive tone i can im the porter and this is the lodge what do you want please were mr ashfords boys come for the examination heres a note from mr ashford for dr winter the porter took the note and bade the panicstricken trio follow him across the quadrangle what a walk that was across that noble square with its two great elm trees laden with noisy rooks with its widefenced lawn and sundial with its cloisters and red brick houses with its sculptures and latin mottoes and even all these were as nothing to the few boys who loitered about in its enclosuresome pacing arminarm some hurrying with books under their arms some diverting themselves more or less noisily some shouting or whistling or singingall at home in the place and all unlike the three trembling victims who trotted in the wake of the porter towards the dreadful hall of examination at the door richardson felt a frantic clutch on his arm oh i say dick gasped coote holding out a shaking ringer with a legend on its nail whatever is this the date for i put it down and oh i say cant you remember but richardson though he scorned to show it was too agitated even to suggest an event to fit the disconsolate date and poor coote had to totter up the stairs hopelessly convinced that he had nothing at his fingers ends after all they found themselves walking up a long highceilinged room with desks all round and a few very appalling oil portraits ranged along the walls to a table where sat a small handsome gentleman in cap and gown he took mr ashfords letter and the boys knew they stood in the presence of dr winter richardson heathcote coote said the doctor answer to your nameswhich is richardson i am please sir heathcote i am sir please coote i am if you please sir richardson go to desk heathcote desk coote desk coote groaned inwardly it was all up with him now and he might just as well throw up the sponge before he began with a friend within call he might yet have struggled through but what hope was there when the nearer of them was twelve desks away for two hours a solemn silence reigned in that examination hall broken only by the scratching of pens and the secret sighs of one and another of the victims the pictures on the walls as they looked down caught the eye of many a wistful upturned face and marked the devouring of many a penholder and the tearing of many a hair in vain coote searched his nails from thumb to little finger no question fitted to his painfully collected answers edward the fifth was ignored the sex of amnis was not even hinted at and never once came to his rescue and yet he reminded himself over and over again he and heathcote had said their latin syntax to mr ashford only the day before without a mistake cease writing said the doctor as the clock struck two and the boys at desks to come up here this was the signal for the cruellest of all that days horrors if the written examination had slain its thousands the viva voce slew its tens of thousands even richardson stumbled and heathcote when his turn came gave himself up for lost the doctors impassive face betrayed no emotion and gave no token either for joy or hope or despair he merely said that will do after each victim had performed and even when coote after a mighty effort rendered o tempora o mores as oh the tempers of the moors he quietly said thank you now the next boy at last it was all over and they found themselves standing once more in the great quadrangle not very sure what had happened to them but feeling as if they had just undergone a surgical operation not unlike that of flaying alive however once outside the terrible portal of templeton their hearts gradually thawed within them the confectioners shop now crowded with gods held them in awe for a season and as long as the road was specked with mortarboards they held their peace and meditated on their shirtstuds but when templeton lay behind them and they stepped once more on to the breezy heath they shook off the nightmare that weighed on their spirits and were themselves again precious glad its over said richardson beast that arithmetic paper was i liked it better than the english said coote i say is for a preposition or an adverb i couldnt remember oh look here shut up riddles now said richardson weve had enough of them lets talk about our three and not your for you coote you whereupon richardson started to run a proceeding which at once convinced his companions that his last observation had been intended as a joke as in duty bound they gave chase but the fleetfooted dick was too many for them and when at last they came up with him he was strongly intrenched on the boxseat of the empty waggonette at markridge with toms whip in his hand beyond all attack i say said he after his pursuers had taken breath and granted an amnesty it would be great fun to drive home by ourselves toms not here i asked them hes gone to see his aunt or somebody and left word hed be back at three oclock like his cheek i vote we dont wait for him all serene said the others but we shall want the horse shant we perhaps we shall said dick with a grin unless youd like to pull the trap the horse is in the stable and we can tip the fellow to put him in for us the fellow was quite amenable to this sort of persuasion and grinningly complied with the whim of the young gentlemen secretly enjoying the prospect of toms dismay taint no concern of mine said he philosophically if you tells me to do it i does it and if we tells you to open your mouth and shut your eyes and youll find sixpence in your handyoull find it there said dick of course you knows how to drive said the stableman rather do you think were babies here shy us the reins come along you fellows theres room for all three on the box now then joe give her her head come up you beast swish see if we dont make her step out let her go with some misgivings joe obeyed and next moment the waggonette swayed majestically out of the yard very much like a small steamtug going out of harbour in half a cap of wind rum the way she pitches said dick presently she didnt do it when we came looks to me as if the horse wasnt quite sober suggested coote perhaps if you pulled both reins at the same time instead of one at a time put in heathcote she wouldnt wobble so much you duffer shed stop dead if i did that suppose you dont pull either said heathcote richardson poohpoohed the notion but acted on it all the same with highly satisfactorily results the trap glided along smoothly and all anxiety as to the management of the mare appeared to be at an end i left word for tom said richardson if he stepped out hed catch us up ha ha wont he be wild wonder if hell get us in a row with ashford said heathcote not he whats the harm just a little horseplay thats all heathcote and coote became grave look here said the former we let you off last time but youll catch it now collar him that side coote and have him over dont be an idiot heathcote cried the jehu as he found himself suddenly seized on either hand let go while im driving do you hear coote let go or therell be a smash but as letting go was an accomplishment not taught at mountjoy house richardson had to adopt stronger measures than mere persuasion in order to clear himself of his embarrassments dropping the reins and flinging his arms vehemently back he managed to dislodge his assailants though not without dislodging himself at the same time and a long and somewhat painful creditors meeting down in the waggonette was the consequence the mare whose patience had been gradually evaporating during this strange journey conscious of the riot behind her and feeling the reins dropping loosely over her tail took the whole matter very much to heart and showed her disapproval of the whole proceedings by taking to her heels and bolting straight away the business meeting inside stood forthwith adjourned with scared faces the boys struggled to their feet and holding on to the rail of the boxseat peered over to ascertain the cause of this alarming diversion its a bolt said richardson the only one of the three who retained wits enough to think or speak hang on you fellows ill try and get the reins help me up as well as the swaying of the vehicle would allow it they helped him hoist himself up on to the box but for a long time all his efforts to catch the reins were in vain and once or twice it seemed as if nothing could save him from being pitched off his perch on to the road luckily the mare kept a straight course and at length by a tremendous stretch well supported from the rear by his faithful comrades the boy succeeded in reaching the reins and pulling them up over the mares tail hang on now said he were all right if i can only guide her chapter two how our heroes fall out and yet remain friends mountjoy house had a narrow escape that afternoon of losing three of its most promising pupils the boys themselves by no means realised the peril of their situation indeed after the first alarm and finding that by clinging tightly to the rail of the boxseat they could support themselves on their feet on the floor of the swinging vehicle heathcote and coote began almost to enjoy it and were rather sorry one or two of the templeton boys were not at hand to see how mountjoy did things richardson however with the reins in his hands but utterly powerless to check the headlong career of the mare or to do anything but guide her took a more serious view of the situation and heartily wished the drive was at an end it was a flat road all the way to mountjoyno steep hill to breathe the runaway and no ploughed field to curb her ardour it was a narrow road too so narrow that for two vehicles to pass one another it was necessary for one of the two to draw up carefully at the very verge and as the verge in the present case meant the edge of rather a steep embankment the prospect was not altogether a cheering one for an inexperienced boy who if he knew very little about driving knew quite well that everything depended on his own nerve and coolness and richardson not only had a head but knew how to keep it with a rein tightly clutched in each hand with his feet firmly pressed against the footboard with a sharp eye out over the mares ears and a grim twitch on his determined mouth he went over the chances in his own mind if she goes on like this we shall get to mountjoy in half an hour what a pace were bound to smash up before we get there perhaps these fellows had better try and jump for it hallo lucky we didnt go over that stone wonder if i could pull her up if i got on her back she might kick up and smash the trap wonder if she will pull up or go over the bank or what tomtom will have to run hard to catch us whew what a swing i could have sworn we were over this last peril and the involuntary cry of the two boys clinging on behind him silenced even this mental soliloquy for a bit but the waggonette after two or three desperate plunges righted itself and continued its mad career at the heels of the mare what would happen if we went over jolly awkward to get pitched over on to my head or down among the mares feet shed kick i guess those fellows inside could jump and by jove there comes something on the road were in for it now either a smash or over the bank or hallo theres a gate open this last inward exclamation was caused by the sight of an open gate some distance ahead through which a rough carttrack branched off from the road towards the sandhills on the left richardson with the instinct of desperation seized upon this as the only way of escape from the peril which threatened them look out you fellows cried he hang on tight on the right side while we turn and jump well out if we go over they watched him breathlessly as they came towards the gate the vehicle which was meeting them and their own were about equal distance from the place and it was clear their fate must be settled in less than a minute richardson waved to the driver of the approaching cart to pull up and at the same time edged the mare as far as he could on to the offside of the road so as to give her a wide turn in now for it said he to himself pulling the left rein if this dont do ill give up driving the mare perhaps weary perhaps perplexed at the sight of the cart in front perhaps ready for a new diversion obeyed the lead and swerved off at the gate for a moment the waggonette tottered on its left wheel and but for the weight of the two passengers on the other side would have caught the gate post and shattered itself to atoms in the narrow passage as it was it cleared the peril by an inch and then plunging on to the soft rough track capsized gently mare and all landing its three occupants a yard or two off with their noses in the mud it was an undignified end to an heroic drive and richardson as he picked himself up and cleared the mud from his eyes felt half disappointed that no bones were broken or joints dislocated after all coote did certainly contribute a grain of consolation by announcing that he believed one of his legs was broken but even this hope of glory was shortlived for that young hero finding no one at leisure to assist him to his feet rose by himself and walked some distance to a grass bank where he could sit down and examine for himself the extent of his injuries wal young squire said a voice at dicks side as that young gentleman found eyesight enough to look about him youve done it this time the owner of the voice was the driver of the cart and the tones and looks with which he made the remark were anything but unflattering to richardson it was a close squeak through the gate said the latter not six inches either side and if it hadnt been for the ruts we should have kept up all right till now i say do you think the traps damaged or the mare the mare was lying very comfortably on her side taking a good breath after her race and not offering to resume her feet as for the waggonette it was lying equally comfortably on its side with one wheel up in the air shaft broken said the driver thats all thats all said dick dolefully we shall catch it and no mistake the man grinned you cant expect to play games of that sort without scratching the varnish off said he no fault of yours you havent got your necks broke suppose we try to get her up said richardson looking as if this last information had very little comfort in it so among them they unharnessed the mare and managed to disengage her from the vehicle and get her to her feet shes all sound said the man after a careful overhauling shes a cad said dick and i shouldnt have been sorry if shed broken her neck look at the smash shes made the trap was indeed far worse damaged than they supposed as first not only was a shaft broken but a wheel was off and the rail all along one side was torn away it was clear there was no more driving to be got out of it that afternoon and the boys gave up the attempt to raise it in disgust do you know tom our manashfords man said dick who tom tranter yes i knows him well youll meet him on the road between here and markridge walking or perhaps running tell him weve had a spill and hed better see after the trap will you well go on what about the horse though said heathcote i suppose we shall have to take the beast along with us we cant leave her here i think wed better stop till tom comes and all go on together suggested heathcote i suppose you funk it with ashford said dick whose temper was somewhat ruffled by misfortune i dont if you two like to stop you can ill go on with the mare oh no well all come said heathcote im not afraid no more is coote all serene then come on mind you tell tom i say added he to the carter goodbye and thanks awfully and they departed in doleful procession dick with the whip in his hand leading the mare by the mouth and heathcote and coote following like chief mourners just out of range of the animals heels what shall we say to ashford asked heathcote after a little say what do you mean said dick hes sure to ask us what has happened well we shall tell him i suppose therell be an awful row of course there will we shall get licked of course we shall what of it only said heathcote with a little hesitation i suppose theres no way of getting out of it not unless you tell lies you and coote can tell some if you likei shant im not going to tell any said coote ive told quite enough in my exam papers oh of course i dont mean telling crams said heathcote who really didnt exactly know what he did mean ill back you up old man thanks i say as we are in a row mightnt we just as well take it out of this beastly horse if coote led him you and i could take cock shots at him from behind oh yes said coote and hit me by mistake not if i know it we might aim at coote suggested heathcote by way of solving the difficulty and hit the mare by mistake perhaps it would be rather low said dick i dont see though why she shouldnt carry us shes a long back plenty of room for all three of us the middle for me said coote think shed kick up asked heathcote not she she couldnt lift with all of us on her come on whoa you beast give us a leg up somebody whoa hold her head coote and keep her from going round and round now then by jove what a way up it is by a mighty effort of combined hoisting and climbing the boys one after the other scaled the lofty ridge and perched themselves as securely as they could well forward on the mares long back luckily for them the patient animal endured her burden meekly and plodded on in a listless manner pricking her ears occasionally at the riot which went on on her back and once or twice rattling the bones of her riders by a mild attempt at a trot but otherwise showing no signs of renewing her former more energetic protest in this manner after a weary and not altogether refreshing journey the three jaded tightlypacked heroes came to a standstill at the door of mountjoy house where one after the other they slid sadly from their perches and addressed themselves to the satisfying of mrs ashfords natural curiosity only hoping the interview would not be protracted and so defer for long the supper to which they all eagerly looked forward why whats all this said the matron wheres the waggonette and tom chimed in mr ashford appearing at the same moment please sir said dick we didnt wait for tom and drove home and there was a little accident i was driving at the time sir we got spilt and the trap was a little damaged we left word for tom to see to it and ill write and get my father to pay for mending it were all awfully sorry sir dr winter sends his regards and we shall hear the result of the exam on thursday one of the wheels came off but i fancy it will go on again it was a rut did it we were coming along at a very good pace and should have been here an hour ago if it hadnt been for the accident were sorry to be late sir after which ample explanation and apology the boys felt themselves decidedly aggrieved that they were not at once ushered in to supper mr ashford however being a mortal of only limited perception required a good deal more information and a painful and somewhat petulant crossexamination ensued the result of which was that our heroes were informed they were not to be trusted that both mr and mrs ashford were disappointed in them that they ought to be ashamed of themselves and that they would hear more about the matter tomorrow and what about the supperthat glorious spread of coffee and hot toast and eggs and bacon the anticipation of which had borne them up in all the perils and fatigue of the day and had shone like a beacon star to guide them home the subject was ignored basely ignored and the culprits were ordered to join the ordinary school supper and appease their hunger on bread and cheese and cold boiled beef and slake their thirst on swipes then did the spirits of richardson heathcote and coote wax fierce within them then did they call mr ashford a cad and mrs ashford a sneak then did they kick all the little boys within reach and scowl furiously upon the big ones then did they wish the mare was dead and templeton a ruin as when jove frowns and mercury and vulcan scowl the hills hide their heads and the valleys tremble beneath the storm so did the youth of mountjoy quake and cower that evening as it raised its eyes and beheld those three gloomy heroes devour their beef and drink their swipes no one ventured to ask how they had fared or wherefore they looked sad but they knew something had happened the little boys gazed with awe struck wonder at the heroes who had that day been at templeton and contended for templeton honours the elder boys wondered if gloom was part of templeton form and when their turn would come to look as black and majestic and all marvelled at the supper those three ate and at the chasm they left in the cold boiled beef come on you fellows said richardson as soon as the meal was finished im going to bed im fagged so am i said heathcote so am i said coote and the triumvirate stalked from the room leaving mountjoy more than ever convinced something terrific had happened if coote had had his way he would rather have stayed up he slept in a different room from richardson and heathcote and it was rather slow going to bed by himself at halfpast seven but as it was evident from dicks manner that this was the proper course to take under the circumstances he took it and was very soon dreaming that he and edward the fifths father were trotting round the templeton quadrangle on the mare much to the admiration of the templeton boys who assembled in their thousands to witness the exploit next day the uncomfortable topic of the mare and the waggonette was renewed in a long conference with mr ashford as supper was no longer pending and as a nights rest had intervened the boys were rather more disposed to enter into details but they failed to satisfy mr ashford that they were not to blame for what had occurred i am less concerned said he about the damage done to the waggonette than i am to think i cannot trust you as fully as i ought to be able to trust my head boys i hope during the week or two that remains of this term you will try to win back the confidence you have lost i must in justice to my other boys punish you under the circumstances i shall not cane you but till the end of the term you must each of you lose your hours play between twelve and one mr ashford paused perhaps he expected an outburst of gratitude perhaps he didnt exactly know what to say next in either case he found he had made a mistake the boys with an instinct not certainly of selfrighteousness but of common justice felt that they had had punishment enough already for their sin mr ashford took no account of those few seconds when the waggonette was dashing through the gate and reeling to its fall he reckoned as nothing the weary jolt home the indignity of that supper last night and the suspense of that early morning he made no allowance for an absence of malice in what they had done and gave them no creditalthough indeed neither did they give themselves credit for the regret and straightforwardness with which they had confessed it he proposed to treat them the head boys of mountjoy as common delinquents and punish them as he would punish a cheat or a bully or mutineer it wasnt fairthey knew it and if ashford didnt know it toowell he ought wed rather be caned sir said richardson speaking for all three mr ashford regarded the speaker with sharp surprise richardson kindly remember i am the best judge of what punishment you deserve its not fair to keep us in all the term said dick his cheeks mounting colour with the desperateness of his boldness mr ashford changed colour too but his cheeks turned pale leave my sight sir instantly how do you dare to use language like that to me fortunately for the dignity as well as for the comfort of the three boys dick made no attempt to prolong the argument he turned and left the room followed by his two faithful henchmen little imagining that if any one had scored in this unsatisfactory interview he had dont let the reader imagine that any mystical glory belongs to the schoolboy who happens to score one off his master if he does it consciously the chances are he is a snob for doing it if he does it unconsciously as dick did here then the misfortune of the master by no means means the bliss of the boy dick felt anything but blissful as he stalked moodily to the schoolroom that morning and growled his injuries to his allies but mr ashford as soon as his first burst of temper had evaporated like an honest sensible man sat down and reviewed the situation and it occurred to him on reviewing it that he had made a mistake it was of course extremely painful and humiliating to have to acknowledge it but once acknowledged it would have been far more humiliating to mr ashfords sense of honour to persist in it he summoned the boys once more to his presence and they trooped in like three prisoners brought up on remand to hear their final sentence the masters mouth twitched nervously and he half repented of the ordeal he had set before himself you said just now richardson that the punishment i proposed to inflict on you was not fair yes sir we think so replied dick simply i think so too said mr ashford equally simply and i shall say no more about it now you can go the boys gaped at him in mingled admiration and bewilderment you can go repeated the master richardson took a hasty survey of his companions countenances and said will you cane us instead please sir no richardson that would not be fair either richardson made one more effort please sir we think we deserve something people dont always get their deserts in this world my boy said the master with a smile now please go when i tell you mr ashford rallied three waverers to his standard that morning they didnt profess to understand the meaning of it all but they could see that the master had sacrificed something to do them justice and with the native chivalry of boys they made his cause theirs and did all they could to cover his retreat two days later a letter by the post was brought in to mr ashford in the middle of school cootes face grew crimson as he saw it and the faces of his companions grew long and solemn a sudden silence fell on the room broken only by the rustle of the paper as the master tore open the envelope and produced the printed document his eyes glanced hurriedly down it and a shade of trouble crossed his brow were gone coons groaned heathcote dont speak to me said dick coote said nothing but wished one of the windows was open on a hot day like this this paper contains the result of the entrance examination at templeton said mr ashford out of thirtysix candidates heathcote has passed fifteenth and richardson twentyfirst coote i am sorry to say has not passed chapter three how our heroes gird on their armour our heroes each in the bosom of his own family spent a somewhat anxious easter holiday of the three cootes prospects were decidedly the least cheery mountjoy house without richardson and heathcote would be desolation itself and the heart of our hero quailed within him as he thought of the long dull evenings and the dreary classes of the coming friendless term never mind old man dick had said cheerily as the firm talked their prospects over on the day before the holidays youre bound to scrape through the july exam and then wont we have a jollification when you turn up but all this was sorry comfort for the dejected coote who retired home and spent half his holidays learning dates so determined was he not to be out of it next time as for heathcote and richardson they were neither of them without their perturbations of spirit not that either of them realisedwho ever doesthe momentous epoch in their lives which had just arrived when childhood like a pleasant familiar landscape lies behind and the hill of life clouded in mist and haze rises before all unknown and unexplored heathcote who was his grandmothers only joy and had no nearer relatives did hear some remarks to this effect as he girded himself for the coming campaign but he evaded them with an oh yes i know all serene and was far more interested in the prospect of a new eton jacket and sunday surplice than in a detailed examination of his past personal history the feeling uppermost in his mind was that dick was going to templeton too and beyond that his anxieties and trepidations extended no further than the possibility of being called green by his new schoolfellows richardson had the great advantage of being one of a real family circle he was the eldest of a large family the heads of which feared god and tried to train their children to become honest men and women how far they had succeeded with dick orto give him his real christian name now we have him at homewith basil the reader may have already formed an opinion he had his faultswhat boy hasntand he wasnt specially clever but he had pluck and hope and resolution and without being hopelessly conceited had confidence enough in himself to carry him through most things dont be in too great a hurry to choose your friends my boy said his father as the two walked up and down the london platform youll find plenty ready enough but give them a week or two before you swear eternal friendship with any of them dick thought this rather strange advice and got out of it by saying oh i shall have georgie heathcote you know i shant much care about the other fellows dont be too sure and remember this my boy be specially on your guard with any of them that flatter you theyll soon find out your weak point and thats where theyll have you dick certainly considered this a little strong even for a parent but somehow the advice stuck for all that and he remembered it afterwards as to other matters said the father your mother i know has spoken for us both be honest to everybody most of all yourself and remember a boy can fear god without being a prig ah heres the train it was a dismal farewell that between father and son when the moment of parting really came neither of them had expected it would be so hard and when at last the whistle blew and their hands parted both were thankful the train slipped swiftly from the station and turned a corner at once after the bustle and excitement of the last few days dick found the loneliness of the empty carriage decidedly unpleasant and for a short time after leaving town was nearer moping than he had ever been before it would be an hour before the train reached x where heathcote would get in it would be all right then but meanwhile he wished he had something to do so he fell to devouring the provisions his mother and sisters had put up for his special benefit and felt in decidedly better heart when the meal was done then he hauled down his hatbox and tried on his new pot and felt still more soothed then he extricated his new dressingcase from his travellingbag and examined with increasing comfort each several weapon it contained until the discovery of a razor in an unsuspected corner completed his good cheer and he began to whistle in the midst of this occupation the train pulled up and heathcote with his hatbox and bag invaded the carriage hallo old man said dick with a nod youve turned up then look here isnt this a stunning turnout dont go sitting down on my razor i say excuse me a second said heathcote putting down his traps and turning to the window grandmas here and ive got to say goodbye goodbye grandma added the dutiful youth holding out his hand to a venerable lady who stood by the window goodbye georgie give me a kiss my dear boy georgie didnt like kissing in public especially when the public consisted of dick and yet he couldnt well get out of it so he hurried through the operation as quickly as possible and stood with his duty towards his relative and his interest towards the razor wondering why the train didnt start it started at last and after a few random flickings of his handkerchief out of the window he was able to devote his entire attention to his friends cutlery one exhibition provoked another heathcotes pot was produced and critically compared with dicks he had no dressingcase certainly but he had a silver watch and a steel chain also a pocket inkpot and a railway key and by the way he thought the sooner that railway key was brought into play the better by its aid they successfully resisted invasion at the different stations as they went along until at length heathcotes watch told them that the next station would be templeton whereat they became grave and packed up their bags and looked rather wistfully out of the window father says remarked dick only the new boys go up today the rest come tomorrow rather a good job said heathcote a long silence followed think therell be any one to meet us said dick dont know i wish coote was to be there too another pause i expect theyll be jolly enough fellows said dick oh yes they dont bully now in schools i believe no they say its going out perhaps its as well we shall be pretty well used to the place by tomorrow i fancy yes itll be rather nice to see them all turn up i expect you know theyll have such a lot to do they wont bother about new fellows i know i shouldnt they might about the awful green ones perhaps ha ha wouldnt it be fun if old coote was here yes poor old coote you know im half sorry to leave mountjoy it was a jolly old school wasnt it the shrieking of the whistle and the grinding of the brake put an end to further conversation for the present as they alighted each with his hatbox and bag and umbrella and stood on the platform they felt moved by a sincere affection for the carriage they were leaving indeed there is no saying what little encouragement would not have sufficed to send them back into its hospitable shelter here you are sirthis way for the schoolthis cab sircried half a dozen cabmen darting whip in hand upon our heroes as they stood looking about them dont you go along with them said one confidentially theyll charge you halfacrown come along young gentlemen ill take you for two bob go on you think the young gentlemen are greenhorns no fear they know whats what they aint agoin to be seen drivin up the quad in a noahs ark like that come along young gents leave him for the milksops the like of you rides in a hansom i know of course this artful student of juvenile nature carried the day and there was great cheering and crowing and chaffing when the hansom with the two trunks on the top and the two anxious faces inside peering over the top of their hatboxes and bags rattled triumphantly out of the station as templeton school was barely three minutes drive from the station there was very little leisure either for conversation or the recovery of their composure before the gallant steed was clattering over the cobbles of the great quadrangle they pulled up at a door which appeared to belong to a bell of imposing magnitude which the cabman alighting proceeded to pull with an energy that awoke the echoes of that solemn square and made our two heroes draw their breath short and sharp hop out young gentlemen said the cabman helping his passengers and their luggage out its a busy time and im in a hurry a shilling each and sixpence a piece for the traps thats two and three makes five and leave the driver to you considering the distance they had come it seemed rather a long price and heathcote ventured very mildly to ask the other man at the station said two shillings bah said the cabman in tones of unfeigned disgust you are green ones after all hed have charged a bob a piece for the traps and landed you up to eight bob and stood no nonsense too about it come settle up young gentlemen please the templeton boys im used to always fork out like gentlemen dick took out his purse and produced fiveandsixpence which he gave the driver just as the door opened and the school matron presented herself is that your cab said she pointing to the receding hansom yes maam how much did he charge you five shillings maam the lady uttered an exclamation of mingled wrath and contempt its double his right fare run quick and youll catch him heathcote started to run shouting meekly and waving his hand to the man to stop but the man goodhumouredly declined the invitation raising his hat gallantly to the lady and putting his tongue into his cheek as he touched the horse up into a trot and rattled out of the square heathcote returned rather sheepishly and the two friends followed the lady indoors feeling that their entry into templeton had been anything but triumphant the idea said the matron partly to herself and partly to the boys of his landing you and all your luggage on the pavement like that and then going off before i came he knew well enough i should have seen he only got his right fare the wretch the boys did not know at the time but they discovered it afterwards that mrs partlett the matron had a standing feud with all the cabmen of templeton whose delight it was to enjoy themselves at her expensea pastime they could not more effectively achieve than by fleecing her young charges so to speak under her very nose now said she when presently she had recovered her equanimity if youll unlock these things you can go and take a walk round the quadrangle and look about you while i unpack the bell will ring for new boys tea in half an hour they obeyed and took a melancholy but interested stroll round the great court they read all the latin mottoes and were horrified to find one or two which they could not translate fancy a templeton boy not being able to understand his own mottoes they read the names on the different masters doors and dwelt with special reverence on the doorplate of mr westover in whose house they were to reside they deciphered the carvings on the great gate and shuddered as they saw the name of one joe bolt cut rude and deep across the forehead of the cherub who stood sentinel at the chapel portal all was wonder in that strange walk the wonder of untasted proprietorship it was their school their quadrangle their chapel their elmtrees and yet they scarcely liked to inspect them too closely or behave themselves towards them too familiarly one or two boys were taking solitary strolls like themselves they were new boys toonearly all of them afflicted with the same uneasiness some more some less it was amusing to see the way these new boys held themselves one to another as they crossed and passed one another in that afternoons promenade there was no falling into one anothers arms in bursts of mutual sympathy there was no forced gaiety and indifference as though one would say i dont think much of the place after all no with blunt english pride each boy bridled up a bit as a stranger drew near and looked straight in front of him till the coast was clear at length the bell above the matrons door began to toll and there was a general movement among the stragglers in its direction about twenty boys mostly of our heroes age assembled in the tea room their small band looked almost lost in that great hall as they clustered of one accord for warmth and comfort at one end of the long table the matron entered and said grace and then proceeded to pour out tea for her hungry family while the boys themselves at her injunction passed round the breadandbutter and eggs a meal is one of the most civilising institutions going and dick after two cups of templeton tea and several cubic inches of templeton bread andbutter felt amiably inclined towards his lefthand neighbour a little timorouslooking boy who blushed when anybody looked at him and nearly fainted when he heard his own voice answering mrs partletts enquiry whether he wanted another cup apart from a friendly motive it seemed to dick it would be good practice to begin talking to a youth of this unalarming aspect he therefore enquired are you a new boy the boy started to hear himself addressed then looking shyly up in the speakers face and divining that no mischief lurked there he replied yes dick took another gulp of tea and continued where do you livein london noi live in devonshire dick returned to his meal again and exchanged some sentences with heathcote before he resumed what school were you at before i wasnt at anyi had lessons at home a tutor the boy blushed very much and looked appealingly at dick as though to beg him to receive the disclosure he was about to make kindly nomy mother taught me dick did receive it kindly that is he didnt laugh he felt sorry for the boy and what was in store for him when the news got abroad he also felt much less reserved in continuing the conversation heathcote here and i were at mountjoy so were pretty well used to kicking about said he patronisingly i suppose you didnt go in for the entrance exam then yes i did said the boy poor chap thought dick fancy a fellow whos never left his mammys apronstrings going in for an exam how did you get on he added turning to his companion pretty well i think said the boy shyly i was twentyfirst out of thirtysix said dick and heathcote here was fifteenthwhere were you again the boy made a mute appeal for toleration as he replied i was first dick put down his cup and stared at him go on said he it was down on the list so said the boy with an apologetic air they sent one with the names printed dick made a desperate onslaught on the breadandbutter regarding his neighbour out of the corners of his eyes from time to time quite at a loss to make him out how old are you he demanded presently thirteen whats your name bertie aspinall whose house are you going to live in mr westovers oh said dick abruptly ending the conversation and turning round towards heathcote in due time the meal was over and the boys were told they could do as they liked for the next hour until the matron was at leisure to show them their quarters so for another hour the promenade in the quadrangle was resumed not so dismally however as before the tea had broken the ice wonderfully and instead of the studied avoidance of the afternoon one group and another fell now to comparing notes and rehearsing the legends they had heard of templeton and its inmates and gradually a fellowfeeling made every one wondrous kind and the little army of twenty in the prospect of tomorrows battles drew together in bonds of selfdefence and felt all very like brothers aspinall however who knew no one and had not dared to join himself to any of the groups paced in solitude at a distance hoping for nothing better than that he might escape notice and be left to himself but dick whose interest in him had become very decided found him out before long and much to his terror insisted in introducing him to heathcote and attaching him to their party theres nothing to be in a funk about young un said he i know i dont mean to funk it whatever they do to me ill back you up old man all i can said heathcote i expect its far the best way not to kick out but just go through with it said dick thats what my father says and he had a pretty rough time of it he said at first oh yes im sure its all the worse for a fellow if he funks or gets out of temper all this was very alarming talk for the timorous small boy to overhear and he longed a hundred times to be safe back in devonshire im afraid he faltered i knowi shall be a coward dont be a young ass said dick heathcote and i will back you up all we can wont we georgie rather said heathcote if you do it wont be half so bad said the boy brightening up a bit its dreadful to be a coward well why are you one said dick no ones obliged to be one i suppose i cant help it i try hard there goes the bell i suppose thats for us to go in said dick as the summons once more sounded they found the matron with a list in her hand which she proceeded to call over bidding each boy answer to his name the first twelve were the new boys of westovers house and they included our two heroes and aspinall who were forthwith marched together with their night apparel across the court to their new quarters here they were received by another matron who presided over the wardrobes of the youth of westovers and by her they were escorted to one of the dormitories where for that night at any rate they were to be permitted to sleep in the comfort of one anothers society new boys are to call on the doctor after breakfast in the morning announced she breakfast at eight and no morning chapel good night it was not long before the dormitory was silent one by one the tired boys dropped off most of them with heavy hearts as they thought of the morrow among the last was dick who as he lay awake and went over in his mind the experiences of the day was startled by what sounded very like a sob in the bed next to his he had half a mind to get up and go and say something to the dismal little devonshire boy but on second thoughts he thought the kindest thing would be to let the poor fellow have his cry out so he turned over and tried not to hear it and while trying he fell asleep chapter four how our heroes are put through their paces the assyrian came down like a wolf on the fold early next day the twenty innocent lambs whom in the last chapter we left sweetly folded in slumber had barely had time to arise and comb their hair when the advanceguard of the hungry tyrant appeared in their midst this was no other than a truckload of trunks portmanteaux bags and hatboxes sent up from the station the owners of which so the alarming rumour spread were on the road it was an agitated meal our heroes partook of with the spectacle of that truck before their eyes and many an anxious ear was pricked for the first sound of the approaching horde but the horde being aware that nothing was expected of it till midday by no means saw the fun of surrendering its liberty at oclock and went down to bathe in the harbour on the way up so that the fate which impended was kept for two good hours in suspense meanwhile the interview with the doctor was accomplished it was not very alarming your new boy would sooner face twenty doctors than one hero of the middle fifth the head master asked a few kindly questions of each boy and so to speak took stock of him before adding his name formally to the school list he also added a few words of advice to the company generally and enlightened them as to a few of the chief school rules the others he said they would learn soon enough whereat they all said thank you sir and retired dick and heathcote with young aspinall in tow walked back to westovers house together and were nearly halfway there when aspinall suddenly clutched dicks arm and whispered theres one they all stood still and gazed as if it was a spectre not a human being they expected what they really did see was a rather nicelooking boy of sixteen or seventeen lounging in at the great gateway looking about him with a familiar air and apparently bending his steps straight for westovers it was an awkward situation for our three new boys every step brought them nearer under the observation of the assyrian and at every step they felt more awkward and abashed dick did his best to put on a little swagger he stuck one hand in his pocket and twitched his hat a trifle on one side heathcote too instinctively let slip his jacket button so as to betray his watch chain and laughed rather loudly at something which nobody said poor young aspinall attempted no such demonstration but slipped under the lee of his protectors and wondered what would become of him the old boy and the new foregathered just at the door of westovers and it was not till they actually stood face to face that the former gave any sign of being aware of the presence of the trio he then honoured them with a casual survey as they stood back to let him enter first new kids he asked yes westovers yes the hero grunted and passed in and they heard him shouting to the matron to ask if his traps had come from the station and whether anybody had come yet anybody come he didnt count them that was plain not knowing exactly what to do they determined on another walk round the quad preferring to be reconnoitred by the enemy in the open and not indoorspossibly in a corner the enemy reconnoitred in force after the first arrival boys dropped in in twos and threes in cabs in omnibuses in high spirits in low spirits the old square began to get lively the echoes which had slept soundly for the past fortnight woke up suddenly and the rooks in the elms began to grow uneasy and summoned a cabinet council to discuss what was going on in the lower world hallo duff old man cried one boy near to our heroes as he caught sight of a chum across the square seen raggles yes hes got a cargo down hes asked me tell him im up will you whats a cargo asked heathcote as the speaker went past goodness knows said dickperhaps its a crib my brother will used to call a hamper a cargo said aspinall humph said dick who never liked to be corrected theres something in that i hope there is said heathcote it said a great deal for the solemnity of the occasion that dick did not at once proceed to administer condign punishment he took note of the offence though and punished the offender quietly in bed some days after just at the present moment had he been inclined to square accounts he had no leisure for a sudden cry of dredger was raised whereat they noticed a number of boys step off the pavement on to the grass before they could conjecture what this sudden manoeuvre might mean a rush of steps arose behind and next moment they were caught up in the toils of a net constructed of towels knotted together stretching across the path and held at each end by two swift runners who swept them along at a headlong pace catching up a shoal of stray fish on the way until even the stalwart dredgers were compelled from the very weight of their take to slacken speed a crowd collected to witness the emptying of the net one by one the trembling small fry were grabbed and passed round to answer a string of questions such as whats your name are you most like your father or your mother whos your hatter can you swim who was the father of zebedees children are you a radical or a tory all of which questions each luckless catechumen was required to answer truly and in a loud distinct voice amid the most embarrassing cheers and jeers and hootings of the audience dick got through his fairly well till he came to the political question when he made the great mistake of saying he didnt know whether he was a radical or a tory for as he might have expected every one was down on him and he was sent forth a marked man to make up his mind on the question heathcote whose sorrow it was to be separated from his friend in the landing of the catch was less lucky he professed himself like his mother which was greatly against him his hatter also was a country artist instead of a londoner and that he discovered was an extremely grave offence and as for his politics he made a greater mistake even than dick for he professed himself imbued with opinions between the two an announcement which brought down a torrent of abuse and scorn mingled with cries of kick him for a halfandhalf prig an observation which heathcote was very sorry indeed to hear as the reader may guess poor young aspinall had a very bad time of it he began to cry as soon as the first question was propounded but this demonstration failed to shelter him a general hiss greeted the sound of his whimper and cries of wheres his bottle meow hushabye baby his ruthless tyrants who knew no distinction between the tears of a crocodile and the tears of a terrified child made him go through his catechism to the bitter end they howled with delight when they heard him call himself bertie and paused in dead silence to hear him say whether he was like papa or mammaor nurse as some one suggested he took refuge in tears again with the result that his inquisitors were more than ever determined to get their answer hang it you young ass said one boy whom the child even in his flutter and misery recognised as the boy who had accosted them at the door of westovers that morning cant you answer without blubbering like that nobodys going to eat you up this friendly admonition served to set the boy on his feet and he stammered out mother you werent asked if you were like your mother shouted some one are you most like papa or mamma mamma faltered the boy whereat there was great jubilation as there was also when he described his hatter as mr smith of totnes can you swim nno im afraid not thats a pity with the lot you blubber youll get drowned some day terrific cheers greeted this sally in the midst of which the boy was almost forgotten but the political test remained now bertie dear are you a radical or a tory he was asked the boy took a deep breath and said im a radical at which straightforward and unlookedfor reply there were great cheers and countercheers in the midst of which the scared little radical was hustled down from his perch and sent flying to join his friends and calm the fluttering of his poor little heart it being evidently unsafe to remain longer in the quadrangle the dejected trio betook themselves with many misgivings to their house westovers presented a striking contrast to the quiet scene of yesterday evening it being still a quarter to twelve and term not being supposed to commence till midday the short interval of freedom from school rules was being made use of to the best advantage the matron shouted at and besieged on all sides already stood at bay with her hands to her ears having abandoned any attempt to do anything for anybody the house porter was in a similar condition of strike he had once been knocked completely over by rival claimants on his assistance and he had several times been nearly pulled limb from limb by disappointed employers he therefore stood with his back to the wall and his arms folded waiting till the storm should blow itself out upstairs in the studies riot scarcely less exuberant was taking place bosom friends reunited after three weeks separation celebrated their reunion with paeans of jubilation and warwhoops of triumph cargoes were being unladen here liddellandscott was officiating as a cricket ball there a siege was going on round this door and a handtohand scrimmage between the posts of that a few of the placid ones were quietly unpacking in the midst of the babel and one or two were actually writing home our heroes fancying the looks neither of the matrons hall nor of the lobby upstairs deemed it prudent to retreat as quickly as possible to the junior schoolroom there to await in the calm atmosphere of expectant scholarship the ringing of the twelve oclock bell has the reader ever visited that famous resort of youth the zoo has he stood on that terrace five minutes before dinnertime and listened to the deepmouthed growl of the lion the barking of the wolf the shriek of the hyaena as they pace their cages and await their meal then turning on his heel has he quitted that stately scene and pushed back the door of the monkey house even so it was with our heroes the junior schoolroom was as the matrons hall and the studies thrown into oneat first to the untutored eyes of the visitors it looked like a surging sea of unkempt heads and waving elbows then as their vision grew accustomed to the scene they beheld faces and legs and boots then amid the general din they distinguished voices and perceived that the sea was made up of human beings at the which they would fain have retreated but as old virgil says and we wont insult our readers by translating the verses facilis descensus averni sed revocare gradum hoc opus hic labor est their retreat was cut off before they were well in the room and amid loud cries of new kids bertie scrunch they were escorted to the nearest form where they forthwith received a most warm and pressing welcome into their new quarters the top boy of the form in his emotion planted his feet against the wall and began to push inwards the bottom boy equally overcome planted his feet in the hollow of a desk and also pushed inwards every one else in fellowfeeling pushed inwards too except our heroes who being in the exact centre remained passive recipients of their schoolfellows welcome until the line showed signs of rising up at the point where aspinalls white face pointed the middle whereupon the bottom boy considerately let go with his feet and the occupants of the form were poured like water on the floor after being thus welcomed on some halfdozen forms our heroes began to feel that even good fellowship may pall and were glad decidedly glad to hear the great bell beginning to sound forth school that morning was rather a farce the master was not in the humour for it nor were the boys after calling over names and announcing the subjects which would engage the attention of the different classes and reading over in case any one had forgotten them the rules of westovers house the class was dismissed for the present all except the new boys being permitted to go out into the court or playingfields till dinner it was a welcome relief to our new boys to find themselves together once more with the enemy beyond reach their ranks showed signs of severe conflict one boy who had rashly worn a light blue necktie in the morning wore no necktie now heathcotes jacket was burst under the arm dick bore no scars in his raiment but his nose was rather on one side and his face was rather grimy aspinall was white and hot and the skeery look about his eyes proclaimed he had had almost enough for one day after dinner at which our heroes rejoiced to find the assyrians had something more serious to do than to heed them templeton went out into the fields to air itself there was nothing special doing a few enthusiastic athletes had donned their flannels and were taking practice trots round the halfmile path another lot were kicking about a football in an aimless way others were passing round a cricket ball at long range but most were loafing apparently undecided what to turn themselves to thus early in the term one or two of the fifth however appeared to have some business on hand in which much to their surprise our new boys found they were concerned the senior whose arrival they had witnessed in the morning came up to where they were and said youre all three new boys arent you yes they replied well go up to the flagstaff there and wait for me with much inward trepidation they obeyed wondering what was to happen swinstead for that was the name of the fifthform fellow continued his tour of the field accosting all the new boys in turn and giving them the same order at length the longsuffering twenty clustered round the flagstaff and awaited their fate it was simple enough every new boy was expected to race on his first day at templeton and that was what was expected of them now lets have your nameslook sharp said one fifthform fellow with a pencil and paper in his hand who seemed to look upon the affair as rather a bore come on sing out one at a time they did sing out one at a time twenty of them said the senior running down his list four fives i suppose yes said swinstead clear the course somebody and call the fellows so the course was cleared and proclamation made that the new boys were about to race whereat templeton lined the quartermile track and showed a languid interest in the contest swinstead called over the first five names on his list take off your coats and waistcoats said he they obeyed dick who was not in the first heat took charge of heathcotes garments and secretly bade him put it on toe the line said swinstead are you ready off they started it was a straggling procession two of the boys could scarcely use their legs and of the other three heathcote was the only one who showed any pace and greatly to dicks delight came in easily first dicks turn came in the second round and he greatly to heathcotes delight won in a canter in the fourth heat aspinall ran but he poor fellow could scarcely struggle on to the end and had literally to be driven the last fifty yards for no new boy was allowed to shirk his race templeton evinced a more decided interest in the final round it had looked on as a matter of duty on the trial heats but it got a trifle excited over the final the winner of the fourth round the youth who had been robbed of his light blue tie commanded the most general favour swinstead on the other hand secretly fancied dick and one or two others were divided between heathcote and the winner of the third round keep your elbows in and dont look round so much whispered swinstead to dick as the four champions toed the line dick nodded gratefully for the advice now then are you ready go cried the starter the hero of the blue tie led off amid great jubilation among the sportsmen but swinstead who trotted beside the race still preferred dick and liked the way he kept up to the leaders heels in the first hundred yards heathcote in his turn kept well up to dick and had nothing to fear from the other man pretty race said some one good action number two replied another swinstead fancies him and he knows whats what i should have said number three myself two hundred yards were done and scarcely an inch had the position of the three runners altered then swinstead called now then young un dick knew the call was meant for him and his spirit rose within him he waited on his man as they say and before the next hundred yards were done he was abreast with heathcote close on the heels of both frantic were the cries of the sportsmen to their man but his face was red and his mouth was open hes done was the cry of the disgusted knowing ones and the knowing ones were right dick walked away as fresh as a daisy in the last hundred yards while heathcote blowing hard stepped up abreast of the favourite it was a close run for second honours but the mountjoy boy stuck to it and staggered up a neck in front with ten clear yards between him and the heels of the victorious dick chapter five how heathcote nearly catches cold dick felt decidedly pleased with himself as he walked back arminarm with heathcote after his victory he felt that he had a right to hold up his head in templeton already and although he still experienced some difficulty in managing his hands and keeping down his blushes when he met one of the fifth he felt decidedly fortified against the inquisitive glances of the juniors in fact in the benevolence of his heart he felt so anxious lest any of these young aspirants to a view of the hero who had won the new boys race should be disappointed that he prolonged his walk and made a circuit of the great square with his friend so as to give every one a fair chance at tea to which templeton trooped in ravenously after their first afternoons blow in the open air he sat with an interesting expression of langour on his face enduring the scrutiny to which he was treated with an air of charming unconsciousness from which any one might suppose he harboured not the slightest desire to hear what swinstead was saying to his neighbour as they both looked his way it was a pity he could not hear it look at that young prig said swinsteads neighbour he cant get over it its gone to his head young ass said swinstead ran well too it would be a good turn to take him down a peg whats the use hell come down soon enough for all that the two friends could not resist the temptation when after tea they caught sight of dick and his chum going out into the quad of beckoning to the former to come to them those fellows want me said dick to his friend in a tone as much as to say im so used to holding familiar converse with the fifth that its really almost beginning to be a grind but i dont like to disappoint them this time well how do you feel said swinstead oh all right replied dick showing unmistakeable signs of intoxication capital run you made said the other middling said dick deprecatingly i hadnt my shoes that makes a difference it does said the two elders rather a nice turf track youve got said the boy presently by way of filling up an awkward gap glad you like it some of the fellows growl at it but well tell them you think it good it was rather an anxious moment to see how the fish would take it but he swallowed it hook and all we used to run a good deal at our old school you know said he some of us that is ah youre just the man we want for the harriers theyre badly off for a whipperin and we had to stop hunting all last term because we hadnt got one oh said dick yes but itll be all right if youll take itwont it be birket rather said birket hed be a brick if he did i dont mind trying said dick modestly will you really thanks awfully you know cresswell no by the way hes not here yet hes in the sixth and has been acting as whipperin till we got a proper chap hell be here in the morning any one will tell you where he hangs out hell bless you i can tell you for taking the job out of his hands you never saw the pace he goes at when he tries to run eh birket rather not said birket its a regular joke a snails nothing to him how has he managed to whip in asked dick rather amused at the idea of this sixthform snail bless you weve had no runs lately thats why but we shall make up now youve come dick heartily wished he had run in his shoes that afternoon he was sure he could have done the distance two or even three seconds better if he had if youll really go in for it said birket go to him early to morrow and tell him who you are and say you are going to act as whipperin and that you have arranged it all with us dick looked a little concerned hadnt you better come with me he asked i dont know him we shall be in class but hell know if you mention our names say we sent you and that you won the new boys race do you twig all right said dick beginning to feel he had something really big on hand youre a young trump said birket and i say dont forget to ask him to give you the whip we might manage a run tomorrow goodnight glad youve come to templeton look here by the way said swinstead as they parted dont say anything about it to anybody theres such a lot of jealousy over these things best to get it all settled first dont you think so yes said dick feeling a good deal bewildered and doubtful whether after all he had not been foolish in undertaking so important a task he returned to his chum in an abstracted frame of mind he had certainly expected his achievement that afternoon would give him a footing in templeton but in his wildest dreams he had not supposed it would give him such a lift as this whipperin of the templeton harriers was rapid promotion for a new boy on his first day but then he reflected if they really were hard up for a fellow to take the office it would be rather ungracious to refuse it what did they want you for asked heathcote oh talking about the race dont you know and that sort of thing said dick equivocally did they say anything about me not a word old man whereat heathcote turned a little crusty and wondered that ten yards in a quarter of a mile should make such a difference dick was bursting to tell him all about it and made matters far worse by betraying that he had a secret which he could on no account impart youll know tomorrow most likely said he im awfully sorry they made me promise to keep it close but ill tell you first of all when its settled and i may be able to give you a leg up before long heathcote said he did not want a leg up and feeling decidedly out of humour made some excuse to go indoors and hunt up young aspinall on his way he encountered a junior next to whom he had sat at dinner and with whom he had then exchanged a few words where are you going demanded that youthful warrior indoors said heathcote no you arent replied the bravo standing like a wolf across the way it was an awkward position for a pacific boy like heathcote who mildly enquired why not because you cheeked me replied the wolf how i didnt mean to replied the lamb thatll do youve got to apologise apologise what for speaking to me at dinnertime the blood of the heathcotes began to tingle suppose i dont apologise asked he youll be sorry for it what will you do lick you then said heathcote mildly youd better begin the youthful champion evidently was not prepared for this cordial invitation and looked anything but pleased to hear it well why dont you begin said heathcote following up his advantage because said the boy looking rather uncomfortably around him i wouldnt dirty my fingers on such a beast now if heathcote had been a man of the world he would have divined that the present was a rare opportunity for catching his bumptious young friend by the ear and making him carry out his threat then and there but being a simpleminded new boy unlearned in the ways of the world he merely said pooh and walked on leaving his assailant in possession of the field calling out coward and sneak after him till he was out of sight he was rather sorry afterwards for his mistake as it turned out he might have been much more profitably and pleasantly employed outside than in aspinall whom he had come to look after was nowhere visible and feeling somewhat concerned for his safety heathcote ventured to enquire of a junior who was loafing about in the passage if he knew where the little new fellow was in bed of course said the junior and id advise you not to let yourself be seen unless you want to get in an awful row added he solemnly what about asked heathcote why not being in bed my eye itll be rather warm for you i tell you if any of the fifth catch you why its only halfpast seven well and dont you know the rule about new boys always having to be in bed by seven exclaimed the junior in tones of alarm no i dont believe it is the rule said heathcote all right said the boy you neednt believe it unless you like but dont say you werent told thats all and he walked off whistling heathcote was perplexed he suspected a practical joke in everything and had this junior been a trifle less solemn he would have had no doubt that this was one as it was he was sorry he had offended him and lost the chance of making quite sure dick he knew was still out of doors and he it was certain knew nothing about the rule but just then a fifthform fellow came along and cut off the retreat he eyed the new boy critically as he advanced and stopped in front of him whats your name he demanded heathcote a new boy yes how is it youre not in bed do you know the time yes said heathcote convinced now that the junior had been right but i didnt knowthat is shut up and dont tell lies said the fifthform boy severely go to bed instantly and write me out lines of virgil before breakfast tomorrow ive a good mind to send your name up to westover im awfully sorry began heathcote no one told me ive told you and if you dont go at once westover shall hear of it the dormitory when he reached it was deserted not even aspinall was there and for a moment heathcote began again vaguely to suspect a plot from this delusion he was however speedily relieved by the appearance of a boy who followed him into the room and demanded look here what are you up to here i wasthat is i was told to go to bed said heathcote well and if you were what business have you got here go to your own den this is where i slept last night said heathcote pointing to the identical bed he had occupied you did like your howling cheek where is my bed room then asked heathcote why didnt you ask the matron im not going to fag for you there in that second door and take my advice slip into bed as quick as you can unless you want one of the fifth to catch you and give you a hundred lines heathcote whipped up his nightgown and made precipitately for the door finally convinced that he was in a fair way of getting into a row very early in his templeton career the door opened into a little room about the size of a small ships cabin and here he undressed as quickly as he could in the fading daylight and slipped into bed inwardly congratulating himself that no one had detected him in the act and that he had a good prospect contrary to his expectations of getting to sleep comfortably the thought of the lines certainly was unpleasant but sufficient unto the day thought the philosophic heathcote he was far more concerned at the fate of the unsuspecting dick what would become of him poor fellow amid these reflections he fell peacefully asleep the next thing he was conscious of in what seemed to him the middle of the night was the sudden removal of the clothes from the bed and a figure holding a light catching him by the arm and demanding fiercely what do you mean by it his first impulse was to smile at the thought that it was only a dream but he quickly changed his mind and sat up with his eyes very wide open as the figure repeated what do you mean by it get out of this the speaker was a big boy whom heathcote in the midst of his bewilderment recognised as having seen at the fifthform table in hall whats the matter faltered the new boy the matter you impudent young beggar come get out of this ill teach you to play larks with me get out of my bed heathcote promptly obeyed i didnt knowi was told it was where i was to sleep he said shut up and dont tell lies said the senior taking off his slipper and passing his hand down the sole of it really i didnt do it on purpose pleaded heathcote i was told to do it the case was evidently not one for argument as heathcote turned round the silence of the night hour was broken for some moments by the echoes of that slippersole it was no use objectingstill less resisting so heathcote bore it like a man and occupied his leisure moments during the ceremony in chalking up a long score against his friend the junior now make my bed said the executioner when the transaction was complete the boy obeyed in silencewonderfully warm despite the lightness of his attire his comfort would have been complete had that junior only been there to help him the fifthform boy insisted on the bed being made from the very beginningincluding the turning of the mattress and the shaking of each several sheet and blanketso that the process was a lengthy one and but for the occasional consolations of the slipper might have become chilly also now clear out said the owner of the apartment where am i to go asked heathcote beginning to feel rather forlorn out of here repeated the senior i dont the senior took up the slipper again please may i take my clothes said heathcote are you going or not please give me my trou he was on the other side of the door before the second syllable came and the click of the latch told him that after all he might save his breath heathcote was in a predicament the corridor was dark and draughty and he was far from home what was he to do three courses as the wise man says were open to him either he might camp out where he was and by the aid of doormats and carpet extemporise a bed till the morning or he might commence a demonstration against the door from which he had just been ejected till somebody came and saw him into his rightsor failing his rights into his trousers or he might commence a housetohouse canvass up one side of the corridor and down the other in hopes of finding either an empty chamber or one tenanted by a friend there was a good deal to be said for each though on the whole he personally inclined to the last course indeed he went so far as to grope his way to the end of the passage with a view to starting fair when a sound of footsteps and a white flutter ahead sent his heart to his mouth and made him shiver with something more than the evening breeze he stood where he was rooted to the spot and listened an awful silence seemed to fall upon the place had he hit on the templeton ghoston the disembodied spirit of some luckless martyr to the ferocity of a last century bully or was it an ambuscade prepared for himself or was it some companion in yes there was a sob and heathcotes soul rejoiced as he recognised it is that you young un he said in a deep whisper the footsteps suddenly ceased the white flutter stopped and next moment there rose a shriek in the still night air which made all westovers jump in its sleep and opened as if by magic half the doors in the long corridor aspinall had seen a ghost amid all the airilyclad forms that hovered out to learn the cause of the disturbance heathcote felt comforted his one regret was that he was unable to recognise his friend the junior in whose debt he was in nocturnal garb but he recognised dick to his great delight and hurriedly explained to him as well as to about fifty other enquirers the circumstancesthat is so much of them as seemed worth repetition between them they contrived to reassure the terrified aspinall who it turned out had been the victim of a similar trick to that played on heathcote where are you sleeping said the latter to dick the old place where ever did you get to ill tell you has any one got my bed there no come onhere aspinall catch holdlook sharp out of the passage are you coming too heathcote to his astonishment heathcote darted suddenly from his side and dived in at an open door before his friend could guess what he meant he returned with a bundle of clothes in his arms and a triumphant smile on his face hurrah said he got em at last whose are they asked dick mine my boy by jove i am glad to get them again cave there westover called some one near him and as if by magic the passage was empty in a moment our heroes being the last to scuttle into their dormitory with aspinall between them dick lay awake for some time that night he was excited and considered on the whole he had made a fair start at templeton he had won the new boys race and he was the whipperinelect of the templeton harriers fellows respected him possibly a good many of them feared him certainly they let him alone for all that meditated he it wont do to get cocked up by it father said i was to be on my guard against fellows who flattered me so i must keep my eyes open or some one will be trying to make a fool of me if cresswells a nice fellow ill have a talk with him tomorrow about young aspinall and see if we cant do anything to give him a leg up poor young beggar i wonder if im an ass to accept the whippingin so easily any how i suppose i can resign if its too much grind heigho im sleepy chapter six how our heroes begin to feel at home heathcote awoke early the next morning with his friend the junior seriously on his mind one or two fellows were already dressing themselves in flannels as he roused himself amongst others the young hero who had threatened to fight him the evening before hallo said that young gentleman in a friendly tone as if nothing but the most cordial courtesies had passed between them coming down to bathe all serene said heathcote not however without his suspicions if any one had told him it was a fine morning he would in his present state of mind have suspected the words as part of a deeplaid scheme to fool him but he reflected he had not much to fear from this mock heroic junior and as long as he kept him in sight no great harm could happen come on then said the boy whose name by the way was gosse we shall only just have time to do it before chapel wait a second till i tell dick hed like to come too said heathcote whats the use of waking him when hes fagged besides hes got to wash and dress his baby and give him his bottle so he wouldnt have time arent you ready yes said heathcote flinging himself into his hardlyregained garments the templeton tub as the bathing place was colloquially termed was a small natural harbour among the rocks at the foot of the cliff on which the school stood it was a picturesque spot at all times but this bright spring morning with the distant headlands lighting up in the rising sunlight and the blue sea heaving lazily among the rocks as though not yet awake heathcote thought it one of the prettiest places he had ever seen the tub suited all sorts of bathers the little timid waders could dip their toes and splash their hair in the shallow basin inshore the more advanced could wade out shoulderdeep and puff and flounder with one foot on the ground and the other up above their heads and delude the world into the notion they were swimming for others there was the springboard from which to take a header into deep water and further out still the rocks rose in ledges where practised divers could take the water from any height they liked from four feet to thirty except with leave no boy was permitted to swim beyond the harbour mouth into the open but leave was constantly being applied for and as constantly granted and perhaps every boy at some time or other cast wistful glances at the black buoy bobbing a mile out at sea and wondered when he like pontifex and mansfield and other of the sixth should be able to wear the image of it on his belt and call himself a templeton shark heathcote on his first appearance at the tub acquitted himself creditably he took a mild header from the springboard without more than ordinary splashing and swam across the pool and back in fair style gosse who only went in from the low ledge and swam halfway across and back was good enough to give him some very good advice and promise to make a good swimmer of him in time whereat heathcote looked grateful and wished dick had been there to astonish some of them one or two of the fifth including swinstead and birket arrived as the youngsters were dressing hallo said swinstead to heathcote you here wheres your chum asleep said heathcote quite pleased to think he should be able to tell dick he had been having a talk with swinstead that morning have you been in yes can you swim yes a little said gosse answering for him were about equal heathcote couldnt stand the barefaced libel meekly why you cant swim once across he said scornfully and you cant go in off the board the fifthform boys laughed ha ha said swinstead hes letting you have it gossy hes telling beastly crams said gosse and ill kick him when we get back ill swim you across the pool and back first said heathcote the seniors were delighted the new boys spirit pleased them and the prospect of taking down the junior pleased them still more thats fair said birket come on strip heathcote was ready in a trice gosse looked uncomfortable im not going in again he said ive got a cold yes you are replied birket ill help you this threat was quite enough for the discomfited junior who slowly divested himself of his garments now then plenty of room for both of you on the board no said gosse ive not got any cotton wool for my ears i dont care about going in off the board unless i have thats soon remedied said swinstead producing some wool from his pocket and proceeding to stuff it into each of the boys ears poor gosse was fairly cornered and took his place on the board beside heathcote the picture of discontent and apprehension now then once across and back are you ready said birket seating himself beside his friend on a ledge no said gosse looking down at the water and getting off the board do you funk it no then go in hurry up or well come and help you idid rather go in from the edge said the boy you funk the board then the boy looked at the board then at his tyrants then at the water i suppose i do said he sulkily then put on your clothes and cut it said swinstead scornfully then turning to heathcote he shouted now then young un in you go heathcote plunged he was nervous and splashed more perhaps than usual but it was a tolerable header on the whole for a new boy and the spectators were not displeased with the performance or the swim across the pool and back which followed all right said swinstead stick to it young un and turn up regularly can your chum swim rather said heathcote taking his head out of the towel i wish i could swim as well as he can humph said swinstead when presently the two seniors were left to themselves number twos modest number ones cocky therefore said birket number two will remain number two and number one will remain number one right you are most learned plato but im curious to see how number one gets out of his friendly call on cresswell think hell cheek it yes and we shant hear many particulars from him birket was right as he very often was dick on waking was a good deal perplexed to find his friend absent and when he heard the reason he was more than perplexedhe was vexed it wasnt right of heathcote or loyal to take advantage of him in this way and he should complain of it meanwhile he had plenty to occupy his mind in endeavouring to recover his babys wardrobe a quest which as time went on and the chapel bell began to sound came to be exciting however just as he was about to go to the matron and represent to her the delicate position of affairs a bundle was thrown in through the ventilator over the door and fell into the middle of the dormitory floor where it came from there was no time to inquire aspinall was hustled into his garments as quickly as possible and then hustled down the stairs and into chapel just as the bell ceased ringing and the door began to close heathcote was there among the other new boys looking rather guilty as well he might the sight of him with his dripping locks and clear shining face interfered a good deal with dicks attention to the servicealmost as much as did the buzz of talk all round him the open disorder in the stalls opposite and the look of undisguised horror on aspinalls face as dick caught sight of that look his own conscience pricked him and he made a vehement effort to recall his wandering mind and fix it on the words which were being read he flushed as he saw boys opposite point his way and laugh with hands clasped in mock devotion and he felt angry with himself and young aspinall and everybody for laying him open to the imputation of being a prig he glanced again towards heathcote heathcote was standing with his hands in his pockets looking about him what business had heathcote to look about him when he dick was standing at attention why should heathcote escape the jeers of mockers while he dick had to bear the brunt of them it wasnt fair and yet he wasnt going to put his hands in his pockets and look about him to give them the triumph of saying they laughed him into it no so dick stood steadily and reverently all the service and was observed by not a few as one of the good ones of whom good things might be expected when chapel was over fate once more severed him from his chum and deferred the explanation to which both were looking forward the matron kidnapped master richardson on his way into the house in order to call his attention to a serious inconsistency between the number of his shirts in his portmanteau and the number on the inventory accompanying them an inconsistency which dick was unable to throw any light on whatever except that he supposed it must be a mistake and it didnt much matter it certainly mattered less than the fact that owing to this delay he had lost his seat next to heathcote at breakfast and had to take his place at the lowest table where he could not even see his friend there was great joking during the meal about the escapade in the lobby last night the general opinion being that it had been grand sport all round and that it was lucky the monitors werent at home at the time beastly grind said one youngsterall of them coming back today a fellow cant turn round but they interfere are all the sixth monitors asked dick rather replied his neighbour whom dick discovered afterwards to be no other than raggles the hero of the cargo whose fame he had heard the day before whats the name of the captain oh ponty he doesnt hurt said the boy its beasts like mansfield and cresswell and that lot who come down on you dick would fain have inquired what sort of fellow cresswell was but he was too anxious not to let the affair of the whipperin leak out and refrained he asked a few vague questions about the sixth generally and gathered from his companion that with a very few exceptions they were all beasts in school that one or two of them were rather good at cricket and swimming and football and that the monitorial system at templeton and at all other public schools required revision from which dick argued shrewdly that master raggles sometimes got into rows by the time he had made this discovery the bell rang for first school and there was a general movement to the door the two chums foregathered in the hall pity you werent up in time for a bathe said heathcote artfully securing the first word i heard you went too much fag getting up so early i mean to go down in the afternoon when most of the fellows turn up swinstead and birket were there i wish youd been there not worth the grind you can come with me this afternoon if you like some of the sharks will be down as well heathcote began to discover he had done a foolish thing and when he found his friend launching the sharks at his head in this familiar way he felt it was no use holding out any longer it was awfully low of me not to call you this morning said he but you looked so fast asleep you know so i was said dick unbending im glad you didnt rout me up for i was regularly fagged last night what time will you be going this afternoon depends ive got to see one of the sixth as soon as he turns up but that wont take long heathcote retired routed his friend was too many for him he heathcote had no one bigger than swinstead and birket to impress his friend with dick had sharks and behind them one of the sixth what was the use of opposing himself to such odds wait for us wont you was all he could say and next moment they were at their respective desks and school had begun dicks quick ears caught the sound of cabs in the quadrangle and the noise of luggage in the hall while school was going on and his mind became a little anxious as the prospect of his coming interview loomed nearer before him he hoped cresswell was a jolly fellow and that there would be no one else in his study when he went to call upon him he had carefully studied the geography of his fortress so he knew exactly where to go without asking any one which was a blessing as soon as class was over he made his way to the matrons room do you know if cresswell has come yet please yes what do you want with him oh nothing said dick dissembling i only wanted to know and he removed himself promptly from the reach of further questions little dreaming of the visit with which he was to be so shortly honoured cresswell the fleetest foot and the steadiest head in templeton was complacently unpacking his goods and chattels in the privacy of his own study he wasnt sorry to get back to templeton for he was fond of the old place and the summer term was always the jolliest of the year there was cricket coming on and lawn tennis and the long evening runs and the early morning dips and there was plenty of work ahead in the schools too and the prospect of an exhibition at midsummer if only freckleton gave him the chance altogether the sixthform athlete was in a contented frame of mind as he emptied his portmanteau and tossed his belongings into their respective quarters so intent was he on his occupation that it was a full minute before he became aware of a small boy standing at his open door and tapping modestly as he looked up and met the eyes of the already doubtful dick both boys inwardly thought i rather like that fellowa conclusion which as far as dick was concerned made it still more difficult for him to broach the subject of his mission cresswell was still kneeling down so it was impossible to form an opinion of his legs but his arms and shoulders certainly did not look like those of a snail what do you want youngster said cresswell oh said dick screwing himself up to the pitch swinstead told me to come to you oh said the other in a tone of great interest what about about thei meansomething about thethe harriers said dick suddenly beginning to see things in a new light about the harriers said cresswell rising to his feet and lounging up against the mantelpiece in order to take a good survey of his visitor what does mr swinstead want to know about the harriers the sight of the champion there drawn up to his full height with power and speed written on every turn of his figure sent dicks mind jumping at one bound to the truth what an ass he had been going to make of himself and what a time he would have had if he hadnt found out the trick in time as it was he could not help laughing at the idea of his own ridiculous position and the narrow escape he had had what are you grinning at said cresswell sharply not understanding the little burst of merriment in his presence dick recovered himself and said simply theyve been trying to make a fool of me i beg your pardon for bothering you hold hard said cresswell as the boy was about to retreat its very likely they have made a fool of youtheyre used to hard work but youre not going to make a fool of me come in and tell me all about it dick coloured up crimson and threw himself on the monitors mercy youll think me such an ass said he appealingly its really nothing i do think you an ass already said the senior so out with it whereupon dick blushing deeply told him the whole story in a way which quite captivated the listener by its artlessness they said you were an awful muff and couldnt run any faster than a snail you knowbegan heand as i had pulled off the new boys race they said theyd make me whipperin of the harriers instead of you and told me to come and tell you so and ask you to give me the whip cresswell laughed in spite of himself do you really want it he asked not now thank you i suppose youd been swaggering after youd won the race and they wanted to take the conceit out of you yes i suppose so and have they succeeded wellyes said dick i think they have then theyve done you a very good turn my boy and youll be grateful to them some day as for the whip you can tell them if theyll come here for it ill give it to them with pleasure there goes the dinner bellcut off or youll be late thanks cresswell i suppose said the boy lingering a moment at the door you wont be obliged to tell everybody about it you can do that better than i can said the sixthform boy laughing and dick felt as he hurried down to hall that he was something more than well out of it instead of meeting the fate which his own conceit had prepared he had secured a friend at court who something told him would stand by him in the coming term his selfesteem had had a fall but his selfrespect had had a decided lift for he felt now that he went in and out under inspection and that cresswells good opinion was a distinction by all means to be coveted as a token of his improved frame of mind he made frank confession of the whole story to heathcote during dinner and found his friend as he knew he would be brimful of sympathy and relief at his narrow escape swinstead and birket as they watched their man from their distant table were decidedly perplexed by his cheerful demeanour and full of curiosity to learn the history of the interview they waylaid him casually in the court that afternoon well have you settled it said birket eh oh yes its all right replied dick rather enjoying himself he made no difficulty about it did he not a bit jolly as possible it was not often that two fifthform boys at templeton felt uncomfortable in the presence of a new junior but swinstead and birket certainly did feel a trifle disconcerted at the coolness of their young victim you told him we sent you rather he was awfully obliged was he and did he give you the whip no he hadnt got it handy but i told him he could give it to you two next time he met youand hes going to and to the consternation of his patrons the new boy walked off whistling sweetly to himself and watching attentively the flight of the rooks round the school tower old man we shall have some trouble with number one said swinstead laughing yes weve caught a tartar for once said birket you and i may retire into private life for a bit i fancy chapter seven a general election the return of the sixth our heroes discovered made a wonderful change in the school life of templeton the fifth who always made the best use of their two days authority while they had it retired almost mysteriously into private life in favour of their betters all school sports and gatherings and riots had to depend no longer upon the sweet will of those who sported or gathered or rioted but on the pleasure of the monitors the school societies and institutions began to wake up after their holiday and generally speaking the wheels of templeton which during the first two days had bumped noisily over the cobbles got at last on to the lines and began to spin round at their accustomed pace in no part of the school was this change more felt than among the juniors they liked being off the line now and then and they always rebelled when the iron hand of the law picked them up and set them back on the track it wasnt only that they couldnt run riot and make templeton a beargarden that was bad enough but in addition to that they had to fag for the sixth and after a week or two of liberty the return to servitude is always painful you kids said raggles two days after the return of the sixth mind you show up at den after elections this evening what is den and who are elections asked dick what dont you know awful green lot of new kids you are elections is after tea in the hall and dens directly after that raggles was very much affronted when after this lucid explanation dick again enquired what do you mean by den and elections look here what a howling idiot you must be if youve got to be told half a dozen times ill spell it for you if you like all serene said heathcote two to one you come a cropper over elections who do they elect asked dick why everybody of course the captains of the clubs and all that hang it youll be there whats the use of fagging to tell you and what about the den who lives in it look here i shall lick you richardson if you go on like that you green kids are a lot too cheeky and the offended envoy went off in a huff leaving his hearers in a state of excited uncertainty as to the nature of the ceremony to which their company had been invited as the reader may like to have a rather more definite explanation than that afforded by mr raggles let him know that unlike most public schools the school year at templeton began after the easter holidays instead of after the summer holidays the new boys came up then for the most part though a few second chances as they were called straggled in in the autumn term and the various appointments to offices of honour and duty the inauguration of the clubs and the apportionment of the fags always formed an interesting feature of the new term the whole of the business was transacted in a mass meeting of the school known by the name of elections where under the solemn auspices of the sixth templeton was invited to pick out its own rulers and settle its own programme for the ensuing year elections as a rule passed off harmoniously the school acquiescing on most points in the recommendations of the sixth and except on matters of great excitement rarely venturing to lift up its voice in opposition the juniors however generally contrived to have their fling usually on the question of fagging which being a recognised institution at templeton formed a standing bone of contention and as part of the business of elections was the solemn drawing of lots for new boys to fill the vacancies caused by removal or promotion the opportunity generally commended itself as a fit one for some little demonstration the juniors den at templeton that is the popular assembly of those youthful templetonians who had not yet reached the dignity of the fourth form had always been the most radical association in the school though they differed amongst themselves in most things they were as one man in denouncing fagging and monitors their motto wasdown with both and it pleased them not a little to discover that though their agitation did little good in the way of reforming templeton it served to keep their den well before the school and sometimes to cause anxiety in high places such was the state of school politics at templeton when dick and heathcote obeyed the summons to attend their first elections on the first saturday of the new term they found the great hall crowded with benches rather like chapel with a raised dais at the upper end for the sixth a long table in front for the reporters and the rest of the space divided into clusters of seats occupied by members of the various school organisations represented of these clusters by far the largest was that devoted to the accommodation of the den towards which our heroes actively piloted by raggles and gosse and a few kindred spirits were conducted in state just as the proceedings were about to begin come and squash up in the corner said raggles were well behind and shant be seen if we want to shine shine as our heroes discovered in due time was a poetical way of expressing what in commonplace language would be called kicking up a shine shall you cheer ponty asked gosse of his friend rather hes a muff i shall howl at mansfield though and cresswell i shant howl at cresswell said dick boldly why not hes a beast youll get kicked if you dont i say i suppose theyll make him whipperin again said another boy near them dick looked uncomfortable for a moment but the indifferent looks on his neighbours faces convinced him the story had not yet reached the den cazenove thinks he ought to get it said gosse amid a general laugh for cazenove was almost as round as he was high shall i put you up old man hullo here they come theres ponty clap up you fellows a big cheer greeted pontifex the captain of the school as he strolled on to the dais and took the chair of state the new boys eyed him curiously he was a burly goodhumoured easy going fellow with an anything for a quiet life look about him as he stretched himself comfortably in his seat and looked placidly round the hall the cheering had very little effect on his composure indeed he may not have taken in that it was intended for him at all for he took no notice of it and appeared to be quite as much amused at the noise as any one else a great contrast to pontifex was mansfield the vicecaptain who with quick eye and cool determined mouth sat next and eyed the scene like a general who parades his forces and waits to give them the word of command like pontifex he seemed but little concerned either with the cheers of his friends or the few howls of his mutinous juniors he was used to noises and they made very little difference to him one way or another cresswell on the contrary seemed decidedly pleased when cheers and cries of well run greeted his appearance and most of the other monitorscartwright the quicktempered warmhearted templeton football captain freckleton the studious dark man bull the knowing one with his horseshoe pin pledge the smirking spider of the sixth and othersseemed to set no little store by the reception the school was pleased to accord them at last all were in their places the door was shuta traditional precaution against magisterial invasionand pontifex lounged to his feet well you fellows said he with a pleasant smile and in a pleasant voice here we are again at another election were always glad to see one another after the holidaysat least i am cheersand i hope weve got a good year coming on they tell me im captain of templeton this year laughter and cheers i can tell you im proud of it and only wish i wasnt going to oxford in the autumn cheers and cries of dont go the comfort is youll have a rattling good captain in mansfield when im gone cheers and a few howls i dont wonder some of the young uns howl for hell make some of you sit up which i could never do great laughter among the seniors and signs of dissension in the den but ive not got to make a speech theres a lot of business the first thing is the cricket captain theres only one man fit for that and i wont go through the farce of proposing him those who say mansfields the right man for cricket captain hold up your hands a forest of hands went up for even the malcontents who didnt approve of mansfield as a monitor had nothing to say against his cricket which was about as perfect as any that had been seen in the templeton fields for a dozen years with similar unanimity cresswell was reelected whipperin of the harriers and no one held up his hand more enthusiastically for him than did dick who shuddered to think how he could ever have imagined himself on such a lofty pedestal then followed in quick succession elections to the other high offices of state in templetoncartwright to the football captaincy bull to the keepership of the fives and tennis freckleton to be warden of the porta sinecure office supposed to imply some duties connected with the tub but really only the relic of some ancient office handed down from bygone generations and piously retained by a conservative posterity all these were reelections and passed off without opposition and as a matter of course when however pontifex announced that the office of usher of the chapel was vacant the duties of which were to mark the attendance of all boys and present weekly reports of their punctuality and proceeded to nominate pledge for the post the first symptoms of opposition showed themselves much to the delight of the den i move an amendment to that said birket looking a little nervous but evidently in earnest i dont think pledge is the proper man cheers i dont like him myselfloud cheersand i dont think im very fastidious great applause from the den we want an honest reliable manhear hearwholl keep our scores without fear or favour applause you neednt think im saying this for a lark im pretty sure to catch it but i dont care ill say what i think cries of well back you up and cheers youre not obliged to have a monitor to be usher of the chapel and i propose swinstead be appointed birket sat down amid loud cheers it had been a plucky thing for him to do and very few would have undertaken so ungracious a task but now he had undertaken it the meeting was evidently with him everybody here said pontifex as long as hes in order has a right to express his opinion without fear two names have now been proposed pledge and swinstead any more no one broke the silence then ill put up swinstead first who votes for swinstead everybody apparently the den to a man and the middle school scarcely less unanimously now for pledge about a dozen including bull and one or two of the sixth a select few among the juniors and a certain unwholesomelooking clique among the fourth and fifth it rather surprised our heroes to notice that pledge so far from appearing mortified by his reverse took it with a decidedly amiable smile which became almost grateful as it beamed into the corner where birket and swinstead both flushed with excitement sat by jingo i wouldnt be those two for a lot said raggles now i think pledge takes it very well said heathcote whereat there was a mighty laugh in the den as the joke passed round and the phenomenon of the green new kid blushing scarlet all over attracted general curiosity and stopped the proceedings for several minutes as soon as order was restored other elections were proceeded with including the school librarian and the post fag the duty of which latter office was to distribute the letters which came by the post to their respective owners for this office there was always great competition each set being anxious to get one of its own members on whom it could depend the contest this year lay between pauncefote of westovers and duffield of purbecks and ever since the term opened canvassing had been going on actively on behalf of the respective candidates i regret to say the laws relating to elections at templeton were not as rigid as those which regulate public elections generally and bribery and corruption were no name for some of the unscrupulous practices resorted to by the friends of either party to secure a vote if a small boy ventured to express so much as a doubt as to his choice his arm would be seized by the canvassing party and screwed till the required pledge was given and woe to that small boy if an hour later the other side caught him by the other arm and begged the favour of his vote for their man nothing short of perjury would keep his arm in its socket nor was it once or twice only that the youth of templeton would be made to forswear itself over the election of post fag several times a day the same luckless voter might be made to yield up his promise until at the end of a week he would become too confused and weary to recollect for which side his word of honour had last been given nor did it much matter for his vote in hall depended entirely on the company nearest within reach of his arm and if by some grim fatality he should chance to get with one arm towards each party the effort of recording his vote was likely to prove one of the most serious undertakings of his mortal life our heroes luckily for them found themselves planted in the midst of pauncefotes adherents so that they experienced no difficulty at all in making up their minds how they should vote they either did not see or did not notice a few threatening shouts and pantomimic gestures addressed to them by some of duffields supporters in a remote corner of the room and held up their hands for his opponent with the clear conscience of men who exercise a mighty privilege fearlessly stick up both hands said gosse we shall be short it wouldnt be fair said dick boldly howling prig said gosse in disgust canting young hypocrite youll get it hot i can tell you if shut up shouted dick rounding on him with a fierceness which astonished himself it was a show to see the way in which gosse collapsed under this thunderclap of righteous indignation he looked round at dick out of the corners of his eyes very much as a small dog contemplates the boot that has just helped him halfway across the road and positively forgot to keep his own grimy hand raised aloft till the counting was finished pauncefote has votes now those who are in favour of duffield there was great excitement and no little uproar as the rival party made their show cries of cheat both hands up rose from the shocked adherents of pauncefote and a good deal of quiet service in holding the arms of weaklings down to their sides was rendered on the frontier finally it was found that duffield had in votes whereat there were tremendous cheers and countercheers not unmixed with recriminations and imputations and threats which promised our heroes a lively time of it when finally they adjourned to the den before that happened however a solemn ceremony had to be gone through in which they were personally interested the chairman read out a list of new boys and ordered them to answer to their names and come forward on to the platform it was a nervous ordeal even for the most self composed to be thus publicly trotted out in the presence of all templeton and to hear the derisive cheers with which his name and appearance were greeted as he obeyed look at his legs cried one as dick inwardly hoping he was making a favourable impression passed up the hall and mounted the steps whereupon dick suddenly became conscious of his lower limbswhich by the way were as straight and tight a pair of shanks as any boy of fourteen could boastand tried to hide them behind a chair i can see them still cried a shrill voice just as he thought he had succeeded and poor dick who an hour ago had almost forgotten he was a new boy had to endure a storm of laughter and look as much at his ease as he could while all templeton mounted on chairs and stretched its necks to catch a glimpse of his unfortunate legs heathcote came in for a similar trial on account of his blushes and poor aspinall positively staggered and finally broke down under allusions to the bottle and soothing syrup and mamma and sister lottie the sixth had the sense not to attempt to quell the disorder till it had had a fair chance of blowing itself off then pontifex ordered the names to be put into a hat and handed round for each of the monitors to draw each monitor accordingly drew and announced the name of his future fag in the first round heathcotes name and aspinalls both came upthe former much to his disgust falling to the lot of pledge the latter to that of cresswell dick boiled with excitement as the hat started on its second round suppose he too should fall to the lot of a cad like pledge or a brute like bull or oh blissful notion suppose cresswell should draw him too as well as aspinall the hat started pontifex drew a stranger so did mansfield then cresswell drew and with a bound of delight dick heard his own name and marked the gleam of pleasure which crossed his new masters face as he turned towards him he forgot all about his legs he even missed heathcotes doleful look of disappointment or the thankful sigh of young aspinall he felt as if something good had happened to him and as if his star were still in the ascendant at the end of the elections a cry of three groans for fagging was proposed by some member of the den who took care to keep himself well concealed and as usual was lustily responded to by all the interested parties which little demonstration being over pontifex announced that the meeting was over and that captains levee would be held on that day week at our heroes were promptly kidnapped as they descended from the platform by the emissaries of the den who hurried them off to the serene atmosphere of that dignified assembly where for an hour or more they took part in denouncing everybody and everything and assisted in a noble flow of patriotic eloquence on the duty of the oppressed towards the oppressor and the slave towards his driver the sixth meanwhile rather glad to have elections over strolled off to their own quarters more row than ever this year said mansfield as he followed cresswell into his study pontys too easygoing i dont know if you keep them in too tight theyll burst i think hes right to give them some play well perhaps youre right cress but im afraid i shant be as easy with them as ponty my opinion is that if you give them an inch theyll take an ell by the way that was a queer thing about pledge did you expect it no but im not surprised hes a low cadpoor forbes owed his expulsion last term to him im positive he simply set himself to drag him down and he did it pity hes such a good bowler ones bound to keep him in the eleven and the fellows always swear by the eleven by the way i hear we have our work cut out for us at grandcourt this year theyre a hot lot and we play them on their own ground this time oh we shall do it if only ponty will wake up these two enthusiasts for the good of templeton would have been a good deal afflicted had they seen what the burly captain of the school was doing at that moment he was sitting in his easychair the picture of comfort with his feet up on the windowledge reading pickwick and laughing as he read no sign of care was on his brow and apparently no concern for templeton was weighing on his mind and even when a fag entered and brought him up a list of names of boys requiring his magisterial correction he ordered him to put it on the table and never even glanced at it for the next hour pontifex it is true did not do himself justice he passed for even more easygoing than he was and when he did choose to make an effort few fellows could better deal with the duties that fell to his lot but unfortunately he didnt make the effort often enough either for the good of templeton or his own credit he was getting to the end of his chapter when the door opened again and pledge entered hallo said the captain looking up after a bit you came a cropper i say this afternoon what have you been up to thats what i came to ask you said pledge with an amiable smile goodness knows i was as much surprised as you you know between you and me i dont think you did forbes much good last term quite a mistake i befriended him when everybody else was cutting him he told me when he left i was the only friend he had here a good friend asked pontifex looking hard at his man really ponty you dont improve in your manners said pledge with a slightly embarrassed laugh no offence old man said the captain but seriously dont you think you might do a little more good or even a little less well harm you know in templeton than you do most noble captain we must see what can be done said pledge colouring a trifle as he left the room ive lost my pull on him i suppose said the captain taking up his pickwick by jove i wish i could make up my mind to kick him chapter eight in which heathcote becomes interesting pledge was a type of fellow unfortunately not uncommon in some public schools whom it is not easy to describe by any other word than dangerous to look at him to speak to him to hear him the ordinary observer would notice very little to single him out from fifty other boys of the same age and condition he was clever goodhumoured and obliging he was a fine cricketer and lawn tennis player he was rarely overtaken in any breach of school rules and he was decidedly lenient in the use of his monitorial authority for all that fellows steered clear of him or when they came across him felt uncomfortable till they could get out of his way there were ugly stories about the harm he had done to more than one promising simpleminded young templetonian in days past who had had the illluck to come under his influence and although as usual such stories were exaggerated it was pretty wellknown why this plausible small boys friend was called spider by his enemies who envied no one who fell into his web heathcote accordingly came in for very little congratulation that evening after elections when he was formally sworn in to the den as the spiders fag and was thoroughly frightened by the stories he heard and the still more alarming mysterious hints that were dropped for his benefit however like a philosopher as he was he determined to enjoy himself while he could and therefore entered with spirit into the lively proceedings of that evenings den that important institution was our heroes discovered by no means an assembly of one idea although its leading motive might be said to be disorder it existed for other purposes as well as was clearly set forth in the articles of admission administered to each new boy on joining its honourable company terrible and sweeping were the affirmations each denite was required to make on the top of a crib to caesars commentaries i promise to stick by every chap of the den whenever i am called upon i promise never to sneak or tell tales of any chap of the den under any circumstances i promise never to fag for anybody more than i can possibly help i promise to do all i can to make myself jolly to the den if i break any of these rules i promise to let myself be kicked all round by the chaps of the den as long as i am able to stand it our heroes and young aspinall were called upon solemnly to subscribe to each of these weighty promises under threat of the most awful vengeance if they refused and as it seemed to each he might safely venture on the promise required they went dutifully through the ceremony and had the high privilege of exercising their new rights ten minutes later in kicking a couple of recalcitrant denites one of whom as it happened was the highminded mr gosse who had been detected in the act of telling tales to a monitor of one of his companions mr gosse availed himself on this occasion of the last clause of rule and lay down on the ground after the first kick he was however persuaded to resume his feet and finally had the inward satisfaction of feeling that he had obeyed the requirements of the rule to the utmost this little matter of business being disposed of and the usual patriotic speeches having been delivered the den which was nothing if it was not original proceeded to its electionsa somewhat tedious ceremony which it was very difficult for a stranger to understand a viciouslooking youth called culver was elected president of the club pauncefote the rejected post fag and smith were appointed treasurers and greatly to the surprise of the new boys but of no one else mr gosse still barely recovered from his loyalty to rule was elected secretary and made a very amiable and highlyapplauded speech in returning thanks for the compliment paid to him after this the den resolved itself into a social gathering and became rather tedious dick was interrupted in a yawn by messrs pauncefote and smith who politely waited upon him for his subscription a request which culver as president and gosse as secretary were also in attendance to see complied with how much said dick threepence said smith but was instantly jostled by a violent nudge from gosse how much tin have you got demanded that official dick who had long ere this lost any reverence he might be expected to entertain towards the secretary of the den replied threepence howling cram observed gosse i know youve more than that ah youve been putting your hands in my pockets then whereat there was a mighty cheer and the den was called to order to hear the joke which it did with genuine merriment and then and there passed a resolution unanimously requesting mr gosse once more to comply with rule that young gentleman got out of it this time by making a public apology and in no way abashed by the incident proceeded to attend the treasurers during the remainder of their business circuit culver stayed behind and said to dick awfully well you shut him up i say by the way i suppose you dont want a knife do you yes i do have you got one rather but id sooner have a dogshead pin instead i suppose youve not got one considering that dicks dogshead pin the gift of his particular aunt was all this time within a few inches of culvers nose the inquiry was decidedly artless yes i have said dick pointing to his scarf a jolly one too howd you like to swop lets see the knife replied the businesslike dick culver produced the knife rather a sorry weapon as regarded its chief blades but it had a saw and a gouge to remove stones from ones boot its a jolly fine knife said culver seeing that it was already making an impression and id be sorry to part with it dick mused on the weapon and lightly rubbed his chin against his aunts dogshead all right said he putting the knife into his pocket and slowly pulling out the pin his conscience half smote him as he saw his treasure being transferred to culvers scarf but he was too proud to try to revoke his bargain and consoled himself as best he could by fondling the knife in his pocket and thinking how useful the gouge would be before the evening was over he made the discovery that swopping was a favourite pastime of the leisure hours of the den he was startled at one period of the evening to notice heathcotes steel chain adorning the waistcoat of gosse and an hour later to find it in the possession of raggles who came over to dick with it and asked casually i suppose you wouldnt care to swop a knife for this dick was proof against the temptation he didnt want a steel chain but he wished culver would be moved to transfer the dogshead to some one who wanted a knife that however culver did not do he seemed as indeed his experience in business justified him in being a good judge of a good bargain and stuck very faithfully to his new pin in spite of a considerable number of offers after joining in a few songs the airs of which were somewhat vague the den adjourned as its proceedings had consisted in an uninterrupted uproar for two consecutive hours the new boys none of whom were seasoned to it were all more or less tired poor young aspinall in particular was very tired he had had a rough time of it and had tremblingly complied with every demand any one chose to make of him he had parted with all his available swoppable goods he had stood on a form and sung little hymns to a derisive audience he had answered questions as to his mother his sister and other members of his family he had endured buffeting and kicks till he was fairly worn out and till it ceased to be amusing to torment him when finally he was released and found himself on his way to the dormitory under dicks sheltering wing he broke down i wish i was dead he said miserably its awful here dont talk like that said dick a trifle impatiently for with all his good heart he got tired of the boys perpetual tears youll get used to it soon havent you got any pluck in you its all very well for you said the boy fellows seem to let you alone and not care to touch you but they see i cant stand up for myself more shame if they do said dick bluntly i dont believe you when you say so i call it cant how do you know you cant tell till you try oh dont be angry please said the boy i know you are right i really will try if you stick up for me never mind me said dick getting into bed aspinall did not pursue the topic but as he lay awake that night feeling his heart jump at every footstep and word in the room he made the most desperate and heroic resolves to become a perfect griffin to all templeton for all that he also nearly made up his mind to steal out of bed and peep from the window to see if there were any possibility of escaping home while templeton slept to devonshire the new boys all obeyed the summons of the halfpastsix bell next morning with nervous alacrity for it was something more than a mere call to shake off dull slothit was a reminder that they were fags and that their masters lay in bed depending on them to rouse them in time for morning chapel the old fags smiled to see the feverish haste with which the new ones flung themselves into their garments and started each on his rousing mission these veterans had had their day of the same sort of thing now they knew better and as long as they could continue occasionally to be found by their seniors with a duster in their hands or toasting a piece of bread before the fire the new brooms could be left to do all the other work for which the old ones reaped the credit heathcote with very dismal forebodings knocked at pledges door its time to get up please said he all right fetch me some hot water will you and brush my lace boots heathcote as he started off to fetch the water thought that the voice of his new master was certainly not as repulsive as he had been led by his numerous sympathisers to expect however said he to himself you cant always judge of a fellow by his voice which was very true as he found immediately afterwards when as he was kneeling down at the tap trying to coax the last few drops of hot water into his can a voice behind him said look sharp you fellow dont drink it all up and he looked up and saw dick and dicks can bound on the same errand as his own hallo he said you wont find much left youll have to give me some of yours then said dick i cant ive only got half a canfull as it is but cresswell sent me i tell you and pledge sent me pooh he doesnt matter hes a beast come go halves old man of course heathcote went halves and enquired as he did so whether dick had got any boots to clean ive put the young un on to that said dick rather grandly i left him crying on them just now how many fags has cresswell got us two said dick at least ive not seen any more i believe im the only one pledge has got poor beggar thanks georgie get next to me at chapel and the two friends went each his own way pledge seemed on the whole agreeably surprised to get as much as a quarter of a can of hot water and heathcote as he polished up the lace boots felt he had begun well his new master said little or nothing to him as he put the study tidy arranged the books and got out the cup and saucer and coffeepot ready for the seniors breakfast is there anything else he asked as the chapel bell began to toll no thats all just now you can come and clear up after breakfast and if youve got nothing to do after morning school you can come and take a bat down at the nets while i bowl at the very least heathcote had expected to be horrified when this terrible ogre did speak by a broadside of bad language and he felt quite bewildered as he recalled the brief conversation and detected in it not a single word which could offend anybody on the contrary everything had been most proper and considerate and the last invitation coming from a first eleven man to his new fag was quite gratuitously friendly i dont think hes so bad he remarked to dick as they went from chapel to breakfast all i know is said dick cresswell was asking me if it was my chum who had been drawn by pledge and when i told him he told me i might say to you from him that you had better be careful not to get too chummy with the spider and the less you hang about his study the better i dont think cresswell would say a thing like that unless he meant it i dare say not said heathcote but i wish to goodness some one would say what it all means i cant make it out after breakfast he repaired to his lords study and cleared the table well said pledge what about cricket thanks awfully said the fag id like it all serene come here as soon as school is up which heathcote did and was girt hand and foot with pads and led by his senior down into the fields where for an hour he stood gallantly at the wickets swiping heroically at every ball and reerecting his stumps about once an over as often as they were overturned by the desolating fire of the crack bowler of templeton a few stragglers came up and watched the practice but heathcote had the natural modesty to know that their curiosity did not extend to his batting gallant as it was indeed they almost ignored the existence of a bat anywhere and even failed to be amused by the gradual demoralisation of the fag who wielded it under the sense of the eyes that were upon him pledge is on his form this term said cresswell one of the onlookers to his friend cartwright tremendously said cartwright grandcourt wont stand up to it if its like that on match day whos the kid at the wicket his new fagpoor little beggar its a pity poor forbes was just like him a couple of years ago never mind said cresswell mansfield has got his eyes open and i fancy hell be down in that quarter when hes captain old ponty wont do it hes worse than ever wont even come to practice till hes finished pickwick he says and the two friends strolled off rather despondently in due time heathcote was allowed to divest himself of his armour and accompany his senior indoors you didnt make a bad stand youngster said pledge as they walked across the field especially at the end have you done much cricket not much said heathcote blushing at the compliment you should stick to it youll get plenty of chance this term and yet said heathcote to himself this is the fellow everybody tells me is a beast to be fought shy of and not trusted for a minute he was almost tempted to interrogate pledge pointblank on what it all meant but his shyness prevented him nothing occurred during the day to solve the mystery there was comparatively little to be done in the way of fagging and what little there was was amply compensated for by the help pledge gave him in his latin composition in the evening later on while pledge was away somewhere heathcote was putting the books away on to the shelves and generally tidying up the study when the door partly opened and a small round missive was tossed on to the floor of the room heathcote regarded the intruder in a startled way as if it had been some infernal machine but presently took courage to advance and take the missive in his hand it was a small round cardboard box about the size of a tennis ball which much to his surprise bore his own name printed in pen and ink on the outside he opened it nervously and found a note inside also addressed to himself which ran thus heathcotethis is from a friend you are in peril dont believe anything pledge tells you suspect everything he does he will try to make a blackguard of you you had much better break with him refuse to fag for him and take the consequences than become his friend be warned in timejunius this extraordinary epistle all printed in an unrecognisable hand set heathcotes heart beating and his colour coming and going in a manner quite new to him who was this junius and what was this conspiracy to terrify him suspect everything he does a pretty piece of advice certainly to anybody for instance what villainy could be concealed in his bowling for an hour at the wickets or rescuing young aspinall from his tormentors he will try to make a blackguard of you supposing junius was right would it not be warning enough to fight shy of him when he began to try heathcote had reached this stage in his meditations when he heard pledge approaching he hurriedly crushed the letter away into his pocket and returned to the bookcase hullo young fellow said pledge entering putting things straight thanks what about your latin verses not done as usual i suppose lets have a look ill do them for you and you can fetch them in the morning goodnight heathcote retired utterly puzzled he could believe a good deal that he was told but it took hard persuasion to make him believe that a senior who could do his latin verses for him could be his worst enemy chapter nine a literary ghost for two whole days heathcote let juniuss letter burn holes in his pocket not knowing what to think of it or what to do with it for him to take dick into his confidence was however a mere matter of time for heathcotes nature was not one which could hold a secret for many days together and his loyalty to his leader was such that whenever the secret had to come out dicks was the bosom that had to receive it its rum said the latter after having read the mysterious document twice through i dont like it georgie the thing is i cant imagine who wrote it you didnt did you dick laughed rather not i dont see the good of holeinthecorner ways of doing things like that do you think cresswell wrote it hes about the only senior that knows me except pledge i dont fancy he did its not his style said dick who seemed quite to have taken the whipperin under his wing he might know i wonder dick if youd mind trying to find out it maybe a trick you know after all dont look like it said dick glancing again at the letter its too like what everybody says about him thats the worst of it hes hardly said a word to me since ive been his fag and certainly nothing bad and he writes my latin verses for me too i fancy fellows are down on him too much well said dick ill try and pump cresswell but i wish to goodness georgie you werent that beasts fag every conversation he had on the subject no matter with whom ended in some such ejaculation till heathcote got quite used to it and even ceased to be disturbed by it indeed he was half disappointed after all the warning and sympathy he had received to find no call made upon his virtue and no opportunity of making a noble stand against the wiles of the spider he would rather have enjoyed a mild passage of arms in defence of his uprightness and it was a little like a sell to find pledge turn out after all so uninterestingly like everybody else dick duly took an opportunity of consulting cresswell on his friends behalf i say cresswell said he one morning as the senior and his fag walked back from the tub who was forbes never mind said cresswell shortly this was a rebuff certainly but dick stuck to his purpose heathcote asked me he said hes pledges fag and everybody says to him hell come to grief like forbes and he doesnt know what they mean you gave your chum my message did you said cresswell oh yes and do you know the other evening he had a letter thrown into him he doesnt know where from saying the same thing cresswell whistled and stared at his fag was it signed junius and done up in a ball he asked excitedly yes did you send it and was it in printed letters so that nobody could tell the writing yes do you know about it i say no said cresswell no more does anybody your chums had a letter from the ghost the what the templeton ghost my boy i dont believe in ghosts said dick thats all right no more do i but those who do say its a bad sign to get a letter from ours forbes got one early last term do you really mean began dick i mean said cresswell interrupting him and evidently not enjoying the topic i mean that nobody knows who writes the letters or why its been a mystery ever since i came here three years ago it happens sometimes twice or thrice a term and other times perhaps only once in six months what had heathcote better do asked dick feeling anything but reassured do hed better read the letter theres no use going and flourishing it all round the school with this small grain of advice dick betook himself to his friend and succeeded in making him more than ever uncomfortable and perplexed nor was his perplexity made less when during the next few days it leaked out somehow and spread all over templeton that heathcote had had a letter from the ghost interviewers waited on him from all quarters seniors crossexamined him fifthform fellows tried to coax the letter out of him and the den called upon him under threats of rule to make a full disclosure of what had befallen him he had a fair chance of losing his head with all the attention paid him and had it not been for cresswells advice emphasised by dick he might like the ass in the lions skin have made himself ridiculous as it was he was not more than ordinarily intoxicated by his sudden notoriety and kept the ghosts letter prudently hidden in his own pocket one fellow and one only besides dick saw it and that was pledge whats all this about the ghost asked the senior of his fag one evening during preparation in their study is it true youve had a letter yes said heathcote very uncomfortably do you mind letting me see it id rather not please said the boy dont you think it was meant for me to see asked pledge heathcote was puzzled he had never thought so yet and wished dick was at hand to be consulted i dont think so he said it says doesnt it that you are to be on your guard against me and that i shall be sure and do you harm and that the less you see of me the better eh yes have you seen the letter no or i shouldnt ask to see ithow would you like to have letters written about you like that not at all do you know who wrote it no no one knows and you believe it of course no i dont said heathcote making up his mind at a bound on a question which had been distracting him for a week pledge seemed neither pleased nor surprised by this avowal doesnt everybody say you ought to perhaps they do said heathcote getting into a corner doesnt your chum say so he only goes by what other fellows say you mean cresswell i daresay cresswell may have said something said the new boy getting deeper and deeper and beginning to shuffle in spite of himself you know he has said something said pledge sternly the ghost didnt tell you to tell falsehoods did it no cresswell did say something and you think it was very friendly of him dont you no i dont said the unhappy heathcote is cresswell very fond of you asked pledge no i hardly ever saw him why do you suppose he sent you that message then i dont know perhaps hes got a spite against you the boy was fairly out of his depth now and gave up trying to recover his feet would you like to know why or dont you care i would like to know please i daresay youve heard of a fellow called forbes heathcote had from twenty different fellows forbes was a fag of mine last yeara nice boy but dreadfully weak minded any one could twist him round his thumb as long as i kept my eye on him he was steady enough but if ever i let him slide he got into trouble i was laid up a month last autumn with scarlet fever and of course forbes was on the loose and spent most of his time with cresswell and his set as soon as i got back i noticed a change in him he had got into bad ways and talked like a fellow who was proud of what he had learned he used to swear and tell lies and other things a great deal worse i did all i could to pull him up and before christmas i fancied he was rather steadier but last term he broke out again as bad as ever i could keep no hold of him he was constantly cutting me for his other friend and all the time i as his senior got the credit of his ruin he was expelled in february for some disgraceful row he got into and because i stuck to him to the end his other friend gets up a report that i was to blame for it all i dont profess to be better than i ought to be youngster i know i should be better than i am but im not a blackguard heathcote was greatly impressed by this narrative it cleared up to his mind a great deal of the mystery that had been tormenting him the last few days and accounted for most of the stories and rumours which he had heard the manner too in which pledge defended himself taking no undue credit for virtue and showing such little bitterness towards his traducers went far to win him over its hard lines on you he said you see even a ghost can be wrong sometimes yes he can said heathcote resolutely i should like to see the letter if you have it and he did see it and heathcote watched the two red spots kindle on his cheeks as he read it and then crushed it up in his hand you dont want it back i suppose youre not going to frame it no replied the boy watching the ghosts letter rather regretfully as it flared up and burned to ashes on the grate he wished the unpleasant impression caused in his own mind by the affair could come to an end as easily as that scrap of paper did care however was not wont to sit heavily at any time on the spirit of george heathcote and as pledge did not again return to the subject and even dick seeing no immediate catastrophe befall his friend began to suspect the whole affair as an intricate and elaborate practical joke at the expense of two new boys the matter gradually subsided and life went on at its usual jogtrot this jogtrot gave place however on one eventful afternoon to a more stately parade on the occasion of the captains levee a week after elections this ceremony one of the immemorial traditions of templeton which fellows would as soon have thought of neglecting as of omitting to take a holiday on the queens birthday was always an occasion of general interest after the reassembling of the school the captain of templeton on this evening was at home in other words he stood on the platform at the top of hall in his swallows and received the school who all turned up in their very best attire to do honour to the occasion new boys were presented by their seniors and the captain if he was a fellow of tact and humour usually contrived to say something friendly to the nervous juniors and generally the occasion was looked upon as one on which templeton was expected to make itself agreeable all round and do itself honour for some days previously our heroes had been carefully looking up their wardrobes in anticipation of the show dick on the very evening of elections had put aside his whitest shirt and heathcote had even gone to the expense of a lofty masher collar and had forgotten all about the ghost in his excitement over the washing of a choker which would come out limp though he personally devoted a cupful of starch to its strengthening there was as usual keen competition among the members of the den as to who should achieve the showiest rig on the occasion for some days the owner of heathcotes steel chain was mentioned as the favourite until rumour got abroad that young aspinall was a hot man and had white gloves and three coral studs but culver outdid everybody at the last moment by appearing in a real swallowtail of his own which he had secretly borrowed from a cousin during the holidays and kept dark till now this of course settled the contest in favour of the president of the den and so much enthusiasm prevailed over the discovery that a den levee was immediately proposed the idea took and after much debate it was resolved that the honourable and original fraternity should take possession of the lower end of hall on the captains night and after doing duty at the top end repair to the bottom there to display their loyalty to their own particular swallow due announcement was made to this effect and rule carefully rehearsed in the ears of all waverers the evening came at last pontifex surrounded by the sixth rambled up on to the dais and waited goodhumouredly for the show to begin quite regardless of his own imposing appearance and of the awe which the array of senior shirtfronts struck into the hearts of the new juniors who looked on in solemn order templeton ascended the dais and rendered homage with the fifth the captain was affable and with the upper fourth he exchanged a few jocular courtesies with the middle school he contented himself with a shake of the hand and a how are you wright ah troup old man and suchlike greetings boys he had punished yesterday he received quite as warmly now as the most immaculate of the virtuous ones and boys who had cheeked him two hours ago in the fields he shook hands with as cordially as he did with the most loyal of his adherents there was a pause as the last of the middle school descended from the dais and the den headed by the resplendent culver advanced templeton tried to look grave and remember its good manners but it was an effort under such an array of glory culver himself with his borrowed coat so tight under the arms that he could not keep his elbows down and his waistcoat pinned back so far that the empty buttonhole in his front quite put the studded ones to shame might have passed in a crowd but gosse with his hair parted in the middle and his whisker elaborately curled pauncefote with his light blue silk handkerchief protruding half out of his waistcoat pocket and smith with the cuffs that hid the tips of his fingers were beyond gravity and a suppressed titter followed the grandees up the hall and on to the platform pontifex received them all with serene affability and good breeding hullo youngster said he to culver not even bestowing a glance on his finery hope to see you in an eleven this season ah gosse my boy quiet as ever eh youre an inch taller than last levee how are you pauncefote how are you smith how goes the novel not dead i hope no its going on said pauncefote blushing put me down for a copy said the captain hullo here come the new boys time did not appear to have endowed our heroes yet with confidence or elegance in the art of ascending the templeton platform dick still retained a painful recollection of his legs and heathcote was torn asunder by the cruel vagaries of his high collar which would not keep on the button but insisted on heeling over choker and all at critical moments to one side aspinall made a more respectable show for he was too nervous to bestow a thought on his dress or to notice the curious eyes turned upon him from remote corners new boys were always presented by their seniors and it was a critical moment when cresswell taking dick and aspinall one by each arm said in an audible voice captain allow me to introduce mr richardson and mr aspinall two new boys dick bowed as gracefully as he could and watched the captains hand sharply in case it might show signs of expecting to be shaken which it did with a cheery very glad to see you richardson i hear you won the new boys race youve got a good trainer in cresswell how do you do aspinall feeling more at home here arent you i recollect how lost i was the first time i tumbled into school captain allow me to introduce mr heathcote said pledge poor heathcote whose choker had now got round to his back turned crimson and said thank you and then made a grab at the captains hand by way of hiding his confusion ah how are you heathcote said the magnate kindly hope to see plenty of you in the tub and down field you new boys should show up out of doors all you can mansfield was not the only senior standing by who heard and appreciated this delicate hint pledge heard it too and knew what it meant if old ponty said mansfield to cresswell would only follow it up what a splendid captain he would be theres not another fellow can go through levee the way he does he strokes down everybody goodness knows when my turn comes i shall come a cropper your turn will come soon if ponty leaves this term youre bound to have levee in your first week hullo whats up down there this last question was caused by the slight excitement of den levee which according to programme was in the act of being celebrated at the bottom of the hall culver who was really rather sore under the arms with his long confinement in his cousins swallow was mounted on a lexicon and word being passed that he was ready to receive company the den proceeded to file past him in imitation of the ceremony which had just been concluded on the upper dais the imitation in this case however was not flattery culver was not a dignified youth and his sense of humour was not of that refined order which enables a man to distinguish between comedy and burlesque he had a general idea that he had to make himself pleasant which he accordingly did in his own peculiar style ah gossy old chap he said as the secretary of the den presented himself with his whiskered cheek nearest to his chief its coming on my boy youll have a hair and a half before the grandcourt match the titter which greeted this sally highly delighted the tightlaced president who especially as his audience consisted of a good sprinkling of the middle school attracted by the chance of sport strained every nerve to sustain his reputation for wit how do you do pauncefote my lad said he as the owner of the light blue silk handkerchief approached why dont you show enough wipe stick a pin in one corner and leave the rest hanging down hows the novel my boy pretty well said pauncefote ah my venerable chum smith continued the president holding out his hand to the joint secretary why dont you wash your face and stick your hands up your sleeves hows a fellow to flap you a daddle in those cuffs eh in this refined style of banter culver passed his followers in array gradually degenerating in his humour as he went on until the last few came in for decidedly broad personalities but he saved up his final effort for the new boys of whom aspinall happened to be pushed forward first booh hoo poor little baby did it come for a little drink of its ittle bottle it should then hold out your hand you young muff aspinall obeyed and next moment was writhing under the scrunch which the president in his humour bestowed upon it now make a bow demanded that gentleman when the greeting was over aspinall made obeisance amid loud derisive cheers and was called upon to repeat the performance several times now shake hands again the boy tried to escape but his arm was roughly seized and his hand once more captured in the ruthless grip of his host in vain he tried to get free the more he struggled the tighter the grip became till at last he fairly fell on his knees and howled for pain then dick who had gradually been boiling over could stand it no longer let his hand go he shouted stepping up to the president and emphasising his demand with a slight push you might have knocked the den down with a feather they stared at one another and then at dick and then at one another again until their eyes ached then culver utterly oblivious of his tight sleeves or his dignified position turned red in the face and said what do you mean what i say said dick a trifle pale and breathing hard will you fight said culver yes said dick in a dream for his head was swimming round and he forgot where he was and what the row was about you mean it once more asked the president yes i do again retorted dick very well said culver instantly there was a stampede of the den and cries of a fight shook the halls and passages of templeton the sixth heard it in their lofty regions whither they had retired after the fatigue of levee pity to stop it said birket who reported the state of the matter to the seniors itll do good whos the better man asked cresswell culver i fancy humph said the captain youd better be there to see fair play birket and cresswell will come down and stop it in ten minutes eh cress all serene said cresswell chapter ten describes a great battle and what followed perhaps i ought to begin this chapter with an apology perhaps i ought to delude my readers into the belief that it gives me far more pain to describe a fight than it gave dick and his antagonist to take part in it perhaps i ought to go back and alter my last chapter and call in the dogs of war perhaps i should solemnly explain to the reader how much more beautiful it would have been in dick if instead of letting his angry passions rise at the sight of young aspinalls wrongs he had walked kindly up to the bully and laying his hand gently on his shoulder asked him with a sweet smile whether he thought that was quite a nice thing for a big boy to do to a small one whether his conscience didnt tell him he erred and whether he wouldnt go and retire for a quiet hour to his study and think the matter over with the said conscience then if at the end of that time he still felt disposed to use physical force towards the little new boy would he allow him dick on this occasion to bear the punishment in his young friends place i say i might perhaps begin my chapter in this fashion were it not for two trifling difficultiesone being that i should be a humbug which it is not my ambition to be the other that dick too would have been a humbug which he certainly was not the truth about fighting isif one must express an opinion on so delicate a subjectthat its right and wrong depend altogether on what you fight about there are times when to fight is right and there are a great many more times when to fight is wrong and for dick at the present moment to hold up his hands and say oh no thank you when culver asked him if it was a fight would have been as bad every bit as if he had picked a quarrel and fought with the man who caught him out at cricket having relieved our minds so far let us reader accompany basil the son of richard as he strides surrounded by his myrmidons and most of all by the faithful heathcote to the templeton cock pit where already the largeboned culver hemmed in no more by the envious grip of the toga of his mothers sisters son awaits the fray for him gosse holds the sponge and bids him hit low and walk his foeman over the tapes and now a score of officious voices cry out a ring and the surging waves fall back as when a whirlpool opens in midocean tall amid the crowding juniors stalks birket at sight of whom dicks heart rejoices and gosses countenance falls for birket will see fair play and now the faithful heathcote staggers under the weight of his friends discarded garments and whispers words of brotherly cheer as the snowy sleeves of the hero roll up his arm and his chafing collar falls from his swelling neck the crowd grows dumb and hearts beat quick as those two stand there face to face the largeboned solid culver and the compact light footed dick with his clean fresh skin and wellpoised head and tight determined lips and the signal goes forth that the battle has begun the knowing ones are there who with birket look close to see what the new boy is made of and how he works his left but the unknowing regard the size of their culver and prophesy fast and furiously then do these two circle slowly round the tapes attempting nothing great but by feint and parry seeking each to unmask his man and discover where he is weak and where strong the unknowing ones and gosse murmur and cry on their man to let out and he irresolute a moment yields and standing drives at his foemans head up goes the right of basil the son of richard and behold while all cry a parry in goes his left quick as a flash and grazes the chin of the solid culver whereat the ring wellnigh breaks with applause and the knowing ones nod one at another and heathcote leaps for joy and beams like the sun at midday as his hero returns to his knees and girds himself for the second round birket looks up at the clock and groans to see five minutes gone gosse too groans as his man steps forward once more unsteady and amazed at what had befallen him hit low he whispers and now once more dead silence falls upon the ring and all eyes turn to where dick steps lightly up and meets his man all mark the laugh in his eye but the knowing ones like it not steady says birket dont be too sure but basil the son of richard heeds him not and his eyes laugh still this time not culver but he is the pursuer and the unknowing ones quake for their hero yet culver stands as he stood before and deals his blow once more the new boy parries and drives home with his left but alas culver is ready for him while he unprepared with his right still up receives the fist of culver on his chest and the echo falls upon the ring like distant thunder where now is the laughter in basils eyes or who can see the sunlight on heathcotes troubled face who now nod their heads but the unknowing ones and who looks grave but birket as when a mountain torrent rushes down its bed with huge uproar until it meet a fiercer leaping headlong from the cliff and drowning the lesser din with a greater so do the shouts for basil the son of richard grow faint beneath the shouts that rise for culver the large of bone nor when time is called and from the trembling knees of their seconds those two arise and stalk into the ring does the clamour cease till birket with his eye on the clock breathes threatenings and demands it then you may hear a pin fall as basil stern of eye and tight of lip stands fast and waits his man the knowing ones look anxiously to where the solid culver squares and take cheer for he is flushed and eager and his lips are open as he walks into the fray and heathcote calls loud upon his hero and birket bids him straight go in and win gosse yet again bids the solid one hit low and the unknowing ones cry two to one on culver the heroes meet and culver gathering up his might makes feint at basils head up goes the wary arm of basil which marking culver smites hard and low a villain thrust hard on the heros belt whereat gosse cries aloud bravo but heathcote rages and shouts belt and would himself spring into the fray but birket holds him back for basils eyes flash fire and on the distant staircase stands already cresswell ready to stop the fight a minute more cries birket and the ring is still as when etna ready to burst sleeps then does basil the son of richard gather himself together and draw breath while culver sure of his man steps back for a mighty blow dick sees it coming and marks with a quick cool eye its fierce descent with half a step he avoids it and as the solid form sways past he greets it right and left with wellaimed blows which send it headlong to the dust two long yards distant then as when the swelling torrent breaks with one furious bound into the vale below does the crowd burst into the ring and with mighty shouts proclaim a victory to the lightfooted son of richard and behold as they do so the towering form of cresswell comes in view and bears down upon the scene never did swarm of mice spying grimalkin afar scamper quicker to their holes than do the youths of templeton vanish before the distant view of cresswell victor and vanquished knowing and unknowingall but one fade to sight and ere the monitor can stop the fight the fight is over birket alone remained to meet the senior well said the latter is it all over rather said the fifthform boy im awfully glad you didnt come sooner bless you said cresswell ive been watching it for the last five minutes so i ought to know when to turn up you have then you saw the finish the youngster made as neat a job of it as i ever saw it was rather pretty said cresswell hed something to make up for though after making such an ass of himself in the second round by theway was that last shot of culvers below the belt it was precious close to the wind anyhow you leave that to me though ill make that all right thanks said the monitor something ought to be said about it or we shall have more of it well i suppose theyll shake hands after a bit you might see to that too pontys sure to ask and there ought to be an end of it when birket half an hour later descended to the den he found a revolution in active progress dick was the hero of the hour his valiant stand against solid odds his last victorious blow but most of all the cowardly blow of his opponent had suddenly raised him to a pinnacle of glory which took away his breath culver despite his dresscoat despite his exertions at levee despite his seniority and long service had been ignominiously deposed from office and subjected to the rigour of rule by an indignant and resentful populace the unknowing ones who had backed him the loudest now answered the soonest to heathcotes demand for retribution and gosse himself who had an hour ago whispered nothing but hit low now denounced the coward and proclaimed his deposition by a single vote culver was dethroned and dick amid frantic cheers elected president in his stead nor did popular clamour cease there for gosse was stripped of his office too and heathcote unanimously chosen secretary and for the first time in history the den did homage to two weekold new boys and called them its leaders it was scarcely possible that dick in the midst of all this glory should remain unmoved he tried to look modest he tried to bear himself as though he had done nothing out of the common he even tried to persuade himself he would rather not accept the office thrust upon him but his heart swelled with pride and his head grew light in its lofty atmosphere nor did birkets visit tend to sober him well youngster said the fifthform boy you managed it at last then oh yes said dick grandly hes not very good with his parries isnt he hes good at coming in on your chest my boy dont you be too cocky youre not a tom sayers yet the last blow was below the belt though said dick i know ive come to see about that you neednt bother hes been licked for it i didnt touch him of course but the other fellows did kind of you has he apologised oh never mind said dick forgivingly it doesnt matter tut do you suppose hes got to apologise to you i was there to see fair play and hes to do it to me at any other time dick might have felt snubbed but now he failed to see the rebuke and gave order grandly that culver should be brought there he is said he as the unhappy expresident of the den was conducted into his presence culver said birket you are a cad you hit below the belt no i didnt it was an accident pleaded the culprit please birket ive been licked already stand up on that form and tell all the fellows you apologise for doing a cowardly action and disgracing templeton culver promptly obeyed and repeated the apology word for word there were loud cries for gosse at this point and birket yielded to the popular demand and ordered the exsecretary to go through the same ceremony which the exsecretary cheerfully did now then said the fifthform boy turning again to culver shake hands with richardson and make it up youve been licked so theres nothing left to settle culver may have secretly differed from birket on this point but he kept his secret to himself and held out his hand dick took it and gave it an honest shake it is one of the luxuries victors enjoy to shake the proffered hand of the vanquished and dick enjoyed it greatly its all made up now said birket addressing the den and thered better be no more row about it or youll have one of the sixth down on you and he wont let you off as easy as i have i can tell you but although the fight was over and the breach of the peace was healed the consequences of the fray were of much longer duration their effect on dick was not on the whole beneficial to that doughty young warrior prosperity went harder with him than adversity as long as he had his hill to climb his foe to vanquish his peril to brave dick had the makings of a hero but when fortune smoothed his path when the foe lay at his feet when the peril had passed behind then dicks troubles began popularity turned his head and laid him open to dangers twice as bad as those he had cleared the more fellows cheered him the more he craved their cheers the more he craved their cheers the more willing a slave he became it strikes me youngster said cresswell one day when the term had turned the corner and the grandcourt match was beginning to loom very near in the future it strikes me youre not doing much good up here youre always fooling about with those precious juniors of yours instead of sticking to cricket and tennis and your books heres young aspinall here ahead of you by long chalks in classics and getting a break on at tennis thatll puzzle you to pick up unless you wake up you can do as you like only dont blame me if you get stuck among the louts for a time this friendly advice pulled dick up in his profitless career the dread of being considered a lout by your senior is a motive which appeals forcibly to most boys and for a week or so dick made a feverish show of returning to his outdoor sports and doing himself justice but the effort died away under the claims of the den den suppers den concerts den debates and den conclaves always somehow managed to clash with templeton work and play and even heathcote found it next to impossible to keep up his batting and his secretarial duties to the honourable fraternity i shall have to jack it up said he one day dolefully to dick pledge always wants me just when things are going on here hadnt you better get some one else bosh let pledge get some one else said dick warmly what right has he got to make you fag for him out of school thats the very thing we want to stop but i rather like the batting cartwright said i was improving oh of course just a dodge to make you stick to it dont you let them gammon you georgie stick to us and hang pledge and of course heathcote obeyed and his cricket suffered and fellows who had hopes of him shrugged their shoulders when they saw him rioting in the den and letting another usurp his pads had dick known the bad turn he was doing his friend he would have hesitated before requiring him to give up a healthy sport which just then was one of his chief safeguards against far less healthy occupations the spider had not had the fly in his web for five weeks without casting some light toils around him heathcote himself would have said that pledge was as inoffensive today as he had been on the first day of the term and would have angrily scouted the idea that junius or any one else had been right in his warnings and yet in five weeks heathcote had begun not to be the nice boy he was not that pledge by any direct influence incited him to evildoing on the contrary he always corrected him when he prevaricated and scolded him when he idled but the boy had begun a course of indirect training far more dangerous to his morals and happiness than any direct training could have been he discovered very gradually that pledges notions of persons and things were unlike any he had hitherto entertained in the innocence of his heart he had always given every one credit for being honest and virtuous until he had good cause to see otherwise when any one told him a thing he usually believed it straight off if any one professed to be anything he usually assumed it was so the small knot of boys at templeton who called themselves religious who said their prayers steadily who refused to do what their conscience would not allow who tried to do good in some way or other to their fellows these heathcote had readily believed were christians and more than once he had wished he belonged to their set but somehow pledges influence gave him altogether different ideas on these points for instance he would one evening hear a conversation somewhat as follows between his senior and some friendgenerally wrangham of the fifth who usually associated with pledge i hear holden is not going to try for the bishops scholarship after all says wrangham who by the way is aesthetic and adopts an air of general weariness of the world which hardly becomes a boy of seventeen did he tell you so himself asked pledge yes then of course we dont believe it hed like us to think so i daresay he knows what he is about though he got confirmed last week you know and thats bound to go down with winter winters pretty well bound to favour morris i fancy though hes not pious says pledge there are three young morrises growing up you know wrangham laughs languidly nice rotten state the schools in says he thank goodness it doesnt matter much to me but ive once or twice thought of joining the saints just to save trouble ha ha id come and look at you old man fancy you and mansfield looking over the same hymnbook and turning up your eyes but says heathcote who has been drinking in all the talk in a bewildered way and venturing now as he sometimes does to join in it but i always thought mansfield was really good his two hearers laugh till the boy blushes crimson and wishes he had not made such an ass of himself rather says wrangham he is one of the elect its worth fifty pounds a year to him so it would be a wonder if he wasnt yes my boy says pledge if you want to get on at templeton take holy orders believe everybodys as good as he tries to make out and youll have no trouble at all when a fellow cracks up your batting dont on any account suspect he wants to borrow five shillings of you and if he tells you its naughty to look about in chapel dont imagine for a moment hes got halfadozen cribs in his study bah theyre all alike thank goodness youre not a hypocrite yet young un whatever you may become now you can cut goodnight and heathcote obeys and lies wide awake an hour wondering how he can ever have remained a simpleton as long as he has chapter eleven how ponty takes his hand out of his pocket the grandcourt match was the only match of the season which templeton played away from home all its other matches the house match and even the match against the town were played in the fields in the presence of the whole school but once every other year templeton went forth to war in drags and omnibuses against its hereditary rival and mighty was the excitement with which the expedition and its equipment were regarded by every boy who had the glory of his school at heart seventy boys and seventy only were permitted to form the invading army the selection of whom was a matter of intrigue and emulation for weeks beforehand but for a few broad rules which eliminated at least half the school the task might have been still more difficult than it was for instance all juniors to the eternal wrath and indignation of the den were excluded further all boys who during the term had suffered punishment either monitorial or magisterial all boys who had not shown up at the proper number of practices in the fields all boys who had lost a given number of callovers forfeited the chance of getting their names on the grandcourt list as it was called of the reduced company that remained each member of the eleven had the right of nominating six the remaining four being chosen by the patriarchal method of lot altogether it was admitted that the system of selection was on the whole impartial although as a matter of course it involved bitter disappointments to many an enthusiastic and deserving cricketer our heroes being juniors were of course out of it and they warmly adopted the indignation of the den against the gross tyranny of excluding the rising generation from taking part in the great school event but dick was not a youth whose inmost soul could be satisfied with mere indignation if a thing struck him as unjust the desire to rid himself of the injustice took possession of him at the same time georgie said he to heathcote the day before the match its all rot we must go i tell you how can we we should get bowled out to a certainty before we started but georgie its no end of a day fellows say you get put up like lords at grandcourt and the spread afterwards is something scrumptious yes but what chance should we stand of that when every one will know were mitching oh they wouldnt say anything if once we got there i tell you old man id risk a good bit to do it think of the crow wed have at the next den how should we get over though oh i know some of the fourth they might smuggle us into their trap or we could hang on somehow bless you the fellows will be too festive to notice us what do you say all right im on to try it said heathcote not feeling very sanguine right you are keep it quiet i say and come down to tub early to morrow which being arranged the two dissemblers went down and addressed a monster meeting of the den denouncing everybody and vowing vengeance on the oppressor at tub time next morning dick met his friend with a radiant face its all right said he ive been over to the mews and had a look at the traps and one of thems got a bar underneath we can easily hang on to rather a grind hanging on to a bar for two hours suggested heathcote bless you that wont hurt besides we might get a lift further on in fact one of the coachmen said for five bob hed stow us away in the boot that would be less dusty said heathcote but look here said dick eagerly as he and his friend stood side by side on the springboard ready for a plunge what howling asses we are of course all the fellows will go on the top of the omnibuses so if we cut round to the stables directly after breakfast we can stow ourselves away inside one under the seat and then we shall have it all to ourselves all right said heathcote looking at last as if he saw his way to the venture and the two friends forthwith dived and turned the plan over beneath the waves when punctually at ten oclock the six coaches paraded in the great quadrangle no one noticed the absence of dick and his henchman in the crowd that assembled to watch the departure of the lucky seventy nor when coach one had started with the eleven and coaches two three and four had carried off the rest of the sixth and fifth did any one suspect that coach five had taken up two of its passengers already the upper and middle fourth who boarded this vehicle had little idea as they pitched their coats and wraps inside and mounted themselves to the top that like the birds who buried the babes in the wood beneath the leaves they were hiding the light of day from two innocents who lay one under either seat with their noses to the fresh air and their hearts very decidedly in their mouths chock full up here cried a voice from the top which dick even in his retirement recognised as belonging to duffield the post fag who by virtue of his office was just out of the den you kids will have to go inside oh i say you might let us up replied one of the kids in question in tones of expostulation we wont take up much room its so jolly stuffy inside so it is inwardly ejaculated the two stowaways just the place for you you can play oughtsandcrosses and enjoy yourselves theres not standing room up here cried duffield cant we stand on the step no hookers bagged the bottom step and ive bagged the one half up this side as soon as we start the lurkers gasped they had not reckoned on the steps being occupied and their snug retreat raked by the eyes of the bumptious hooker can we stand on them till youre ready i say once more asked the persevering fourthformers why cant you go inside i say though added the post fag theres room for two on the next coach hop up or youll be out of it to the relief of our heroes the youngsters yapped off on the new scent and they presently had the satisfaction of hearing their voices raised in a halloo of triumph from the box of coach six all right cried a master as the last man squeezed up to his perch then arose great cheers and countercheers not unmixed with yells as the cavalcade drove off in style followed by templeton in full cry as far as the great gate where they parted company amid shouts that brought all the town to its windows once clear of the school our heroes breathed more freely in more senses than one as long as hooker kept guard of the lower step and duffields legs swayed about on the other they were unable to do more than quietly push back the coats and put their heads out but both these amateur conductors were too much occupied in hailing passersby and protecting their caps from the assaults of their own friends above to bestow much attention to the inside of a coatstrewn stuffy vehicle and in time our heroes found they might venture to whisper across the floor and attempt in a quiet way to make themselves more comfortable beastly dusty said heathcote it gets in my mouth wouldnt mind that said dick if i didnt get pinsandneedles in my arms ive a good mind to turn over here they were sent back like rabbits to their holes by the scare of a free fight taking place on the lower step between hooker and a town youth whom he had aggrieved by discharging a broadside of peas on a tender portion of his visage the fight was a sharp one for the burly town youth was a tartar and had more than one grudge to settle with the templeton boys he managed to get a footing on the step and hooking one elbow securely over the door worked his other arm with great effect on the unfortunate hooker the whole fray was so suddenly got up that those on the roof knew nothing about it and duffield was so occupied with kicking at the intruder with his one spare leg that he quite forgot to raise a war cry the town boy proved equal to his two antagonists duffield was early rendered hors de combat by his spare foot being captured and tucked under the arm by which the enemy hung on to the door and hooker himself was gradually getting ousted from his perch and might have been finally dropped on to the road had not an unexpected diversion in his favour rescued him this was made by no one less than dick who having taken in with a quick eye the position of affairs saw that templeton demanded his services cost him what they might he therefore summoned heathcote to back him up and taking an overcoat from the pile cast it adroitly over the head of the town boy just as he had edged hooker on to the very margin of the step this of course settled the business duffield got back his foot and hooker got his arm once more over the door the former raised a cry of cad hanging on the latter shouted whip behind the occupants of coach six yelled chuck him over and putting one thing with another the town boy decided that he would be more comfortable on the pavement than where he was so he dropped off leaving his hat behind him which trophy was immediately seized and passed aloft amid universal triumph and displayed proudly on the top of a bat on coach five until the cavalcade was clear of the town who scragged that fellow asked hooker as soon as the campaign was over looking up and down i dont know said duffield is there any one inside dick who had been gradually trying to edge back to his retreat deemed it prudent to make a clean breast of it at once while the two step men owed him their thanks i say hooker said he putting up his head behind the pile of wraps in a manner that made the gentleman addressed almost fall off with fright dont say anythingi scragged him heathcote and i wanted so awfully to see the match keep it dark i say hooker put his head into the window and whistled youll get in a frightful row said he consolingly never mind ill say nothing cover up and dont let the chaps see you they took his advice as cheerfully as they could and even endured pleasantly the occasional peashooter practice with which by way of enlivening their solitude he was good enough to favour them they had an anxious drive on the whole for besides hookers pea shooter and the dismal prophecies he kept calling in to them of the terrible fate that awaited them on their return to templeton they found the dust and heat very trying all that however was as nothing to the panic produced by a sudden rumour of a shower and the possible descent of the whole of coach five into the interior happily for them jupiter pluvius changed his mind at the last moment and sheered off but the two minutes they spent in expecting him were calculated considerably to curtail the natural life of both it was hard lines too to hear all the festivities going on above and be able to take no part in them they dared not even sit up for fear of becoming visible to the occupants of the boxseat of coach six who had a full view of their interior so they lay low for two mortal hours and by the time grandcourt was reached discovered that their dusty heads and limbs ached not a little youd better come out and cheek it said hooker as the coach pulled up youre bound to get into a row so you may as well enjoy yourselves dicks intention had been to get taken on under the seat to the stables and there make his escape but after all there was not much less risk that way than in following hookers advice so they tumbled out with the crowd and kept near hooker on whose support they felt entitled to rely after the service rendered to him in the battle of the lower step every one was so excited about the match and so anxious to show off well to the grandcourt boys that no one took any notice of the two small interlopers which was a matter of great thankfulness to our heroes their spirits gradually rose as they found themselves sitting comfortably among a knot of templetonians in the glorious grandcourt meadow with a superb view of the match they lost all their reserve and joined wildly in the cheers for the old school heedless of every consideration of prudence and selfpreservation and they certainly had some excuse for their enthusiasm for templeton walked away from her enemy from the very first in a style which amazed even her most ardent admirers in their first innings they put together as smartly and merrily as if they were playing against an eleven of the den one after another the grandcourt bowlers collapsed no sort of ball seemed to find its way past the templeton bats and no sort of fielding seemed to hem in their mighty hits pontifexdear old ponty as everybody called him todaywho had been breaking his friends hearts by his indolence and indifference all the term stood up now and punished the grandcourt bowling till the enemy almost yelled with dismay the steady mansfield was never steadier nor cartwright more dashing nor pledge more artful even birket who to day fleshed his maiden bat on the grandcourt meadow knocked up his two and threes with one cut for four into the tent till it seemed to templeton that cricket was in the air and that even hooker and duffield could have pulled the match off singlehanded but the batting was nothing to the play when templeton was out and took the offensive pledge was more than dangerous he was deadly and knocked the balls about in a manner quite skeery heathcote was perfectly sure he could have made as good a stand as the grandcourt captain and began to lay down the law to his hearers as to how this man should have taken one ball and that man drawn another till he became quite amusing and was recognised for the first time by several of his schoolfellows however the general interest in the match was still too keen to give him the notoriety his indiscretion deserved and lulled by his apparent immunity and the luxury of his present circumstances he like dick quite forgot he had no right to be where he was and even expostulated with duffield for squashing him and interfering with his view grandcourt went out for a miserable of which had been put on by one man of course they had to follow on and as the time was short it was agreed to curtail the usual interval and finish up the match straight away so grandcourt went in again and although it fared somewhat better was still unable to stem the tide of defeat with to get in order to avoid a single innings defeat it was only natural they did not settle down to their task very cheerfully or hopefully pledge still sent down a ruthless fire from one end and seemed even to improve with exercise nor was he badly backed up at the other end by cresswell while mansfield at the wicket and ponty at point seemed as it were to help themselves to the ball off the end of the bat whenever they liked by painful plodding hard work grandcourt put up their hundred and it spoke well for the chivalry of the victorious seventy that they cheered the three figures as loudly as any one it was uphill work trying to hold out for the remaining runs but the losers were englishmen and long odds brought out their good qualities with solemn almost ferocious faces the two last men in clung to their bats and blocked blocked blocked stealing now a bye pilfering now a run out of the slips and once or twice getting on the right side of a lob with a swipe that drew the hearts of templeton into their mouths a score of runs did those two add on to their hundred and the seventy groaned as the chances of a single innings victory dwindled run by run most frightful soak if they do us said dick addressing the audience generally why dont they try mansfield shut up lie down under the seat and dont talk to me said hooker flushed with excitement pledge has bowled four maidens running said heathcote determined that no one should blame the bowler he had assisted to train whats the use of bowling maidens why dont he bowl the boys and have done with it said duffield dick looked at heathcote heathcote looked at dick duffield hummed a ditty how could he do such a thing at such a time and in such a place oh had he been only in the mountjoy waggonette on a lonely road what a business meeting they could have held as it was there was only time to crush the debtors hat down over his eyes and dig him on each side in the ribs when a general stir betokened some important movement on the field of battle by george theyre going to change bowlers said hooker quite time too no theyre not replied dick theyre going to change ends awful low trick to put cresswell with the light in his eyes pledge has had it in his all the last hour said heathcote shut up you kids and dont make such a row you can talk when were in at supper said a fifthform fellow the allusion was a depressing one more than once it had crossed our heroes minds that supper was coming on but the chances of their cheeking in as they called it to that part of the days entertainment were to say the least narrow at any rate the allusion made them sad and they relapsed into silence as the bowlers changed ends and pledge prepared to attack from his new base there was a sudden uncomfortable silence all round the meadow grandcourt felt that if they could weather the storm a few overs longer they might yet avert the disgrace of a single innings defeat templeton felt with decided qualms that unless the change told quickly it had better not have been made at all the eleven stepped in a bit and watched the ball with anxious faces ponty alone with one hand in his pocket yawned and looked somewhere else whats the odds to ponty thought the seventy marvelling how any one could look so unconcerned at such a crisis pledge bowled one of his finest awkwardest most disconcerting slows the cautious batsman was proof against its syrenlike allurements and stepped back to block what any one else would have stepped forward to slog the ball broke up sharp against his bat and grandcourt began to breathe again as they saw its progress arrested but at that particular moment it appeared to enter dear old pontys head to take his hand out of his pocket and stroll forward a pace or two from his place at point in the direction of the wicket and somehow or another it seemed to him that while he was there he might as well pick up the ball as it dropped off the end of the bat on its way to the ground which he did and as every one looked on and wondered what little game he was up to it occurred to the umpire that it was a catch and that the match was at an end whereupon the truth flashed round the field like an electric shock and the crowds broke into the meadow in wild excitement while the seventy crimson with cheers formed column and went for their men poor ponty had a hard time of it getting back to the tent and half repented of his feat but it did him and templeton good when they came upon the headquarters of grandcourt to hear the hearty cheers with which the vanquished hailed their victors chivalry is infectious for the next quarter of an hour the meadow was given up to cheers by templeton for grandcourt and cheers by grandcourt for templeton in which the gallant seventytwo despite their numerical inferiority held their own with admirable pluck then a mighty bell tolled out across the meads and conqueror and conquered united in the brotherhood of appetite and good fellowship turned in to supper carrying their cheers with them now was the hour of our heroes perplexity for be it said to their credit as gentlemen that however easily they may have got over their scruples as to breaking templeton rules riding in templeton coaches and enjoying themselves in the grandcourt meadows they had some hesitation about making free with the grandcourt supper without a rather more precise invitation than they were already possessed of so they lagged a little behind the seventy put their templeton badges conspicuously forward and tried to look as if supper had never entered into their calculations arent you two fellows coming to supper said a grandcourt senior overtaking them as they dawdled along thanks awfully said they perhaps there wont be room rather said the hospitable enemy you two wont crowd us out well sit close you know said dick better not sit too close to begin with said the grandcourt boy laughing or itll be real jam before suppers over cut on and join your fellows and squeeze into the first seat you can find the first seat our heroes found was one between ponty and the grandcourt head master which on consideration they decided not to be appropriate they therefore made hard for the other end of the room and wedged themselves in among a lot of jolly grandcourt juniors who hailed them with vociferous cheers and commenced to load them with a liberal share of all the good things the hospitable table groaned under happy for dick and heathcote had they taken advice and begun the orgy at half distance but they survived the jam and what with chicken pie and beef and ham and gooseberry pie and shandygaff to say nothing of jokes and laughter and vows of eternal friendship with every grandcourt fellow within hail they never to quote the experience of the little foxes in the nursery rhyme they never eat a better meal in all their life they could have gone on all night but alas envious time that turns day to night and hangs its pall between our eyes and the light of our eyes put an end to the banquet the coaches clattered up to the grandcourt gate the seventy with their wraps and coats were escorted by their hosts in a body to the chariots horns sounded cheers answered cheers caps waved whips cracked and in five minutes the grandcourt gate was as silent as if it guarded not a fortress of hearty schoolboys but a deserted timeruined monastery chapter twelve in which nemesis has a busy time of it our heroes had all along had a presentiment that their troubles would begin some time or other they had expected it at the very start but it had been put off stage by stage throughout the day until it really seemed as if it must make haste if it was to come at all and yet everything had gone so smoothly so far the day had been so successful the match so glorious the supper so gorgeous that they could hardly bring themselves to think nemesis would really pounce upon them that worthy lady however though she often takes long credit always pays her debts in the long run and our heroes found her waiting for them before grandcourt was many miles behind them they had been baulked in their intention of getting back into the friendly shelter of coach five at the outset by the very awkward fact that mansfield would stand at the door of grandcourt talking to a friend until coach five had received its passengers and started coach six followed and to the horror of our two skulkers the way was still blocked things were getting desperate the top of number six was packed and still mansfield stood across the door should they throw themselves on his mercy or hurl themselves between his feet and overturn him if haply they might escape in the confusion how they hated that grandcourt fellow who talked to him what business had he to keep a templeton fellow there catching cold why hadnt all grandcourt been ordered to bed directly after supper horrors coach six shouted all right and rattled off were done for said heathcote we may as well show up stay where you are said dick we shall have to hang on behind the coach the eleven go in but dick theyre all monitors cant be helped said dick peremptorily the elevens coach drove up and all grandcourt turned out with a final cheer for their conquerors mansfield shook hands with his friend and climbed up on to the box the rest followed ponty rambled out among the last he looked up at the crowded roof and didnt like it it was far too much grind for the dear fellow to swarm up there ill go inside cresswell come on well get a seat each and make ourselves comfortable cresswell laughed if you hadnt made that catch old man said he id say you were the laziest beggar i ever saw but as youve a right to give your orders ill obey lead on mighty captain our heroes shivered and wondered if any sin in the calendar were equal to that of sloth with all the eleven on the top they had had a chance yet of weathering mrs nemesis and hanging on behind but with the captain and whipperin inside they might as well try and hang on a lions tail all u p old man groaned heathcote slip out sharp said dick excitedly our only chance is to get ahead of them and pick them up on the road scarcely any one noticed the two dismayed little templetonians as they squeezed out of the gate with their caps drawn over their eyes and their heads diligently turned away from the coach of the eleven one fellow however spotted them and scared the wits out of them by saying hallo here are two youngsters left behind get inside this coach theres lots of room look alive theyre starting oh thanks said dick scarcely able to speak for the jumping of his heart were going to do a trot the first mile or so thanks awfully goodbye and to the amazement of the grandcourtier the small pair started to run with their heads down and their fists up at the rate of seven miles an hour by george thought he to himself some of those templeton kids go the pace the pleasant village of grandcourt was startled that evening as the shades of night fell by the sight of two small boys trotting hard down the high street side by side some three hundred yards in advance of the coach which carried the conquering heroes of templeton like eastern couriers who run before the chaise of the great man but those two heeded neither looks nor jeers their ears were deaf to the cry of stop thief and shouts of two to one on sandy stirred no emotions in their fluttering breasts luckily for them the road began uphill so they were able to get a fair start by the time the village was clear when at last they pulled up breathless at the roadside they could see the lamp of the coach a quarter of a mile down the road advancing slowly its touch and go said heathcote if we do it without getting nabbed that wretched light shows up everything yes i dont like it said dick wed better lie down in the ditch georgie till its got past theyll trot as soon as they get up here on to the level and we must make a shot at the step those fellows inside are sure not to be looking out it was an anxious few minutes as the light approached and shot its rays over the prostrate bodies of the boys in the ditch they dared not lift their faces as it passed and it was only when as dick had predicted the walk changed into a trot that they started from their lurking place and gave chase why groaned heathcote as they came up its got no step for once dick was gravelled the idea that the coach was not like all the other coaches had never once crossed his mind and he felt beaten the two unhappy pursuers however kept up the chase pawing the forbidding coach door very much as kittens paw the outside of a gold fish bowl alas there was nothing to lay hold of not even a handle or a nail shall we yell gasped heathcote nearly at the end of his wind wait a bit is there anything underneath we could lay hold of they groped but as it seemed fruitlessly dick however stooped again and next moment turned round radiant theres a bit of string said he keep it up old man and well get hold of it with much diving he succeeded in picking up the end of a casual piece of string that had somehow got its other end fastened to a nut underneath the coach as quick as thought he whipped out his handkerchief and looped it on to the string then heathcote whipped out his handkerchief and looped it on to dicks and between them the two held on grimly and tried to fancy their troubles were at an end the support of a piece of stray string at the tail of a coach supplemented by two pockethandkerchiefs may be grateful but for practical purposes it is at best a flimsy stay and had it not been for occasional hills at which to breathe our heroes might have found it out at once as it was they were carried three or four miles on their way by the purely moral support of their holdfast until the last of the hills was climbed and the long steady slope which led down to templeton opened before the travellers and reminded the horses of corn and stable then a trot began which put the actual support of the extemporised cable to the test our heroes worn out already could not try all they would keep it slack every step it became tauter and tauter until at last you might have played a tune upon it they made one gallant effort to relieve the strain but alas it was no good there was a crack of the whip ahead the horses full of their coming supper gave a bound forward and that moment on the lonely road five miles from home sprawled heathcote with dick in his lap and two knotted pockethandkerchiefs in the dust at their feet they had no breath left to shout no energy to overtake so they sat there panting watching the coach vanish into the night and humbly wonderingwhat next heres a soak said heathcote at last recovering speech and slowly untying his handkerchief from the cable in order to mop his face yes said dick getting off his friends lap and looking dismally down the road our ride home didnt come off after all we came off though said heathcote but he corrected himself as he saw dick wearily round upon him i meani say what must we do stump it said dick its about five miles heathcote whistled pity we didnt cheek it into our own coach said he i say dick what a row therell be of course there will said dick have you only just found that out come along well be late considering it was eight oclock and they were yet five miles from home this last observation was sagacious they strolled on for half an hour in silence mending their pace as they recovered their wind until at the end of that time they had settled down into a steady threeandahalf miles an hour and felt rather more like getting home than they had done another hour will do it said dick i say we might smuggle in after all georgie what a crow if we do eh georgie inwardly reflected that there would be a crow of some sort or other whatever happened but he prudently reserved his opinion and said rather we ought to come to the crossroads before long said dick i hope to goodness you know which one goes to templeton no i dont but theres bound to be a post there was a post but though they climbed up it and rubbed their eye lashes along each arm they could get no guiding out of it they could see an l on one arm and an n on another and a full stop on each of the other two but even with this intelligence they felt that the road to templeton was still open to doubt as indeed after their wanderings round and round the signpost they presently had to admit was the case with the road by which they had just come wed better make ourselves snug here for the night said heathcote who fully took in the situation that would be coming to a full stop with a vengeance said dick shut up i let you offand by jove heres somebody coming the red embers of a pipe followed by a hulking nautical form hove slowly in sight as he spoke and never did a sail cheer the eyes of shipwrecked mariners as did this apparition bring comfort to dick and heathcote i say said the former advancing out of the shades and almost startling the unsuspecting salt weve lost our way which road goes to templeton the big sailor gave a grunt and lay to in an unsteady way which convinced our heroes unlearned as they were in such matters that he wasnt quite sober what dyer want ter go ter templeton fur demanded he we belong to the school and weve got left behind the sailor laughed an unsympathetic laugh and took his pipe out of his mouth yer belong to the school do yer and yerve lost yer way yes can you put us right yes i can put yer right said the brawny young salt putting his pipe back between his lips whatll yer stand well give you a shilling said dick yer will yerll give me a sovereign apiece or ill bash yer and he laid a hand on the arm of each of his victims chuckling and smoking as he looked down on their puny efforts to escape turn out yer pockets nobs said he giving them a slight admonitory shake i havent got a sovereign said heathcote dick did not even condescend to plead he fell headlong on his huge opponent shouting in the midst of his blows let us go do you hear i know your name youre tom white the boatman and ill get you locked up if you dont but even this valiant threat and the still more valiant struggles of the two boys availed nothing with the nautical highwayman who smoked and shook the bones of his wretched captives till they were fain to call for mercy the mercy was dearly bought dicks halfsovereign heathcotes twelve shillings the penknife with the gouge among them did not make up the price one by one their pockets were turned inside out and whatever there took the fancy of the noble mariner went into the ransom pencils indiarubber keys and even a photograph of dicks mother were impounded while resistance or even expostulation only added bone shaking into the bargain till at last the unhappy lambs were glad to assist at their own fleecing in order to expedite their release there yer are said tom when at last the operation was over thats about all i want of yer my hearties and if yer want the road to templeton thats she and goodnight to yer and thank yer kindly next time yer want a sail dont forget to give an honest jack tar a turn knows my name do yer blessed if i ever see you afore youre a beastly low tipsy thief shouted dick from a respectful distance and well get you paid out for this and not waiting for a reply the two unfortunates less heavily weighted than ever started down the road snorting with rage and indignation and full of thoughts of the direst revenge nemesis was coming down on them at last with a vengeance two miles they went before speech came to the relief of their wounded feelings its transportation said heathcote catoninetails too said dick jolly good job said heathcote and they went on another mile then it occurred to them this was not the road along which they had driven in the morning and once more the villainy of tom white broke upon them in all its blackness hes sent us upon the wrong road said heathcote beginning at last to feel that nemesis was a little overdoing it dick gulped down something and walked on in silence where are you going whats the use of going on may as well said dick striding on its bound to lead somewhere in which comfortable conviction they accomplished another halfmile then to their satisfaction and somewhat to dicks selfsatisfaction they heard a low noise ahead which they knew must be the sea i thought it would bring us out said dick when once we get at the sea we cant help finding templeton unless we take a wrong turn to start with and then we shall have to walk all round england before we turn up shut up georgie weve had foolery enough for one night heathcote collapsed and another mile brought the two wanderers to the sea luckily for them the rising moon came to their rescue in deciding whereabouts they were not far out said dick theres the sprit rock two miles more will do it i shant be sorry when im in bed said heathcote i shant be sorry when i see tom white hung i say we may as well have a dip before we go on so they solaced themselves with a plunge in the moonlit sea which after their dusty labours was wonderfully refreshing having dressed again all but their shoes and stockings which they looped together and hung over their shoulders they tucked up their trousers and started to wade along the strand to their journeys end the tide had only just started to come in so they had the benefit of the hard sand which combined with the soft refreshing water and the bright moonlight rendered their pilgrimage as pleasant as under the circumstances they could have desired their talk was of thomas white for whom it was well he was not within earshot they arrested him tried him sentenced him flogged him transported him and yet were not satisfied you know georgie said dick working himself into a fury he collared my mothers photograph the low cad id be a beast if i didnt pay him out rather and ill back you up old man i was going to get a tennisbat with that twelve bob the blackguard about a mile from home the lights of templeton hove in sight but still our heroes talk was of tom white and the next assizes they had the beach to themselves with only a few stranded boats for company over whose anchors they had to pick their way gingerly the tides coming in at a lick said dick half an hour later we should have had to tramp on the soft sand lookout you duffer the last remark was caused by heathcote tripping over a rope and coming down all fours on the wet sand bother that rope said he i never saw it i say its rather a small one for that big boat isnt it it is said dick walking round to the stern of the boat in question its hallo i say georgie look here georgie looked in the direction of dicks finger and read the words martha thomas white templeton on the stern of the boat both boys whistled then dick marched resolutely up to the bows over a thwart in which the anchor rope was hitched in a loop tom white must have been drunk when he anchored this boat said dick shell never hold if the wind gets up good job too said heathcote so i think said dick thoughtfully i say georgie added he with his fingers playing on the end of the loop tom whites a frightful cad isnt he rather and a thief too i should think so it would serve him jolly well right if he lost his boat he dont deserve to have a boat at all this knot said dick slipping the loop wouldnt hold against a single lurch why it comes undone in a fellows hand and the end dropped idly on the floor of the boat as he spoke heathcote nodded think of the cad having robbed two juniors like us and collared mothers photograph too the brute said dick taking his friends arm and walking on they talked no longer of thomas white but admired the moonlight and wondered how soon the tide would be up and speculated as to whether there wasnt a breeze getting up off the land once they turned back and glanced at the black hull lying still aground with the tide yards away yet then they thought a trot would warm them up before they put on their boots and mounted the cliff to templeton the clock struck halfpast eleven as they knocked modestly at the porters lodge the porter was up and evidently expected them nice goingson young gentlemen said he the doctor wishes to see you after chapel in the morning in you go im sorry for you with fluttering hearts they stole across the moonlit quadrangle and gazed round at the grim windows that peered down on them from every side the housekeeper was up and ready for them too bad boys said she as she opened the door go to bed quietly and make no noise the doctor will be ready for you the moment chapel is over they mounted the creaking stairs and crawled guiltily along the passage to their dormitory the dormitory monitor was sitting up in bed ready for them too oh you have turned up have you said he i hope youll enjoy yourselves with winter in the morning most of the fellows say its expulsion but i rather fancy a licking myself cut into bed and dont make a noise and he curled himself up in his bedclothes and slept the sleep of the just which was more than could be said for the fitful slumbers of our heroes which visions of tom whites boat and pontys pocket and the piece of string at the tail of the elevens coach combined to make the reverse of sound in the middle of the night dick as he lay awake felt heathcotes hand nudging him i say dick said the latter the winds got up do you hear it shut up georgie im just asleep nemesis handed in her last cheque to our heroes after chapel next morning in the doctors study i will spare the reader the harrowing details of that serious interview suffice it to say that the dormitory fag was right and that mrs partlett was spared the trouble of packing up the two young gentlemens wardrobes but they emerged from the study wiser and sadder men they knew more about the properties of a certain flexible wood than they had ever dreamed of before they also felt themselves marked men in high quarters with a blot on their new boys scutcheon which it would take a heap of virtue to efface by george said dick that afternoon we got it hottoo hot georgie i think winter might have let us down rather easier myself said georgie there was a pause was it windy last night asked dick rather said georgie anything new down town couldnt hear anything hum i wonder what that beasts done with mothers photograph i say georgie what a howling brute he was he was he deserves anything strange if so that neither of our young heroes went to the police station and informed against their man on the contrary they went up on to the cliffs after school and scanned the bay from headland to headland doubtless lost in the wonders of the deep and wishing very much they could tell what the wild waves were saying as to the whereabouts of the martha chapter thirteen twixt scylla and charybdis perhaps no epoch of a schoolboys life is more criticalespecially if he be of the openhearted nature of dick and heathcotethan that which immediately follows his first punishment at the hands of the law on the one hand he has the sense of disgrace which attends personal chastisement as well as the discomfort of a forfeited good name and the feeling of being down on the black books of the school authorities generally on the other hand he is sure to meet with a certain number of companions who if they do not exactly admire what he has done sympathise with him in what he has suffered and sympathy at such a time is sweet and seducing a little too much sympathy will make him feel a martyr and a little martyrdom will make him feel a hero and once a hero on account of his misdeeds he needs a stout heart and a steady head to keep himself from going one step further and becoming a professional evildoer and ending a fool and his own worst enemy dick and heathcote ran a serious risk of being shunted on to the road to ruin after the escapade of the grandcourt match the former discovered that his popularity with the den was by no means impaired by adversity in fact he jumped at one bound to the hero stage of his ordeal he was but a boy of flesh and blood and sympathy is a sweet salve for smarting flesh and blood after the first burst of contrition it pleased him to hear fellows say hard lines on you old man not another in a hundred would have cheeked it the way you did it pleased him too to see boys smaller than himself look round as they passed him and whisper something which made their companions turn round too dick grew fond of small boys as the term went on it pleased him still more to be taken notice of by a few bigger boys to find himself claimed by hooker and duffield as a crony to be bantered by the aesthetic wrangham and patronised by the stout bull all this made him go over the adventures of that memorable day often in his mind and think that after all it wasnt a bad days sport and that though he said so who shouldnt he had managed things fairly well and got his moneys worth his moneys worth however reminded him of his lost halfsovereign and his mothers photograph and these reflections usually pulled him up short in his reminiscences heathcote in a more philosophical and dismal way had his perils and pledge gave him no help through his difficulty on the contrary he encouraged his growing discontent dismals again said he one evening that cane of winters must be a stiff one if it cuts you up like that winter always does lay it on thick to the kids though said wrangham who happened to be present his lickings are in inverse ratio to the size of the licked it did comfort heathcote to hear his case discussed in such learned and mathematical terms but that was all the consolation he got dick was in far too exalted a frame of mind to give much assistance what does it matter said he recklessly i dont mean to fret myself and so the matter ended for the present the two friends were bearing their ordeal in two such different ways that they might almost have parted company had there not been another common interest of still greater importance to bind them together one day heathcote came up from the tub at a canter and caught his friend at the chapel door dick he said its all out this bill was sticking on one of the posts by the pier it was wet so i took it off dick readl reward lost or stolen from her moorings on templeton strand on the th inst a luggerrigged sailing boat named the martha any one giving information leading to the recovery of the boator if stolen to the conviction of the thiefwill receive the above reward police station templeton dick handed the ominous paper back with a long face here take it whatever did you pull it off the post for i thought youd like to see it said heathcote putting the despised document into his pocket so i did thanks georgie we didnt steal the boat did we rather not not like what he did to our money no that was downright robbery with violence added heathcote of course it was really tom whites fault the boat got adrift it was so carelessly anchored yes a puff of wind would have slipped that knot there was a pause its plain he doesnt guess anything said dick not likely and hes not likely to say anything about it if he does of course not it would mean transportation for him after all some one may have gone off with the boat we cant tell it was there all right when we saw it wasnt it dick looked at his friend he could delude himself up to a certain point but this plea wouldnt quite wash most likely theyll find it it may have drifted round to birkens or some place like that itll be all right georgie but the thoughts of that unlucky boat haunted their peace that tom white had only got his deserts they never questioned but they would have been more comfortable if that loop had slipped itself days went on and still no tidings reached them the bills faced them wherever they went and once as they passed the boathouse with a crowd of other fellows they received a shock by seeing tom white himself sitting and smoking on a bench and looking contemplatingly out to sea theres tom white said one of the group i say shouted he have you found your boat tom tom looked up and scanned the group our heroes hearts were in their boots as his eyes met theirs but to their relief he did not know them a halftipsy man on a dark night is not a good hand at remembering faces found her no i arent young gentleman said he hard lines hope youll get her back said the boy i say do you think any one stole her may be may be not replied the boatman jolly rum thing about that boat said the spokesman of the party as the boys continued their walk i expect it got adrift somehow said another i dont know said the first i was speaking to a bobby about her he says they think she was stolen and fancy theyve got a clue to the fellow heathcote stumbled for no apparent reason at this particular moment and it was quite amusing to see the concern on dicks face as he went to the rescue jolly low trick continued the boy who appeared to interest himself so deeply in toms loss if any one really took the boat away tom will be ruined who do they think went off with her asked another they dont say but theyre rather good at running things down are our police do you recollect the way they bowled out the fellow who tried to burn the boathouse last year and got him six months this police gossip was so alarming to our two heroes that they gave up taking walks along the beach and retired to the privacy of the school boundaries where there was no lack of occupation indoor and out to relieve the monotony of life a week after the grandcourt match a boy called braider came up to dick and asked to speak to him braider was in the fourth and dick knew of him as a racketty roystering sort of fellow very popular with his own setand thought something of by the den on account of some recent offences against monitorial authority i say said he to dick confidentially what do you say to belonging to our club what club asked dick scenting some new distinction and getting lightheaded in consequence youll promise not to go telling everybody said braider were called the sociables its a jolly enough lot only twenty of us and we have suppers and concerts once a week the thing is its awfully select and a job to get into it but your name was mentioned the other day and i fancy youd get in i suppose georgie heathcote isnt in it said dick rather not said the other mistaking his meaning hed have no chance hes not a bad fellow said dick i wouldnt mind if he was on well there are two vacancies what do you say for one do i know the other fellows most of them and braider repeated a string of names among which were those of a few wellknown heroes of the fifth and fourth theyre all jolly fellows said braider and back up one another like one oclock it was your plucky show up at grandcourt that made them think of having you and if you join youll just be in time for the next concert what do you say dick didnt like to say no and not being a youth who dallied much between the positive and the negative he said all serene braider if they really want it of course they do old man said braider in tones of satisfaction theyll be jolly glad mind you dont go talking about it to any one you know theyre very select and dont want all templeton wanting to join whens the election asked dick oh today week theres one fellow culver up against you but hes got no chance one black ball in six excludes so its always a close run do you think there would be any chance for young heathcote doubt it but we might try when youre in ta ta old man mums the word dick spent a troubled week he was uncomfortable with heathcote in whom he was bursting to confide he was uneasy too in meeting the few members of the sociables whom he knew and felt that they were watching him critically with a view to the election next thursday and he was vindictive in the presence of culver whose possible rivalry he regarded as little short of an insult indeed the effect of the suspense on him was bad all round for having somehow picked up the notion from braiders hints that spirit was a leading qualification for aspiring members of the club he was very nearly increasing that qualification notoriously before the week was out by another row with headquarters he purposely shirked his work and behaved disorderly in class in order to show his patrons what he was made of and what was worse he egged the unsuspecting georgie on to similar excesses by his example georgie as far as spirit went stood better qualified for membership of the club at the weeks end than did the real candidate for while the latter escaped punishment the former was dropped upon to the tune of three hundred lines of virgil for throwing a book across the room during class just my luck said he defiantly to his leader afterwards everybodys down on me im bound to catch it so i may as well have my fling you did have your fling georgie and you caught it too georgie was too out of humour to notice the jest you dont catch me caring twopence about it though said he but his tones belied the valiant words and dick looked curiously at his troubled harried face why georgie said he youre down on your luck old man blow my luck said georgie perhaps i am down on it it serves me worse than yours dick didnt say anything more just then perhaps because he had nothing to say but he didnt like this new state of things in his friend georgie was being spoiled and would have to be looked after dick was not the only templetonian who had made this brilliant discovery ponty had dropped a casual eye on him now and then so had mansfield and neither the captain that was nor the captain that was to be liked the look of things hes going the way of allall the pledgelings said ponty cant you stop it mansfield if i were captain of templeton id try old man replied the other really mansfield you frighten me when you look so solemn what can i do do take him away from where he is to begin with on what grounds pledge hasnt done anything you or i could take hold of and if the kid is going to the dogs we cant connect it with pledge any more than we can with winter himself and ponty yawned and wished mansfield would not look as if somebody wanted hanging its curious at any rate said mansfield that pledges fag should begin to go to the dogs while his chum who fags for cresswell and is quite as racketty should keep all right do you call young richardson all right asked ponty i should say he and his friend are in the same boat and hes holding the tiller which was pretty cute for a lazy one like ponty well said mansfield who with all his earnestness felt really baffled over the problem things mustnt go on as they are surely certainly not dear boy if we can make them better but i dont see whats to be done id bless you if you could put things right and he put his feet upon the chair in front and took up his novel mansfield took the hint nor did he misunderstand his indolent friend pontys indolence wasnt all laziness it was sometimes a cloak for perplexity and the captaintobe as he said goodnight guessed shrewdly that not many pages of the novel would be skimmed that evening ponty did in fact wake up a bit those last few weeks of the term he rambled down once or twice to the juniors tennis court and terrified the small fry there by sprawling at full length on the grass within sight of the play it was a crowded corner of the fields and a noisy one and if the captain went there for a nap he had queer notions of a snug berth if however he went there to see life he knew what he was about he saw aspinall there toughening every day and working up his screwy service patiently and doggedly till one or two of the knowing ones found it worth their while to get on the other side of the net and play against him culver was there big of bone bragging blustering as ever but keeping the colour in his cheeks with healthy sport gosse was there forgetting to make himself a nuisance for one hour in twenty four the globular cazenove was there melting with the heat but proclaiming that even a big body and short legs can do some good by help of a true eye and a patient spirit these and twenty others were there getting good every one of them and atoning every time they scored a point and hit out a rally for something less healthy or less profitable scored elsewhere and ponty as he lay there blinking in the sun moralised on the matter and came to the conclusion that there is hope for a boy as long as he loves to don his flannels and roll up his shirt sleeves and stand up with his head in the air to face his rival like a man even a culver may look a gentleman as he rushes down to his corner and saves his match with a lefthander and aspinall himself may appear formidable when as he stands up to serve his foeman pulls his cap down and retreats with lengthened face across the serviceline but where were dick and heathcote for a whole week ponty took his siesta in the juniors corner blinking now at the cricket now at the tennis strolling sometimes into the gymnasium and sometimes to the fives courts but nowhere did basil the son of richard meet his eyes and nowhere was heathcote the pledgeling one day he did find the latter wandering like a ghost in the quadrangle and saw him bolt like a rat to his hole at sight of a monitor and once he saw dick striding at the head of a phalanx of juniors with his coat off and his face very much on one side and the marks of battle on his eye and lip ponty sheered off before the triumphal army reached him and shrugged his shoulders that afternoon he encountered our heroes arminarm in the quadrangle and hailed them they obeyed his summons uneasily go and put on your flannels both of you said the captain and come back here ill wait for you in trepidation they obeyed and went while ponty looked about for a cozy seat on which to stretch himself in five minutes they returned and presented themselves ponty eyed them both calmly and then roused himself and began to walk to the fields tennis was in full swing in the junior corner where all sorts of play good bad and indifferent was going on at the nets ponty followed by the two bewildered champions strolled about till he came upon an indifferent set being played by gosse and cazenove against raggles and another boy called wade stop the game for a bit you youngsters said the captain which two of you are the best i think i and raggles are said gosse with his usual modesty oh then you can sit out give your rackets to these two theyre going to play against cazenove and wade dicks heart sank within him as he took gosses racket and glanced up at the captains face im rather out of practice faltered he come are you ready ill umpire said the captain it was a melancholy exhibition that scratch match all the more melancholy that the other courts gradually emptied and a ring of juniors formed who stared silently now at the players then round at pontifex and wondered what on earth he found to interest him in a miserable show like this for our heroes mulled everything two faults were not enough for them the holes in their rackets were legion and their legs never went the way they wanted the den blushed as it looked on and heard ponty call game after game loveforty of course the two wretched boys were scaredponty knew that well enoughbut so were cazenove and wade and yet cazenove and wade managed to keep their wind and get over their net and no one could say they had less to be scared at than their opponents at length the doleful spectacle was over onesix was the score in games you must be proud of your one game said ponty strolling off our heroes watched him go and felt they were hard hit it was no use pretending not to understand the captains meaning or not to notice the still lingering blushes of the spectators on their account so they withdrew sadly from the field of battle chastened in spirit yet not without a dawning ambition to make ponty change his mind concerning them before the term was quite run out chapter fourteen how dick has one latin exercise more than he bargained for dick did not often feel ashamed of himself he had a knack of keeping his head above water even in reverses which usually stood him in good stead but after that mournful scratch match with cazenove and wade he certainly did feel ashamed and be it said to the credit of his honesty that he blamed the right offender ponty had been rough on him but it wasnt pontys fault cazenove and wade had knocked him and his chum into a cocked hat but it wasnt cazenoves or wades fault heathcote had mulled his game dreadfully and done nothing to save the match but it wasnt heathcotes fault basil the son of richard was the guilty man and basil the son of richard kicked himself and called himself a fool not publicly though in the den despite the blushes his tennis had caused he did his best to keep up his swagger and restore confidence by a few acts of special audacity and the den was forgiving on the whole they did feel sore for a day and showed it but gradually they came back to their allegiance and made excuses for their hero of their own accord if truth must be told dick was far more concerned as to the possible effect of his public humiliation on his election at the sociables which was now only a day off braider told him with rather a long face that his chances had been rather shaken by the affair and that there was again some talk of pushing culver against him this alarming news drove all immediate projects of virtue out of dicks head not that membership of the club was his one ideal of bliss but being a candidate he could not bear the idea of being defeated particularly by a young ruffian like culver so he indulged in all sorts of extravagances on the last day of his probation and led heathcote on to the very verge of a further punishment in order to recover some of the ground he had lost with the select twenty after school he could settle to nothing till he knew his fate he dragged the unsuspecting heathcote up and down the great quadrangle under pretext of discussing tom whites boat but really in order to keep his eye on the door behind which the select sociables sat in congress heathcote saw there was a secret somewhere and feeling himself out of it departed somewhat moodily to pledges study dick however continued his walk heedless if every friend on earth deserted him so long as culver should not be preferred before him behind that door he was getting tired of this solitary promenade and beginning to wonder whether the select sociables had fallen asleep in the act of voting for him when a ball pitched suddenly on to the pavement between his feet he couldnt tell where it came fromprobably from some window above for no one just then was about in the quadrangle he stooped down to pick it up and pitch it back into the first open window when greatly to his surprise he saw his name written across it and discovered that the ball was not a tennis ball at all but a round paper box which came in two as he held it dick was not superstitious he had scoffed at the templeton ghost when he first heard of it and made up his mind long since it was a bogey kept for the benefit of new boys but it certainly gave him a start to find himself at this late period of the term when he had almost forgotten he ever was a new boy pitched upon as the recipient of one of these mysterious missives the letter inside was written in printed characters like those addressed to heathcote dick it began hallo thought dick to himself rather cheek of a ghost to call a fellow by his christian name isnt it dickdont be a fool you were a fine fellow when you came what are you now dont let fellows lead you astray you can be a fine fellow without being a bad one let the sociables alone theyll teach you to be a cad if you dont care for yourself think of heathcote who only needs your encouragement to make a worse failure than he has made already save him from pledge then youll be a fine fellow with a vengeance your real friend junius pstranslate dominat qui in se dominatur the first thing that struck dick about this extraordinary epistle was that it was odd the ghost should write his letters on templeton exercise paper it then occurred to him that it was rather rough to put him through his paces in latin idioms at a time like this couldnt the ghost get a dictionary or ask a senior and find out for himself it then occurred to him who on earth was it who had written to him like this some one who knew him that was certain and he almost fancied it must be some one who liked him for a fellow wouldnt take the trouble to tell him he was a fine fellow at the beginning of the term and all that sort of thing unless he had a fancy for him what did he mean by what are you now it sounded as if he meant you are not a fine fellow now rather a personal remark whats it got to do with him what i am now reflected dick digging his hands into his pockets and resuming his promenade and what does he mean by fellows leading me astray like to catch any one trying it on thats all like to catch him for the matter of that for his howling cheek dick sat down on one of the stone benches and pulled out the letter for another perusal let the sociables alone oh ah most likely hes been blackballed himself and dont like any one to humph wonder if they are a shady lot or not what does he mean by saying theyll teach me to be a cad wholl teach me to be a cad not a muff like braider at that moment a door opened at the end of the corridor and a voice shouted richardson it was braiders voice and dick knew it he crumpled the letter up in his hand and the colour came and went from his cheeks richardson where are you called braider again for it was dusk and our heros seat was screened from view dick coloured again and bit his lips and finally got up from the bench and strolled off in an opposite direction richardson do you hear once more shouted the invisible braider dick walked on in the dusk wondering to himself whether braider would get into a row for kicking up that uproar in the quad at last after one final shout he heard the door slam then he quickened his pace and made for cresswells study on the staircase he met aspinall i heard some one calling you out in the quad said the small boy did you replied dick i wonder who it can have been is cresswell in his study no all serene come back with me have you done your swot yes i did my lessons an hour ago oh said dick and strode on followed somewhat dubiously by his young protege shut the door said dick sternly as they entered the study whatever is going to happen to me ejaculated the small boy inwardly as he obeyed dick had never spoken to him like this before had he offended him unwittingly had he been disloyal to his sovereignty dick walked to the fireplace and pulling a letter from his pocket read it through twice apparently heedless of his subjects presence then he looked up suddenly and crushing the paper viciously back into his pocket stared hard at his perturbed companion young aspinall said he sharply do you say im a fool oh no replied the boy staggered by the very suggestion i should never think of saying such a thing should you say i was a blackguard no indeed dick no one could say that the heros face brightened there was a warmth in aspinalls voice which touched the most sensitive side of his nature dick would have liked the ghost to be near to hear it should you say ive let myself be led astray and made a mess of it here at templeton no dick i dont think so said the boy what do you mean dont think have i or have i not demanded dick it was a delicate position for the timorous small boy he had had his misgivings about dick and seen a change in him not as he thought for the better but the idea of telling him so to his face was as much as his peace was worth yet he must either tell the truth or a lie and when it came to that aspinall could not help himself you are the best friend ive got said he nervously and id give anything to be as brave as you but well wire in said dick tearing to bits one of cresswells quill pens with his teeth but what youre so goodnatured said aspinall fellows make you do things you wouldnt do of your own accord who makes me do things demanded dick sternly i dont know pleaded the boy feeling that this sort of tightrope dancing was not in his line perhaps some of your friends in the fourth and fifth but i may be all wrong what do they make me do said dick they make you said aspinall feeling that it was no use trying to keep his balance any longer and that he might as well throw down his pole and tumble into the net they make you break rules and get into rows dick because you see it goes down with them and they cheer you for it you wouldnt do that of your own accord how do you know that i dont think you would said the boy if any one had told aspinall ten minutes ago he would be talking to dick in this strain he would have scouted the idea as a bit of chaff as it was he could hardly believe he had said as much as he had and waited in an uncomfortable sort of way for dicks next remark oh thats what you think is it please dont be angry pleaded the boy you asked me what about heathcote demanded dick abruptly after a pause what do you mean dick i mean is he making a mess of it too oh dick i never said you were making a mess of it well then is heathcote being led astray i dont know he seems different and talks funnily about things does what i never heard georgie talk funnily about things and ive known him a good bit whos leading him astray am i poor aspinall was on the tightrope again at the most ticklish part for he did think dick was running heathcote into mischief unintentionally no doubt but still unmistakably am i repeated dick rounding on his man and fixing him with his eyes heathcotes not so strongminded as you are dick and when he sees you doing things i fancy he thinks he can do them too but he cant pull up like you and so he gets into rows oh said dick returning to his quill pen and completing its demolition then he pulled out the letter and read it to himself again and this time instead of returning it to his pocket twisted it up into a spill and lit the gas with it what should you say was the english of dominat qui in se dominatur young un he asked casually when the operation was complete why thats one of the mottoes in the quad said aspinall wondering what on earth this had to do with heathcotes rows i always fancied it meant he rules best who knows how to rule himself which is the word for best asked dick critically rather pleased to have found a flaw in the motto oh i suppose its understood said aspinall why couldnt he say what he meant straight out said dick waxing wondrous wroth at the mottomaker theres plenty of room in the quad for an extra word aspinall quite blushed at this small explosion and somehow felt personally implicated in the defects of the motto perhaps im wrong said he perhaps it means a fellow cant rule at all unless he can rule himself that wont wash said dick profoundly wheres the nisi never mind goodnight young aspinall im going to do my work here and aspinall departed a good deal exercised in his mind as to dicks latest humour but thankful all the same that he didnt appear desperately offended with the answers he had extorted to his very home questions dick did not do much swot that evening he couldnt get the ghost out of his head nor the slovenly latin prose of the old templeton motto writer qui in se dominatur what latin dick pulled down cresswells dictionary and looked up se and dominatur and wished he had the fellow there to tell him he ought to be ashamed of himself why it might mean who is ruled by his inside perhaps it did mean that but no dick couldnt get out of the hobble he was in he tried every way but the right way he denounced the ghost he denounced heathcote he denounced the latin grammar but they always sent him back to where he started until finally in sheer desperation he had to denounce himself he was just beginning this congenial occupation in as comfortable an attitude as he could in cresswells easychair when the study door opened and braider entered hallo youre here are you said that youth why ever didnt you come before i told you to be in the quad and id call for you didnt i youve got in a nice mess here was another candid friend going to tell him hed got into a mess what mess who with why with the club they elected you by a close shave and expected youd come in i yelled all over the place for you and couldnt find you so they thought youd skulked and were nearly going to take culver after all when i promised to find you and bring you theyre waiting for you now awfully sorry braider said dick in an embarrassed way i cant come cant come you ass what do you mean this was just what dick wanted as long as braider was civil dick had to be rational but as soon as braider began to threaten dick could let out a bit and relieve his feelings look here who are you calling an ass said he starting up fortunately for the peace cresswell at that moment entered the study hallo said he looking round make yourselves at home in my study youngsters cant you ask a few friends in as well whats the row braiders the row said dick i want him to cut and he wont he wants me to all right said braider in sudden concern lest the secret of the sociables was to be divulged ill cut and dont you forget young richardson what youve promised of course i shant said dick the select sociables sat in congress to a late hour that night what passed no one outside that worthy body exactly knew but braider on the whole had a busy time of it he did not visit dick again but he interviewed both culver and heathcote and was extremely confidential with each and both culver and heathcote after preparation lounged outside the door as dick had lounged two hours before and the two loungers neither of them fancying the intrusion of the other came to words and from words proceeded to personalities and from personalities to blows and as in the course of the combat heathcote made a mighty onslaught and caught his enemy round the body and wrestled a fall with him on the threshold of the sociable door it so happened that the door not being securely latched gave way beneath the weight of the two combatants and swinging suddenly open precipitated them both on to the floor of the apartment just as the club was proceeding to record its votes be it said to their credit the select sociables had a soul above mere routine and seeing the contest was even and that blood was up on both sides they adjourned the business and hospitably invited the two candidates to fight it out there and then which the two candidates did with the result that on the whole heathcote got rather less of the worst of it than culver then having politely ejected them both the club returned to business and elected george heathcote as a fit and proper person to fill the vacancy caused by the unjust expulsion of the late alan forbes heathcote was thereupon brought in and informed of the honour bestowed upon him and after being sworn to secrecy and promising to obey the club in all things was called upon for a speech heathcotes speech was short and memorable all serene anything you like i dont care a hang every sentence of this brilliant oration was cheered to the echo and heathcote was installed into his new dignity with loud enthusiasm he had not a ghost of an idea who the sociables were what they did or what they wanted but he had a rough idea they were a select assembly not favoured by the monitors or the masters in which a fellow was popular in proportion to his record of rows and heathcote whose one ambition it was at present under pledges influence not to figure as a prig or a hypocrite cast his lot in with them and chanced the rest it did occur to him to enquire if dick was a member yes hes a member rather said spokes the president he was elected this evening wasnt he you fellows rather echoed the highsouled club winking at one another whereupon heathcote asked no more questions and proceeded to enjoy himself as the club was breaking up twiss one of its leading spirits came up to the new member and said look here youngster dont you forget youre on your honour not to say a word about the club outside to anybody not to pledge or your chum or anybody but dicks a member too said heathcote that does not matter you maynt even speak about it to me or pretend you belong to my set do you twig all right said heathcote its a good job you told me though for i was going to tell dick about my election well you know now youre on your honour so are we all noble society organised dishonour held together in bonds of honour if boys were only to cast round what is right the same shield of honour which they so often cast round what is wrong what a world this would be when heathcote and dick met that evening in the dormitory they had something more important to talk about or to be silent about than the select sociables look here old man said dick thrusting a piece of newspaper into his friends hand they wrapped up the notepaper i got in town today in this its a bit of last weeks templeton observer heathcote looked at the paragraph his friend pointed to and read the mysterious disappearance of a boatup to the present no news has been heard of the martha of templeton which is supposed to have been stolen from its moorings on the night of the th ult the police however profess to have a clue to the perpetrators of the robbery it is stated that late on the evening in question a lad without shoes or stockings was seen on the strand in the neighbourhood of the boat and as the lad has been lost sight of since it is supposed he may be concerned at present the police are unable to give a description of the suspected lad but vigilant enquiries are being prosecuted and it is hoped that before long the mystery may be solved and the culprit brought to justice chapter fifteen in which our heroes do not distinguish themselves one result of the alarming paragraph in the templeton observer was that dick and heathcote for the remainder of the term became models of virtue as far as going out of school bounds was concerned other boys might stray down the high street and look at the shops but they didnt others might go down to the beach and become familiar with the boatmen but our heroes were far too respectable others might mitch off for a private cruise round sprit rock in quest of whiting or other treasures of the deep but dick and georgie would not sully their fair fame with any such breach of templeton rules they kept up early morning tub but that was the limit of their wanderings from the fold and it was often amusing to mark the diligence with which they always took to drying their heads with the towels on the way up if ever a boatman happened to cross their path heathcote on more than one occasion was compelled politely but firmly to decline pledges commissions into the town although it sometimes cost him words and worse still sneers from his patron once however he had to yield and a terrible afternoon he spent in consequence youngster said the spider i want you to go to websters in high street and get a book for me afraid i cant pledge said heathcote i must swot this afternoon what have you got to do theres thirty lines of cicero and i havent looked at them ill do it for you before you come back and there are some latin verses for westover too leave them with me too heathcote felt uncomfortable and it occurred to him it was not right to accept anothers help i think i ought to do them myself said he i dont like having them done for me quite right my dear young friend youre beginning to find out it pays to be a good little boy are you i always said you would i only hope youll make a good thing of it heathcote coloured up violently its not that at all said he its only would it do if i went after preparation this evening what saint george propose to break rules well i am shocked after all my pains too no my child i couldnt let you do this wicked thing what book am i to ask for said heathcote giving it up thanks old man theres something better than the saint in you after all tell webster its the book i ordered last week it is paid for heathcote started on his mission with a heavy heart he had lost caste he feared with pledge and he was running into the enemys country and perilling not only himself but dick in the venture he made fearful and wonderful detours to avoid a few straggling policemen or any figure which in the distance looked remotely like a british seaman the sight of a shopkeeper sitting at his door and reading the templeton observer scared him and the bill offering a reward for his discovery all but drove him headlong back to the school without accomplishing his mission at length after an anxious voyage he ran into mr websters harbour and for a little while breathed again the bookseller knew quite well what book pledge had ordered here it is said he handing over a small parcel and id advise you to get rid of it as soon as you can it would do you no good to be found in your pocket or mr pledge either he added he says its paid for said heathcote quite right then noticing that the boy still seemed reluctant to launch forth once more into the high street he said perhaps youd like to look round the shop mr heathcote heathcote thought he would and spent a quarter of an hour in investigating mr websters shelves of books just as he was about to leave duffield and the sociable raggles entered the shop hullo georgie said the latter whod have thought of seeing you in the town everyone says youre keeping out of the way of the police dont they duff yes said duffield perceiving the joke for some burglary or something like that heathcote breathed again at the word burglary and made an heroic effort to smile not at all said raggles nudging his ally not a burglary but boat stealing isnt it webster ah said mr webster who was a good man of business and fond of his joke they never did find that young party certainly shut up and dont be a fool said heathcote feeling the colour coming to his face and longing to be out in the open air whats this the description was said duffield perching himself on the corner of the counter and reading off the unhappy heathcotes personal appearance goodlooking boy of fourteen with fair hair and a slight moustache dressed in a grey tweed suit masher collar and two tin sleevelinks not very intelligent and usually wears a smudge of ink under his right eye isnt that it thats something about the mark said mr webster laughing think of offering two pounds reward for a chap like that said raggles they must be hard up look here said heathcote seeing that his only refuge lay in swagger im not going to have any of your cheek raggles shut up or ill lick you no fighting here young gentlemen please said the affable bookseller ha ha said raggles enjoying himself under the security of duffields alliance hes in a wax because we said it was only a slight moustache he thinks we ought to have said a heavy one he may think it ought to be but it aint said duffield i never saw such a slight one in all my days it is rarely that any one sees reason to bless his own moustache but on this particular occasion when he perceived the welcome controversy to which it was giving rise georgie was very near calling down benedictions on his youthful hairs with great presence of mind he recovered his goodhumour and diverted the talk further and further into its capillary course he backed his moustache against duffields and raggles spliced together he upbraided them with envy and called webster to witness that the pimple on raggles lip which he claimed as the forerunner of his crop had been there for the last six months with never a sign of harvest altogether under shelter of his moustache georgie crept out of a very awkward hobble and finally out of websters shop greatly to the relief of his palpitating heart but his trials were not quite over as he was running headlong round the corner of high street determined that no pretext should detain him a moment longer than necessary in this perilous territory he found himself to his horror suddenly confronted with the form of the very british seaman whom of all others he hoped to avoid and before he could slacken speed or fetch a compass he had plunged full into tom whites arms tom white as usual i am sorry to say was halfseasover never steady in his best days he had ever since the loss of the martha made his headquarters at the bar of the dolphin not that the loss of the martha was exactly ruin to her late owner on the contrary since her disappearance tom had had more pocketmoney than ever he had when she was his for sympathetic neighbours pitying his loss had contributed trifles towards his solace the templeton boys with many of whom he had been a favourite had tipped him handsomely in his distress and it was even rumoured that half of a collection for the poor at the parish church a few sundays ago had been awarded to poor destitute tom white on the whole tom felt that if he could lose a martha twice a year he might yet sup off tripe and gintoddy seven times a week the dolphin became his banker and took very particular care of his money all this the boy of course did not know all he knew was that the waistcoat into which he had run belonged to the man he had wronged who if he only suspected his wronger could make the coming summer holidays decidedly tedious for georgie and his friend belay there hiccupped tom reeling back from the collision and catching heathcote by the arm got yer young gemn and ill bash yer i beg your pardon said georgie terribly scared and seeing already in his minds eye the narrowest cell of the county jail tom blinked at him stupidly holding him at arms length and cruising round him bust me if it aint a schollard said he what cheer my hearty dont forget the poor mariner thats lost his martha its very ard on a honest jack tar how heathcotes soul went out to the poor british seaman as soon as he discovered that he did not recognise him he gave him his alltwo shillings and one pennyand deemed it a mite to offer to so deserving a cause he hoped from his heart tom would find his boat or if not would get a pension from the government or be made an inspector of coastguards nothing was too good for the sweet delectable creature and he told him as much whereat tom with the shillings penny in his hand and all the boys blandishments in his ears retired to the dolphin to digest both and once more heathcote with the perspiration on his brow and his chest positively sore with the thumping of his heart sped like a truant shade from the fangs of cerberus after that neither threats entreaties or taunts could induce heathcote to venture either alone or in company into templeton fortunately for him and his leader the approaching close of the term gave every one at templeton an excuse for keeping bounds and sticking steadily to work pledge among others was in for a scholarship which five out of six of those who knew him prophesied he would get if he took a fortnights hard work before the examination a fortnight before the examination to the day pledge began to work and templeton put down the bishops scholarship to him without further parley only two men were against himcartwright who fine fellow as he was could not desert the cricket field and gymnasium even in the throes of an examination and freckleton the hermit whom half of templeton didnt know by sight and the other half put down as a harmless lunatic who divided his time between theological exercises and plodding but not always successful study our heroes being new boys were exempt from the general school examinationstheir guerdon of reward being the general proficiency prize for new boys a vague term in which good conduct study and progress were all taken into account dick sadly admitted that he was out of it still he vaguely hoped he might pull off his remove as the phrase wentthat is get raised next term to the serene atmosphere of the lower fourth along with the faithful heathcote but nowhere was the studious fit more serious than in the upper fifth where birket swinstead wrangham and one or two others cast longing eyes on the vacant desk in the sixth and strained every nerve to win it cricket flagged and it was hard during that fortnight to make up a set at tennis the early tub alone retained its attractions and indeed was never more crowded than when templeton was heart and soul in study one fellow regarded the whole scene half sadly and that was ponty indolent as he seemed to be he loved the old school and hated the thought of leaving it he had friends there that were like brothers to him there were nooks here and there where he had lounged and enjoyed life which seemed like so many homes he knew he had not done anything great for templeton he knew he had let the tares grow side by side with the wheat and made no effort to uproot them he knew that there were boys there whom he ought to have befriended and others he ought to have scathed and it made him sad now to think of all he might have done i dont think theyll erect a statue to me in the quad old man said he to mansfield at the end of the examination i know there isnt a fellow that wont be sorry to lose you said mansfield ah no doubt theyve had quiet times under easygoing old saturn and dont fancy the prospect of jove with his thunderbolts ruling in his stead eh if i could be sure of fellows being as fond of me as they are of you i shouldwell i should get something i dont expect said mansfield dont be too sure old man said ponty but i say will you take a hint from a failure like me added the old captain digging deep into his pockets and looking a trifle nervous rather id only be too thankful said mansfield go easy with them at first only have one hand in an iron glove keep the other for some of those juniors who may turn out all right if they get a little encouragement and arent snuffed out all at once youll have plenty of work for the iron hand with one or two hornets nests we know of give the little chaps a chance this was dear old pontys last will and testament templeton looked back upon him after he had gone as an easygoing goodnatured let alone loveable fellow but it didnt know all of what it owed him the examinations came at length the new boys having been the last to come were naturally the first to be examined and once more the portraits in the long hall looked down upon basil richardson and georgie heathcote gnawing at the ends of their pens and gazing at the ceiling for an inspiration it was rather a sad spectacle for those portraits possibly they barely recognised in the reckless jaunty fair boy and his baffled almost wrathful companion the heathcote and richardson who four months ago had sat there fresh and simple and rosy with the world of templeton before them it had not been a good term for either thank heaven as they sat there they had honesty enough left to know it and hope enough left to feel there might still be a chance they were not to jump by one leap into the perfect schoolboy still with honesty and hope left who shall say they had lost all as to their immediate care the examinationtheir last lingering expectation of getting their remove slowly vanished before those ruthless questions all of which they knew they ought to know but many of which they discovered they knew nothing about other boys like aspinall who with all his tears and terrors had struggled through the term more of a hero than either of his doughty protectors found the time only too short to answer all they had to answer and our two dejected ones as they looked round and saw the fluency of every one else felt themselves like sediment gradually sinking to their level as long as the stir of term life had lasted they had imagined themselves as well up even better than most of their contemporaries but now they began to find out it was not so the suspense if they felt any was not long two days after the examination at the time when the sixth and fifth were passing through their ordeal the new boys list came out aspinall was first and got his welldeserved remove with a compliment from the doctor into the bargain which made his pale face glow with pleasure dick with a sturdy effort to look cheerful waved his congratulations across the hall and then settled down to hear the almost interminable string of names before his or georgies broke the monotony in their own minds and in the modesty of their own selfabasement they had fixed on the twentieth place or thereabouts for heathcote and about the twentyfifth for dick alas the singles grew into the teens and the teens into the twenties and the twenties into the thirties before the break came after eighteen every one knew that the removes were exhausted and that the list which followed was if not a list of reproach at any rate one neither of honour nor profit richardson read the doctor making a pause on the announcement which cut the penitent dick to the quick fox sumpter whiles heathcote hooker junior that is all poor heathcote he had buoyed himself up to the last he had reminded himself that he was not a prig or a saint that he didnt go in for conduct that paid that he called a spade a spade and that he didnt profess to be what he wasnt and yet all this failed to place him higher than last but one of thirtysix boys among whom only four months ago he stood fifteenth even dick had beaten him now although dick himself had fallen ten places down the list the two friends had a dreary walk round the deserted fields that afternoon i cant make it out said heathcote i knew i hadnt done well but i expected to be higher than that i wonder if winters got a spite against me more likely got one against me did you hear the way he read out my name yes he may have been surprised you came out so high its nothing to joke about said dick weve both made a mess of it i really thought id done my lessons pretty steadily said heathcote loth to part with the idea that there must be a mistake somewhere you mean pledge did them for you i tell you what old manive had enough of this sort of mess i dont like it no more do i said heathcote very truly i mean to get my remove at christmas if i get brainfever over it rather so do i said heathcote i shall have a go in at the irregular verbs during the holidays ehwill you asked georgie beginning to stagger a little at the new programme all serene so will i we might begin tonight perhaps awfully sorryive an engagement tonight said heathcote where this was the first occasion on which dick had asked this very awkward question it was the windup supper of the select sociables for the present term and to heathcote one of the chief attractions of the prospect had been that dick being a member would be there too he was therefore startled somewhat at the inquiry oh you know we dont talk about it said he so it seems said dick but it happens i dont know dont you then the fellows must have told me a cram what fellows why do you mean to say you dont know dick how should i havent they asked you too arent you a i mean dont you know at this particular moment cresswell came across the quadrangle with a bundle of books in his hands which he told dick to take to his study and before dick had time to perform his task and return to the quad braider had pounced on heathcote and borne him away in hot haste to the orgy of the select sociables where he spent a very unprofitable evening in trying to square his conscience with all he saw and heard and in trying to ascertain from every member of the club he could get hold of why dick wasnt there too he was not released without a renewal of his promise of secrecy and spent a very uncomfortable half hour in the dormitory that evening trying as best he could to parry the questions of his friend into whose head it had never entered that the select sociables after ejecting him should dream of such a thing as electing heathcote they might have quarrelled over the mystery had not the approaching holidays and an opportune note from coote announcing that he had just scraped through the pass examination for second chances and would be at templeton after the recess driven all other thoughts for the time being out of their heads and the few remaining days of the term were devoted not to irregular verbs but to the devising of glorious schemes of welcome to old coote and anticipations of the joys of their reformed triple alliance the great result day found templeton as it always did in the chaos of packing up at the summons of the great bell to come and hear the lists read in the hall fellows dropped collars and coats rackets and rods boots and bookstand rushed for a front seat every one turned up to the summer listeven the housekeepers and the school porter the masters were there in caps and gowns and the sixth in solemn array occupied the benches on the dais the rest of the hall was left to the first comers and as all templeton on this occasion arrived first in a body the scene was usually animated dr winter read the list himself and every name rang through the hall being followed with cheers which made all the more striking the silence with which the next name was listened for the bishops scholarship has been won by freckleton said the doctor amazement as well as approval mingled with the applause which followed this most unexpected announcement which is freckleton asked dick of swinstead who sat in front that dark fellow talking to mansfield silence pledge was second and within a few marks cartwright was third how pleased winter must have been to find those marks the right way whispered pledge with the red spots on his cheeks to bull its a funny thing that freckleton should be a nephew of winters and yet just get the scholarship isnt it so very unusual eh the fifthform remove has been gained by swinstead said the doctor loud cheers wrangham was second but not very close and birket was a few marks below wrangham these announcements were the most interesting on the doctors list and templeton listened impatiently to the rest it waited however in its place in order to give a final cheer for ponty at the close which it did and the dear old fellow though he seemed very sleepy and longed for his armchair couldnt help hearing it and looking round at the old school nodding his kindly head when however somebody called out speech he stretched himself comfortably and shrugged his shoulders and they knew what that meant and gave it up twentyfour hours later templeton was scattered to the four winds and our heroes first term had become a chapter of ancient history chapter sixteen in which a notable triple alliance is renewed the six short weeks of holiday darted away only too quickly dick in the whirl of family life a hero to his sisters and a caution to his young brothers forgot all the troubles of the term and all its disappointments all about the select sociables and all about tom whites boat in one glorious burst of holiday freedom he even forgot about his irregular verbs and the good resolutions with which he had returned he left packed up in his trunk until the time came to take them back to templeton still it wasnt a bad time on the whole for dick like some small boat that gets out of the rushing tide for a little into some quiet creek he had time to overhaul himself and pull himself together ready for another voyage he was able in the home harbour to take some little fresh ballast on board and to rearrange what he at present had he was able to stow away some of his useless tackle and bale out some of the water he had shipped in the last few rapids altogether though dick was not exactly a boy given to selfexamination or self dedication and although he would have scouted the notion that he was going in for being a reformed character his little cruise in calm water did him good and steadied him for his next venture on the tide when the time should come it was not so with george heathcote he was a craft of flimsier build than his leader and the tide had gone harder with him there was a leak somewhere and the tackle was atwist and the ballast rolled to one side and for him the home harbour was no place for repairs heathcote had neither father nor mother and though his old relative did her best for him the boy was more or less at a loose end at home with no better guide than his own whims the wonder was considering his surroundings that heathcote was not utterly spoiled that he was still honest and amiable and amenable to good influence when he came across it he did not however come across much these holidays for four weeks he kicked his heels about in any way that suited him and began to long for templeton again and the face of a friend then one day a letter came to him from pledge dear youngsteryou said something about wanting to see london these holidays what do you say to coming here on a visit my father and mother would be glad to see you and we can go back to templeton together if you come tomorrow youll be in time for the last day of the australian match at the ovalyours truly p pledge heathcote jumped at the invitation an invitation from anybody would have been welcome just then but to be asked by his own senior in this unexpected way was both tempting and flattering so he took the letter to his grandmother and indulged in a glowing account of pledges virtues and merits the good lady of course gave her consent and the very next day georgie was in london the week slipped by in a round of pleasures for heathcote pledge the spoiled child of wealthy parents was pretty much his own master and spared no pains to make his young protege at home and gratify his every inclination to georgie the life in which he found himself was bewildering in its novelty pledge showed him london they saw public buildings and they saw the great streets they went to theatrical entertainments and concerts and parties they met friends good and bad and heard talk good and bad no one thought of making any distinction no one seemed to admit that there was much distinction it was all life if some went in for the good well let them if others went in for the bad what right had any one to interfere and if any went in for a little of both well wasnt the balance about straight and who was any the worse for it heathcote felt that he was in liberty hallthat he might do exactly as he liked without the awkwardness of feeling that any one was surprised or that any one was shocked pledge did not distinctly tempt him to do anything and yet during that one short week the boys moral sense was more deeply undermined than during the whole of the term that had passed the clear line between good and evil vanished and seeing the two side by side and hearing his companions constant sneers at sanctity it became natural to him to suspect the good and of the two prefer the evil so georgie heathcote went back to templeton the worse for his holidays and snared faster than ever in the spiders web but the sight of dick on the templeton platform drove all his unhealthy philosophy for a time from his mind and when an hour later the train from g came in and discharged coote and cootes hatbox and travellingbag there was joy in the hearts of those three old mountjoy boys which could not find vent in mere smiles or words of greeting coote was in a horrible flutter despite the countenance of his two protectors he could not trust himself out of their sight as they walked up from the station and crossed the quadrangle he suspected a snare everywhere and sniffed an enemy at every corner come on old fellow said dick in all the glory of an old hand stick your hat on the back of your head and make a face at everybody you meet and nobody will humbug you coote had his doubts of this advice but it occurred to him if it should be good he had better make the experiment while his friends were there to protect him so he tilted his hat cautiously back and timidly protruded his tongue at culver whom they met staggering under the weight of a carpet bag near the housekeepers door culver regarded the demonstration with a certain amount of bewildered disfavour and to cootes terror looked for a moment like putting down his carpet bag but the presence of dick and heathcote deterred him for the present and he contented himself with a promise that tilted the new boys hat back into its proper elevation with wonderful celerity never mind him said heathcote he always doubles up after five or six rounds do you mean he will fight me asked coote bless you yes today do you think dont know depends on what hes got in his bag if its a cargo he wont be out for a couple of nights all this was very alarming to coote who devoutly hoped culvers cargo might be big enough to keep him many nights in unloading it dick and heathcote led their junior partner rejoicing to the housekeeper and assisted in counting out his shirts and socks they then took him to show him off in the lobbies deserting him once or twice to his consternation in order to greet some crony or take part in a mild shindy in the studies the presence of their new kid inspired them with a wonderful fund of humour and audacity his astonishment flattered them and his panics delighted them with a lively recollection of their own experiences last term they took care he should be wandering in the quad when the dredger came its rounds and for fear he should miss the warm consolations of a lower third scrunch they organised one for his special benefit and had the happiness of seeing him rising in the middle scared and puffing with cheeks the colour of a peony all the while they tried to figure as his protectors and demanded credit for getting him through his ordeals in a way he would by no means have got if left as they had been to his own resources nor were they wholly unoriginal in their endeavours to make him feel at home in his new surroundings by george its ten minutes to dinnertime said dick looking at the clock therell be a frightful row if you are late first day and youve barely time to dress dress i am dressed said coote in alarm you muff youre not in your flannels think of a new fellow turning up to hall first day not in his flannels eh georgie my eye said georgie what a row thered be cut as hard as ever you can and put them on better not show up till just as the clock strikes in case fellows humbug you well be near the door and show you where to sit whatever should i have done thought the grateful coote to himself as he rushed off to don his brandnew flannels if it hadnt been for those two bricks the two bricks waited somewhat anxiously near the door of the hall for their new kid and as the clock began to strike they had the joy of seeing him dart resplendent across the quad keeping in the shade as much as possible and looking nervously up at the clock lamm it on called heathcote as the bell ceased and the breathless athlete ran into their arms am i all right asked the victim soso said they surveying him critically but youd better carry your coat over your arm look out winter will be coming in youve got to sit up there at the top table in that empty chair look alive or hell catch you and as the blushing innocent walked up the room the observed of all observers and made straight for the head masters table our heroes became absorbed in admiration of the plates in front of them and positively trembled with the emotion their beauty evoked every one was most polite to the abashed new boy on his journey up the room they ceased talking as they beheld him and respectfully made room for him some even were good enough to assist his progress by word and gesture where are you going my pretty maid asked birket of the rosy youth as he neared his destination the poetical suggestion was too much for the fifth who caught up the pastoral ditty and accompanied the measured tread of the wanderer with an undertone chorus of where are you going my pretty maid im going to dinner sir she said may i go with you my pretty maid not if i know it sir she said coote got used to the pretty melody before the term was over but just now his sense of music was deadened by the apparition of dr winter who entered by a door at the upper end of the hall and walked straight for the chair which the modest novice had looked upon as the goal of his tedious journey cut back said birket coming to the rescue just in time and turning the unhappy boy to the rightabout theyve been making a fool of you then might have been seen a spotless white figure flying like the wind down the hall of templeton making the place rosy with his blushes and merry with his hot haste dick and heathcote caught their brother as he made for the door and squeezed him in between them at their table where roast beef and good cheer restored some of his drooping spirits while the applause of his patrons and the success of the whole adventure went far to reduce the tension which otherwise might have threatened the stability of the firm but after that coote felt his confidence in the two bricks on whom he had hitherto relied so implicitly a trifle shaken and was not quite sure whether after all a new boy might not get through his first few days as comfortably without the protection of two bosom friends as with it there being very few new boys this term compared with last he found himself by no means neglected in his walks abroad and it required all his wariness to elude the gins and pitfalls prepared for him indeed his very wariness got him into trouble after chapel on his second morning swinstead came to him and said youngster you are to go to the doctor at halfpast nine oh ah said coote to himself knowingly i know what that means do you hear asked swinstead i suppose you think im green said the new boy swinstead laughed what on earth should make me think that said he coote chuckled merrily to himself as he saw the senior depart im getting over the worst of it said he to himself theyll soon give up trying it on me ha ha and he went off to find his chums who took him for a stroll in the fields well young un said dick patronisingly getting used to it worn your flannels lately youre a beastly cad dick said coote but you dont catch me like that again no youre getting too knowing said georgie coote laughed im not quite as green as some fellows think said he a fellow came to me this morning and told me to go to the doctor at a nice fool he thought hed make of me ha ha what fellow was he said dick looking rather serious i dont know his name said coote the fellow who marked the names in chapel i believe what swinstead did he tell you to go rather and i told him i wasnt such a fool as i lookedi mean as he thought by joveyou young ass youve got yourself into a mess if you like how do you mean inquired the new boy beginning to be alarmed at the concerned looks of his two friends why hes chapel usher said dick do you mean to say you didnt go to the doctor rather not i whats the time said dick a quarter to ten without more ado they took the unhappy coote between them and rushed him frantically back to the school where they shot him in at the doctors door just as that gentleman was about to dismiss his new boys class how is this coote demanded the head master sternly as the breathless boy entered were you not told to be here at halfpast nine yes sir ii made a mistake im very sorry sir the genuine terror in his face procured his reprieve this time dr winter may have been used to mistakes of this kind at any rate he contented himself with cautioning the new boy against unpunctuality generally and by way of punishment gave him an examination all to himself which resulted much to his comfort in his being placed in the upper third of which dick and heathcote were already shining lights while he was thus engaged dick and heathcote were holding a secret and by no means cheerful consultation over a recent number of the templeton observer i made sure it was all blown over said the latter dejectedly what a cad the fellow must be said the former i think newspapers are a regular nuisance said georgie all i know is he robbed us of all we had and if wed informed hed have been in botany bay or somewhere this minute said dick working himself up into a passion the extract from the templeton observer which gave rise to this duet of wrath was as follows dated some ten days before the close of the holidays the recent mysterious disappearance of a templeton boatup to the present time nothing has been heard of the martha which as our readers will remember disappeared from the templeton beach on the th june last the supposed clue with which the police professed to be provided has so far failed to bring the perpetrators of the outrage to justice although the hope is by no means abandoned of tracing the missing lad the matter is somewhat seriously complicated by the discovery that thomas white the reputed owner of the boat was at no time its actual proprietor the martha was the joint property of white and three other men one of them skipper of the brig julia and the other two wellknown fishermen of this town it appears that an arrangement was made whereby white should be the nominal owner of the boat he undertaking to hand over monthly three quarters of the profits to his partners in may last during the absence of his other partners white pawned the martha representing her to be his sole property and appropriated the whole proceeds of the transaction for this act of fraud which the recent loss of the boat and the return of its joint owners has brought to light we understand a writ has been issued against white and that he will be arrested immediately on his return to templeton from his present cruise with the fishing fleet in the high seas tom whites a regular bad one said dick yes it was a jolly mean trick to pawn what didnt belong to him the thing is who did it belong to when wewhen it got adrift the pawnbroker i suppose said heathcote most likely nash no wonder tom white didnt seem much cut up about losing her no he made a good thing by it its a comfort to think hell get nabbed at last of course weve nothing to do with his row said dick of course not we had nothing to do with pawning the boat and yet they concluded if the martha had never gone adrift no one would have known of tom whites fraud and he might have been able to make money enough with her to clear himself it seemed unfair to rake up an old sore like this at the very beginning of the term especially when as they persuaded themselves over and over again the whole affair had very little to do with them i vote we dont look at this wretched paper any more said heathcote crumpling up the offending observer into a ball and giving it a punt across the path why not we may as well see what becomes of tom white said dick young aspinall can fetch us up a copy once a week and so one of the events of the new term was that the templeton observer had a new subscriber and increased its circulation by two new and very diligent readers chapter seventeen the new captain draws a straight line mansfield returned to templeton like a man who knows that his work is cut out for him and who means to do it coute qui coute as the french say any one else might have been afraid of the task before him and doubtful of success mansfield was neither at any rate as far as any one else could see he set himself up neither for a hercules nor a galahad it never occurred to him what he was but it did occur to him that templeton wanted reform and that the captain of templeton ought to reform it and with that one clear purpose before him mansfield was the sort of fellow to go straight through thick and thin to reach it or perish in the attempt they say that when a certain russian emperor wanted a railway made between the two chief cities of his dominion and was asked what route it should take so as to benefit the largest number of intervening towns and villages he called for a map and ruler and drawing a straight line between the two places said let it go that way that was pretty much the style of mansfield he didnt understand turning to right or left to give anybody a lift on the way all he knew was that templeton was not up to the mark and that templeton must be brought up to the mark between those points he ruled his straight line and that way he meant to go if the line cut a snug little set of chums in half if it turned one or two settled school customs out of house and home if it sent one or two waverers hopelessly over to the wrong sidewell so be it it was a pity especially if the innocent had to suffer with the guilty but the good of templeton was at stake and woe to the traitor who thought anything more important than that dear old ponty whom templeton had never loved so much as when it missed him had curled his line about in snug comfortable insandouts so as not to disturb anybody mansfield didnt think himself better than ponty whom he loved as a brother but mansfield couldnt draw curling inandout lines he only knew one line and that was a straight one and so for better or worse mansfield called for his map and his ruler and dashed into his task give the little chaps a chance ponty had said in his last will and testament and the new captain of templeton was willing to make one little curve in order to carry out his friends wish on the fourth evening of the term as the den was assembled in full session for the purpose of swearing in coote and denouncing the powers that be that honourable fraternity was startled out of its never superabundant wits by an apparition far more terrible than the templeton ghost dick was in the chair at the time and heathcote was in the act of moving a resolution that this den considers all the monitors ought to be hanged and hopes they will be when the captain of templeton suddenly entered the room then fell there a silence on the den like to the silence of a kennel of dogs when the whip of the master cracks the word hanged died half uttered on the lips of heathcote and dick slipped aghast from his eminence the tongue of coote clave to the roof of his mouth and even gosses heart turned to stone in the midst of a swop never did condemned criminals stand more still or waxworks more dumb mansfield closed the door behind him and marched straight to the top of the room where stood dicks vacant chair was he going to drive them out singlehanded was he going to arrest their leader or was he going to make a speech as soon as they perceived he was going to do neither the first nor the second and knew he was going to do the last they groaned they could have endured a stampede round the quad they could have brought themselves to see their leader immolated in a good cause but to have to stand still and hear jupiter speakwhat had they done to deserve that look here you youngsters began mansfield needing not even a motion of his hand to command silence ive not come as an enemy but a friend what will it be like mused coote when he comes as an enemy and ive only a very few words to say to you was it a sigh of relief or disappointment that escaped the den mansfield didnt know he wasnt well up in sighs theres a great deal goes on in the den that isnt right some of you youngsters think the only use of school rules is to break them and that its a fine thing to disobey the monitors youre wrong and unless you give up that sort of thing youll find it out the school rules are made to be kept and the monitors are appointed to see they are kept and any boy that says otherwise is an enemy to templeton and he will be treated accordingly some of you dont approve of all that goes on here and yet you dont like to stand up against it thats not right you cant be neutral if you mean to be steady you are bound to stand out and have nothing to do with the bad lot i want you all to understand this once for all and not say youve had no warning i warn you now rules are made to be kept and you must keep them pontifex the captain had to stop for the den which had stood in breathless silence thus far sprang at the mention of the name into a cheer which spoke quite as much for the tension of their own feelings at this moment as for their affection for the old captain mansfield let them have it out he liked them none the worse for their love to his friend and what he had to say would by no means spoil by keeping till the cheers were over they were over at last the sight of the captain there tall upright determined with his dark eyes bent on them cut them short and brought the den back to silence as deep as that which had just been broken pontifex was fond of you youngsters he said to me a day or two before he went give the little chaps a chance they could not help it captain or no captain they must cheer again and again mansfield waited patiently and ungrudgingly till it was over this is why ive come here tonight you have your chance let everybody choose for himself and dont let any one say he didnt know what to expect theres to be a captains levee on thursday i dont want any one to come to it who is not prepared to stand by templeton rules this term those who are prepared will do well to show up so ended jupiters speech to the den he stalked down the room and out of the door amid a solemn silence which was not broken until his firm footsteps died away down the passage then the den looked at one another as much as to say what do you think of that pretty warm said dick relieving the general embarrassment by speaking first think he means it said one looks like it said dick gloomily there was a pause the den knew somehow it was no joke it was a case of life or death war or peace liberty or servitude and they hesitated on the brink i dont mean to knuckle under to him said heathcote speaking with the mantle of pledge upon him its all a dodge to curry favour with winter the den was thankful for the suggestion and revived wonderfully under its influence catch me doing more for him than for old ponty cried gosse who had never done anything for ponty the reference was a popular one and the den took it up also it fell to extolling ponty to the very heavens and abasing mansfield to the opposite extremity while it held up its hands in horror at the man who could seek to make the good order of templeton the price of his favour with the head master but when the little outburst had subsided the awkward question still remainedwhat was to be done of course nobody will be cad enough to go to the levee after what he said said heathcote who warmed by the admiring glances of coote and the success of his last observation felt called upon to speak for the assembly in general rather not you wont go will you dick said pauncefote dont know said that hero shortly the den was startled what did dick mean by dont know was he going to knuckle in after all and join the saints the uncertainty had a very depressing effect on heathcotes enthusiasm which had calculated all along on the countenance of his leader coote too cautiously separated himself from gosse who was shouting sedition at the top of his voice and drew off to more neutral territory smith and pauncefote kept up their cheers for ponty but gradually dropped the groans for mansfield and altogether the howls of the den toned down to the roar of a sucking dove as it got whispered abroad that dick richardson didnt know the two days that followed were days of suspense to the den is dick going was the question every one asked he doesnt know was the invariable answer under these circumstances it will be understood but little enthusiasm could be called up over the rival toilets of the fraternity culvers dresscoat had been returned to its lawful owner long since and for that reason if for no other he determined not to attend heathcotes choker and white gloves were the worse for wear so he was not anxious and coote whose one strong point was a watered ribbon watchchain was rumoured to be weak in collars and on the whole not a hot man at all or likely to show up as to dick opinions were divided as to what he could do if he went it was known his dicky had fallen off but on the other hand he had brought back a pair of patent leather pumps which might make him feel it his duty to attend look here old man asked heathcote for about the hundredth time the evening before the levee are you going or are you not dont know replied dick are you what a question for a leader to ask his lieutenant dick knew it was ridiculous but he guessed shrewdly it might choke off further inquiry and it did heathcote however had other counsellors besides dick who were neither doubtful nor sparing in their advice on the great question a hasty meeting of the select sociables was summoned by means of braider that very evening to take into consideration the action of the club at the forthcoming levee at which it was agreed unanimously that after the captains threat no member of that honourable body should on any account show up heathcote held up his hand for the resolution with the others and felt sure in his own mind dick would have done the same mind nobody shows up on any pretext said spokes as the meeting separated were on our honour and of course no one mentions the club outofdoors of course nobody would think of such a thing heathcote felt a good deal concerned as the evening went on and still no sign came from dick it wasnt exactly kind to keep a fellow in suspense like this the only thing was to take the bull by the horns and announce what he was going to do then possibly dick might show his hand ive decided not to show up at the levee said georgie on the morning of the eventful day have you said dick with a most provoking indifference yes said the cunning georgie i tell you what dick while its going on you and i can get the top court and play off our heat for the handicap what do you say dont know whereupon heathcote wished that two words in the english language could be suspended and went off to see if any comfort was going in the den but no whats dick going to do asked almost everybody he doesnt know groaned heathcote whereupon the den as well as georgie wished ill to those two unlucky words the morning passed and still no ray of light illumined the doubters dick got twenty lines from pledge for jumping over the geranium bed in the quad and knocking off a flower in the act and every one guessed this would decide him against the levee but at dinnertime a rumour spread on the authority of coote that he had put on a clean collar since morning school and public opinion immediately veered round to the opposite direction no sooner however was dinner done than he was seen to fetch his tennis racket from his study and once more it was surmised that he was going after all to play off his heat with georgie instead of attending the ceremony and that supposition was in turn dashed to the ground when it was discovered that he had got the bat in order to give it to a messenger from splicers the racket maker to be tightened up in the top cord afternoon school dragged tediously on and the den grew desperate fellows went off to dress but what was the use of heathcote putting on his choker or smith and pauncefote parting their hairs when they didnt know whether they were going to the levee or not heathcote made one final effort to draw the sphinx come on said he well bag the court if we are sharp and get an hours quiet play ive got no racket said dick i say dick are you going to the leveedo tell us i dont know what do you want to know for ii vote we dont go said georgie coaxingly im not going i know that are you and there was a tone of desperate pathos in the boys voice havent i told you a hundred and fifty times i dont know replied dick scarcely less desperate heathcote gave it up and joined the den who were waiting about in anxious groups near the door of the hall with their ornaments in their hands ready to put on at a moments notice if necessary presently dick strolled up and joined them hurrah he had not got his patent leather boots on after all a weight fell from the minds of half the beholders as they cast their eyes down at his dusty double soles and yet if he wasnt going in what was he hanging about there for dick would have been very sorry if any of the den had guessed what was passing in his mind he didnt know what to do if there had been no one but himself it wouldnt have mattered but there was that young ass heathcote and coote too who were certain to do as he did and the fag of making up his mind for three people was not fair to a fellow and yet the ghosts letter somehow stuck in his mind and the ballast he had taken on board during the holidays made it harder to play pitch and toss with himself than it had been he didnt like the way mansfield had almost dared them to stay away because if it came to that he would just as soon let fellows see he wasnt going to be bullied on the other hand the captain had as good as said it wanted some pluck to stand out against the rowdies and that was an argument in favour of showing up at levee the worst of it was when once you showed up you were committed to the steady lot and couldnt well back out if young heathcoteno he was bound to look after heathcote so to the amazement and consternation of the den after loafing about at the door for ten minutes dick strolled into the hall and made his way up to the platform one or two including coote followed him immediately others remained long enough to put on their cuffs and chokers and then followed suit one or two looked at the door and went back again and a few talked about treason and rule heathcote alone was aghast and dumbfounded for he had never seriously calculated on his leaders decision and being himself under vow not to present himself his dilemma was terrible perjury or treason that was the problem he had to decide at half a minutes notice and it was no joke as he watched dick slowly advance up the room dogged by the faithful coote and supported by a bodyguard of loyal followers his courage failed and he could hardly restrain himself from rushing after him and yet the memory of his promise to the select sociables and the vision of braider watching him from a distance held him where he was how he wished he could have a fit or break his arm or have his nose bleed anything to get him out of this hobble but no he saw dick ascend the dais and shake hands with the captain who looked almost amiable as he spoke a few words to him he saw pauncefote and smith and the other loyal ones come in for the same greeting he saw coote and his watered ribbon being presented by cartwright and he caught sight of pledge looking up and down the room possibly in search of his georgie all this he saw and yet could not stir only when he saw dick descend the platform and slowly return towards the door did the spell yield and permit him to escape to the quad there half an hour later he was found by pledge hullo youngster you didnt turn up at the pantomime then no said heathcote i didnt want to what not want to be shaken hands with and blessed by the holy mansfield you naughty boy to neglect such a short cut to peace and plenty i dont want to toady to anybody said heathcote bitterly of course you dont but im afraid your courage will cost you something in impositions and detentions and that sort of thing what do i care id sooner have any amount of them than be a humbug and truckle to anybody every one said pledge with an approving smile made sure when your friend richardson came to do homage that you would come too i was quite pleased to find i knew better and was right i dont know what made dick go said heathcote no cant you guess isnt dick a good boy and doesnt he always do what good boys do heathcote laughed i dont think hes very much in that line well he imitates it very well said pledge watching his man carefully and ive no doubt he will find it worth his while what do you mean inquired heathcote looking up i mean that mansfield is picking his men for the rd football fifteen and im afraid you wont be in it my boy heathcote said nothing but walked on to the school door where he and his patron parted company the latter proceeding to his study with a particularly amiable smile on his countenance the former repairing to the adjourned meeting of the select sociables there to hear high praises of his loyalty and steadfastness and to partake of a very select contraband supper which with the questionable festivities that followed was good for neither the body nor the soul of our unheroic young hero chapter eighteen dick conspires to defeat the ends of justice dick on quitting the captains levee retired in anything but exalted spirits to cresswells study he didnt care to face the den that evening not that he was afraid of rule or cared a snap what anybody there had to say about his conduct but he wasnt sure himself whether he had made a mistake or not he hated being in a corner he had no natural antipathy to doing what was right but he didnt like being pinned down to it he didnt go to the levee because he was desperately in love with law and order and it was a shame for any one to suppose he had he went because he knew heathcote was waiting to see what he did and now after all heathcote had deserted his colours and not gone it was enough to make any one testy and aspinall had he known it would have been less surprised than he was to have his head almost snapped off as the two fellowfags sat at work in their seniors study that evening cant you do your work without groaning like that said dick when the small boy for about the fiftieth time stumbled over his hexameters i beg your pardon said aspinall i didnt mean to disturb you who said you did retorted poor dick longing for a quarrel with some one whats the use of flaring up like that i didnt meanim sorry if i there you go why cant you swear straight out instead of mumbling i cant hear what you say i beg your pardon dick shut up and get on with your work and dont make such a noise after that the wretched aspinall hardly dared dip his pen in the ink or turn over a page for fear of disturbing his badger companion it was a relief when presently cresswell entered and gave him a chance of escape well youngster said the senior when he and dick were left alone im glad you had the sense to turn up at the levee im sorry i did said dick shortly cresswell knew his man too well to be taken aback by the contradiction yes is the den going to lick you for it id like to see them try said dick half viciously so would i said the senior laughing mansfield will be trying to make out ive promised to back him up said dick cresswell laughed by jove he will be cut up when he finds you arent hell resign dick coloured up and looked a little foolish i didnt mean that he said no very dreadful thing if you did back him up eh said the monitor casually it might disgust some of your friends in the den but you arent obliged to toady to them rather not said dick besides a fellow may sometimes do whats right and not be an utter cad perhaps you dont think so though youd cut a nobler figure wouldnt you dragging down your chums from one row to another than by anything so paltry as doing right because it is right i quite understand that feeling why do you talk to me like that said dick feeling a sting in every word of the seniors speech you think i went to the levee to please myself i didnt and is that why you are sorry you went dont make yourself out worse than you are dick youve done a plucky thing for once in a way and got yourself into a row with the den and i really dont see that you have very much to reproach yourself with i dont care a farthing for the den said dick but you do for yourself if i were you i wouldnt let myself be floored by one reverse stick to your man and youll get him out of the hands of the philistines after all this little talk did dick good and cleared his mind it put things in a new light it recalled the ghosts letter and brought up in array once more the better resolutions that appeal had awakened what was the use of his setting up as an example to his friends when he was little better than a rowdy himself yes dick richardson must be looked to how and by whom dominat qui in se dominatur said dick to himself as he went off to bed and closed a very uncomfortable and critical day when he went to call cresswell next morning he found him already up and dressed ah youngster before you today have you forgotten its a holiday so it is said dick who in his troubles had actually overlooked the fact what do you say to coming with freckleton and me for a days fishing in the bay winter has given us leave if we keep inside the sprit rock and i expect hed let you come if i asked him id like it frightfully said dick glowing with pleasure at the invitation all right set to work with the sandwiches make as many as the potted meat will allow and get the matron to boil halfadozen eggs hard ill see winter after chapel about you and if its all square well start directly after breakfast dick went into raptures over the making of those sandwiches fishing was one of his great weaknesses and a day of it in such lovely weather as this and in such distinguished company was a treat out of the ordinary the one drawback was that neither heathcote nor coote was in it that however could not be helped and he decided that under the circumstances it would be kindest not to tell them about it or raise their regrets after chapel he made straight for cresswells study and waited with some anxiety the result of his seniors application to the head master in due time cresswell returned all serene said he he didnt much fancy it i think but i undertook to be responsible for you it occurred to dick that he didnt see why he couldnt be responsible for himself but he was too anxious not to mar the expedition to raise any protest on behalf of his own independence take this can said cresswell and go down as quick as you can to greens next door to the dolphin and tell him to fill it with worms for me and bring them down to the beach were going to have tugs boat and well be there in halfanhour so look alive dick rather thankful to be able to get off unobserved hurried off on his savoury errand he had scarcely once gone down town since the affair of tom whites boat and certainly not since the alarming paragraphs in the observer had taken to appearing but he comforted himself with the reflection that tom was at present on the high seas and that no one else appeared to have any suspicion which would connect him dick with the mysterious lad who had been seen on the strand on the eventful night last june for all that he dawdled not a moment longer than he could help green had the worms ready so youre going for a days sport are you said he its a good day too and the whiting ought to be plentiful off the rock i hope they will said dick theyve been let alone the last week or two said the bait merchant since our chaps have been out in the deep so youve a fair chance when will the boats be back asked dick rather nervously we should have seen some of them this morning but the winds dropped maybe it will be afternoon before they come in its always a great day when they come in isnt it asked the boy depends on the catch when its a bad catch no one cares to see them back dick tried hard to keep down his next question but it had a sort of fascination for him and he could not smother it i suppose said he in the most careless tones he could assume tom whites not likely to come back in a hurry green laughed he was no friend of the doubledealing mariner not if he knows whos agoing to be down on the beach to welcome him but bless you hows he to know the sooner he comes home and gets his right lodgings the better so say i what do you say young squire the young squire did not exactly know what to say and took up his can of worms to depart with something like precipitation he found cresswell and freckleton waiting for him down at the boat until this moment he had never seen the templeton hermit except occasionally at a distance and he glanced with some curiosity at the face of the fellow who had beaten pledge for the bishops scholarship he didnt altogether dislike him the stolid face and bright black eyes of the hermit made him a little uncomfortable but there was an occasional twitch at the corners of his mouth and a music when he chose to use it in his voice which reconciled the junior to his presence and even interested him in the disposal of his new patrons good graces it didnt take long to get all aboard the precious worms were safely deposited in the hold the three lines were stowed away under the seat and the basket containing the sandwiches and hardboiled eggs added ballast to the bows cresswell who had an idea of doing things comfortably had brought his ulster and made freckleton bring his the latter had armed himself also with a shakespeare in case the fish didnt bite and three towels knowingly produced by the whipperin added a further pleasant suggestion for whiling away a dull halfhour the calmness of the day and the absence of any sign of wind induced the party to vote the mast and sails a useless encumbrance and they were accordingly left ashore and a spare pair of oars taken in their place the irony of fate left it to dicks lot to see the anchor was in proper trim and firmly secureda task which he discharged with almost vicious solemnity what time does the tide turn joe asked cresswell of the boatman as they ran the boat down to the water halfpast two about mister yerll need to bring her in close ashore and give the fiddlesand a wide berth while the tide flows all right shove her off joe they had a glorious day the sea had scarcely a ripple and the sky scarcely a cloud the fish seemed to vie with one another in falling upon the bait the view of templeton from the sea was perfect and the sharp outline of the sprit rock above them was grandeur itself dick as he lolled over the side of the boat slowly hauling up his line and speculating whether he had got two fish on each hook or only one felt supremely at peace with himself and all the world the sandwiches had been delicious cresswell and freckleton had treated him like a lord the pile of fish on the floor of the boat was worthy of a professional crew the light breeze was just enough to keep the sun in his place and the sofa he had made for himself with freckletons ulster in the bows was like a feather bed dick loved the world and everything in it and when cresswell said walk into those sandwiches young un he really thought life the sweetest task in which mortal can engage cresswell and freckleton were scarcely more proof against the luxury of the morning they chatted in a sort of sleepy undertone as if they knew all nature was taking a nap and didnt want to be disturbed how did you think old jupiter got through levee asked cresswell well for those who wish him well said the hermit ah hes an uphill job before him and i fancy he knows it if he ever is down in the mouth i think he was so last night after it was all over i thought so too said freckleton that is i shouldnt call it down in the mouth he had headache thats about the same thing hes staked high no one else would have dared to challenge the whole school in the way he did said cresswell dropping his voice but still in the quiet air not quite beyond dicks hearing it answered it brought the right fellows to the front and shut the wrong fellows hopelessly out i hope not many of them are only fools they think its plucky to defy the powers that be and quite forget its pluckier to defy themselves thats a neat way of putting it old man theres a big bite this time said the hermit so there wasthree fish on two hooks and it was some time before the diversion was disposed of its a pity every one cant be made to see hes his own worst enemy it would simplify matters awfully if a youngster got it into his head that it wanted more pluck to go against himself than all the templeton rules put together we should get some surprises no chance of that im afraid while there are fellows like pledge who make it a business to drag youngsters down you may say so i should say theres not a youngster in templeton in greater peril at this moment than pledges fag and the worst of it is there is no one to help him dick suddenly felt his sofa uncomfortable the boards underneath cramped him the sun too for some reason or other became too hot and the breeze fidgeted him the last sandwich he had eaten had had too much mustard in it he was getting fagged of fishing although the talk of the two seniors had not been intended for his ears it had been impossible for him to avoid overhearing it even if he had tried which he had not and the hermits last words had stung him to the quick and spoilt his enjoyment whats the matter youngster asked cresswell getting seasick no replied dick trying to compose himself what do you say to a header dick was stripped in half a minute anything for a change and what change more delightful than a plunge in the lovely green sea the seniors smiled at his hurry as they proceeded in a more leisurely fashion to follow his example dont wait for us over you go said cresswell and tell old neptune we are coming dick waited for no further invitation and sprang from the gunwale they watched the spreading circles that tracked his dive and marked the white shining streak as it darted past under the water hell be a shark before long said cresswell look at the distance hes dived he has to thank the tide for part of this though said freckleton looking at his watch why its an exclamation from cresswell stopped him dick had reappeared but he was twenty yards at least astern of the boat and drifting back every moment at first he did not seem to be aware of it but treading water waved one hand exultantly to celebrate his long dive but when he began to swim leisurely at first but harder presently he suddenly realised his position and saw that instead of making way back to the boat he was losing distance at every stroke some of my readers may have been in a similar position and know the horror of helplessness which for a moment comes over the swimmer at such a time dick was not given to panic still less fear but for all that the minute which ensued was one of the most terrible in his life at certain times of the tide the current between the sprit rock and the long fiddlesandbank rushed like a millrace the boys knew this they had been reminded of it at starting but the morning had passed so quickly that until dick had taken his header and they saw him swept astern it had never occurred to one of them that it could possibly be three oclock freckleton was the first to see the danger and almost as soon as dick appeared above water he flung off his coat and boots and saying to cresswell come quick with the boat plunged into the water he was soon at dicks side not to support him for the boy was able to do that for himself but to encourage him to keep cool and not waste his strength in endeavouring to stem the tide and dick had sense enough to take the advice and tread water quietly till the boat should come it seemed a long time coming the anchor was fast in the bottom and it wanted all cresswells strength to get it up indeed he would have been tempted to simplify matters by cutting the cord had he had a knife at hand by the time it was free the boys were almost a quarter of a mile away and getting weary but once free their suspense was not prolonged cresswell bore quickly down upon them and picked them up and rarely did three friends breathe more freely than when they all stood once more on the floor of their boat there was no speechmaking or wringing of hands no bragging no compliments they knew one another too well for that and dressed in silence much as if the adventure had been an ordinary incident of an ordinary bathe it strikes me said cresswell who still had the oars out it will take us all our time to get back are you ready to take an oar old man short as the time had beenindeed the whole incident had not occupied much more than five minutesthe boat was about a mile below her old moorings and still in the rush of the current it was little the two rowers could do to keep her head up much less to make any way and finally it became clear that if they were to get back to templeton at all that day they must either anchor where they were for six hours with the risk of their rope not holding in the race or else let the current take them out to the open and then make a long row back outside the sprit and clear of the fiddle bank they decided on the latter and somewhat gloomily rested on their oars and watched the backward sweep of the boat on the tide seaward the square tower of templeton had become a mere speck on the coastline before they felt the tide under them relax and knew they were out of the race then they manned their oars and began their long pull home fortunately the water still remained quiet and the breeze did not freshen but after about a mile had been made and the sprit rock seemed only midway between them and the shore a peril still more serious overtook them the sky became overcast and a sea mist springing from nowhere came down on the breeze blotting out first the horizon then the rock and finally the coast and leaving them virtually blindfolded in midocean we may as well anchor and wait till it clears said cresswell i think we might go on slowly said freckleton if we keep the breeze on our left and dick looks sharp out in front we are bound to come either on the sprit or the shore try it for a bit so they tried rowing gingerly and steering by the breeze on their cheeks while dick ahead strained his eyes into the soaking mist they may have made another mile and still the mist wrapped them round they had no idea where they were they might be close to the rock or they might have drifted down the coast or they might be coming on to the race again still anything seemed better than lying idle and they paddled steadily on hoping against hope for a single glimpse of daylight through the veil suddenly dick held his hand above his head and shouted easy hold hard and they could just see a dark object ahead on the water it couldnt be the rock for it was too small and they could hardly imagine it to be part of the pier or a boat on the beach they shouted and in a moment an answer came ahoy there and they knew they had come upon a fishingboat at anchor its one of the fleet waiting to get in wed better go alongside and wait with them said freckleton so dick shouted to say they were coming and they rowed carefully alongside the first sight that met dicks astonished eyes as he reached across to seize the gunwale of the friendly boat was tom white sitting comfortably smoking in the stern good day young gentlemen said that worthy cant keep away from us cant yer hullo tom weve lost our way in the mist said cresswell where are we reckon youre in the bay and a swim to the pierhead so near we made sure we were outside the sprit how long have you been here come here when the tide turned we did said tom with a boat full and no mistake say young gentlemen you aint forgot the poor mariner that lost his boat have yer its cruel hard to lose your living and have to begin afresh if you mean you want a shilling for piloting us ashore said cresswell here you are will you take us or will your mate dick grew uncomfortable and under pretence of wanting to examine some of the fish on the floor of the lugger he scrambled up the side and got in come back dick do you hear called cresswell we must go back if one of those fellows will run us in will you come tom visions of the barparlour of the dolphin hovered before toms mind as he looked down at the speaker and the shilling that lay in his hand he was just about to consent when he felt his arm nudged by dick who was crouching down over the fish at his feet tom white said the boy looking up nervously dont go ashore they are going to arrest you for pawning that boat that didnt belong to you tell your mate to see us ashore theres another shilling for you tom took his pipe out of his mouth and gaped at the boy then he slowly pocketed the shilling then he relieved himself of an oath then he called his mate jerry see the squires ashore with fluttering heart dick scrambled back into the boat followed by the hulking jerry who in a very few minutes ran them comfortably on to the beach and made an end of all their perils for that day they reached templeton just in time for call over and no one knew as they walked into chapel that evening through what adventures they had passed since they left templeton in the morning early next morning dick could not resist the temptation of going down to call on mr green well did the boats all come in he inquired all bar tom whites and they do say it will be long enough before any one sees him in these parts again hes got wind somehow its wonderful the way news travels on waterso it is chapter nineteen in which heathcote mounts high and falls low george heathcote celebrated the early hours of his holiday by sleeping in until the boom of the chapel bell shot him headlong out of bed into his garments coote who had not yet mastered the art of venturing into chapel alone grew more and more pale as the hand of the clock crawled on and the desperate alternative loomed before him either of sharing his unpunctual friends fate or else of facing the exploit of walking unaided into his stall in the presence of gazing templeton he had almost made up his heroic mind to the latter course when a sound as of coals being shot into a cellar broke the stillness of the morning air and next moment heathcote descended the stairs at the rate of five steps a second come on you idiot put it on he cried as he reached coote and swept him forward towards the chapel it was a close shave swinstead was shutting the door as heathcote got his first foot in and but that the usher was unprepared for the desperate assault of the two juniors and lost a second in looking to see what was the matter coote would have scored his first bad mark and heathcotes name would have figured for the fifth or sixth time that term on the monitors black list as the latter young gentleman had nothing but his trousers slippers and coat on over his nightshirt he deemed it prudent to bolt as soon as chapel was over so as to elude the vigilant eyes of the authorities he therefore saw nothing of dick as he came out and dick as we have seen had too much on hand just then to see him at length however when the toilet was complete and the glorious liberty from lessons began to swell our heroes breasts heathcotes thoughts turned to dick wheres old dick said he to coote did you see him at breakfast yes he was at the other table but i didnt see where he went afterwards heathcote didnt like it dick had done him a bad turn yesterday over that levee business and the least he could have done today would have been to find him out and make things jolly again but instead of that he had vanished and left it to heathcote to find him out go and see where he is said he to coote the meek coote obeyed and took a cursory trot round the school fields in search of his leader no dick was there and no one had seen him heathcotes face grew longer as he heard the report it was getting serious dick was not only illtreating him he was cutting him he went off to cresswells study as a last chance the study was empty and even the caps were gone from the pegs base desertion as he left the study he met pledge ah youngster going to grind all today i was looking for dick oh david looking for jonathan poor chap johnny has given you the slip this time where has he gone asked heathcote trying to appear indifferent the saintly youth has gone for a days fishing in the bay with the dearlybeloved cresswell and the reverend freckleton they have got him an exeat from the doctor they have bought him lines and bait they have filled his pockets with good things so you see piety pays after all georgie what a pity you are not pious too you wouldnt be left so lonely if you were heathcote was too hard hit to reply and pledge was kind enough not to attempt any further consolation it had been coming to this for weeks past georgie had refused to believe it as long as he could he had stuck to his chum and borne all the rebuffs which had rewarded him patiently he had even made excuses for dick and tried to think that their friendship was as strong as ever but now he saw that all the time dick had been falling away and cutting himself adrift this was why he left the select sociables the moment heathcote joined them this was why he went to the levee as soon as he saw heathcote was not going and this was why he had hidden out of the way this morning for fear heathcote should find out where he was going and want to come too georgie laughed bitterly to himself as he made the discovery as if he cared for fishing or boating or sandwiches as if he cared about being cooped up in a tarry boat the livelong day with a couple of such fellows as cresswell and freckleton as if he couldnt enjoy himself alone or with cootepoor young coote who had come to templeton believing dick to be his friend whereas dick in his eagerness to toady to the saints would let him go to the dogs if it wasnt that he heathcote was there to befriend him so heathcote went forth defiant with coote at his heels resolved to let templeton see he could enjoy himself without dick he laughed extravagantly at nothing he feigned to delight himself in the company of every idler he came across he scorned loudly such stupid sport as fishing or tennis or fives he meant to make his mark and then dick when he came back would gnash his teeth with envy and wish woe to the hour when he was fool enough to desert his noblest friend tell you whatll be a lark coote said heathcote as the two strode on arm in arm followed by a small crowd of juniors who seeing they were on the swagger hoped to be in the sport as spectators tell you what well have a walk round the roofs i know where we can get up we can get nearly all round the quad wont it be a spree coote looked as delighted as he could and said he hoped they wouldnt be caught or there might be a row bless you no ones about today come on nobodys done it since fitch fell off a year ago and he only got half round coote was inwardly most reluctant to deprive the late master fitch of his hardearned laurels and even hinted as much but heathcote was in no humour for paltering he was playing a high game and coote must play too so they gave their followers the slip and dodged their way back to the quad and made for the first staircase next to the great gate up here they crept hurriedly and stealthily one or two boys met them on the way but georgie swaggered past them as though bound to pay an ordinary morning call on some occupant of the top floor the top floor of all was dedicated to the use of the maids who at that hour of the day were too much occupied elsewhere in making beds and filling jugs to be at all inconvenient heathcote who considering he had never made the expedition before was wonderfully well up in the geography of the place piloted coote up a sort of ladder which ended in a trapdoor in the ceiling of the garret i know its up here he said raggles told me it was the way fitch got up oh said coote hanging tight on to the ladder with both arms and trusting that whichever way they ascended they might select a different mode of descent from that adopted by the unfortunate fitch horrors the trapdoor was padlocked joy the padlock was not locked they opened the flap and scrambled into a cavernous space between the ceiling and the roof from which to cootes relief there seemed no exit except by the door at which they entered heathcote however was not to be put off and scrambled round the place on his hands and knees in search of the hole in the roof which he knew on raggles authority was there it was there at the very end of the gable a little manhole just big enough to let a small body through to clear the gutter and no more hurrah old man shouted heathcote in a whisper to his follower who still lingered at the trapdoor ive got it shut that door down and crawl over here mind you keep on the rafters or youll drop through hurrah said coote pensively as he proceeded to obey in two minutes they were out upon the roof and enjoying a wonderful birdseye view of templeton and the coast beyond a moderately broad gutter ran round the roof on the inside of the quadrangle with a low stone parapet at the edge along this the two boys crawled slowly and cautiously until they had reached about the middle of their side of the quadrangle it was dizzy work looking down from their eminence but glorious even coote now the venture had been made and no relics of the late master fitch had appeared began to enjoy himself what a pity dick isnt here said he rather wont he look blue when he hears of it said heathcote hullo there are some of the fellows in the quad theres pauncefote isnt it i vote we yell perhaps somebody would hear hadnt we better chuck a stone heathcote detached a piece of plaster from the gutter and pitched it neatly down within an inch of the head of the unsuspecting pauncefote that hero started and looked first at the stone then at the sky finally his eyes met georgies triumphant face beaming over the parapet side by side with the rosy countenance of coote it was enough in another two minutes the den knew what was going on and georgie and coote were the heroes of the hour moved by a desire to afford their spectators an entertainment worthy of their applause they proceeded to make the round of the quadrangle at a smart though not always steady pace for their attention was so much divided between the gutter before them and the upturned faces below them that they were once or twice decidedly close on the heels of the luckless fitch once when they came to a comparatively broad landing they varied the entertainment by swarming a little way up the tiles and sliding gracefully down again regardless of tailors bills and when the spectators got tired of that they treated them to a little horseplay by pelting them with bits of plaster and finally with cootes hat even the highest class of entertainment cannot thrill for ever and after a quarter of an hour of this edifying exhibition the den found they had had enough of it and began to saunter off much to the amazement of the two performers may as well cut down said heathcote when at length the quad was deserted and nothing seemed likely to be gained by remaining coote was quite ready to obey he had enjoyed his outing pretty well but was rather tired of standing with one foot in front of the other and keeping his eyes on georgie he was nearest to the trapdoor and had already crouched through it when heathcote perceiving that one of the den had come back for another look decided in the kindness of his heart to take one last turn round before retiring he had accomplished half his journey and was glancing down rather anxiously to see if the boy was enjoying it when a secondfloor window on the opposite side suddenly opened and mansfield looked out this apparition nearly sent georgie headlong over the parapet he saved himself by dropping on his hands and knees he wasnt sure whether the captain had seen him or not if he had he was in for it if he had not why on earth did he stand there at the window georgies performance ended in a humiliating wriggle back along the gutter to the trapdoor he dared not show so much as his whisker above the parapet and as the parapet was only high enough to conceal him as he lay full length on his face the return journey was both painful and tedious at last he reached the door where the faithful coote anxiously awaited him wondering what had kept him and not sure whether the peculiar manner in which he advanced to the door was to be regarded as a joke or a feat of agility as heathcote did not gratify his curiosity on this point he received the hero with a smile of mingled humour and admiration and then followed him in his precipitate descent to the lower world at the bottom of the staircase duffield was comfortably lounging hullo kids he said youve got down then what a mess youre in mansfield wants you heathcote and the messenger departed whistling a cheery tune and dribbling cootes cap after the straightest rules of the association across the quad before him heathcotes face lengthened this was the triumphal reception which was to greet him on his return to earth the mention of which was to set dicks teeth gnashing he walked sulkily to mansfields study and knew his fate almost before he entered the room the captain was stern and cutting he wasted few words in inquiry still fewer in expostulation youre one of the boys its no use talking to he said almost scornfully youll be glad to hear im not going to talk to you im going to thrash you and that beautiful holiday morning george heathcote was thrashed in a manner which hurt and startled him he fled from the captains presence sore both in body and mind but strange to say his chief wrath was reserved not for the captain but for dick his mind once poisoned contrived to connect dick with every calamity that came upon him and it enraged him to think that at this moment while he was smarting under the penalty of a straightforward honest breach of rules inflicted by a senior whose chief quarrel with him was that he had had the pluck to stay away from levee dick was reaping the benefit of his toadyism and basking in the sunshine of the powers that were pledge as might be expected did nothing to discourage this feeling he was not a bit surprised he had expected it and he knew equally well it was but the beginning of a settled programme heathcote had better not keep up the contest he had better knuckle under at once as dick had done and enjoy a quiet time or if he must break rules let him remember that fellows could lie and cheat and sneak in templeton and never once be interfered with by the holy monitors but when once they took to walking on the roofswhy where could they expect to go to when they descended to such a depth of wickedness as that heathcote spend a miserable afternoon letting his misfortune and pledges words rankle in his breast till he hated the very name of dick and goodness in due time the three fishers returned that evening tired with their hard days work and bronzed with the sun and breeze dick looked serious and anxious as he followed his seniors into the quadrangle carrying the ulsters and the empty luncheon basket ah thought heathcote as he watched him from a retired nook hes ashamed of himself he well may be the two seniors turned in at westovers door leaving dick to continue his walk alone now was heathcotes time emerging from his corner he put his hands carelessly in his pockets and advanced to meet his former friend whistling a jaunty tune he was half afraid dick might not see him but dick had a quick eye for a friend and hailed him half across the quadrangle hullo georgie old man said he running up so awfully sorry you couldnt come on our spree too whats the matter what indeed georgie with an elaborate air of unconsciousness either of the voice or the presence of his comrade walked on looking straight in front of him and whistling more jauntily than ever dick stood for a moment aghast he would fain have believed his chum had either not seen him or was joking but a sinking at his heart told him otherwise and a rush of anger told him that whatever the reason might be it was an unjust one so he checked his inclination to pursue his friend and demand an explanation there and then and strolled on whistling himself heathcote pursued his dignified walk until he concluded he might safely stop whistling and venture to peep round when he did so he was dismayed to see dick walking arm in arm across the quadrangle with coote laughing at some narration which that pliable young gentleman was giving poor georgie this was the hardest blow of all if dick had appeared crushed if he had even looked hurt or said one word of regret georgies heart would have been comforted and his wrath abated but to have his elaborate demonstration of rebuke ignored and quietly passed by in favour of coote was too much georgie could not bear it pledge and all pledges sophistry vanished in a moment with the loss of his friend if dick would only give him another chance chapter twenty how coote comes out as a suspicious character it would have been well for heathcote if he had acted on the impulse of the moment and made it up with dick that same evening dick had come back from his boating expedition better disposed towards his lieutenant than he had been for a long time he had come determined to befriend him and rescue him from his enemies and set him up upon his feet he had come reproaching himself with his former neglect and convinced that georgies fate was in his hands for good or evil and that being so he had determined to make a good job of his friend and turn him out a credit to templeton but in all this modest programme it had never occurred to him that georgie would be anything but delighted to be taken in hand and made a good job of therefore when in the fulness of his benevolence he had found his friend out immediately on his return and been repulsed for his pains dick felt gravelled all his nice little plan of campaign fell through it was no use routing the den and putting pledge and the sociables to shame when georgie wouldnt be made a good job of and so dick with some dismay and considerable loss to his selfconceit had to order a retreat and consider whether the war was worth going on with under the circumstances he therefore did not meet heathcote halfway and curled himself up into bed sorely perplexed sorely crestfallen and sorely out of love with the world at large no news spreads so fast as the news of a quarrel and before school was well launched next morning the noise of a row between dick and heathcote ran through templeton from end to end the den heard it and hoped there would be a fight the select sociables heard it and voted it a good job the fourth and fifth heard it and said young idiots the sixth heard it and shook their heads pledge however regarded the matter with complacency so its a row is it said he as his protege wandered disconsolately into his study after morning school pistols for two coffee for four and all that sort of thing eh he cuts me dead said heathcote and you break your heart of course you do i knew you couldnt get on without him i dont break my heart at all said heathcote savagely no you look as if you were going to hang yourself how glad hell be to see dear georgie sorrowing for his sins if youll take my advice youll go out next time you see him and lie down at his feet and ask him kindly to tread upon you im not going to bother about him said heathcote miserably if he wants to make up hell have to come and ask me himself and of course youll fall on his neck and weep and say oh yes i loved you always very pretty seriously youngsterdont make a donkey of yourself as long as it pays him to cut you he will cut you and when it pays him better to be friends hell want to be friends dont make yourself too cheap youre better than a dirty halfpenny to be played pitch and toss with these words sank deep in the boys disturbed mind and drove away any lingering desire for an immediate reconciliation day after day the two old chums met and cut one another dead and the spectacle of the split became a part of everyday life at templeton at the end of a week fellows almost forgot that david and jonathan had ever been on speaking terms then an unlookedfor incident caused a diversion and upset the calculations of everybody coote had of all interested parties least relished the fallingout of his two old comrades it had not only pained him as a friend but personally it had caused him the greatest discomfort for he found himself in the position of an animated buffer between the two when heathcote wanted to show off to dick that he was not breaking his heart on his account he got possession of coote and lavished untoward affection on that tender youth and when dick wanted to exhibit to heathcote that he was not pining in solitude for want of an adherent he attached coote to his person and treated him like his own brother and coote when heathcote had him was all for heathcote and eloquent on the abominable sins of piety and inconstancy and when he was with dick he was all for dick and discoursed no less eloquently on the wickedness of deceit and poorness of spirit sometimes his bad memory and the quick transitions of allegiance through which he was called upon to pass made him forget his role and condole with dick on heathcotes piety or with heathcote on dicks poverty of spirit and sometimes when in the company of the one he happened to meet the other he quite lost his head and made an ass of himself to both this course of double dissimulation at the end of a week began to lose its charms and coote with all his good nature and desire to make things pleasant for everybody began to get tired of his two friends and long for a breath of freedom so he took an early morning stroll along the cliffs one morning finishing up with mr websters shop in the high street the gossiping templeton stationer had suffered somewhat in temper since the reader saw him last three months ago the young gentry for whom he catered were not the apples of his eyes they had been not that he was at open war with them but he had a grievance he didnt complain of the liberties they sometimes took with his shop making it a general house of call and discussion forum that was good for trade and mr webster didnt object to anything that was good for trade nor did the occasional horseplay and even fighting that took place on his premises now and then sour his milk of human kindness more than was natural but when it came to abusing not himself but his goods with the result that a good many of the latter in the course of a term came to be damaged and some he had reason to suppose pilfered then mr webster thought it time to make a stand and assert himself he was therefore more brusque and less obsequious to the junior portion of templeton this term than he had been last so when coote in the artlessness of his nature feigned an earnest desire to know the price of an elegant ormolu inkpot and modestly inquired it the tradesman eyed him sharply and replied ten shillings do you want to buy it coote was one of those individuals who cannot say no to a shopman though nothing was further from his mind than putting his sadly reduced pocketmoney into an ormolu inkpot his tender heart could not bear to dash the stationers hopes too rudely he said he couldnt quite make up his mind and would just look round if he might mr webster had got tired of the young templeton gentlemen looking round he knew what it meant generally the springs of all his inkpots got critically tested pencils got twisted in and out till they refused to twist again desks got ransacked and their contents mixed in glorious and hopeless confusion photographs got thumbed books got dog eared and the sole profit to the honest merchant was the healthy exercise of putting everything tidy after his visitors had left and the satisfaction of expressing his feelings in language strictly selected from the dictionary he was therefore by no means elated at cootes proposal and might have vetoed it had not an important customer in the shape of the rev mr westworth the curate entered at that moment and diverted his attention but even the reverend gentlemans conversation was unable entirely to engross the honest bookseller who kept a restless corner of one eye on the boys movements while with the rest of his features he smiled deferentially at his customer coote meanwhile unaware of the suspicion with which he was being regarded enjoyed a pleasant five minutes in turning mr websters stock of writing materials inside out being of a susceptible nature he fell in love with a great many things in the course of his investigations and the ormolu inkpot was several times eclipsed what took his fancy most was a pretty chased silver penholder and pencil which shut up into the compass of a datestone and yet when open was large and firm enough to write out the whole of virgil at a sitting whatever else he looked at he always came back to this treasure and finally when he became aware that mr westworth was about to depart he had almost to push it from him in order to bring himself to the pitch of leaving too he had no desire further to lacerate mr websters feelings by declining to purchase anything and therefore quitted the shop hurriedly not noticing as he did so that the unlucky little pencil which he had put down with such affectionate reluctance had shown its regret by rolling quietly and sadly off the tray on to the counter till it reached a gap halfway into which it plunged suicidally and became lost to the light of day mr webster who had seen as little of the catastrophe as the boy had bowed his reverend guest out and then turned to the disordered tray with a shrug of his shoulders his review of its contents had not lasted half a minute when he started and uttered an exclamation the pencil was goneso was coote for once there was no shadow of a doubt in the honest stationers mind it was as clear as daylight no one else had been in the shop except the curate who had never been near the tray coote had he had touched and fingered all its contents he had had this very pencil in his hand he had quitted the shop abruptly and started running as soon as he got outside mr webster did know what two and two made and it was quite a relief to him to feel absolutely and positively certain he had been robbed by a templeton boy his one difficulty was that he did not remember having seen coote before nor did he know his name however he would find him if he had the whole school marched one by one in front of him and when he had found him he would make an example of him blissfully unconscious of the cloud on the horizon coote had arrived at the school just in time for chapel on his way out heathcote came up and took his arm well old fellow said that youth in a loud voice which made it perfectly clear to coote that dick must be somewhere within hearing come and have another jolly twohander after school wont you you and i ought to be able to lick raggles and culver into fits now oughtnt we its a wonder to me said dick walking off in another direction with aspinall how raggles and culver play tennis at all any fool could lick them lefthanded aspinall knew better than to dispute the assertion and submitted to be taken down to the courts after morning school by dick where in full view of heathcote and coote the two played an exciting match in which of course dick came off victorious for the simple reason that aspinall had not the moral courage to beat him towards the end of the game cresswell and cartwright walked up with their rackets finding all the courts occupied cresswell said to dick you two may as well make up a four with heathcote and coote we want one of the courts dick was delighted to give up the court but he was far too fagged to play any more so was aspinall wasnt he besides they neither of them cared about fourhanders heathcote and coote for their part were far too absorbed in their game to heed cresswells suggestion they were playing best out of fifteen sets georgie announced and had just finished the third which being known the spectators fell away from that part of the field rapidly the two oclock bell sounded before the fifth set was over rather to cootes relief who had been getting just tennis enough during the last week the two champions were walking back lovingly to the school when as they approached the quad gate heathcote said hallo theres webster whats he hanging about for there perhaps you owe him a bill said coote not i ive jacked webster up hes a surly beast i was in his shop this morning said coote there was such a stunning little shutup penholder about so big i cant fancy how they make them shut up so small did you buy it no i couldnt afford it hallo what does he want hes beckoning jolly cheek of him said heathcote if he wants you let him come i wouldnt go to him if i were you call out and ask him what he wants whereupon coote called out what do you want i want you said the bookseller approaching tell him youre busy and hed better come again im busy i say cried coote come again no thank you said mr webster stepping before the boys ah good day to you mr heathcote quite a stranger sir if youll allow me i would like a word with your friend you know youll get in a row webster if youre seen up here said heathcote all the shop fellows have to stop at the gate having delivered which piece of friendly caution georgie walked on leaving coote and the bookseller teteatete what do you want asked coote come none of your tricks with me young fellow i want that pencil case there pencilcase what pencilcase ive not got any pencilcase said coote mr webster had expected this he would have been a trifle disappointed had the criminal pleaded guilty at once do you suppose i didnt see you with it in your hand in my shop sir this morning said he but i didnt take iti havent got iti wouldnt do such a thing said coote beginning to feel very uncomfortable youd like me to suppose that some one else took it wouldnt you said mr webster feeling so sure of his ground as quite to enjoy himself if youve lost it somebody else did i didnt said the boy now look here young gentleman that sort of thing may go down at home or here in school but its no use trying it on with me if you dont choose to give me that pencil this moment well see what a policeman can do at this threat coote turned pale really i never took it you may feel in my pockets oh please dont bring a policeman mr webster whats your name demanded mr webster ostentatiously producing a pencil and paper cootearthur dennis coote said the trembling boy address one richmond villas richmond road g very well mr coote said the stationer folding up the paper and putting it into his pocketbook unless you call on me before this time tomorrow with the pencil ill have you locked up good morning coote with his heart in his shoes watched the retreating figure till it was lost to view and then turned bewildered and scared to the school heathcote was waiting for him at the door well what did the cad wantwhats the row i say he demanded catching sight of the dazed face of his chum oh georgie a most frightful row gasped coote he says ive stolen a pencil what the one you were talking about yes the very one i suppose you havent really asked heathcote with no false delicacy no really i haventthat is if i have i look here do hunt my pockets will you old man georgie obeyed and every pocket of the unhappy coote was successively explored without bringing to light the missing pencil there said the suspect with a sigh of relief when the operation was over i was positive i hadnt got it he says i was the only one in the shop and that he missed it as soon as i had gone but really and truly i didnt take it i never did such a thing in my life of course you didnt hes a cad and has got a spite against us thats what it is whats he going to do he says unless i take it to him by this time tomorrow hell send a policeman to take me up and the unhappy youths voice choked with the words heathcote gave a long dismal whistle whatever will you do he asked in tones of deep concern how can i take it back asked coote if i hadnt got it i wish to goodness i had got it youll have to square him somehow said georgie youre positive it hasnt dropped into your shoes or anywhere by accident the bare suggestion sent coote up to the dormitory where he undressed and shook out each article of his toilet in the hope of discovering the lost treasure alas high or low there was no sign of it he spent a terrible afternoon wondering where he should be that time tomorrow or whether possibly mr webster would alter his mind and send a policeman up forthwith he was in no humour for tennis or a row in the den or a sociable concert after school and avoided them all and to add to his troubles heathcote was detained two hours for some offence so that he was deprived for an equal length of time of the consolation of that heros sympathy and advice he spent the interval dismally in a retired corner of the field where he hoped to be able to collect his shattered wits in peace but it was no good he could see no way through it oh thought he for the hundredth time how i wish i had really taken it he had just arrived at this conclusion when a light step approaching caused him to look up and see dick hullo old man said the latter how jolly blue you look whats the row coote repeated his dismal story and marked the dismay which crept over his leaders face as he told it by jove old man said dick its a mess how ever are you to get out thats just what i dont know groaned coote if i only had the pencil it would be all right but really and truly dick i never took it did i all serene said dick but i say if you cant give him the pencil back perhaps you can pay him for it it cost thirty shillings and ive only got sevenandsix ive got ten shillings said dick thats seventeenandsix perhaps if we gave him that hed wait for the rest youre an awful brick said poor coote gratefully if it hadnt been for you and georgie i dont know what i should have done dick started and coloured is he in it does he know about it he asked yes dick said coote feeling rather in a hobble ithought you know id better tell him what did he say oh not much that is he said hed help me if he could buti dont see how he can he might be able to lend you enough to make up the price said dick after a pause i know he would hes such a brickthat is added the wretched coote correcting himself youre both such bricks dick made no answer but walked off musing to himself both bricks and yet poor coote had to blush when he mentioned the name of one brick to the other dick was getting tired of this he retired to the school to think over what could be done and was about to ascend the stairs when the familiar form of georgie appeared coming to meet him georgie cootes in an awful mess i vote we back him up so do i rather old man and they went off arminarm to find him check to you pledge chapter twenty one how our heroes fall out of the fryingpan into the fire templeton opened its eyes as it saw david and jonathan walking together across the fields that afternoon the den with native quickness of perception instantly snuffed a battle in the air and dogged the heels of the champions with partisan shouts and cheers dick will finish him in a round and a half shouted raggles dont you be too cocksure cried gosse georgies got a neat squarefender on him and i rather fancy him best myself gosse had not the ghost of a notion what a squarefender was nor had anyone else but the word carried weight and there was a run on georgie accordingly raggles however was not to be snuffed out too easily bah shouted he whats the use of a squarefender when dick can get down his postmans knock over the top and blink his man into fits after that georgie was nowhere a fellow who can blink his man with a postmans knock no matter what it means is worth halfadozen squarefenders and so dick became a favourite and the event was considered as good as settled which was just as well for our heroes as they walked in search of coote could not be so engrossed either in their newlyhealed alliance or in the affliction of their friend as to be unaware of the commotion at their heels and it was not till dick had ordered the foremost of the procession to hook it enforcing his precept by one or two impartiallydistributed samples of his postmans knock that it dawned on the den there was to be no fight after all whereupon they yapped off in disgust with their noses in the air in search of some better sport left to themselves our heroes with a strange mixture of joy and anxiety in their hearts broke into a trot and presently sighted coote that unhappy youth little dreaming of the revolution which his scrape was destined to effect in templeton was still sitting where dick had left him ruefully meditating on his near prospect of incarceration the vision of dick and heathcote advancing upon him by no means tended to allay the tumult of his feelings im in for it now groaned he to himself theyre both going to pitch into me for telling the other what a mule i was ever to come to templeton but dicks first words dispelled these gloomy forebodings effectually keep your pecker up old man georgie and i are both going to back you up well pull you through somehow ive got ten bob said georgie thats twentysevenandsix perhaps hell let you off the other halfcrown considering he had not abstracted the pencil at all coote inwardly thought mr webster might forego this small balance and be no loser and he halfhinted as much its an awful shame said he not to believe my word i really dont see why we ought to stump up at all but this proposal by no means suited his ardent backersup who looked upon the whole affair as providential and by no means to be burked bound to do it said dick decisively things look ugly against you you know and it would be a terrible business if you got locked up it would cost less to square webster then to bail you out wouldnt it georgie rather said georgie besides it looks awkward if it gets out that youve been to prisonour firm oughtnt to get mixed up in that sort of mess after this coote resigned all pretensions to the further direction of his own defence and left his case unreservedly in the hands of his two honest partners they decided that very evening with or without leave to go down with the twentysevenandsix to mr webster dick was the only one of the three who got leave but his two friends considered the crisis one of such urgency that even without leave they should brave all consequences and accompany him mr webster was in the act of putting up his shutters when the small careworn procession halted before his door and requested the favour of an interview the bookseller was in a good temper he had rather enjoyed the days adventure and reckoned that the moral effect of his action would be good besides the looks of the culprit and his two friends fully justified his suspicions they had doubtless come to restore the pencil and plead for mercy they should see that mercy was not kept in stock in his shop and would want some little trouble before it was to be procured so he bade his visitors step inside and state their business weve come about the pencil you know said dick adopting a conciliatory tone to begin with its really a mistake webster coote never took it no weve known coote for years and never knew him do such a thing said heathcote and theyve turned out every one of my pockets said coote and there was no sign of it mr webster smiled serenely very pretty young gentlemen very pretty when you have done joking perhaps youll give me what belongs to me hang it cried dick forgetting his suavity its no joke webster i tell you coote never took the thing you were here in the shop of course and saw him said the tradesman no i wasnt said dick you know that as well as i do coote said heathcote feeling it his turn to back upcootes a gentleman not a thief im glad to hear that said mr webster hes sure hes not both im positive said coote and is that all youve come to say said the bookseller no said dick its an awful shame if you cant believe us but if you wontwell wed sooner pay you for the pencil and have done with it mr webster was charmed he had always imagined himself a sharp man and he was sure of it now for a minute or two the boys joint protestations of innocence had staggered his belief in cootes guilt but this ingenuous offer convinced him he had been right after all oh you didnt steal it but youre going to pay for it are you very pretty what do you think it was worth thirty shillings said dick that was the price marked on it and yet you never saw it of course i didnt retorted dick beginning to feel hot ive told you so twicecoote saw it yes said coote there was a tiny label on it we cant make up quite thirty shillings said heathcote but weve got twentyseven shillings and sixpence i suppose youll make that do do you suppose ill make it do said mr webster beginning to feel hot too you think you can come to my shop and pilfer my things like so many young pickpockets and then you have the impudence to come and offer me part of the price to say nothing about it no thank you thats not my way of doing business theres nothing else we can do said dick oh yes there is you can march off to the lockupall three of you if you like but one of you anyhow and so you will as sure as i stand here oh mr webster i say please dont say that he never took it really he didnt come thatll do twelve oclock tomorrow unless i get the pencil youll get a call from the police off you go ive had enough of you and the bookseller whose temper had gradually been evaporating during the visit bustled our heroes out of the shop and slammed the door behind them its all up old man said heathcote lugubriously i did think the cad would shut up for twentyseven shillings and sixpence im afraid he wants me more than the money said coote whatever can i do you cant prove you didnt take it thats the worst said dick he cant prove i did he only thinks i did how i wish i had that stupid pencil with which original conclusion they returned to templeton dick under cover of his exeats marched ostentatiously in the other two in a far more modest and shy manner entered by their hands and knees on receipt of a signal from their leader that the coast was clear heathcote deemed it prudent not to exhibit himself in the den and therefore retired to pledges study as the place least likely to be dangerous pledge was there working hullo youngster said he whats been your little game this evening been to a prayer meeting no said heathcote laconically it was no part of pledges manner to appear inquisitive he saw there was a mystery and knew better than to appear in the slightest degree anxious to solve it he had as yet heard nothing of the newlyformed alliance in low life and attributed heathcotes uncommunicativeness either to shame for some discreditable proceeding or else to passing illhumour in either case he reckoned on knowing all about it before long heathcote was very uncomfortable it had not occurred to him till just now that pledge would resent the return of his allegiance to dick as an act of insubordination not that that would keep him from dick but heathcote who had hitherto admired his old patron as a friend by no means relished the idea of having him an enemy he therefore felt that the best thing he could do was to hold his tongue and if after all a row was to come wellit would have to come he sat down to do his own preparation and for half an hour neither student broke the silence then pledge who had never known his protege silent for so long together before felt there must be something the matter which he ought to be aware of so he leaned back in his chair and stretched himself youre a nice boy george said he laughing youve been sitting half an hour with your pen in your hand and havent written a word georgie coloured up its a stiff bit of prose said he so it seems suppose i do it for you no thanks pledge said the boy who without having any particular horror of having his lessons done for him did not like just now when he was conscious of having revolted against his senior to accept favours from him no its true then georgie is joining the elect and going to take holy orders no im not said georgie then georgie is trying to be funny and not succeeding said the monitor drily returning to his own books another silent quarter of an hour passed and then the first bed bell rang goodnight said heathcote gathering together his books goodnight dear boy said pledge with the red spots coming out on his cheeks come down with me to the tub in the morning im going down with another fellow said georgie feeling his heart bumping in his chest oh said the monitor indifferently with a very dear friendthe saintly dick for instance yes said heathcote and left the room pledge sat motionless watching the closed door for a full minute and as he did so an ugly look crept over his face which it was well for heathcote he did not see then he turned mechanically to his books and buried himself in them for the rest of the evening the tub next morning was crowded as usual and it needed very little penetration on pledges part to see that the triple alliance between our three heroes was fast and serious they undressed on the same rock they dived side by side from the springboard they came above water at the same moment they challenged collectively any other three of the den to meet them in mortal combat in midtub and they ended up their performance by swimming solemnly in from the open arminarm coote of course being in the middle all this pledge observed and marked also their anxious looks and hurried consultations as they dressed he guessed that there must be some matter of common interest which was just then acting as the pivot on which the alliance turned and his taste for scientific research determined him if possible to discover it so when after tub the three friends marched arminarm down town pledge casually strolled the same way at a respectful distance it was clear the firm was bound on a momentous and unpleasant errand coote every other minute was convulsed by the brotherly claps which the backersup on either side bestowed upon him and the long faces of all three as now and then they stopped and scrutinised the shopwindow of some silversmith or pawnbroker betokened anything but content or high spirits at length pledge saw them enter very dejectedly at mr websters door where not being anxious to disturb them he left them and took a short turn down the shady side of high street within view of the stationers shop their business was not protracted for in about three minutes he saw them emerge with faces longer than ever and turn their steps hurriedly and dismally towards templeton when they were out of sight pledge crossed the road and casually turned in at mr websters door well webster anything new no sir nothing in your line im afraid said the shopman by the way said pledge carelessly was that my fag i saw coming out here just now mr heathcote said webster frowning yes that was he sir and two friends of his im afraid hes getting into bad company mr pledge are you what makes you think that its an unpleasant matter altogether said mr webster and likely to be more so the fact is sir ive been robbed and he proceeded to give pledge an account of the loss of the pencil case and of the efforts of the boys to get the matter hushed up pledge heard it with an amused smile theyve just been here to try and buy me off said the indignant shopkeeper but im going to make an example of them im sorry to do it mr pledge but its only fair to myself isnt it sir i dont know said pledge i dont see that it will do you much good youd better leave it to me leave it to you well i expect i can get back your pencil as easily as you can if theyve got it youre sure they have got it im certain master coote took it certain as i stand here what theyve done with it among them i cant say well dont be in a hurry im a monitor you know and its as much to my interest to follow the thing up as to yours if youll take my advice you wont be in a hurry to prosecute wait a week very good sir said the bookseller to whom it was really a relief to postpone final action for a day or two at least if pledge meanwhile should succeed in bringing the culprit to book it would still rest with mr webster to decide whether to make an example of him or not pledge departed and the bookseller turned to dust his shop out for the day in this occupation he had not proceeded far when his brush penetrating into a crack in his counter caused something within to rattle being a tidy man and not favouring dust or dirt of any sort even out of sight he proceeded to probe the hole in order to clear away the obstruction when to his amazement and consternation he discovered snugly lying in the hollow the lost pencilcase mr websters first thought was artful young rogues theyve brought it back and hidden it here to escape punishment and yet when he came to think of it all the dust in that hole could not have settled there during the last halfhour norand he was sure of thishad either of the boys on their last two visits been anywhere near that side of his shop after all he had run his head against a stone wall and narrowly escaped ruining himself as far as templeton was concerned for he knew the young gentlemen of that school well enough to be sure after a blunder like this that the place would soon have become too hot to hold him mr webster positively gasped at the thought of his narrow escape and forgot all about pledge and the culprit and the culprits friends in his self congratulation about midday however he was suddenly reminded of them all by the vision of dick darting into the shop webster said that youth in tones of breathless entreaty do let us off this once coote really never took the pencil and if you have him taken up it will be ruination i shall get in a row for coming down now but i couldnt help well do anything if you dont take coote up ill get my father to pay you what you like will you please webster the boy delivered this appeal so rapidly and earnestly that webster had no time to stop him but when dick paused he said make yourself comfortable mr richardson ive found the pencil dick literally shouted as he sprang forward and seized the booksellers hand found it oh what a brick you are yes it had fallen into that hole and i just turned it out lucky for you and your friend it did and im not sorry either for id no fancy for putting any of you to trouble but i was bound to protect myself you see of course of course youre a regular trump webster cried dick too delighted to feel at all critical of the way in which the bookseller was extricating himself from his dilemma im so glad so will they be thanks awfully webster i say i must get a templeton observer for the good of the shop and he flung down a sixpence in the bigness of his heart and taking the newspaper darted back to templeton in a state of jubilation and happiness which made passersby as he rushed down the street turn round and look after him in ten minutes coote and heathcote were as radiant as he and that afternoon the templeton tub echoed with the boisterous glee of the three heroes as they played leapfrog with one another in the water and set the rocks almost aglow with the sunshine of their countenances but nemesis is proverbially a cruel old lady she sports with her victims like a cat with a mouse and just when the poor scared things having escaped one terrible swoop of her hand take breath she comes down remorselessly with the other hand and dashes away hope and breath at a blow and so it fared with our unlucky heroes no sooner had they escaped the fangs of mr webster than they found themselves writhing in the clutches of a new terror twice as bad and twice as awkward in the first flush of escape dick had crammed the templeton observer which he had paid sixpence for in celebration of the finding of the pencil into his pocket and never given it another thought during the evening however having occasion to search the pocket for another of its numerous contents he came upon it and drew it out whats thatthe templeton observer asked heathcote becoming suddenly serious anything in it i havent looked said dick becoming serious too and inwardly anathematising the public press may as well said heathcote perhaps therell be something about the all england tennis cup in it said coote dick opened the paper and his jaw dropped at the first paragraph which met his eye well said heathcote reflecting his friends consternation in his own looks whatever is it has lawshaw won it or renford inquired coote dick passed the paper to georgie who read as follows the mysterious disappearance of a templeton boatthe boatman thomas white was arrested yesterday at glistow and will be charged before the magistrates on saturday with fraudulently pawning the boat martha knowing the same to be only partially his own property the case is attracting much interest in the town no news has yet reached us of the missing boat but we hear on good authority that circumstances have come to light pointing to white himself as the thief and we believe evidence to this effect will be offered at saturdays examination the police are reticent on the subject what was the score of sets asked coote as heathcote put down the paper the latter replied by handing the paper to the questioner and pointing to the fatal paragraph coote read it in great bewilderment of course he knew all about tom whites row and the missing martha every templeton fellow from mansfield down to gosse knew it but why should dick and heathcote look so precious solemn about it by jove said he i wish theyd catch the fellow whats the use of the police being reticent coote old man said dick in a tone which made the youth addressed open his eyes do you know how the martha got lost stolen said coote by a fellow who was skulking about on the sands wrong she was turned adrift someone loosed the anchor rope when the tide was coming in how do you know that because i was the fellow and i helped said heathcote my eye what a regular row said coote whereupon the firm swore eternal friendship and resolved to sink or swim together chapter twenty two the hermit comes out of his cell mansfield never flattered himself that templeton would right itself by a single turn of his hand nor did he flatter himself that templeton would ever love jupiter as they had loved the old saturn who had preceded him and in neither expectation was he out of his reckoning after a week or two the sole result of the new regime seemed to be that the bad lot had plunged further into their evil ways the select sociables had increased the number of their members to thirty and made it an indispensable qualification for every candidate that he should have suffered punishment at the hands of the masters or monitors it got to be known that it was war to the knife and fellows flocked to the post of danger and begged to be admitted to the club all this mansfield saw but it did not disconcert him he was glad to see a clear line being drawn which made it impossible for any but the practised hypocrites to hang out false colours and pretend to be what they were not it was half the battle to the captain to know exactly who were friends and who were enemies he may sometimes have thought with a passing sigh of the affection which everybody good and bad had had for dear old ponty and wished he could expect as much but he dashed the thought aside as folly his duty was to make war on rebels not to win them over by blandishments so he set his face like steel to the work and made the name of monitor a caution in templeton and it is fair to say he was well backed up cresswell cartwright swinstead and others of their sort rallied round him and at the risk of their own popularity and sometimes against their better judgment took up the rule of iron even the hermit freckleton came out of his den now and then on the side of justice the cad bull who had neither the wit nor the temper to play a double part threw up his monitorship in disgust and went over to the enemy carrying with him one or two of the empty heads of the fifth pledge alone looked on the whole revolution as a joke but even pledge found it hard to make a case against the new rulers for if their severity was great their justice was still greater if they spared no one else neither did they spare themselves there was something almost ferociously honest and upright about mansfield and his lieutenants soon caught his spirit and made it impossible for anyone even for pledge to point at them and say that either fear or favour moved them it was probably on this very account that pledge deemed it well to treat the new state of things as a comedy and not with serious attention a monitors meeting was summoned for the morning after pledges call on mr webster and he attended it with a pleasant smile on his face as one who was always glad to come and see how his schoolfellows amused themselves the rest of the meeting was grim and serious its time we did something to put down this club said mansfield they are drawing in all sorts of fellows now and the longer we put it off the worse it will be what shall we do asked freckleton i think we ought to be able to do it without going to winter about it said cresswell would it do to start an opposition club suggested swinstead or make it penal for any fellow to belong to it said cartwright or send a deputation said pledge laughing and ask them please not to put the sixth in such an awkward fix you see said the captain ignoring as he usually did pledges sarcasms whatever we do some are sure to be irreconcilable i would like to give any who wish a chance of coming out and then we shall know what to do with the rest does anyone know when they meet i believe theres a meeting this evening said cartwright at least my fag coote told me a couple of days ago that he had a particular engagement this evening and was sorry he couldnt say what it was for hed promised never to speak of the club to anyone least of all to a monitor there was a general smile at the expense of the artless coote and then mansfield said well one of us had better go there and give them a caution will you go freckleton i exclaimed the hermit aghast yes please old man said the captain youd do it better than anyone wouldnt you like me to go asked pledge theres one other thing i want to speak about said mansfield theres been a lot of breaking bounds lately among the juniors i caught your fag yesterday cresswell and gave him lines your fag too pledge i have seen several times lately going out without leave dear me how shocking said pledge if monitors dont see that their own fags keep the rules said mansfield theres not much chance of getting the school generally to keep them in your case pledge i happen to know you yourself gave heathcote leave to go out more than once this term im going to put a stop to that are you really said pledge yes said mansfield flashing with his eyes but otherwise cool whereupon the meeting broke up freckleton had by no means a congenial task before him all this term he had been unable to settle down in his hermits cell mansfield had always been bringing him out for this and that special duty till he was becoming quite a public character and unfortunately for him he had done the few services for which he had been told off so well that mansfield had no notion whatever of letting him crawl back to obscurity the captain knew what he was about in selecting the hermit to open the campaign against the select sociables a secret lawless society in a school is like a secret lawless society in a countrya pest to be dealt with carefully mansfield knew well enough that he himself was not the man to do it nor was the downright cresswell nor the hotheaded cartwright it needed the wisdom of the serpent as well as the paw of the lion to do it and if anyone was likely to succeed it was freckleton for freckleton hermit as he was seemed to know more about every fellow in templeton than anyone else where and when he made their acquaintance no one knew and no one inquired but certain it was no one knew the weak points of this boy and the good points of that better than he and as we have seen already he was a dark man hardly anyone knew him they knew he had won the bishops scholarship and was reputed prodigiously learned for the rest except that he was harmless and kindly fellows hardly seemed to know him at all the select sociables were in full congress they had instituted a fine of a penny for nonattendance which had worked wonders and tonight every member was in his place except only heathcote and coote who as the reader knows had something else to think of just then the behaviour of these two young gentlemen was giving the club some uneasiness they were not alive to their duties as sociables and they had got into the abominable habit of obeying monitors and associating with questionable characters such as richardson aspinall and the like a motion had just been passed calling upon the two delinquents to appear at the next meeting and answer for their conduct when the door opened and freckleton entered good evening gentlemen said he im not sure if im a member but i hope i dont intrude the sociables stared at him half in anger half in bewilderment as he helped himself to a chair and sat down with his back to the door the fact is said he with a weary look ive lived such a retired life here i hardly know where to find fellows i want ive been hunting high and low for half a dozen fellows with brains in their heads and someone told me if i came here i should find plenty there was a titter not unmingled with a few frowns as the hermit spread himself comfortably on his chair and looked round him its as hard to find a fellow with brains nowadays as it was for diogenes to find an honest man once you know who diogenes was dont you gossy added he turning suddenly on that young bravo gosse blushed crimson at finding himself so unexpectedly singled out and faltered out that he had forgotten forgotten said freckleton joining in the general laugh at gosses expense and you knew so well once ask bull he knows hes in the sixth and very clever why bull i hope hes not present another laugh for bull sat in his place the size of life with his bloated face almost as red as gosses bull actually found the sixth so dull and unintellectual that he left us in order to cultivate the acquaintance of culver and fellows of culture and scholarship like him it was a great loss to us weve hardly had an idea in the sixth since bull left this double hit greatly delighted the majority of the sociables scarcely less so than bulls red cheeks and the gape with which culver received the reference to himself youre not wanted here bull exclaimed get out there isnt that clever said the hermit in apparent admiration did ever you hear a sentence so well put together and so eloquently delivered why not even the tootoo wrangham i hope wranghams not here blushing was the order of the day wrangham tried hard to look unconcerned but as the eyes of the club turned round in his direction the telltale roses came on his cadaverous cheeks and mounted to his forehead the tootoo wrangham who loves lilies because they are pure and calls teapots consummate becausewell i dont exactly know whyhe couldnt have put his one idea so neatly look here freckleton said spokes feeling it due to the dignity of the club to put an end to this scene this is a private meeting youve no right to be here nobody wants you dear me was that the silvery voice of toffeeloving spokes said the hermit amid a shout of laughter for everyone knew spokess weak point he says look here really i cannot until a sponge has been passed over the honest face and shorn it of some of its clinging sweetness but gentlemen of the selectselect is the word isnt it if you dont go out youll get chucked out said bull oh wonderful english wonderful elocution said the hermit ah it is good to be here ah he comes he comes it was a critical moment as the burly bull came down the room had he done so five minutes sooner freckleton might have found himself single handed but already his genial banter had told among the more susceptible of his hearers and he could count at any rate on fair play for the rest he had little anxiety wait a moment said he rising to his feet and motioning to bull to wait sociables bull wants to fight me do you want me to fight him yes yes shouted every one delighted at the prospect of a fray and many of them quite indifferent as to who conquered very well gentlemen said the hermit i will obey you on one condition and one only what is it they shouted eagerly this that if i beat bull you make me your president or if you think it fairer if i beat bull first and then spokes you elect me what do you say the hermit was staking high with a vengeance little had he dreamed when he came down to have a little talk with the select sociables of such a proposal it was the sight of bull walking down the room which had furnished the inspiration and he was daring enough to seize the chance while he had it and risk all upon it in his secret heart he was not absolutely sure of vanquishing his opponent for bull was a noted fighting man and had made his mark in templeton the hermit had never fought in his life and yet he knew a little about boxing he was strong cool and sound of wind and knew enough of human nature to avoid the least appearance of doubt or hesitation in a crisis like this what do you say asked he rather if you lick well make you president shouted the club as it is a business matter said freckleton and will have to go on the minutes wouldnt it be well for someone to propose and second it whereupon braider proposed and someone else seconded the proposal which was put to the meeting with due solemnity and carried unanimously now said the hermit slowly divesting himself of his coat when the ceremony was concluded im at your service bull there was breathless silence for a moment as all eyes turned on the ex monitor the blushes had left his cheeks and a pallor rather whiter than usual was there in their place he stood in a fascinated sort of way watching freckleton as he rolled the sleeves up above his elbows and divested himself of his collar he had never imagined the dark man would face him still less challenge him thus before the whole club the cowards heart failed him when the moment came he didnt like the look of things for an instant the crimson rushed back to his face then turning his back he walked away instantly a storm of hissing and hooting rose from the club such as had rarely been heard in the walls of templeton none are so indignant at cowards as those who are not quite sure of their own heroism and bull found it out do i understand said freckleton as soon as he could get in a word that the bull declines the bull made no answer he funks it turn him out cried gosse the hermit could not prevent a smile does anyone second mr gosses motion i do shouted spokes amid derisive laughter then said freckleton opening the door we neednt detain you bull unless on second thoughts bull slunk out followed by another howl which drowned the hermits words when he had gone the latter put on his coat and walking up to the chair which spokes had prudently vacated called the club to order and said gentlemeni beg to thank you for appointing me your president i know it will be hard to follow worthily in the footsteps of the gentleman who has just left the roomgroansand of the gentleman who has just vacated this chair leaving some of his sweetness behind him derisive cheers still i would like to do something to help make this club a credit i think we might look over the rules and see if we can get anything in which will keep cowards and cads out of the club of course that wouldnt affect any of you but it would help to keep us more select for the future cheers in fact i dont see gentlemen why we shouldnt make the club big enough to take in any fellow who like all of you hates cowardice and meanness and dirtiness and that sort of thing cheers not unmixed with blushes we may not all think alike about everything but if we are all agreed its good form to be gentlemen and honest and brave i dont see why we cant be select sociables still we pride ourselves at templeton on being one of the crack schools in the country loud cheers well any lot of fellows who set up for the select here ought to be the crack of the cracklike you all for instance however these are only suggestions now im your president i mean to work hard for the club and do my bestcheersand i ask you to back me up cheers i think by way of a start we might appoint a committee of say half a dozen to look into the rules and see how they can be improved and how the club can be made of most use to templeton what do you say cheers greeted the suggestion and several names were proposed the six elected included spokes and braider and it was evident from the half nervous halfgratified manner in which these two undertook their new responsibilities that the hermit had found out the trick of bringing out the good points even of the most unpromising boys the club separated with cheers for the new president and scarcely yet realising the transformation scene which he had made in their midst a few such as wrangham skulked off but the majority took up the new order of things with ardour and vied with one another in showing that they at any rate were bent on making the club a credit freckleton meanwhile retired to report the success of his mission to mansfield well have you got their names and cautioned them asked the captain im very hot and thirsty said the hermit flinging himself down on a chair yes yes but what about this bad club call it not bad jupiter for i am its president what you its president cried the captain taking in the mystery at a bound you mean to say youve talked them over by jove freckleton you ought to be captain of templeton thank you ive quite enough to do as president of the select sociables and he then proceeded to give a modest history of the evenings proceedings mansfield was delighted at every particular but suppose bull had fought you said he where would you be now better off i think said the hermit it would have told better if i could really have knocked him down however i fancy its as well it didnt come to a brush but can you box old man we must try one fine day but now about the club i want you to help me draw up a scheme for my committee and the two friends spent the rest of the evening in one of the most gratifying tasks that ever fell to the lot of two honest seniors a very different conversation was taking place a few studies away where pledge found himself alone with his fag for the first time since the boy had avowed his reconciliation with dick ah georgie i dont see much of you now my studys badly off for dusting im very sorry pledge i really hadnt time no busy reading the police news i suppose and seeing how young gentlemen behave themselves in the dock heathcote flushed up though from a very different cause from that which his senior suspected in the new terror about tom white the youngster had forgotten all about websters pencilcase youre going it georgie said the monitor the inevitable result of bad company youll want me to go bail for you after all i dont know what you are talking about said the boy with a confusion that belied the words well i may be able to pull you through it better than you think though of course im not such a great gun as dick however what i want you for now is to go and post this letter at the head office why its halfpast eight said heathcote wonderful and the post goes at nine but i mean i shall get in a row for going out wonderful again if anyone asks you say i told you to go look alive heathcote took the letter mechanically and went he was too dazed to argue the matter and too much disturbed by pledges apparent knowledge of the scrape which was weighing on him and his friends to care to run the risk of offending him just now as he was creeping across the quadrangle a door opened and mansfield confronted him where are you going to the post pledge gave me leave go back to your room said mansfield shutting the door hes forgotten to give me lines said georgie to himself by jove i hope hes not going to send me up to winter to georgies surprise he got neither lines nor a message to go to dr winter but as he was about to retire to rest he received a summons from the captain to go and speak with him in his study his sentence was as short as it was astounding heathcote in future you fag for swinstead not pledge goodnight chapter twenty three which treats of law and justice while pledge was dressing on the following morning the captains fag brought him a note theres no answer said the junior tossing it down on the table and departing whistling pledge opened it and read as you are determined to defy the rules and make others do the same i send this note to say heathcote is no longer your fag and that you will have to do without one for the future i also wish to say that unless you are prepared to abide by school rules it will save trouble if you send in your resignation as a monitor at oncee m his first impulse on reading this letter was to laugh and toss the paper contemptuously into the hearth but on second thoughts his amusement changed to wrath not quite unmixed with dismay he knew well enough last night when he sent heathcote out that he was bringing matters between himself and the captain to an issue and he had been too curious to see what mansfields next move would be to calculate for himself on what it was likely to be and now he felt himself hit in his weakest point not that the spider was desperately in love with heathcote as long as that volatile youth had owned his allegiance and proved amenable to his influence so long had pledge liked the boy and set store by his companionship but lately heathcote had been coming out in an unsatisfactory light for no apparent reason he had upset all his patrons calculations and spoiled all his carefully arranged plans by going over to dick and placing pledge in the ridiculous position of a worsted rival to that noisy young hero and as if that were not enough he had let himself be used by the captain as a means of dealing a further blow for when pledge came to think of it heathcote had made prompt use of his new liberty to absent himself from his seniors chamber that very morning he left his study door open and watched the passage sharply for the deserter he saw him at last labouring under a huge pile of books which he was carrying to his new lords study ah georgie cried pledge with studied friendliness youll drop that pile if you try to carry all at once put some down here and make two loads of it so youve been promoted to a new senior its not my choice mansfield moved me said heathcote feeling and looking very uncomfortable and i fancy i can hear the fervour with which you said god bless you for saving me from pledge mansfield when he moved you i said nothing of the sort i knew nothing about it i tell you till he told me quite a delicious surprise but you really mustnt be seen here said pledge with a sneer the holy ones will think i am luring you back to perdition i dont care what they say said the boy oh georgie how ungrateful how sinful of you go to them they may even be able to tell you how to enjoy yourself in a police cell it was gratifying to the senior to see the gasp with which the boy received this random shot what do you mean faltered the latter really hadnt you better ask swinstead hes your protector now i have no business to interfere do tell me what you mean said the boy imploringly but just at that moment a step sounded in the passage outside and mansfield entered the study heathcote promptly vanished and pledge face to face with his antagonist had something else to think about than mr websters pencil the captain who had great faith in striking the iron while it is hot had come down on the heels of his letter determined that if any understanding was to be come to between him and pledge it should be come to promptly youve had my note said he really mansfield began pledge ive no doubt its an honour to receive a call from the captain but you seem to forget this is my study not yours you sent heathcote out last night on purpose said mansfield ignoring the protest and what i want to know now is whether you are going to resign your monitorship or not pledges eyes blazed out as he met the captains determined face and cool eyes you dont seem to have heard what i said he replied i heard every word and you heard my question answered the captain and suppose i dont choose to answer your question then ill answer it for you if you choose to resign you may if you dont well you cease to be a monitor all the same who says so asked pledge sharply and with pale lips i say so as captain here said mansfield coolly you youre not templeton you may be a great man in your own eyes but youre only a schoolboy after all i always understood dr winter was head master here and not the boy mansfield you prefer to appeal to winter then dear me no dr winter is so well drilled into what he has to say and do here that it would be a pity to put him to unnecessary trouble you can do as you like said the captain drily theres to be a monitors meeting at twelve if you like to come and resign do so or if you like to come and hear your name taken off the list you can and mansfield turned on his heel and went pledge did not often fly into a passion but as he locked his door and heard the captains steps retreating down the passage he gave vent to a fit of uncontrolled fury he was a coward he knew it he knew he dared not meet the enemy face to face and fight for his good name in templeton he knew everyone hated himeveryone except perhaps heathcote and heathcote was drifting from him too should he appeal to winter he dared not should he let himself be expelled from the monitorship if he could have counted on any one who would feel an atom of regret at the step he might have faced it but there was no one should he resign and so relieve the monitors of their difficulty and own himself beaten there was nothing else to do of the three alternatives it was the least dangerous so he sat down and wrote dear mansfieldas you appear to have set your mind upon my resigning my monitorship and as i am always anxious to oblige the disinterested wishes of those who beg as a favour for what they know would come without asking i take the opportunity to carry out what i have long contemplated and beg to resign a post of which i have never been proud at the same time i must ask you to accept my resignation from the football club and the harriersyours truly p pledge it was a paltry letter and pledge knew it but he could not help writing it and only wished the words would show half the venom in which his thoughts were steeped the sentence about the football club and the harriers was a sudden inspiration templeton should have something to regret in the loss of him he knew they would find it hard to fill his place in the fields however easily they might do without him in school mansfield read the letter contemptuously as did all the monitors who had the real good of templeton at heart a few pulled long faces and wondered how the fifteen was to get on without its best halfback but altogether the sixth breathed more freely for what had been done and were glad mansfield had taken upon himself a task which no one else would have cared to undertake meanwhile our three heroes were spending an agitated saturday half holiday for dick had decided two days ago that his firm would have to look after tom white you know you fellows said he were not exactly in it as far as his pawning the boat goes but then if we hadnt lost her the row would have never come on and if he hadnt robbed us we should never have interfered with the boat and if we hadnt gone to the grandcourt match said dick who was fond of tracing events to their source he wouldnt have robbed us whereat they left the pedigree of tom whites row alone and turned to more practical business what can we do said georgie we cant get him off were bound to back him up though arent we oh i suppose so if we only knew how well it strikes me we ought to turn up at the police court tomorrow and see how things go said dick the firm adopted the motion the next day was a halfholiday and a police court is always attractive to infant minds and the presence of a real excuse for attending made the expedition an absolute necessity as soon as saturday school was over therefore and at the very time when the sixth were considering pledges resignation our three heroes having taken a good lunch and armed themselves each with a towel in case there might be time for a tub on the way back sallied forth arminarm to back up tom white they found rather to their disgust on reaching the police court that they were not the only templetonians who had been attracted by the prospect of seeing the honest mariner at the bar raggles and duffield were there before them waiting for the public door to open and greeted them hilariously what cheer cried raggles heres a go squash up and we shall bag the front pew duffs got fivepennorth of chocolate creams so we shall be awfully snug this last announcement somewhat mollified the firm who made up affectionately to duffields old tom will get six months said duffield as soon as his bag of creams had completed its first circuit rough on him aint it i dont know i say itll be rather a game if it turns out he stole his own boat wont it case of picking your own pocket eh i dont know said dick i dont think he did steal it but even if he did you see it didnt belong to him its a frightful jumble altogether said georgie i think laws a beastly thing if the pawnbroker chooses to give money on the boat oh its not the pawnbrokerits the fellows the boat belonged to but i tell you toms one of the fellows himself well its the other fellows we may as well have another go of chocolates now in case they get squashed up going in suggested coote who avoided the legal aspect of the case the door opened at last and our heroes some of whom knew the ways of the place made a stampede over the forms and through the witnessbox into the front seat reserved for the use of the public where they spread themselves out luxuriously and celebrated their achievement by a further tax on the friendly duffields creams the court rapidly filled the interest which tom whites case had evoked had grown into positive excitement since his arrest and our heroes had reason to congratulate themselves on their punctuality as they saw the crowded forms behind them and the jostling group at the door theres webster at the back shall you nod to him asked heathcote yesbetter said dick speaking for the firm whereupon all three turned their backs on the bench and nodded cheerily to mr webster who never saw them so busy was he in edging his way to a seat having discharged this public duty our heroes resumed their seats just in time to witness the arrival of the usher of the court followed by a man in a wig and a couple of reporters its getting hot i say said dick speaking more of his emotions than of the state of the atmosphere it got hotter rapidly for two of the templeton police appeared on the scene and looked hard at the front public bench then the solicitors seats filled up and the magistrates clerk bustled in to his table and before these alarming arrivals had well brought the perspiration to our heroes brows the appearance of two magistrates on the bench sent up the temperature to tropical order in the court cried the usher whereupon duffield in his excitement dropped a chocolate on the floor and turned pale as if expecting immediate sentence of death however the worst was now over and when it appeared that the two magistrates were bluff goodhumoured squires who seemed to have no particular spite against anybody and believed everything the clerk told them the spirits of our heroes revived wonderfully and duffields bag travelled briskly in consequence to the relief of the firm the first case was not tom whites it was that of a vagrant who was charged with the heinous crimes of begging and being unable to give an account of herself the active and intelligent police gave their evidence beautifully and displayed an amount of shrewdness and heroism in the taking up of this wretched outcast which made every one wonder they were allowed to waste their talents in so humble a sphere as templeton the magistrates put their heads together for a few seconds and then summoned the clerk to put his head up too and the result of the consultation was that the poor creature was ordered to be taken in at the union and cared for duffields bag was getting very light by the time this humane decision was come to only one round was left and that was deferred by mutual consent when the clerk called out thomas white our heroes sat up in their seats and fixed their eyes on the dock in a moment tom white as rollicking as ever but unusually sober stood in it and gazed round the place in a halfdazed way as his eyes came down to the front public bench our heroes cheeks flushed and their eyes looked straight in front of them duffield and raggles on the contrary being the victims of no pangs of conscience after looking hurriedly round to see that neither the magistrates the police nor the usher observed them winked recognition at their old servant in distress this was too much for dick these two fellows who werent in it at all were backing tom up in public whereas his firm who were in it and had come down for the express purpose of looking after the prisoner were doing nothing better nod he whispered and the firm nodded shyly but distinctly tom white was not the sort of gentleman to cut his friends on an occasion like this and he seeing himself thus noticed and recognising in a vague sort of way his patrons favoured the front public bench with five very pronounced nods greatly to the embarrassment of the young gentlemen there and vastly to the indignation of the police and officials of the court order there or the court will be cleared cried the clerk in a tone of outraged propriety how dare you our heroes not being in a position to answer the question by reason of their tongues being glued to the roofs of their mouths remained silent and tried as best they could to appear absorbed in the shape of their own boots if such a thing occurs again persisted the clerk their worships will take very serious notice of it their worships who had not a ghost of an idea what the clerk was talking about said very serious and asked that the case might proceed it proceeded and under its cover our agitated heroes gradually raised their countenances from their boots and felt their hearts which had just now stood still beating once more in their honest bosoms for any one not personally interested the case was prosy enough a solicitor got up and said he appeared for toms three partners who charged him with pledging the martha and appropriating the money whereas the martha belonged to the four of them and tom had no right to raise money on her except by mutual consent the three partners and the pawnbroker were put into the witnessbox and gave their evidence in a lame sort of way tom was invited to ask any questions he desired of the witnesses and said thankee sir to each offer he had nothing that he knowed of to ask them he was an unfortunate labouring man that had lost his living and he hoped gentlemen would remember him he accompanied this last appeal with a knowing look and grin at the occupants of the front public bench who immediately blushed like turkey cocks and again dropped their heads towards their boots have you anything to say about the disappearance of the boat said the clerk shuffling his notes only your worship said the solicitor that on the th of june last the martha disappeared from her berth on the beach and as white disappeared at the same time and refuses to give an account of himself at that particular time the prosecutors are convinced he removed the boat himself in support of this very vague charge a policeman was called who gave a graphic account of the beauties of the moonlight on the night in question and of how he had seen from his beat on the parade a figure move stealthily across the sands to the place where whites boat was supposed to be he couldnt quite swear that the figure was white or that the boat was the martha but he didnt know who either could be if they were not the figure might have been a boy but as he was a quarter of a mile off he couldnt say he never left his beat till one in the morning by that time the tide was in he didnt actually see tom white row off in the martha but neither of them was to be seen in templeton next day after this piece of conclusive evidence the public looked at one another and shook their heads and thought what wonderful men the templeton police were for finding out things have you any questions to ask the witness demanded the clerk of tom thankee no sir its all one to me said tom bless yer i never knows nothing about it till a young gentleman says to me theyre after you says he scuttle off so i scuttled off bless you sir i didnt know i was doing harm under this thunderbolt dick almost collapsed fortunately toms short memory kept him from recognising him in the matter any more than the other occupants of the seat he nodded generally to the young gentlemen as a bodya most compromising nod and one which included all five in it meaning one of the magistrates who saw it looked up and asked genially you dont mean to say it was one of those young gentlemen prisoner bless you sir likely as not they young gentlemen sir always spare a trifle for a honest yes yes we dont want all that if you have no more questions to ask the constable the constable may stand down the constable stood down and a brief consultation again ensued between the bench and the clerk which dick firmly believing that it referred to him watched with terrible interest yes said the magistrate looking up we remand the case for a week dick breathed again the storm had blown over after all not only had he himself escaped punishment for conspiring against the ends of justice but tom white had still another week during which something might turn up the court emptied rapidly as the case ended rather hot wasnt it said duffield as the five found themselves outside solacing themselves with the last go of the creams awful said the firm from the bottom of their hearts and feeling that many afternoons like this would materially shorten their days chapter twenty four how our heroes turn their attention to the chase during the few days which followed their gallant but unsuccessful attempt to back up tom white the firm found plenty to think about nearer home the rumour of the revolution in the select sociables spread rapidly over templeton and freckleton was almost mobbed more than once by his new admirers however he kept his head and steered his new ship craftily and carefully by appealing to the patriotism and honour of his sociables he succeeded in getting the rules so amended and purified that in a few days instead of being a select club of the worst characters in templeton its constitution was open enough to admit any boy who in any way proved himself a credit to the school a still more important step was the voluntary disbanding of the old club for the purpose of placing the new rules before a meeting of the whole school this was not an easy thing to accomplish for the old members knew most of them that their qualifications were the reverse of those which would make them eligible for membership according to the new rules they therefore clung tenaciously to their hold and it was not until freckleton compromised the matter by promising to hold them eligible for election to the new club and exempt them from the conditions other fellows would have to fulfil to become eligible that they finally gave way it was a great day when by virtue of a personal invitation to each boy in the hermits name templeton met together in the great hall to put the new club on its feet it was remarked at this meeting that the sixth took their places as ordinary templetonians in the body of the hall and not on the dais and that the den which usually herded together at the lower end was distributed here and there impartially in fact everyone was equal today and the very knowledge of the fact seemed to put dignity and order into the assembly after rather an awkward pause during which it seemed doubtful how the business ought to begin freckleton stepped up on to the platform his appearance was greeted by cheers which however he immediately extinguished i think said he quietly as this is quite a private meeting you will all see cheering is hardly the thing suppose we do without it it is very good of you fellows to come here in such numbers and i only hope youll not hesitate to say what you think about the proposal i am going to makefor the question is one which the whole school ought to decide and not any one particular clique or set among us hear hear you all of you know i believe what the object of the meeting is up till quite recently we had a club in templeton which rejoiced in the name of the select sociables laughter it wasnt a public clublaughterbut most of the school i fancy had heard of its existence laughter gentlemen laugh but i assure them i am telling the truth and have good reason to know what i am talking about as i happened to be the president of the select sociables hear hear we found the club wasnt altogether flourishing laughter some of the rules wanted looking to and a few of the members were not exactly the best specimens of templeton form loud laughter gentlemen think there was a joke in that i suppose i didnt see it myself we put our heads together to see how the club could be improved and i am bound to say the old members came forward most patriotically and gave up their undoubted rights in order to make the club a thoroughly templeton affair cheers were raised here for the old sociables who never felt so virtuous in all their lives now you want to hear what our proposal is youll understand it best if i read the rough rules which the committee has drawn up that the club be called the select sociables that the number of members be limited to thirty that not more than six members be chosen from any one form this is to prevent the club getting crowded out with sixthform fellowsloud cheers from the juniorsor fellows from the junior third laughter from the seniors it will insure each form getting represented on it by half a dozen of its best men that all templetonians are eligible who have either a gained any prize or promotion in the school examinations b played in any of the schoolhouse matches senior or junior cheers c won any event at the school sports d run through any hunt with the harriers cheers e swum round the black buoy loud cheers f done anything which in the opinion of the school has been for the good of templeton that all elections take place by ballot that the first thirty members be elected by ballot by the whole school and future vacancies be filled up by the club that all the original members of the old club shall be considered eligible for election whether they have complied with any of the conditions named or not laughter and blushes that if there are less than six fellows eligible in any form the number may be filled up from eligible candidates in the form below there thatsroughly speakinghow it is proposed the new club should be formed we should like to know said cresswell rising what the club will do when it will meet and so on well said freckleton we thought we could get leave to use the library every evening and being a sociable club we should try to afford to take in a few of the illustrated and other papers and manage supper together now and then and make ourselves as comfortable as possiblelaughter and cheers especially from the youngsters if we got talent enough in the club we might give the school a concert or a dramatic performance now and then or in the summer try our hand at a picnic or a fishing cruise if cresswell gets elected himselfand hed better not be too surehell find out that the sociables will have a very good idea of making themselves snug laughter is there to be any entrancefee or subscription asked birket we think fellows might be asked to subscribe halfacrown a term its not very much and as the juniors usually have twice as much spare cash as we seniors we dont think they will shy at the club for thatloud cheers and laughter from the juniors theres just one other thing by the way continued the hermit its only perhaps to be talking about turning fellows out of the club but we think we ought to protect ourselves by some rule which will make any member of the club who does anything low or discreditable to templeton liable to be politely requested to retire i dont mean mere monitors rows of course fellows arent obliged to get into them though they do but i dont think we ought to be too stiff and turn a fellow out because he happens to get a hundred lines from cartwright for climbing one of the elms laughter and hear hear from cartwright hes no business to climb elms and its quite right to give him lines for it but as long as he doesnt do that sort of thing systematically in defiance of rules then i say let him find some place other than the clubroom to do his lines inhear hear the fellows the club will want to protect itself against are the cads and sneaks and cheats who may be knowing enough to keep square with the monitors but are neither select nor sociable enough for a club like ours there i never made such a long speech in all my life im quite ashamed of myself templeton forgot its good manners and cheered loudly at this point there was something about the genial unassuming straightforward hermit which touched the fellows on their soft side and made them accept him with pride as a representative of the truest templeton spirit they might not perhaps love him as fondly as they loved dear old lazy ponty but there was not one fellow who did not admire and respect him or covet his good opinion as soon as silence was obtained mansfield rose it was a selfdenying thing to do and the captain knew it there was very little affection in the silence which fell on the room he had given up long since expecting it it said much for him that its absence neither soured nor embittered him it made him unhappy but he kept that to himself and let it influence him not a whit in the path of duty he had set before hima path from which not even the hatred of templeton would have driven him im sure we are all very grateful to freckleton he said it will be an honour to anyone to get into the club and for those who dont get on at first it will be something to look forward to and work for i dont think a better set of rules could have been drawn up it will be a thoroughly representative club of all that is good in templeton it doesnt favour any one set of fellows more than another fellows who are good at work and fellows who are good at sports have all an equal chance the only sort of fellows it doesnt favour are the louts and the cads and the less they are favoured anywhere in templeton the better its a shame to trouble freckleton with more questions but some of us would like to know when the ballot for the new club is to take place and how he proposes we should vote there was a faint cheer as the captain sat down templeton whatever its likes and dislikes were always appreciated generosity and the captains honest ungrudging approval of a comrade who had already distanced him in the hold he exercised over templeton pleased them and told in the speakers favour i think the best way would be said freckleton for every fellow to make a list of the thirty fellows he thinks most eligible between now and today week if he cant think of thirty then let him put down all he can remembering that there are not to be more than six in any form today week well have the ballot and fellows will drop their lists into the box and the highest thirty will be elected hadnt we better have a list posted up somewhere of the names of fellows in each form who are eligible asked someone certainly ill have one up tomorrow and if there are any corrections and additions to make there will be time to make them and get out a final list two days before the election among the crowd which jostled in front of the list on the library door next day might have been seen the eager and disconsolate faces of our three heroes alas not one of their names was there everybody elses seemed to be there but theirs aspinalls was there of course for aspinall had won his remove with honour last term raggles was there for raggles had played in the junior tennis fours of westovers against the rival houses spokes was there for spokes had swum round the black buoy and become a shark even gosse was there for gosse had walked over for the high jumps for boys under foot inches last sports dick gulped down something like a groan as he strained his eyes up and down the cruel list in the vague hope of finding his name in some corner however humble but no he turned away at last with his two disconsolate friends feeling more humiliated than he had ever felt in his life he had done nothing for templetonhe who had passed for a leader among his compeers and for a hero among his inferiors his record was absolutely empty in school he had failed miserably out of school he had shirked sports in which he ought easily to have excelled and rotted when he might have been doing good execution for templeton he scoured his memory to think of anything that might savour of credit there was the new boys race he had won that but that was all and it didnt count he had thrashed culver and been patted on the back for it but that hadnt got him on to the list and except for these two exploits what good had he done nay hadnt he done harm instead of good he had dragged heathcote after him and heathcote and he had dragged coote and here they were all left out in the cold dick remembered the ghosts letter and could have kicked himself for being so slow to take its advice were out of it said georgie dismally as the three walked down the shady side of the fields i did think we might have scraped in somehow whatever could you have scraped in for asked dick sharply hadnt you better give in weve been a pack of fools at once so we have said coote id have liked awfully to get in the club how stunning the picnics would be young ass said dick the grubs all you think about even if you got on the list it doesnt follow youd be elected it would be something though to get on the list said georgie it makes a fellow feel so small to be out of it think of that howling young gosse being on yes and raggles said coote look here i say exclaimed dick suddenly stopping short in his walk his face lighting up with the brilliancy of the inspiration what asses we are theres the first harrier hunt of the season tomorrow of course well go and run through heathcote whistled they sometimes run a twelvemiler said he never mind if they run twelve hundred said dick were bound to be in it i tell you its our only chance birket told me hardly anyone ever runs in it below the upper fourth cant help that said dick decisively theres nothing to prevent us oh of course not said heathcote who inwardly reflected that there was nothing to prevent their jumping over the moon if they only could youre game then all right replied the two pliable ones hurrah you know we may not keep close up all the way but if we can only run it through its all right by jove i am glad i thought of it arent you awfully they said templeton opened its eyes that evening when it saw the firm solemnly go to bed at halfpast seven it wasnt their usual practice to shorten their days in this manner and it was evident this early retirement meant something speculation was set at rest next morning when immediately after morning school they appeared in their knickerbockers and running shoes and bare shins hullo said cresswell who was the first to encounter them in this trim are you youngsters going to have a little run of your own cresswell was in running costume tooa model whipperindetermined to do his part in the long afternoons work which he had cut out for himself and his harriers were going to run in the big hunt said dick modestly what said the senior laughing do you know what the run is about twelvemiles isnt it said coote glad to air his knowledge yes im afraid it will be hardly worth your while to take such a short trot said cresswell with a grin were going to try said dick resolutely who are the hares cresswell swinstead and birket good hares too but i say youngsters youd better not make asses of yourselves if you like to come the first mile or two all right but take my advice and turn back before youre too far from home were going to run it through said dick if we possibly can we want to get on the sociables list blurted out the confiding coote thats why dick and heathcote blushed up guiltily and rushed their indiscreet chum off before he had time to unbosom himself further cresswell with the grin still on his honest face turned into freckletons study by jove old man said he youll have a lot to answer for the rate youre going on there are three youngstersmy fag dick and his two chumsgoing to run this hunt through because their names are not on your precious list theyll kill themselves hurrah cried the hermit im delightednot of course about the killing but i like spirit i hope theyll scramble through mark my word cress those three partners will make their mark in templeton yet theyre likely to make their mark at a coroners inquest said cresswell did you ever run in a twelvemile hunt no thank you said the hermit well i only hope theyll cool down before they go too far thats all said the whipperin they dont know what theyre in for theyre in for the sociables and more power to them say i said the hermit when cresswell arrived at the meet he found our heroes the centres of attraction to the crowd who usually assembled to see the hounds throw off they bore their honours meekly and affected an indifference they were far from feeling to the chaff and expostulations which showered upon them from all sides all show off cried gosse theyll sit down and have a nap under the first hedge and make believe they ran it through come youngsters said cartwright youve had a jolly little game better go home and put on your trousers and not try to be funny for too long together is it true said someone else with a significant jerk of his head in the direction of the firm that the hares are going to make a twenty mile run of it instead of twelve of course we go through turners field where the mad bulls are said another our heroes began to think the delay in starting was getting to be criminal everyone had turned up long ago whatever was keeping the hunt from beginning ah there was cresswell calling up the hares at last thank goodness swinstead and birket par nobile fratrum were old stagers in the templeton hunts and fellows knew when they buckled on their scent bags and tied their handkerchiefs round their waists that the harriers would have their work cut out for them before the day was over all ready asked the whipperin taking out his watch all serene off you go then and off went the hares at a long easy swing out of the fields and up on to the breezy downs now then harriers peel said the whipperin when the hares had disappeared from view and his watch showed seven minutes to have elapsed our heroes nervously obeyed the order and confided their outer vesture to aspinalls custody then steeling their ears and hearts to the final sparks of chaff which greeted the action they moved forward with the other hounds and waited cresswells signal to go it seemed ages before those three minutes crawled out but at last the whipperin put his watch back and blew a blast on his bugle forward shouted everybody and the hunt was begun chapter twenty five how our heroes make their record if i were a poet i should at this point pause to invoke diana apollo adonis and the other deities who preside over the chase to aid me in describing the famous and nevertobeforgotten run of the templeton harriers that early autumn afternoon how they broke in full cry out of the fields up on to the free downs how with the fresh sea scent in their faces they scoured the ridge that links templeton with blackarch and blackarch with topping how at the third mile they cried off inland and plunged into the valley by walys bottom and bardies farm through the pleasant village of steg over the railway and along the fringe of swilford wood to the open heath beyond how half the hunt was out of it before they went up the other side of the valley and scattered the gravel on the top of welkin beacon how those who were left dropped thence suddenly on lowhouse and swam the gurgle a mile above the ford how from lowhouse they swerved eastward and caught the railway again at norton cutting how they lost the scent in durdon copse but found it again where the wood and the gravel pits met how the six who stayed in blistered their feet after that on the gritty high road till cresswell hallooed them over the hedge and showed them the scent down the winding banks of the babrook and once again how they dived into the queer hamlet of little maddick and saw the very loaf and round of cheese off which the hares had snatched a hasty meal not five minutes before how mansfield and cresswell made a vow to taste neither meat nor drink till they had run their quarry down and how the ever diminishing pack sighted the hares just out of maddick going up the bengle hill over bengle hill down into the valley beyond and up the shoulder of blackarch ridge how they toiled and struggled till once more the sea burst on to their view and the salt breezes put new life into their panting frames how along the ridge and down towards grey harbour the leaders gained on the hares handoverhand and how at last in that final burst along the hard dry sand the hares were caught gloriously half a mile from home after one of the fastest runs templeton had ever recorded but my muse must curb her wings and descend from poetry to prose in order to narrate the particular adventures of our three modest heroes for the first halfmile be it said to their glory they led the hunt being convinced that their only hope was to get a good start and shake off the field from the very beginning they dashed to the front on cresswells cry of forward at the rate of ten miles an hour and for five minutes showed templeton the way then occurred one of those lamentable disasters which so often befall youthful runners on the exhaustion of their first wind cootes shoe lace came undone that was the sole reason for his pulling up to say that he was blown or that the pace was hard on him was adding insult to calamity and doubtless the redness of his countenance as he knelt down to make fast the truant lace was solely due to indignation at the possibility of such a suggestion dick and heathcote as they stood one on each side of him really thankful for the pause professed to be highly impatient at the delay come on said dick here they all come what a brutal time you take to do up that beastly lace cried georgie we might have been in the next field by this time i think it will hold now said coote rising slowly to his feet as the pack came up in full cry blown already youngsters asked cresswell better go home were not blown at all said dick trotting on abreast of the whipper in cootes lace came undone that was all yes we should have been in the next field if it hadnt said the owner of the luckless lace the harriers smiled and for a minute or two the pack swung in an even line across the field then coote anxious not to crowd anyone let half a dozen or so of the fifth go in front and dick and georgie generously considering that it would be rather low to leave their shortwinded comrade in the lurch dropped behind the leading rank in order to be nearer him in a minute more all anxiety coote may have felt as to crowding any one was at an end he was a yard or two in the rear of the last man with a stitch in his side beginning in his inmost soul to wonder whether the new sociables club was such a very good thing after all dick and georgie as they gradually sacrificed their prospect of being in at the death and fell back to the support of their ally waxed very contemptuous of stitch in a fellows side they knew what it meant it was a pity coote had started if he was liable to that sort of thing his stitch had cost the firm a whole field already however they were not selfish they must back him up even if it meant coming in at the tail of the hunt though to be sure the pace mansfield cresswell and a few others were going at was one which couldnt be kept up and the firm as soon as the stitch was out might be in the running after all by dint of persuasions threats and imputations cootes stitch did come out but before it was gone the last of the pack were seen going over the ridge were out of it said georgie despondently not a bit of it said dick who was getting his second wind and felt like holding on were bound to pull up on them if coote only keeps up so they held on gallantly they could not long keep up the fiction of being in the hunt no amount of selfdeception could persuade them when the end of the straggling line of fellows going up the ridge was a clear halfmile ahead that they were in it still every minute they held on they felt more like staying and when they reflected that it was possible to run through the hunt without being in at the death they took comfort and determined templeton should not say they had turned tail we shall have to follow the scent now said dick when the pack suddenly disappeared to view over the ridge thank goodness its all white paper and plenty of it come on you fellows well run it through yet i feel quite fresh said coote mopping his head with his handkerchief how far do you think weve gonesix miles six weve not done a mile and a half yet coote put away his handkerchief and gave the buckle of his running drawers a hitch and the firm settled down to business having once found out their pace and got their second wind they felt comparatively comfortable the scent lay true up the ridge and as they rose foot by foot and presently breasted the bluff norwester they felt like keeping it up for a week hullo i say cried georgie when the top of the ridge was gained there they go right under us we might almost catch them by a short cut cant do it said dick decisively were bound to follow the scent even if the hares doubled and came back across this very place would real harriers do that asked coote if i was a real harrier and saw the hare close to me id go for him no matter what the scent was all very well you cant do it todaynot if you want to get on the list said dick theyve taken a sharp turn though at the bottom trotting down a steep hill is not one of the joys of the chase and our heroes by the time they got to the level bottom felt as bruised and shaken as if they had been in a railway accident however a mile on the flat pulled them together again and they plodded on by bardies farm where the scent became sparse and on to steg where for the first time since leaving templeton they came upon traces of their fellowman the worthy inhabitants of steg particularly the junior portion of them hailed our three heroes with demonstrations of friendly interest they had turned out fully half an hour ago to see the main body of the hunt go by and just as they were returning regretfully to their ordinary occupations the cry of three more of em came as a welcome reprieve and brought them back into the highway in full force fond of their joke were the friendly youth of steg and considering the quiet life they led their wit was none of the dullest hurrah heres three more hounds theys the puppies i reckon nay one of ems got the rickets see if they dont look to it the hares will be round the world and catching them up hi mister puppy youre going wrong they went tother way shut up cried dick go and give your pigs their dinner shouted heathcote coote contented himself with running through the village with his tongue in his cheek and in another three minutes the trio were beyond earshot and shaking the dust of steg from their feet how many miles now asked coote with a fine effort to appear unconcerned at the answer which he put down in his own mind at six or seven miles three and a half aboutput it on you fellows it was a long trot along the springy turf outside swilford wood once or twice the scent turned in and got doubtful among the underwood but it came out again just as often and presently turned off on to the heath our heroes ploughed honestly through the bracken and gorse which tangled their feet and scratched their bare shins at every step that mile over the heath was the most trying yet the hares seemed to have picked out the very cruellest track they could find and when presently the firm caught sight of the ruthless little patches of paper going straight up the side of welkin beacon coote fairly cried for quarter and announced he must sit down his companions though they would not have liked to make the suggestion themselves were by no means inexorable to the appeal why weve hardly started yet said dick throwing himself down on the ground youre a nice fellow to begin to want a rest only just started gasped coote i never ran so far in my life we came that last bit pretty well considering the ground said heathcote anxious to make the halt as justifiable as possible i wonder where the hares are now said dick rather pensively back at templeton perhaps said heathcote having iced gingerbeer or turning into the tub shut up georgie said dick with a wince whats the use of talking about iced gingerbeer out here they lay some minutes each dreading the first suggestion to move coote feigned to have dropped asleep and heathcote became intensely interested in the anatomy of a thistle dick was the only one who could not honestly settle down and the dreaded summons when at last it came came in his voice you lazy beggars cried he starting up get up cant you and come on rip van winkle never slept more profoundly than did coote at that moment but alas rip had the longer nap of the two an unceremonious application of the leaders toe and a threat to go on alone brought the firm to their feet in doublequick time and started them up the steep side of the beacon hill demoralised by their halt they fared badly up the slope and had it not been for dicks almost vicious resolution which kept him going and overcame his own frequent inclination to yield to the lazier motions of his companions they might never have done it dick saw that the effort was critical and he was inexorable even georgie thought him unkind and coote positively hated him up that slope oh those neverending ridges one above the other each seeming to be the top but each discovering another beyond more odious than itself more than once they felt they had just enough left in them to make the peak that faced them and then when it was reached their endurance had to stretch and stretch until it seemed that the point of breaking must come at each step if nothing else they had ever done deserved the reward of the virtuous that honest pull up the side of the welkin beacon did and freckleton had he seen them making the last scramble would have put their names down on his list without further probation the cairn stood before them at last and as they rushed to it and planted themselves on the topmost point where still a few scraps of the scent lingered all the fatigue and labour were forgotten in an exhilarating sense of triumph and achievement rather a breather that said dick his honest face beaming all over you chaps took a lot of driving i feel quite fresh after it said coote beaming too you didnt feel fresh ten minutes ago under the last shoulder but one my boy if you feel so fresh suppose you trot down and up again while georgie and i sit here and look at the view coote declined and after a short rest they dropped down the long slope with the scent in full view on to lowhouse where the gurgle slipping clear and deep between its banks seemed to them one of the loveliest pictures nature ever drew the scent lay right along the bank sometimes down on the stones sometimes on the high paths above the tree tops until suddenly it stopped by jove we shall have to swim for it you fellows cried dick delighted chuck your shoes and things across and tumble in with joy they obeyed they would fain have spent half an hour in the delicious water so soft and cool and deep but dick was in a self denying mood and would not allow his men more than ten minutes that however was as good as an hours nap and when after dressing and picking up the scent they took up the running again it was like a new start halfamile down they came on to the country road and here suddenly the scent vanished high or low they could not find it it neither crossed the road nor went up the road nor went down the road they sniffed round in circles but all to no goodnot a scrap of paper was anywhere within twenty yards except at the spot where they had struck the road they had gone perhaps half a mile with no sign yet of the scent and were beginning to make up their minds that after all they should have turned up the road instead of down when a horseman followed by a groom turned a corner of the road in front of them and came to meet them hurrah cried dick heres a chap we can ask the chap in question was evidently somewhat perplexed by the apparition of these three bareheaded barelegged duststained youngsters and reined up his horse as they trotted up i say cried dick ten yards off have you seen the harriers go by pleasewhew this last exclamation was caused by the sudden and alarming discovery that the chap thus unceremoniously addressed was no other than one of the two magistrates before whom not three days ago tom white had stood on his trial in the presence of the firm what harriers my man asked the gentleman oh if you please the templeton harriers sir its a paperchase you know oh youre templeton boys are you why i was a templetonian myself at your age said the delighted old boy no no harriers have gone this way you must have lost the scent we lost it half a mile ago if youre going that way we can show you where said dick come on then said the goodhumoured squire well smell em out somewhere so the firm turned and trotted in its very best form alongside the worthy magistrate until they reached the point where the scent had struck the road the old templetonian summoned his groom and dismounting joined the boys with all the ardour of an old sportsman in their search for the scent he poked the hedges knowingly with his whip and tracked up the ditches he took note of the direction of the wind and ordered his groom to take his horse a wide sweep of the field opposite on the chance of a discovery the boys fired by his example strained every nerve to prove themselves good harriers and covered a mile or more in their circuits at length the old gentleman brought his whip a crack down on his leggings and exclaimed i have it ha ha knowing young dogs look here my boy look here and taking dick by the arm he led him to the point where the scent touched the road do you see what theyve doneartful young scamps theyve doubled on their own scent usent to be allowed in my days and delighted with his discovery he led them back along the scent for a hundred yards or so up the field where it suddenly forked off behind some gorsebushes and made straight for the railway at norton ha ha the best bit of sniffing ive had these many years and now i come to think of it with the wind the way it is blowing they may have dropped their scent fair and the breeze has taken it on to the old track cunning young dogs thanks awfully said dick gratefully we should never have found it the other two echoed their gratitude and the delighted old gentleman valued their thanks quite as much as his commission of the peace now youve got it said he come along and have a bit of lunch at my house im not five minutes away thanks very much said dick but im afraid nonsense come on youre out of the hunt ten minutes wont make any difference of course they yielded and enjoyed a sumptuous lunch of cold meat and bread and cheese which made new men of them it took all their good manners to curb their attentions to the joint and their chatty host spun out the repast with such stories of his own school days that the ten minutes grew to fully half an hour before they could get away before they did so dick who for a quarter of an hour previously had been exhibiting signs of agitation and inward debate contrived to astonish both the firm and his host we saw you at tom whites trial the other day sir said he abruptly at the close of one of the squires stories bless my soul were you there why of courseall three of you i saw you they didnt let the youngsters do that sort of thing in my day we were rather interested about white you know said dick nervously a goodfornothing vagabond he is said the very unprofessional magistrate we rather hope said dick turning very red hell get let off eh what do you know you young scamp i can so you want him let off do you hows that because he didnt take the boat away said dick avoiding the horror struck eyes of his firm wethat is ilet it go what do you say said the squire putting down his knife and fork and sitting back in his chair whereupon dick as much to stave off the expected storm as to justify himself proceeded to give a true though agitated story of his and georgies adventures on the day of the grandcourt match appealing to georgie at every stage in the narration to corroborate him which georgie did almost noisily the magistrate heard it all out in silence with a face gradually becoming serious do you know what you can get for doing it he asked dicks face grew graver and graver shall we be transported he asked with a quaver in his voice the magistrate took a hurried gulp from the tumbler before him youve put me in a fix my man youd no business to get round me to prevent me doing my duty i really didnt mean to do that put in dick nowe wouldnt do such a thing said georgie well never mind that whatever tom white did to you youd no right to do what you did youve put me in a fix i say take my advice and write to your father and tell him all about it and get him to come down if tom whites partners and the pawnbroker get their money they may stop the case and therell be an end of it if they dont tom must take his chance dear dear things have changed in templeton since my day confound it i wish the harriers would choose some other run a nice fix im in to be sureyoung rascals late that evening a crowd assembled in the quadrangle of templeton the hunt had been in three hours ago and all the hounds but three had turned up and gone to their kennels it was to welcome the remaining three that the crowd was assembled they had already been signalled from the beach and the faint hum in the high street told that they had already got into their last run nearer and louder grew the sound till the hum became a shout and the shout a roar as through the great gate of templeton three small travel stained figures trotted gamely into the quad with elbows down and heads up they hardly seemed to hear the cheers or notice the crowd but kept their faces anxiously towards where cresswellbook in handstood at the door of westovers to receive them have you run right through he asked as they came up yes every step gasped dick five minutes later the firm was in bed and fast asleep and two days later when the revised list of candidates eligible for election to the select sociables was displayed on the library door it included the names of richardson heathcote and coote chapter twenty six how the sword of damocles still hangs over our heroes dear fatherplease come down here as soon as you can were in a regular row im awfully afraid fifty pounds will not quite cover it please try and come by the next train as the case comes on on saturday and theres not much time we saw the magistrate yesterday and made a clean breast i hope they wont transport us he was very jolly helping us find the scent and gave us a stunning lunch we ran the big hunt right through and are pretty sure to get our names on the sociables list i wish you and mother could have seen the view on the top of welkin beacon the awkward thing is that tom white may get transported instead of us and it would be jolly if you could come and get him off coote wasnt in it but hes backing us up how is tike i hope they wash him regularly if im not transported i shall be home in eight weeks and three days and will take him out for walks love to mother in which all joinyour affectionate son basil psif you come dont take fegans cabhes a cheat old white will drive you cheap hes toms father georgie sends his love the reader may imagine if he can the consternation with which mr and mrs richardson read this loving epistle at breakfast on the friday morning following the great hunt they gazed at one another with countenances full of horror and terror like people suddenly brought face to face with a great calamity at length mr richardson said wheres the bradshaw jane oh the train goes in half an hour you have just time to catch it do go quickly my poor poor boy the father groaned and in another five minutes he was on his way to the station that morning while school was in full swing the porter entered the third class room with a telegram in his hand which he took straight to the master richardson said the master this is for you dick who was at the moment engaged in drawing a circle on his euclid cover with a pencil and a piece of string much to the admiration of his neighbours jumped up as if he had been shot and with perturbed face went up to receive the missive he tore it open and as he glanced at its contents his anxious face relaxed into a complacent grin from g richardson london i shall reach templeton at this afternoon meet me if you can huzzah georgie said he as he returned to his seat fathers coming down by the lets all go and meet him the firm said they would and accordingly that afternoon after dinner the trio sallied forth in great spirits and goodhumour to give the anxious father a reception with the easy memory of youth they forgot all about the probable object of his visit or if they remembered it it was with a sort of passing feeling of relief that the tom white row was now as good as overat any rate as far as they were concerned when mr richardson haggard and anxious descended from the carriage it was a decided shock to encounter the beaming countenance of his son and hear his lighthearted greeting hullo fatherjolly youve come old whites cab is bagged but swishers got a good horse to go heres georgie and cooteyou know the bewildered gentleman greeted his sons friends kindly and then disclaiming all intention of taking anybodys cab drew his son aside what is all this my boy your mother and i almost broke our hearts over your letter oh its all serenereally father said the boy a little disturbed by his fathers anxious tones we really wouldnt have sent if the magistrate hadnt said wed betterwould we georgie no he said that was our only chance replied georgie if your two friends will take my bag up to the george said mr richardson despairing of getting any lucid information out of the firm as a body i should like a walk with you basil on the strand coote and georgie departed with the bag and the father and son being left alone dick gave a simple and unvarnished narrative of the legal difficulties in which he and his friends were involved mr richardsons heart beat lighter as he heard it the scrape was bad enough but it was not as bad as he had imagined nor was the foolish boy at his side the monster of iniquity his letter had almost implied they had a long talk those two that afternoon as they paced the hard dry strand at the waters edge and watched the waves tumbling in from the sea they talked about far more than tom white and his boat dicks heart once opened poured into his fathers ears the story of all his trials and temptations and hopes and disappointments at templeton the narration did him good it cleared and strengthened his mind wonderfully it humbled him to discover in how many things he had been wrong and in how many foolish and it comforted him to feel that his father understood him and judged him fairly it was late in the afternoon when their walk came to an end then mr richardson said now i suppose you and your friends have decided that i am to give you high tea at the georgeeh thanks said dick who had had a dim prospect of the kind well ill come up to the school and see if i can get dr winter to give you leave dr winter doesnt know about tom whites boat you know said the boy as they walked up i didnt like to tell him dr winter was easily persuaded to allow the firm to spend the evening with mr richardson at the george the small party which assembled that evening at the table of the worthy paterfamilias did not certainly look like one over which hung the shadow of transportation the talk was of tubs and harriers of tennis and sociables of virgil and euclid and as the first shyness of their introduction wore off the firm settled down to as jovial an evening as they had spent for a long time only once did the shadow of their row return when mr richardson at eight oclock said now boys goodnight i have a solicitor coming here directly about the trial father asked dick with falling countenance yes my boy as the case comes on tomorrow there is no time to be lost there certainly was not and mr richardson before he went to bed that night had not only seen a good many persons but had materially lightened his pockets buying off the law even in the most straightforward way is an expensive luxury the prosecutors of tom white seeing that their victim had an unexpected backer became very righteous and high principled indeed they could not think of withdrawing the case it was a public dutypainful of course but not to be shirked it pained them very much to bring trouble on any one particularly an old shipmate but they owed it to society to see he got his deserts they were of course wholly unaware of mr richardsons special interest in the matter otherwise they might have been even more virtuous and highprincipled than they were they looked upon him as a benevolent individual bent on getting the halfwitted vagabond out of trouble and as such they knew quite enough of fishing to see that he was in their net their own solicitor too knew something about this sort of fishing and the unfortunate father spent a very unhappy morning floundering about in the net these gentlemen provided for himextremely doubtful whether after all he would not be obliged publicly to incriminate his son in order to solve the difficulty however by dint of great exertion he contrived to get the case adjourned for three days more the prosecutors were of course shocked to see the course of the law delayed for even this length of time it meant expense to them as well as inconvenience of course mr richardson had to act up to this broad hint and promising further not to make any attempt to bail their prisoner he obtained their reluctant consent to a postponement till wednesday greatly to the disgust among other persons of duffield and raggles who mindful of their pleasant morning last saturday had come down with another fivepennyworth of chocolate creams to watch the case again beastly soak it was said raggles that afternoon to dick who acting on parental orders had abstained with the firm from visiting the court they say theres some idiot come all the way from london to stop the case id like to kick him what business has he to come and spoil our fun look here said dick with a sudden warmth which quite took away the breath of master raggles shut up and hold your row unless you want to be chucked out of the quad what on earth is the row with you asked the astounded raggles never you mind hook it retorted dick raggles departed not quite sure whether dick had not had too much swipes for dinner or whether his run after the harriers yesterday had not been too much for his wits dick felt rather blue that afternoon as he watched the train which carried his father steam out of templeton station he had somehow expected that this visit would settle everything but instead of doing that mr richardson had left templeton almost as anxious as when he entered it dick couldnt make it out and he returned rather dismally to templeton here however he had plenty to distract his attention the fame of the firms exploit on the previous day was still a nine days wonder in the den and he might had he been so inclined have spent the afternoon in discoursing to an admiring audience of his achievement but he was not so minded he was more in the humour for a football scrimmage and as today was the first practice day of the season he strolled off to the fields and relieved his feelings and recovered his spirits in an hours energetic onslaught on the longsuffering ball rather to his surprise georgie did not join him in this occupation that young gentleman to tell the truth was very particularly engaged elsewhere his proceedings during the last few days had not been unnoticed by his old patron pledge that senior after his unceremonious deposition from the monitorship by mansfield had been considerably exercised in his mind how to hold up his head with dignity in templeton he was acute enough to see that his chief offence in the eyes of these enemies had been not open rebellion or a flagrant breach of rules but his influence over the juniors with whom he came into contact over george heathcotes soul especially he saw that a great battle had been waged and was still waging in which somehow or other the two great parties of templeton seemed involved so far the battle had gradually gone against pledge just when he had considered the youngster his own he had been quietly snatched off by dick and before he could be recovered the monitors had stepped in and taken dicks side and left him pledge discomfited and a laughing stock to templeton had they pledge chuckled to himself as he thought of mr websters pencil and of the toils in which as he flattered himself he still held both heathcote and dick they were sure of their darling little proteges were they not so sure reflected pledge as they think they might even yet sue for terms when they found that by a single word he could change the lodgings of the two sweet babes from templeton to the county jail he therefore in moderately cheerful spirits allowed a day or two to pass avoiding even a further visit to webster and then casually waylaid his old fag as he was returning decidedly depressed in mind from saying goodbye to mr richardson why georgie old man said pledge how festive you look the change of air from my study to swinsteads has done you good where have you been all the morning ive just come up from the town said heathcote wishing he could get away ah trying to square somebody up eh its not quite as easy as one might think is it heathcote looked doubtfully up at his old seniors face and said nothing its a wonder to me you know said pledge turning his back and looking out of the window that your new angelic friends dont somehow do it for you theres mansfield you know one word from his lips would do the business everyone knows he never did anything low mansfield never speaks to me said georgie more for the sake of saying something than because he considered the fact important really how ungrateful of him when you have been the means of enabling him to kick me out of the sixth very ungrateful i never had anything to do with that said georgie no you dont then believe a fellow can make use of you without your knowing it you cant imagine mansfield saying to his dear friends id give anything to get at that wicked pledge but i darent do it straight out so i must pretend to be deeply interested in that little prig heathcote and much concerned lest he should be corrupted by his wicked senior that will be a fine excuse for having a slap at pledge ill take away his fag and then of course hell resign and we shall get rid of him i dont believe he really said that said heathcote colouring up and then he would say to bribe the youngster over and keep him from spoiling all and going back to his old senior well manage to fool him about our precious new club and put his name on the list this was rousing georgie on a tender point if my name gets on the list it will be because dick and coote and i ran through the hunt thats why he said rather fiercely ha ha if they could only humbug everybody as easily as they do you so you are really going to get into the club ill try if our names get on the list and you think they are sure to elect you of course youve done nothing to disgrace templeton eh the boys face fell and pledge followed up his hit theyd like you all the better wouldnt they if they heard you and your precious friends arewell quite a matter of interest to the templeton police eh my boy were not stammered georgie very red you neednt say anything about that pledge is it likely dont i owe you too much already for cutting me and talking of me behind my back and letting the monitors make a catspaw of you to hurt me oh no ive no interest in telling anybody really pledge i never talked of you behind your back and all that i didnt mean to cut you please dont go telling everybody its bad enough as it is pledge chuckled to himself and began to get his teapot out of his cupboard you see i have to help myself now said he georgies heart was touched what with dread of the possible mischief pledge could do him and with a certain amount of selfreproach at his desertion he felt the least he could do would be to fall into his old ways for this one evening it was just what pledge wanted how he longed that mansfield and cresswell and freckleton could all have been there to see it mansfield is hardly likely to trouble his head about every errand even such an important personage as you run said he in reply to one feeble protest from the boy call yourself swinsteads fag by all means you can still fag for me however it doesnt matter to me i can get on well enough without oh yes ill try said georgie that was enough pledge felt that too much might overdo it so with this triumph he dismissed his youthful perturbed protege for the night and dreamed sweetly of the wrath of his enemies when they discovered that after all he pledge was master of the situation in spite of them chapter twenty seven how the martha comes home to her bereaved friends pledge did well to sleep sweetly and enjoy his triumph while it lasted for the battle which raged over the soul of george heathcote was by no means ended yet i say georgie said dick next day as the firm took a sunday afternoon stroll along the cliffs where on earth did you get to yesterday you never turned up at football practice and skulked all the evening georgie coloured his conscience had already smitten him for detaching himself from his leader at a time of danger like the present still more for deserting him for a fellow like pledge one result of dicks sovereignty had been that the firm had contracted a habit of telling the truth to one another on all occasions it was found to be the shortest cut to friendship and a vast saving of time and trouble georgie therefore however much his inclination as moulded by pledge may have led him to prevaricate replied i was in pledges study dick whistled rather a dismayed whistle i thought you were out of that he said so did i but i dont know dick hes got to know all about our row and if i dont be civil to him hell let out on us how does he know whos told him i never did said coote i cant fancy how he heard but he knows all about it and he as good as says hell spoil our chance for the sociables if i dont fag for him beastly cad murmured dick he says you know pursued george that it was all a spite of mansfields against himthat making me swinsteads fag they knew it would make him resign it is rather low isnt it to humbug me about just for the sake of spiting someone else its all a lie georgie pledge is one of the biggest cads in templeton i heard lots of people say so webster said so he says hed no more let a boy of his go near pledge than hed fly and websters not particular and i heard cartwright say said coote by way of assisting the discussion that pledge has done his best to make a cad of you and nearly succeeded he said that said georgie hotly like his cheek has he done so dick not much said dick frankly i dont feel myself a cad said poor heathcote perhaps fellows cant always tell themselves said coote there was a pause after this and the firm walked on for some distance in silence then dick said youll have to jack him up georgie thats all about it but i tell you hell let out on us pleaded georgie and really ive only said ill fag now and then for him cant help georgie we dont want to have you made a cad of it would smash up our firm wouldnt it coote rather said coote besides said dick hes such a cad no one would believe him if he did tell of us my father would shut him up hell be down you know on tuesday heathcote breathed hard but when it came to a question of choosing between pledge and the firm it needed no very desperate inward battle to decide what had i better do he asked cut him said dick but suppose ive promised him thats a nuisance never mind were all in it so well send him a letter from the firm and tell him you cry off its a bad job of course but it cant be helped and well back you up wont we coote i should rather say so replied the genial junior partner so that quiet sunday afternoon in an unpretentious and unsentimental way a very good stroke of work was done not only for the soul of georgie heathcote but for templeton generally the firm were by no means elated at their decision for they had yet to learn what revenge the senior would take upon them still the effort and the common peril knit them together in bonds of closer brotherhood and enabled them to face the future if not cheerily at least with grim determination pledge was considerably astounded that evening just as he was speculating on the reason of heathcotes nonappearance to see cootes round head suddenly thrust in at the door and a small billet tossed on to the table pledge was getting used to small billets by this time and was rather tired of them coote as he knew was cartwrights fag he therefore concluded that cartwright was the writer of the note and that being so he pitched the paper unopened into the empty fireplace with a sneer he waited for another halfhour and still heathcote did not appear pledge didnt like it and began to grow concerned was it possible after all he had made too sure of his young friend partly to pass the time and partly with the vague idea that might throw some light on the matter he had the curiosity to pick the neglected billet out of the hearth and open it his face went through a strange series of emotions as he read its extraordinary contents our dear pledgewe think you will like to hear that heathcote cant fag for you he doesnt believe he really promised but must be excused weve made him do it because we dont want him to be made a cad he is very sorry and hopes you wont be a cad and let out about the row we are in excuse this short letter and with kind regards believe us our dear pledge your affectionate young friends b richardson g heathcote ad coote sunday afternoon this masterpiece of conciliatory firmness which had cost the firm an hours painful labour to concoct brought out the angry spots on pledges cheeks and forced some bad language from his lips the letter he had received from mansfield a week ago had been nothing to this mansfield and he were equals and a reverse at mansfields hands was at least an ordinary misfortune of war but to be coolly flouted and to have all the work of a term upset by three wretched youngsters who called themselves his affectionate young friends was a drop too much in the bucket of the spiders humiliation he stared at the letter in a stupid way like one bewildered even its quaint phrases and artless attempts at conciliation failed to raise a sneer on his lips something told him it was the hardest hit yet and that out of the mouths of these honest babes and sucklings his confusion had reached its climax if richardson heathcote and coote snapped their fingers at him in the face of all templeton who else would care a fig about him the one grain of comfort was in the possession of the secret of mr websters pencil to which pledge clung as his last and winning card how to make the most of it was the important question pledge decided not to be impatient wednesday was to be the great election for the sociables and if our heroes names appeared on the list as rumour already said they would his blow would tell best if held over till then so he sat down and acknowledged the firms note as follows my dear richardson heathcote and cootepray do as you like promises are never made to be kept by select sociables of your high character i do not understand what you mean about your row what row are you in are you in a row you dont call that little matter that i am expecting to talk to the sociables about on wednesday a row do you please give my kind regards to georgie heathcote and tell him he will need to beg hard before i trouble him to lay my cloth no doubt he has given you many interesting stories of the miserable week he spent with me last holidays in london im not surprised at his turning against me after that i hope i shall not have to tell anyone some of the stories he has told me of richardson and coote excuse this long letter and believe me my dear young jailbirds your affectionate p pledge this bitter effusion was read next morning by the firm as they walked down to the tub its full sting did not come out till after three or four careful perusals and then the firm looked blankly at one another with lengthened faces i couldnt believe any fellow could be such a cad said dick its jolly awkward said heathcote you know he was awfully civil to me in london and it does seem low to be cutting him now civil be hanged said dick he tried to get hold of you to make a cad of you thats what he did and you were precious near being one too when you came back werent you was i asked the humble georgie rather said coote everybody said so well of course said georgie if thats what he was driving at it doesnt matter so much except that it makes him all the bigger a cad what on earth shall we do about the other thing asked georgie the row we must cheek it thats all if he does us over the sociable election we cant be helped and suppose he gets us transported cant do it i tell you my father will be up here you know there was a pause and the firm walked on then georgie said i say what does he mean about the stories i told about you and coote i never told any stories that i remember i never had any to tell ah i was wondering what that meant said dick he speaks as if youd been blabbing all sorts of things i really dont think i ever did said heathcote ransacking his memory i may have said once i thought coote was rather an ass but that was all what made you tell him that said coote he asked me if i didnt think so said georgie apologetically and of course i was bound to say what i thought rather said coote but hes telling crams about you dick said georgie im quite sure of that he used to try and make out you were a sneak and a prig and perhaps i believed him once or twice but that was while i was a cad you know oh yes thats all right said dick putting his arm in that of his friend pledge would have had very little consolation out of this short discussion and if for the next two days he sat up in his study expecting that every footstep belonged to the firm on its way to capitulate he must have been sorely disappointed capitulation was the one consideration which had never once entered the heads of the honest fraternity that afternoon the town of templeton was startled by an incident which had it come to the ears of our heroes as they sat and groaned over their select dialogues of the dead would have effectually driven every letter of the greek alphabet out of their heads for the time being the event was nothing else but the arrival in port of the collier brig hail columbia with a cargo of coals from the tyne and mirabile dictu with the martha lying comfortably bottom upwards safe and sound on her deck the collier according to the account of the skipper had been running across the head of the bay on the th of june last in half a cap of wind from the shore when it sighted the martha drifting empty out to sea having sent one of his men after her to capture her and being convinced by the absence of oars or tackle that she must have drifted from her moorings empty he took her on board and as he was bound to deliver his cargo by a certain day and the wind being against his putting into templeton he stowed his prize comfortably away amidships where she had been ever since awaiting his next call at templeton with the freeandeasy business ways of his craft he had neglected to send any letter or message announcing the safety of the martha to her afflicted friends and having been detained in this place and that by stress of weather or business he had now after more than three months absence his first opportunity of restoring the lost property to its rightful owner if the simple fishermen of templeton had been inclined to believe in miracles the strange reappearance of the missing martha at this particular time must have savoured of something of the sort but being matteroffact folk they contented themselves with lounging round the boat as she lay once more on the beach staring at her and wondering between their whiffs what the solicitors and judges would say now the skipper of the hail columbia had neither the time nor the patience to discover who just now was the lawful owner of the boat some said tom white some said tom whites partners some said the pawnbroker the master disposed the problem off his mind very simply by setting down the martha on the beach and letting those who chose to claim her settle their squabble among themselves the news of the return of the prodigal was not long in spreading and by the time the templeton boys came down for their afternoon bathe it was common property our heroes heard it in the water from raggles and immediately landed and dressed they scarcely exchanged a word till they stood at the side of the martha where she lay in almost the same spot where two of them had seen her threeandahalf months ago then dick said think of her turning up at last i half guessed she would said georgie though i never expected it i say this settles our row doesnt it pretty well but of course tom white may catch it for pawning the boat he collared the money you know ah but thats not got much to do with us said heathcote well said dick we ought to back him right up while we are at it besides you know we may still get into a row for letting her go though she has turned up altogether the firm were not very sure how far their position was improved by the recovery of the martha if pledge or any one chose to tell tales or if they themselves in order to extricate tom white had to tell tales of themselves all might yet go wrong the one good thing they decided was that mr richardson when he came tomorrow would be saved the expense of buying at least one new boat for somebody our heroes as in duty bound were at the station to meet the train and give the worthy paterfamilias a reception hullo father cried dick as if he had only parted with his parent five minutes ago theyve found her i say do you see that twomasted collier in the harbour she picked her up the day after we slipped her isnt it jolly mr richardson certainly looked surprised and a trifle relieved but the matter did not yet occur to him in a jolly light its a good thing she has come back said he and now as i have a great deal to do ill say goodbye for the present i have sent a note to doctor winter to ask him to let you breakfast with me at the george in the morning thanks awfully sir said coote beaming all over mr richardson laughed im afraid i only mentioned basil in my note said he but i daresay we shall be able to have a meal together later in the day goodbye rather cool cheek of you coote said dick as the firm returned to the school cadging my father that way for breakfast very sorry said coote humbly i thought we were all in it thats all the evening passed anxiously for the boys and no less so for poor mr richardson who was buffeted about from pillar to post from lawyer to lawyer from boatman to pawnbroker in his honest efforts to extricate his son from his scrape the recovery of the martha he found made very little improvement in his prospects for now she had come back everybody seemed to be calculating the amount of money she would have brought in had she remained at templeton during the busy season this loss was estimated at several times the value of the boat and the highprincipled prosecutors would hear no suggestion of withdrawing the case until each one of thempartners pawnbroker and allhad been refunded the entire sum then when that was done the lawyers pulled their bills out of their desks and hinted that some one would have to settle them and as neither the partners nor the pawnbroker nor tom white saw their way to doing so mr richardson had to draw his own inferences and settle them himself then when all seemed settled the police recollected that they had had considerable trouble in looking after the case they had made several journeys and spent several hours on the beach looking out for the supposed thief they had also had charge of tom white for a fortnight and what with postages telegrams and office fees they were decidedly out of pocket over the whole business the longsuffering father put them in pocket and after subscribing to several local charities and consoling the reporters of the templeton observer and other such outsiders he retired jaded but comforted to the george feeling that if his mission had been successful it had cost him an amount of generosity which he could hardly have believed was in him when dick with shining morning face presented himself next morning for breakfast he little imagined how much of his fathers money was at that moment scattered about in templeton huzza father said he when his parent presented himself in the coffeeroom such a game cresswell says hell give us his study this evening so our firms going to give you a spread coote and georgie are out ordering the tucker nowkidneys and teacake i asked winter when i went for my exeat if we might have you and he said yes hed be very glad mind you come itll be a stunning spread and georgie and coote are sure to pick out good things i wish mother could come too in the face of this hospitable outburst mr richardson could hardly expatiate on the cost and anxiety of his mission to templeton a calmer moment must do for that meanwhile he delighted his sons heart by accepting his invitation on the spot he allowed dick and his two friends if it fitted in with school rules to be present in the court to hear the end of tom whites casea permission they were not slow to avail themselves of although this time they occupied a modest seat at the back and attempted no public manifestations of encouragement to the prisoner in court the case ended very simply when it was called on and tom as friendly as ever was ushered into the box no one appeared to accuse him and the magistrates rightly concluding this to mean that the prosecution had retired dismissed the case accordingly tom said thankee sir and looked quite bewildered on being told he might walk out of court a free man our heroes who had already got outside before he reached the door deemed it their duty to complete their efforts in his favour by congratulating him on his escape jolly glad we are tom white said dick as the worthy mariner came towards them it was hard lines for you and it wasnt all your fault its my father got you off you know thankee young gentleman its very hard on a hardworking mariner not to have his living if you could spare a trifle and tell the gentlemen id thank you kindly we havent got any tin to spare now said dick who knew that the resources of the firm had been wellnigh exhausted in preparation for the spread in cresswells study that evening but we wont forget goodbye old man jolly glad youve got out at last chapter twenty eight how nemesis makes her final call our heroes as they returned arminarm from the trial of tom white were conscious that in proportion as the troubles behind them diminished those ahead loomed out big and ominous they had escaped transportation at least so they told one another and although when all was said and done they had not done much towards righting tom white or recovering the martha still somehow nemesis had been choked off in that direction but when they turned their faces from what lay behind to the immediate future their hearts failed them they had staked high for the sociables their run with the harriers had been no trifle and far more important was the general attention it had drawn to themselves and to their efforts to get into the select company their candidature was a master of public notoriety and if pledge should at the last moment carry out his threat their fall would be sad in proportion when they reached templeton they found the place in a ferment fellows were going about with pencils and paper making up their lists i say said pauncefote waylaying our heroes as they entered the den vote for us i say ill vote for you oh ah said dick that means we give you three votes and you only give us one see any green you get a couple of other chaps to stick us down and then well do it pauncefote rather bewildered by this way of putting the matter went off immediately and canvassed actively among his particular friends on behalf of the firm which was very kind of him as several fellows told him look here you fellows said gosse approaching the firm with a troubled face do you know anybody in the lower fourth who isnt a cad ive got down all the other forms but i cant get a single decent name for the lower fourth aspinall said dick but hes such a muff id be ashamed to put him down aspinall would lick you lefthanded at tennis and knows more greek than you know english said dick hotly for he always looked upon the devonshire boy as a credit to his protecting arm if you call that being a muff well he is one and you arent thats all gosse received this judgment with attention and went off to have a private look at aspinall at close quarters oh i say dick said raggles whom our heroes presently found absorbed in the deepest study heres a go weve only got to put down six in each form and ive got a dozen down for ours and dont see i can cut any of them out lets hear their names said dick all serene raggles by jove thats modest youre determined hes to have one vote oh you know i believe im safe but of course everybody votes for himself go on who are the rest raggles culver pauncefote smith gosse starkey crisp calverly strahan jobling cazenove andwell i thought of sticking down one of you three for the twelfth thanks said dick we arent particular are we you chaps im not said coote you can stick me down if you like rag raggles finding not much assistance forthcoming to help him in his difficulty retired to a quiet corner and privately tossed up for each name in succession as his penny came down tails persistently both for himself and everybody else except gosse he resorted to the less risky method of shutting his eyes and dropping six blots on his paper this happy expedient was only partially successful as none of the blots fell anywhere near any of the names finally as time was growing short he put down his own name on the paper and resolved to sacrifice his other votes and when he had done it he rather wondered the idea had never struck him before our heroes meanwhile were busy with their own lists which under dicks guiding influence rapidly filled up with a set of good names when it came to their own form they agreed that being a firm and all in it they were entitled each of them to vote for the firm as a body which they did amid much mutual rejoicing at a quarter to four the big hall began to fill everybody was there fellows who were on the list sanguine anxious touchy fellows who were not on the list cross sarcastic righteous nearly every one had his paper in his hand which he furtively glanced through for the last time before the summons to deposit it in the basket on the platform as before the sixth took rank as ordinary templetonians and no distinction was made between monitor and junior eligible and non eligible when the clock struck there were loud cries for freckleton who accordingly ascended the dais and after waiting patiently for order proceeded to explain the order of election i suppose said he all of us who mean to vote have by this time filled up our papers with the names of the fellows we think most worthy to be elected on the new club youd better have a last look to see you havent put down more than thirty names altogether and that there are not more than six in any one form also make sure you have none of you signed your names to the papers as this is secret voting and its not supposed to be known how any one has voted now will fellows come up by benches and drop their papers into the basket the front bench consisting chiefly of sixthform fellows obeyed the invitation and deposited their papers in the receptacle the rest of the meeting could not forbear the luxury of a few cheers as popular and unpopular seniors presented themselves but on the whole the ceremony was gone through rapidly and in an orderly fashion among the juniors the firm walked solemnly up the room amid cheers and cries of well run puppies and gave in their votes they glanced nervously round at pledge where he sat with a sneer on his face and did not like the looks of him the sneer they would have thought nothing of but there was a serious halfdetermined look about him which was ominous the beast whispered dick hes going to do something ugh said georgie to think i ever liked him now said freckleton when the voting was over to insure the counting being fairly done i propose that three fellows who have not had the good luck to be on the list be asked to count i dare say they wont grudge the trouble and it will be satisfactory to everybody to know they see fair play for the rest hear hear will any three fellows volunteer five stood up will you five choose three among you said freckleton this was soon done and the scrutineers were in a few moments buried in their work watched eagerly by many anxious eyes it took a good while but to our heroes as they sat and watched pledges ugly look the end seemed to come all too soon there was a loud hum of excitement when the list as finally made out was handed solemnly to freckleton i think if you dont mind said the hermit passing it back as i am an interested party it would be better if one of you read it all right said the obliging scrutineer gentlemenunaccustomed as i am to public speaking i beg to read you the list of the sociables club i dont see my own name on the list but perhaps youll consider the fag we three have been put to this afternoon is a public service for the good of templeton if so please remember the poor scrutineers at the next election cheers and laughter now for the list better only read the names of the elected ones in each form and not the number of votes suggested freckleton lucky freckleton said so remarked the scrutineer or i should have told you that his name is at the top of the poll by a very long start tremendous cheers but as im not to let out figures all i can say is hes in and so are crossfield cartwright swinstead frith and mansfield for the sixthform it was curious to notice the effect of this announcement on the meeting generally and on the boys specially concerned as name followed name without that of the captain fellows looked round at one another in something like consternation after all the captain of templeton was the captain of templeton and those who had not voted for him had made sure other fellows would but when five names were read out and it was found that even swinstead and frith were elected a sudden tide of repentance set in which found vent in an unexpected cheer as the captains name followed templeton felt it had had a narrow escape of making itself foolish and the cheer was quite as much one of relief as of congratulation mansfield may have understood it he had kept his eyes steadily on the reader with a slight flush on his quiet face and fellows who watched him could not tell whether the peculiar gleam which passed his eyes as his name was read was one of triumph or vexation whatever it was every one knew the captain would be altered neither in purpose nor motive by the incident jupiter would be jupiter still whether in olympus or out of it and templeton on the whole felt that had the vote gone otherwise it would have had quite as much blushing to do as the defeated hero the scrutineer continued his list in order of forms of our particular acquaintance birket hooker duffield braider and aspinall all got safely landed while bull wrangham and spokes were passed over templeton in fact was a very good judge of honour when it was put to the choice and even the enemies of the new club could not help admitting that the best men on the whole were the elected ones a grim silence fell on the hall as the scrutineer said now gentlemen the upper third the following are elected richardson dick caught his breath and felt he dared not move a muscle pledge was looking that way and as the boys eyes and his enemys met the cheers of the den sounded feeble and the shouts of the firm were spiritless pauncefote dick started again at this and shook off the spell that was upon him how dared pauncefote come between him and his firm if fellows voted for himdickwhat on earth did they mean by not voting also for georgie and coote he faced defiantly round towards the reader and waited for the next name smith dick quailed as he listened to the mighty cheer with which pauncefote welcomed his chum into the realms of the select pauncefote and smith were partners they hunted in couples they wrote novels together and here they were side by side while the firm was cruelly severed member from member surely nemesis was having a fling too many if this was her doing heathcote ah about time too thought dick as he raised his voice in a defiant cheer hed like a quiet five minutes with the fellows who had dared to pass his chum by in the voting but at any rate georgie was safe and if only coote came next the firm could afford to snap its fingers at its constituents cazenove what fat cazenove jammed in between the firm and its junior partner dick and georgie glared at him scarcely able to repress a howl at the sight of his smiling expanse of countenance it had never occurred to any of them that the ballot may part friends whom not even a sentence of transportation could have severed and they looked on now more than half bewildered as the scrutineer read out the sixth name for the sixth place said he there appears to be a deadheat calverly and coote have both the same number of votes whats to be done mighty lycurgus say you retire shouted dick to the astonished calverly on whom the announcement had fallen with as much surprise as it had on his friends dont you do anything of the sort shouted gosse youre are as good as that lot stick in of course he will shouted others so calverly announced he would stick in and coote had better retire a suggestion coote did not even condescend to notice he was in his firms hands and the firm were determined to fight the thing out till they had not a toe to stand on the simplest way said freckleton is to vote again for the two what do you say gentlemen of the den all right roared the den whats it to be ballot or show of hands show of hands shouted most of them do you agree to show of hands you two said freckleton or would you sooner have ballot id rather have show of hands said calverly so would coote shouted dick and georgie then those who vote for calverly hold up one hand said freckleton it was a big show and the scrutineers as they went from bench to bench counted now for coote every one could see it was a terribly close affair as dick and georgie scanned the benches their hearts sank at the sight of so many not voting another deadheat i expect said pauncefote the suggestion drove dick almost frantic coote must come in or the consequences would be awful now you fellows he cried starting up and addressing templeton generally as the scrutineers started on their rounds all together for old coote dont forget his trot with the harriers this simple election speech called forth a cheer and better still sent up two or three more hands loud cries of order from the top end of the room prevented any further appeal and amid dead silence the scrutineers finished their work for coote announced the spokesman there are then did the firm go mad and lose their heads then did they yell till their throats were hoarse and wave their hands till their arms ached then did they link arms as they sat victorious and forget the sorrows of a term in that one paean of victory very close they heard freckleton say as soon as order was restored are you satisfied calverly woe betide calverly had he ventured to be otherwise all right he said meekly cowed by the mighty triumph of the firm then coote is in announced the scrutineers the election was over and freckleton was about to disperse the meeting when it was noticed pledge was on his legs trying to speak a low hiss and groan went round the hall but curiosity to hear what the deposed monitor had to say at such a time restored order three boys alone knew what it all meant and their faces blanched and their limbs shook as they looked out from their retreat and awaited their fate perhaps said pledge as this is a public meeting you will allow me though i have not the proud honour of being a sociable and although i believe i am not a monitor either to ask a question i assure you i do it in the interests of templeton and of your immaculate club i dont suppose any one will thank me for doing it and i am glad to say i have ceased to expect thanks you may attribute any motive you like to me the worse it is probably the better you will be satisfied i certainly shall not trouble to tell you my motive except that it is for your good all i want to ask is whether this meeting is aware that three members of the new club are at this moment under the eyes of the police for a disgraceful act of theft committed in the town and if so whether you think that fact increases their claims to become members of a club which is to be a credit to templeton the speech was heard in dead silence but as it closed a storm broke forth from all quarters of the hall name sneak cad name the angry spots blazed out in pledges cheeks as he faced the storm and heard the cries you want the names do you you think perhaps i do not dare to give them i do dare though i stand here singlehanded the three boys are richardson heathcote and coote and if you dont believe me ask them another dead silence followed this announcement and all eyes turned to where the firm sat pale and quivering before however they could say a word mansfield rose and stepped up on to the platform pledge has for reasons best known to himself charged three boys here with theft unlike his usual manner he makes the charge in public before the whole school and that being so it is only fair the whole school should hear from him and his witnesses if he has any what the theft is the captains words were greeted with cries of approval from the meeting and every one turned now to pledge he stood a moment irresolute scowling at his archenemy and longing to be able to include him in the accusation he brought against his proteges then with a halfswagger he stepped on to the platform if the captain thinks im afraid to do what he asks hes mistaken i dont believe in holeandcorner business and as he has challenged me to accuse his three young friends in public and bring my witness i will do both what witness groaned heathcote in a whisper to dick dont talk to me hissed dick between his teeth go on said mansfield to the accuser thank you so i will a fortnight ago gentlemen a small boy went down to templeton wait interposed mansfield we must have names what boy a small boy named coote began pledge coote at the sound of his name halfbounded from his seat he knew he was in it but what on earth had any proceedings of his a fortnight ago to do with the loss of the martha went down to templeton to a shop what shop demanded mansfield to websters shop replied pledge beginning to be ruffled by the captains determined manner the firm started suddenly whatever was coming while spending his time in the shop the young gentleman as young gentlemen sometimes do stole a silver pencil there was a pause and every eye turned towards coote who gaped at the announcement and stared at his partners as if he had been confronted with a ghost on dicks countenance a curious change was taking place horror had already given way to bewilderment and bewilderment was in turn giving way to something which actually looked like a grin the young gentleman proceeded pledge had two dear friends called richardson and heathcote to whom he confided his stroke of business and who joined him in concealing or disposing of the stolen article dick could remain silent no longer to the horror of his firm and the bewilderment of every one elsemost of all pledgehe burst into a laugh which sounded weird in the dead silence order cried mansfield sternly go on pledge i heard of the theft from thefrom webster immediately after it occurred and for the last fortnight have been watching the culprits here he was interrupted by a hiss which the captain immediately suppressed and they have actually admitted their guilt in begging me not to tell of them to you at this point dick started up excitedly and began i should like to say but the captain stopped him you will be heard shortly first of all we must hear pledges witness certainly i told webster to call up at halfpast four he doesnt know what for youd better have him in ill go and fetch him no said the captain aspinall will you ask him to come in chapter twenty nine how templeton turns a corner aspinall was not absent three minutes altogether but the interval seemed interminable our heroes as they sat huddled together pale defiant but bewildered dividing the attention of the meeting with their accuser thought it a century more than once dick boiling over started to his feet and attempted to speak but every time mansfield quietly suppressed him and told him to wait till the proper time came coote was once more racked by doubts as to whether he had really taken the pencil after all he was morally certain he had not but coote was a youth always open to conviction the door opened at last and aspinall appeared ushering in the bookseller who looked like a man who suspected a trap and was prepared to defend himself at the first sign of attack he had received a note in the morning from pledgeof whom he had seen or heard nothing since his visit to the shop a fortnight agoasking him to be sure to call at the school at on a matter of business when aspinall summoned him he concluded it was to go to pledges study but when instead of that he found himself suddenly ushered into a congregation of the whole school it was small wonder if he felt bewildered and sniffed treachery mr webster said mansfield pledge here has just been publicly accusing three boys of theft he says they have robbed you and we want you to hear his statement and tell us if it is true please repeat what you have to say pledge in mr websters hearing the stationer with inquiring face turned to pledge who despite some vague doubts which were beginning to disturb his confidence smiled affably and said oh sorry to bring you up mr webster just at your busy time but i was telling my friends here about that little affair of the pencilcase you know which was stolen from you and as they dont seem inclined to believe me i thought the best thing would be for you to tell them about it yourself the countenance of the bookseller underwent a marvellous transformation as the speech proceeded when pledge had ceased he exclaimed pencilcase why bless you mr pledge i found that a fortnight ago this announcement was the signal for a howl such as templeton had rarely heard the pentup scorn of an afternoon broke out against the accuser as he stood there pale and stupefied staring at webster it was all mansfield could do to restore order the gust had to blow itself more than half out before even he was heeded look here you fellows said he dont let us lose our heads we want to hear the rights and wrongs of the case fairly hadnt you better wait till thats done before you turn the place into a bear garden the rebuke told and the meeting relapsed into silence you never told me that snarled pledge youve been fooling me you never asked me mr richardson knew he was in the shop just after i found it of course he was sneered pledge he neednt have been if thats what you mean hed nothing to do with it bless you its an old story now id almost forgotten it you forgot too that you asked me to recover it for you and you let me go on while all the time you had it you offered to get it back i never asked you you said you had an interest in the young gentlemen and you never thought it worth while to tell me the thing had turned up i told mr richardson and said i was sorry for the fright he and his two friends had had it never struck me youd go on bothering about it or id have told you fact of the matter is ive never seen you from that day to this is that all you want to say said mansfield turning to pledge i can only say this said pledge that i never saw three boys imitate guilt better if they hadnt done it i should like to ask them why they quaked in their shoes whenever they met me and why they sent me a round robin asking me not to tell about them i can tell you that shouted dick springing up you neednt wait mr webster said mansfield thank you for coming up thank you gentlemen said the tradesman im sorry to be mixed up in the matter mr pledge can go somewhere else for his books good day gentlemen good day said several voices when order was restored dick was discovered red in the face mounted on a form propped up on either side by his faithful allies i can tell him that he cried and all of you too we thought he knew about another row of oursabout tom whites boat you know it was us let her go at least i did and georgie was there too and cootes been in it since he came up tom white robbed us coming back from grandcourt and we were awfully wild and were cads enough to slip his boat on the beach theres been a regular row and we expected to be transported we backed tom white up all we could and tried to get him off i told the magistrate it was us did it and he said id put him in a jolly fix pledge was always talking to us about the police and the county gaol and that sort of thing and we made sure hed found out all about it and was going to do us over it we never guessed he was running his head against that pencil business or we could easily have put him right were awfully sorry about the boat you know my governor came down and squared most of the fellows and its all right now and toms got let off pledge has got a spite against all our firm because were not going to let georgie be made a cad of by him and we told him so didnt we you chaps yes we did shouted the chaps yes he thought continued dick warming up hed make georgie go and fag for him again by threatening him about this row but we backed georgie up and wouldnt let him and then he promised to show us up at the sociables and so he has dicks oration was too much for the feelings of his audience they laughed and cheered at every sentence and when finally he subsided between his two supporters quite short of breath and wondering at the length of his own speech they forgot the captains rebuke and finished their howl against pledge to the bitter end does pledge want to ask any more questions asked mansfield pledge laughed bitterly no thank you im not quite clever enough for them perhaps you are right said the captain drily and if you have nothing more to say perhaps you would like to go pledge hesitated a moment amid the howls which followed the captains words then he coolly rose and ascended the platform his face was flushed and his eyes uneasy but otherwise impudence befriended him and he stood there to all appearances neither humiliated nor dismayed gentlemen he began but a fresh storm arose and drowned his voice the uproar continued till mansfield called for order and said i think in ordinary decency you ought to treat everybody fairly on a day like this it will do you no harm and it will be more worthy of templeton gentlemen said pledge thank you for being ordinarily decent although it wouldnt break my heart if you didnt hear me its not as easy as you may suppose to stand up singlehanded against a school full of howling enemies its easy for you to howl when everybody howls on your side suppose you change places with me and try to speak when everybodys howling against you however i dont complain somebody must be on the losing side and as all of you take care to be on the winning ill do without you pledge certainly knew his audience he had hit them cleverly on a weak pointthe point of chivalry and had he been content to rest where he was he might even yet have saved a following for himself in templeton but he went on our three young friends have told you a pretty story which has highly amused you it amused me too they told you i had a spite against them i must say its the first ive heard of it as a rule sixthform fellows dont waste much time in plotting against boys in the third but richardson evidently thinks he and his friends are considerably more important than other boys of their age and brains suppose i were to tell you that instead of my having a spite against any one somebody has for the last year had a spite against me and that somebody is the holy captain of templeton suppose i told you that he dared not show it openly but made use of my wretched fag and his friends to tell tales and trump up stories about me suppose i told you he and his fellow monitors resorted to a mean dodge to get me to resign my monitorship and then got up this precious club in order to softsoap their own toadies for helping them to do it what has mansfield done for templeton i should like to know hasnt he done more harm than good by his hectoring manner and his favouritism and fussiness isnt he one of the most unpopular fellows in templeton didnt he all but get ignominiously left out of his own wonderful club and what do you think of him when he gets up here and tries to pass as a model of justice when as likely as not he has prearranged the whole affair and told every one what part he is to play in the farce he sat down amid a dead silence conscious he had overdone it a little less and he might have convinced some that what he said was true but when he talked such palpable nonsense as that of the captain having arranged the whole scene which pledge himself had got up the meeting took his whole tirade for what it was worth and received it in mocking silence freckleton to the relief of everybody got up and said i did think we might be spared quite such a ridiculous speech as that to which we have just listened however i have nothing to say about its comic side what i want to say is this it is perfectly true mansfield had a spite against pledge so had i so had cresswell so had eleven out of twelve of all the other monitors and ill tell you why when a fellow deliberately sets himself to corrupt juniors entrusted to his care as he corrupted young forbes howls when he sets himself to upset every vestige of order and good form in templeton when he tells lies of everybody and never tells the same lie correctly twice running laughter when he cudgels his brains how he may make mischief between friends cheers from the firm and get the credit of being the only friend of the very fellows he tries to ruin then i say its no wonder if mansfield and you and everybody has a spite against him i dont say much for the templetonian that hasnt i dont mean the spite which would lead any one to kick him thank goodness we can let him know what we think without wearing out our shoeleather laughter he talks in noble strain about being singlehanded and on the losing side thank goodness he is singlehanded and on the losing side thank goodness too he is lonely and finds no one ready to keep him company in his low ways he talks about mansfield continued the speaker waxing unexpectedly warm gentlemen if you knew mansfield as well as i do you would be as angry as i am to hear the lies this miserable cad tells mansfield gentlemen would i know risk his life for the good of templeton he may not be popular hes told me often and often he knows he isnt but i say to him and i think you will say too go on old man cheers youve done more good to templeton in a term than other captains have done in a year and if the only thing you had ever done had been to rid us of the cad pledge you would have done the school a service that any one might be proud of loud cheers there ive used hard words i know and almost lost my temper but its best to speak out sometimes pledge has heard what ive said and i shouldnt say anything different behind his back the hermit sat down amidst a roar of applause in which the sixth joined as heartily as any the effect of his simple straightforward speech was immediately apparent when mansfield rose to dismiss the assembly for a moment he stood there unable to speak for the cheers which greeted him the honest indignation of his friend had touched a keynote which suddenly awakened templeton to the conviction that its captain was a hero after all and the almost pathetic reference to his unpopularity roused them to an enthusiasm of repentance which was almost startling at length silence reigned and the captain said with the faintest suspicion of a tremble in his voice i think weve all had enough of this you fellows theres the chapel bell this meeting is over by a curious sort of instinct the meeting instead of immediately dispersing remained seated while pledge rose and moved to the door he had got halfway there before he noticed his isolation and a sudden flush of scarlet in his cheeks betrayed his emotion at the discovery it was too late to retreat to his seat and too late to pretend not to notice his position with a pitiful attempt at a swagger he completed his passage to the door and left the hall as he reached the door a low hiss rose from the middle of the assembly but a sudden gesture of appeal from the captain stifled it before it could spread and the door closed behind the retreating figure amid a silence which spoke volumes the meeting waited a minute or two and then quietly rose and dispersed every one feeling that from that afternoon a new era in the history of templeton had been inaugurated our heroes who in the midst of later excitements had halfforgotten their own share in the afternoons proceedings were among the first to get out into the quadrangle and once there their manner changed from one of dignified solemnity to one of agitated expectancy in a quarter of an hour their guest was due in cresswells study and between now and then what had they not to do who shall describe that wondrous spread or the heroes that partook of it how when mr richardson arrived punctual and hungry he found a table groaning under every delicacy the ingenuity and pocketmoney of three juniors could provide how the kidneys were done to a turn and the teacake to a shade how jampots stood like forts at each corner of the snowy cloth how hot rolls and bath buns lorded it over white loaf and brown how eggs boiled three minutes and five seconds by heathcotes watch peeped out among watercress and lettuces how rosy apples and luscious pears jostled one another in the centre dish and how tea and coffee breathed forth threatenings at one another from rival pots on the same tray it was a spread to make the mouths in olympus water and drive hebe and ganymede to despair mr richardson who in the guilelessness of his heart had brought a small plumcake as a contribution to the feast positively blushed as he saw that table and hid his poor mite back in his pocket for very shame the firm when they did go in for a thing did it well and no mistake and if mr richardson had paid up royally for them during the day he should find that more than one could play at that game and that they would pay up royally at night like a brave man the good father expanded his appetite and regardless of consequences took a little of everything the firm took a great deal of everything and never was a more jovial meal cootes cup seemed to be always on the road to or from the pot and georgie was for ever mistaking the dish of teacake for his own private plate while dick bolder than any of them insisted on giving his parent ocular demonstration of the wholesomeness of each several dish until that good gentleman began to think it was a good thing he was not a daily visitor at templeton jolly brickish of old cress giving us his study isnt it you chaps rather said georgie i think we might almost leave him out something i dont particularly want this egg said coote who had already accomplished two and was gently tapping a third if you think hed like that how would it be to ask him in would you mind father not at all said mr richardson really relieved at the prospect of a fifth appetite to help off the banquet so dick went in search of his senior and found him in freckletons study he felt constrained to invite both seniors to join their party and somewhat to his alarm they both accepted gladly dick need not have been alarmed though for both the provisions and the company held out wonderfully mr richardson was delighted with his boys seniors and they were no less delighted with him the whole story of tom whites boat was rehearsed again as were also the other stories of the term finishing up with the eventful assembly of the afternoon it wasnt a pleasant affair at all said cresswell but thunderstorms do clear the air sometimes and i think templeton understands itself better now of course we shall have pledge still said freckleton but as long as fellows know what he is hes not dangerous its when he gets hold of young greenhorns like heathcote and coote he does mischief he never got hold of me said coote i was an ass to let him make a cad of me said heathcote i had warning you know the ghost wrote to me before id been here a fortnight what ghost asked mr richardson cresswell laughed nobody knows said he though some of us guess who was it you asked dick i got a letter too you know no it wasnt i then by jove it must have been freckleton exclaimed dick interpreting the guilty look on the hermits face was it i say dominat qui in se dominatur said the hermit in a sepulchral tone yes my boy but keep it mum i shant waste my latin over you again in a hurry your letter really made me sit up said dick gravely well i expect said cresswell if templeton goes on as shes doing now the poor ghost will be hard up for a job mansfield is the right man in the right place and hes more right than ever now that he is said freckleton warmly i can tell you fellows that in spite of his iron hand hes one of the humblest fellows that ever lived i believe he prays for templeton night and morning and thats more than a lot of us do i fear after all said mr richardson thats the best sort of christian a man who lives up to what he believes will lead fifty where a man who believes more than he acts up to will barely lead one it strikes me said freckleton its no joke to be a leader of men or boys either is it dick oh i dont know said dick its no good as long as you dont go quite straight yourself youve got to go square yourself i suppose before any one else will back you up yes said coote we couldnt back you up you know while you were going on as you were could we dick didnt look like it said dick with a grin but i expect dick thinks it was worth his while to have to go steady said cresswell its done your firm no harm has it rather not said the firm returning to their supper the end
