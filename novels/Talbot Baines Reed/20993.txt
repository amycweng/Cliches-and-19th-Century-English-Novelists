sir ludar a story of the days of the great queen bess by talbot baines reed for regular readers of reeds works this will be a surprise not a mention of a school or its inhabitants set in the late sixteenth century and couched in slightly archaic english it narrates the adventures of an apprentice to a printer but this young lad gets caught up in all sorts of adventures and is especially drawn to ludar a young irish rebel there is a good deal of travelling by sea and though this sounds convincing as reed writes it there is not much depth in it in other words you do not need a deep knowledge of rigging and seamanship to follow what is happening as you do with for instance the work of whg kingston there is a slightly dreamlike feel about this book we jump from one situation to the next without sometimes being sure how we got there try the book for yourself and see what you think nh sir ludar a story of the days of the great queen bess by talbot baines reed a story of the days of the great queen bess chapter one how i saw my queen every story whether wise or foolish grave or gay must needs have a beginning how it comes to pass that my story begins on a certain day in may in the year of our lord i can never although i am far on in life now properly explain for that was not the day on which i was born that adventure had befallen me eighteen years before at the parsons little house in felton regis most people who write their histories have a pride in dragging their readers back to the moment when they first hallooed defiance to this wicked world but i since i have clean forgotten the event must een confess that my story does not begin there a like adventure chanced often at the parsonage and at nine years of age i reigned king absolute over a nursery full of her majestys subjects who called me brother and quailed before my nod like helots before the crest of a spartan but as i say all that is neither here nor there in my story nor in truth is that grey september day when on the tail of a country haycart i rode tremulously at my dear fathers side into london where with much pomp and taking of oaths i was bound apprentice body and soul to master robert walgrave the printer in the presence of the worshipful master wardens and assistants of the company of stationers who enriched themselves by shillings pence at my fathers cost and looked upon me in a hungry way that made me tremble in my bones and long to be out of their sight before they should order the bill of fare for their next feast that was a day in my life truly but it was ancient history when my story begins i had grown a big lad since then and was the king of clubs without temple bar and the terror of all young prentices for a mile round who looked up with white cheeks when i swaggered by and ran with their tails between their legs to hide behind counters and doorposts till i was out of sight no nor yet does my story begin even at that sad dayalackwhen i stood by my widowed mother at the open grave of him who had been the pillar of our house and the pride of our lives humphrey my boy she had said as she placed her hand on my arm and led me like one in a dream from the place it is god who has takenhe will surely also give shall i count all lost with a stalwart arm like this to lean upon then she kissed me and i for very shame dried my eyes and held up my head ah me that was but a year before the world had still moved on the grass covered his grave and still my story lacked a beginning how comes it then that this day in may of all others should stand up like a wall as i look back over my life and seem to me the beginning of all things perhaps this history may showor perhaps he who reads it may come to see that i was right when i said i could not explain it it was a great day in london within and without temple bar and for me if for no other reason it was famous because on that day for the first and last time i saw the great queen elizabeth about eight oclock while i stood as was my wont setting types in my masters shop i looked from the window as was also my wont and spied two falconers in their green coats with a trumpeter riding in the midst ambling citywards in a moment i dropped my stick and with it alack a pieful of my masters types and was out cap and club in the strand shouting till i was hoarse god save her majesty on the instant from every shop far and near darted prentices and journeymen shouting and waving capssome because they saw me do so some because they guessed what was afoot some because they saw even now the flutter of approaching pennons and caught the winding of the royal huntsmens horns along the strand the queen was coming i went mad that day with loyalty i kicked my fellows for not shouting louder and such as shouted not at all i made to shout in a way they least expected through the open door of master straws the horologers i spied his two prentices deaf to all the clamour basely gorging a hasty pudding behind the bench what shouted i bursting in upon them and seizing each by his cropped head what ye gluttonous pair of porkers is this the way you welcome her majesty into our duchy is this a time for greasy pudding and smacking of lips come outside and shout or ill brain you with your own spoons whereupon forgetting what i did i dipped the white face of each in his own mess and dragged them forth where to do them justice they shouted and howled as loud as any one and now the strand overflowed from end to end with loyal citizens from the windows above the faces of the city madams beamed and the white necks of their daughters craned while behind with half an eye on us clubs below peeped on tiptoe the maids at each shopdoor stood the grave forms of our masters thinking perhaps of a lost days profits and setting the cost thereof against the blessings of her majestys happy reign at the roadside beggar scholar yokel knight and noble jostled in a motley throng but the sight of all that crowd was the prentices who swarmed out into the road and raised our shouts above the clanging of saint clements bells and the trumpets of the royal servants twas no pageant we had come out to see giants and whales and bottomless pits and salvage men and the like we could see to our hearts content on lord mayors day and the gilded barges and smoking cannon on the rivers side but it was not every day her majesty ambled through the city on her hunting horse and passed our way with her gallants for a days sport in epping woods as for me i had no eyes or throat for any but that queenly woman as she cantered boldly on her white palfrey a pace or more ahead of her glittering courtiers had any one said to me that elizabeth was that day neither young nor lovelyhad anyone even dared to whisper that she was not divinei would have brained him with my club where he stood for a moment her head turned my way she waved her handit had a little whip in itand her lips moved to some words then as i rent the air with a god save your majesty she was past at temple bar the lord mayor and sheriffs arrayed for the hunt with buglers and dogs attending stood across the way and with mighty ceremony and palaver admitted her to the city woe betide them for all their gold collars and maces had they kept her out but the halt short as it was served our purpose for there was no more going back to work on a day like this to the front clubs and lead the way shouted i with what voice was left me it was enough for the lads without temple bar they closed on me with a cheer and followed me at the run past the gaping court ushers past the royal jockeys past the queen herself heaven bless her past lord mayor sheriffs and yapping beagles through the echoing gates of temple bar till we stood at the head of the procession and longed with a mighty longing that someone might dispute the way with us but we had no work for our clubs that morning as we moved forward our body like a growing snowball was swelled by the prentices of each ward shouting as lustily as we make way and hurling defiance like us on all the queens foes by land and by sea even the gay sparks of the temple gave us no handle for a sally for they shouted with the best of us and so down fleet street and in at the ludgate past the square tower of saint pauls and along merry cheap we passed our numbers swelling at every step till it seemed as if all london was out escorting her majesty through the city as you passed below bow church you could scarcely hear the clanging of the bells for the shouting of the people at the new exchange there was like to be a battle at last for the prentices of the bridge had heard the uproar from afar and swarmed down upon us in a flood so that had we not held our own stoutly we should have been driven back upon the royal huntress herself stand if you be men and fall in after us i shouted ho ho answered they since when was the printers devil outside the bar made mayor of our town follow you us it was not a time for bandying words from behind us came a shout pass on pass on room for the queen and at the word we charged forward shoulder to shoulder and brushed those unmannerly mercers and barbersurgeons aside as a torrent the nettles that grow on its bank let them follow as they list the queen went hunting today and was not to be kept standing for a score of london bridges if we knew it after that we passed shouting up the cornhill and so on to the bishops gate where at length we halted and made a lane in our midst for her majesty to ride through never i think did monarch ride down a prouder road than that walled fourdeep for the length of two furlongs by youths who would fain have spilt their blood twice over to do her service and who since that was denied them flung their shouts to heaven as she passed and waved their caps clubhigh i think in truth she needed no telling what kind of road it was for as she cantered by her face was flushed and joyous her head was erect and the hand she waved clenched on the little whip as though she grasped her peoples hand then in a moment she was gone thus for the first and only time did i set eyes on the great maiden queen and when all was over and the clattering hoofs and yelping hounds and winding horns were lost in the distance i came to myself and found i was both hungry and athirst the crowd melted away some returned the way they had come some slunk back to their deserted shops i to finsbury fields for i accounted it a crime that day to worki would as soon have set up types on lord mayors day this day belonged to her majesty and i would een spend it in her service wrestling and leaping in the meadows and training my body to deeds of valour against her foes so i called on my clubs to follow me and they came and many besides for those who might not see the queen hunt might see her loyal citizens jump and on a day like this it was odds if the nimblest prentices in all london were not there to make good sport therefore we straggled in a long crowd to moorgateman and maid noble and prentice alderman and oysterwoman jesting and scolding as we jostled one another in the narrow way and rejoicing when at length we broke free into the pleasant meadows and smelt the sweetness of the early hay already i spied sport for there before us swaggered the mercers prentices of london bridge ready to settle scores for the affront they had received at the new exchange ho ho quoth i with vast content tis time we had dinner my lads if it comes to that so we besieged the booths and fortified ourselves with beef and ale and felt ready for anything that might happen twas no battle after all for as illluck would have it just as we faced them and bade them come on the alderman of the bridge ward rode up what a shame on you to mar a day like this with your boyish wrangles is there no wrestlingring or shootingbutts or leapingfence where you can vent your rivalry without flying at one anothers throats like curs call you that loyalty have we no enemies better worth our mettle than fellowenglishmen this speech abashed us a little and the captain of the bridge prentices said sulkily i care not to break their heads worship theres little to be got out of that come lads we can find better sport in the jugglers booth his worship came in a good hour for you cried we thank him you can slink away on your own legs this time and need no one to drag you feet foremost off the fields come come said the good alderman away with such foolish talk lets see a match struck up i myself will give a new longbow and a sheaf of arrows to the best jumper of you all what say you the highest leap and the broadest ho there added he calling a servant to him bid them clear a space for a match twixt the gallant prentices of the bridge and the gallant prentices without temple bar come boys were i forty years younger id put you to it to distance me but my jumping days are gone by and i am but a judge then we gave him a cheer the bluff old boy and forgetting all our quarrel in the thought of the longbow and arrows we trooped at his horses tail to the open space and doffed our coats in readiness for the contest a great crowd stood round to see us jump the scene remains in my minds eye even now prentices bareheaded squatted crosslegged on the grass bandying their noisy jests and finding a laugh for everybody and everything behind them stood a motley throng of sightseers men women and children for the most part citizens but interspersed here and there with gay groups of gentlefolk and even some who wore the bright trappings of the court behind them the beggars and pickpockets plied their arduous calling and in the rear of all at a little distance wandered the horses of the gentles cropping the fresh grass with no eye to the achievements of temple bar or london bridge beyond them soared the windmills and the hills of isledon and hoxton it was a scene familiar to me for i had often taken it in before and yet for a while today it seemed new and my eye as i waited at the post wandered here and there to detect what it could be which made all seem so strange after a while i discovered that wherever else they roamed my glances returned always to one bright spot close by where stood a maiden it seemed to me i had never known what beauty meant till i looked on her she was tall and dressed more simply than many a citizens wife and yet her air was that of a goddess every movement of her head bore the signs of queenliness and yet in every feature of her face lurked a sweetness irresistible at first sight as you saw her tall erect with her short clustering hair and fearless eyes of blue you would have been tempted to suppose her a boy in disguise yet if you looked a moment longer the woman in her shone out in every step and gesture her cheeks glowed with health and maidenly modesty and her eyes that flashed on you one moment almost defiantly dropped the next in coyness and delicious confusion she stood there conspicuous and radiant amid the jostling crowd yet wholly heedless of the glances and whispers and perplexity she drew forth as for me i scarcely knew where i was and when the alderman cried make ready now i obeyed him as a man in a dream but i recovered myself of a sudden when presently i saw the captain of the bridge prentices who was a shorter man than i leap over the bar as high as his own shoulders and heard the triumphal shouts of his fellows after him one by one came the picked men of either side but at each leap the bar sprung into the air and the champions retired worsted from the contest then came my turn i dared to dart a hurried glance where stood the only onlooker whose applause i coveted and she turned her head towards me so i took my run and cleared the bar a match a match cried the crowd closing in a step a match between will peake and humphrey dexter and take my sword and cloak shouted a bridge boy who owned neither if will peake do not overjump the printers devils head this made me angry not that i cared for the gibe but because i disliked that one there should hear me called by so graceless a name well we jumped once more but this time i dared not look anywhere but straight before me yet i cleared the bar whereupon the bridge boys vaunted themselves more soberly and he who had offered his cloak and sword now offered only his belt set the bar two points higher i cried and clear me that will peake if you can at that our lads rent the air with shouts and will peake pulled a long face for the bar now stood level with his eyes though it only reached my chin it fell out as i hoped he jumped and the bar sprang six yards into the air as he missed it then our prentices made up for the silence of those of the bridge and this time the gamester offered not so much as a shoe lace for all that i must clear the bar if i was to make good my challenge and i drew a long breath as i stood a moment and glanced round yes her eyes of blue were on me her lips were the least bit parted and a glow of expectation was in her cheeks so i took my run and cleared the bar with an inch to spare then as i heard nothing of the shouts which yet deafened me and durst not so much as raise my eyes the cheery aldermans voice cried so master dexter hath won the high jump see if he also win the broad clear away there and stand back good people to give our brave lads fair play when i took courage at last to look up i saw a sight which made the blood in my veins tingle she stood still where she was but next to her had squeezed himself a smirking gallant bravely bedizened who looked round impudently into her face and whispered something in her ear to me it seemed as if at first she was heedless of his presence then hearing him she turned upon him a startled gaze and flushing angrily moved a scornful pace away this i saw while the alderman was saying the first leap is yours master dexter see you set us a good lead i leapt scarcely thinking what i did and leapt badly for though one by one the others failed to reach it will peake reached it and lit in my very footprints a match again cried everyone and a close match too the gallant had made up to her again and was tormenting her sweet ear once more with his whispers she stood rigid like a statue with her eyes before her showing only by the heaving of her bosom that she was aware of his unwelcome presence you keep us waiting lad cried the alderman jump unless you mean to yield the victory to your adversary i jumped listlessly again and again alighted within an inch of my former distance and once again will peake landed in my very hoof marks a mortal match cried the crowd one leap more said the alderman and if that does not decide he was there still and worse than before had caught the little hand that hung at her side in his the colour had gone from her face i saw that she bit her lips and for one moment her eyes looked up appealingly and so it seemed to me met mine then with my heart swelling big within me i walked to the starting point and ran for my last leap it was with all my might that i jumped now and i cleared two good feet beyond my former distance so that the onlookers could scarcely shout for amazement but i waited neither for their shouts nor for wills jump for i knew he could not reach me with beating heart and fingers digging into the palms of my hands i walked straight to where she stood pale and trembling her right hand was still his prisoner and his cursed lips were still at her ear but not for long before he was aware i had seized him with a grip which made him howl and next moment he was reeling and staggering a dozen yards away in the midst of the enclosure it all happened so quickly that even she seemed scarcely to know of her deliverance till she saw him draw his sword and look round for me then to draw the combat away from her i went on to meet him with my club and before his first onset was done his sword flew over his head in two pieces it was an old trick and cost nothing to a prentice outside temple bar and while he looked round bewildered after his weapon i took him by the nape of his neck and the cloth of his breeches and walked with him to the pond hard by where i left him and so was well rid of him by this time the fields were in an uproar so intent had all been on the leaping to see if will peake would equal my jump which heaven help him he could not do that the gallant was swinging over the pond before anyone understood what was afoot then they broke up the ring and closed in on us so that i having dropped my burden amidst the duckweed was fain to lose myself among the crowd and give one and all the slip i thought i had done so for while all stood gaping and jeering as they fished out the sputtering hero from his peagreen bath i sauntered back unheeded to the place where last i had seen her for whose sake all the pother arose at first i feared she had fled but on looking i spied her in company with an elderly woman who soothed and chid her in turn and began to hurry her from the place but when she saw me she brushed the old servant aside and with a blush beckoned me to her shall i ever forget the vision of her as she stood there stately and beautiful with hand outstretched smiling on me with mingled pity for my shyness and gratitude for my service my brave friend said she and her voice fell like music on my ears i have nothing but my poor thanks to give thee but they are thine the crimson now came to my cheeks for it hurt me to hear her talk of payment i would gladly do it all again said i nay she laughed once is enough surely at least for me then i wished the ground might swallow me for i deemed she thought me a fool she would come put in the old servant in an accent which though i had never heard it before i took to be scotch or irish i told her myself what to expect among a crowd of rude rascally city sparks that dont know a lady when they see her and when they do dont know how to behave themselves it serves her right say i and its myself will see she frolics no more i warrant youa low unmannerly pack of curs with a plague on all of you never heed my old nurse said the young lady sweetly she and i were parted in the crowd and but for you brave lad i might have rued my folly in coming hither more than i do thanks once more and farewell come judythank good master dexter for taking better care of me than ever you did and then come away i stood like a mule gaping after them as they went unable to stir or say a word till they were lost to view then as i turned came a shout at my ears there he standsthere stands the villain seize him and hold him fast he shall learn what it is to assault a captain of the queens guard ho ho there were a round dozen of them and one on horseback but i knew of two dozen better than they within call so i shouted clubs clubs to the rescue and began to lay about me chapter two how i served a disorderly printer my assailants were a mixed crew some being lackeys of the halfdrowned gallant some constables of the watch others idle swashbucklers ready to lend a hand to any cause and against any man for a pot of ale but they took no advantage from hiring themselves against a poor prentice from without temple bar for they got sore heads for their pains i myself could not do over much till my comrades arrived for i was in an open place and could not see all sides of me at once so after three of them had gone down i was wellnigh being mastered by the rest but for the timely help of my honest clubfellows foremost among these who should come but honest will peake my late enemy who when it was a matter between prentices and court bullies forgot all old sores and laid about him like a man behind him came a score or two of honest lads some of my ward some of others and between us all you may judge if the numskulls who set upon me had a merry time of it we left them mostly on the ground in a sorry plight and the rest we sent packing back to them that owned them with a message to send a few of better mettle than they if they wanted to catch us then as the messengers did not return we gave loud cheers for the queen and went each our several ways as for me i was in no humour for the noisy company even of my own fellows and excused myself from a march home through the wards i made a pretext to go and find my coat and cap and let them depart without me for i was haunted yet by the memory of that fair face and the sweet music of her voice and i wished to be alone moreover it vexed me grievously that any servant of so gracious a queen as ours could be base enough to offer a helpless maiden a discourtesy and that in chastising him i must needs put an affront on the dignity of her majestys court but that weighed less when i remembered what i had seen and i would fain have had the doing of it all again despite her gentle protest so i waited till the crowd was gone and then paced moodily enough citywards but at the entrance to the fields there overtook me a handful of horsemen bravely equipped amongst whom as i looked round i saw the author of all this mischief himself his gay cloak hid the stains of the duckweed and as for his sword he had borrowed another from one of his men mounted as he was it was not likely he should notice a common prentice lad like me yet i resolved notice me he should even if i went to the pillory for it so i stood across the way and said farewell brave captain the pond will be deeper next time and humphrey dexter will be there to put you in it he turned about crimson in face and cursed savagely as he saw mefor he knew or guessed shrewdly enough who i was then calling loudly to his servants an angel to the man who catches the knave cried he seize him and bring him to me whereat being only one footman to a dozen horse i gave a clean pair of heels i soon shook off my pursuers who liked not the narrow alleys and winding lanes of our city where their horses stumbled and they themselves missed their way one only whether from stubbornness or the hope of the angel kept up the hue and cry and being mounted on a nimble pony followed me close at length it seemed shame to be running from a single man so at the next corner i turned and waited for him he ran at me with his weapon and called loudly on the watch to help him but i pulled him from his horse and had him up against the wall before he could cry againyet not before he had pricked me in the arm with his blade he was a stout little man and a brave one but by no fault of his he was powerless in my grip i wrenched the sword from his hand and held him by the throat till he signalled a surrender tell me first your masters name on your knees and with an oath lest i find you lie said i in none too sweet a mood he had naught else he could do so falling on his knees took heaven to witness that his masters name was david merriman a captain in her majestys service lodging now at the court but presently about to join the queens forces in ireland that was enough for me tell master david merriman i shall remember his name and bid him remember mine against we meet nextand so farewell i left him puffing for breath against the wall and departed but hearing the watch raise a new hue and cry at my heels i quickened my steps and so after many a tedious circuit ran into my masters shop just as he was about to bolt the door for the night he received me sourly as indeed i expected so said he this is your faithful service which you swore to render me and you a parsons son that should know what an oath is he was for ever taunting me with my dear fathers holy calling and it vexed me to hear it i am also under oath to serve my queen said i and i put that before all and you serve her by drunkenness and rioting and breaking the heads of her loyal subjects i have heard of you this day how comes it that your fellow prentice peter stoupe a plague on peter stoupe said i for i disliked him and as for drunkenness i was never drunk in my life nor by my own leave a rioter by whose leave then asked master walgrave by the leave of them who behave themselves as knaves said i getting hot as i thought of captain merriman and had they twenty skulls and a crown on each id crack em had they no crowns they would not be worth the cracking said a cheerful voice behind us and there stood mistress walgrave herself come husband said she soothingly be not too hard on humphrey he is but a lad he serves us well most days when the queen is not to the front i warrant thee robert thou wast a merry prentice once thyself that i never was said master walgrave with an acid face but get in with you sirrah and to bed i had a mind to leave you on the other side of the door this night to cool your hot blood and he bolted the door whilst i slunk up to my garret peter stoupe was already asleep and snoring and as he lay clean across the bed i must needs arouse him to take his own side and make room for me what humphreyi give god thanks to see thee back said he drowsily i feared something was amiss there was a rumour that you lodged this night in newgate you listened to a lie then said i and it is not true is it that you naughtily assaulted a gentleman of the court and what if i did i demanded alas humphrey think of the trouble it is like to bring on our good master and mistress have you no thought for anyone but yourself yet i give thanks thou art safe sofarmygoodhumpi and here he rolled off to sleep and left me in quiet yet not in peace for i could not sleep that night for many an hour for my life seemed to have taken a strange turn round since morning before today i had thought the prentices life the merriest life in the world i had cared for nobody and it had troubled me little if nobody cared for me strange that now i felt like a greyhound in the leash longing to be anywhere but where i was besides i had more solid grounds for wakefulness however well today i had given my pursuers the slip i guessed i had not heard the last of captain merriman and his merry men they would find me out and i might yet become as peter had said a lodger in newgate and worse than that a cause of trouble and distress to good master walgrave and his lady for however poorly i esteemed my master i could ill afford to bring harm on his family for my mistress was ever my champion and my friend and her children i was wont to love as my own brothers and sisters so i spent half the night kicking in my bedof which kicks master peter received his full shareand rose very early resolved to try what hard work could do to cure my unrest no one was stirring that i could hear and i went down the stairs silently and took up my labour at the case my stick lay on the floor where i had dropped it the morning before and alack the squabbled type lay there too a sight to make a man sad slowly and painfully i saved what i could and was setting myself to make good the rest when my ears caught a strange sound below my feet it was a beating sound followed by the dull fall of something and on listening it came and went every two or three minutes i had guessed more than once before now that under the house was a cellar although i had never been there nor indeed knew how to approach it for there was no opening front or back to the outer world that i knew of and if there at all it must be pitchdark and hard to breathe in and yet the noise i now heard if it came from anywhere came from below i looked about carefully hoping for a crack in the floor through which to solve the mystery but crack there was none only as i looked further i saw that the reams of paper which lay usually near the press were moved somewhat to one side now as my master was always particular that the paper should lie always in the same place it seemed strange to me they should be so disturbed but on going nearer i perceived the reason for there usually hidden to view was now exposed a cunning trapdoor opened by a hinge and sunken ring in the boards now having found so much it would have been out of all nature had i gone back to my work and thought no more of the matter besides the strange noise still continued i lifted the door cautiously about an inch and peeped below the cellarfor cellar it waswas bright with the light of a lamp by which i could plainly discern my master or as i believed for a moment my masters ghost with coat off and sweating with the heat of the place working like any journeyman at a printingpress on which lay a forme of type which he inked with his balls and struck off in print with the noises which had perplexed me above then i pulled up the trap and called out master walgrave spare yourself so much toil i pray you and let me help you he turned round with a face the colour of dough like a man who had just received an arrow in his vitals then he rushed as if to put out the lamp but his presence of mind returned before he got that length and he demanded of me angrily enough how i dared to play the spy on him and come where i was not bidden i replied i was no spy and as for coming where i was not bidden had i known who it was down there i would have stayed where i was but being there might i help him i asked at the work he answered angrily no and bade me begone whereupon i returned to my case and waited till he should come up to the earths surface meanwhile i recalled not a few rumours i had heard about master walgrave one was that though he was only licenced to have one press and seemed to have no more yet it was whispered of some he had another in hiding which now i found to be true moreover as i was in stationers hall one day a month or more ago to pay the fee for a register i overheard timothy ryder the beadle and another talking about my master he prints more than he registers said one and he should have his ears cropped for his pains said timothy did i but know where to have him then seeing that i waited for they had forgot to give me my acquittance they dropped talking suddenly by all this i guessed that my master was no favourite with them of stationers hall and moreover that he was addicted to disorderly practices contrary to the acts binding printers but so well did he keep his own secret and so busy was i with my own affairs that it all passed from my mind and now only returned when i saw that what had been said of him was true he came up from below presently and i was ready for him master said i i have displeased you against my will and i have seen what you would fain have kept a secret you shall find it remains safe with me for i am your prentice and bound to you therefore cheer up he brightened at this you are a good lad said he it concerns no one what i do below tis an amusement of my own no more as he stood there pale and anxious with weary eyes it seemed to me an amusement which yielded him but little sport however i did not dispute the matter and we said no more about it but after that day i observed that my master although he seemed to like me less was more sparing of his bitter words than heretofore whereby i guessed plainly enough that the amusement he spoke of were it to come to the ears of the master and wardens of the company would get him into no little trouble mistress walgrave his wife as i said was ever my good friend she was no common woman and how those two made a match of it always puzzled me before she came to england so she had told me often she lived at rochelle in france where her first husband was a merchant in lace then when he died of the plague ten years ago she came with her two young children the elder being but five years to her mothers home in kent where robert walgrave being on a visit to canterbury met her and offered her marriage and in truth she had been the brightness of his house ever since and her two french children jeannette and prosper now tall girl and boy lived with her as did some three other urchins who called master walgrave father sweet jeannette was my favourite for she was lame and had her mothers cheery smile and thought ill of no one least of all of me whom she called her big crutch and tormented by talking french many a summer afternoon when work was slack i carried her to the waterside where she might sit and watch the river flowing past and to reward me she made me read her about king arthur and his knights and stories from mr chaucers book much of which i understood not though being a printers prentice i knew the words one still evening as we sat thus not a week after my adventure in finsbury fields she broke in on my reading with voila see there master humphrey mais comme elle est jolie i dont know what you say when you talk like that mistress said i for i liked not the french jargon although by dint of long suffering it i had a better guess at the meaning of it often than i cared to own look i say said she would not she be a queen of beauty for the knights of old to fight for i looked where she pointed and there gliding within a few yards of us passed a boat and in it drinking in the beauty of the evening sat a maiden at sight of whom i felt the blood desert my cheeks and the hand that held the book tremble her old companion was beside her dozing and the waterman lugged lazily at his oars humming an air to himself jeannette happily was looking not at me but at her and so my troubled looks escaped her i never saw a face more fair said she tis like a picture out of mr chaucers book and now that she is past the day seems darker go on reading please kind master humphrey i tried to go on but i blundered and lost my place while my eyes tried to follow the boat would she but have looked round could she but have known who it was that watched her could i myself have dared even to shout or call alas the boat glided by and her form stately erect fearless lost itself in the distance what dreamed shea queenof an uncouth london prentice master dexter said jeannettes soft voice presently for five whole minutes you have been trying to read one little sentence and it still lacks an ending what ails you nothing mistress but i am a bad scholar and the words are hard i pray you forgive me besides it grows late tis time we went in so i carried her in to her mother and then ran wildly back to the rivers edge if by good hap i might see that lady return or at least catch sight of her boat in the far distance but i did neither the tide still ran out and amongst the many boats that dotted the water citywards who was to say which was hers as i returned by way of the temple to my masters house i met peter stoupe my fellow prentice i am glad i met thee he said a man came to me just now in the shop and said be you humphrey dexter i told him no and asked him what he wanted he told me that was his business i bade him wait where he was and i would fetch you for i had seen you go out but he went away grumbling saying he would choose his own time not mine alas humphrey you have brought us all into sad trouble by your naughty ways what trouble are you in sirrah said i wrathfully it matters little to you what comrade is laid by the heels so that you get your platter full morning and evening but our good master and mistress he began but i waited not for him and went quickly home that night my master called me as i was going to my bed and said humphrey there is like to be sad trouble here on your account a warrant i am told is out to seize you you know best for what but if it be true you struck a gentleman of the queens household i struck a dog who affronted a defenceless maiden said i and i put him in the pond to boot and i care not if i go to the cage for it but i care if i harbour you here i am like to receive the punishment which belongs to you and if i give you up i lose a good prentice i can say thus much for you then said i not heeding his flattery i had better go away myself i never guessed he would take to this but to my surprise he did i and your mistress think so too humphrey whilst the hue and cry lasts you are better anywhere than here when it has ceased you may safely return meanwhile as fortune will have it i can employ you still in my service then he told me how he desired to send a letter to a friend of his at oxford which being of the gravest importance he wished delivered by a trusty messengeras he took me to be therefore if i was ready to forward him in the matter i might avoid my pursuers and do him a service to boot i hailed the offer with joy and thankfulness i longed for a change somewhere i cared not where and if skulk i must an errand like this would please me vastly more than hiding for a week in my masters cellar be secret said he meaning i suppose stoupe tomorrow early be ready to start to kingston where you may get a horse meanwhile your mistress is herself making you a cloak which shall be proof against all weathers so goodnight humphrey and see you rouse yourself betimes in the morning chapter three how i rode posthaste to oxford the summer sun had not been up long before i too was out of bed early as the hour was my master and mistress were both astir and bade me make a hearty meal in view of my journey while i ate my master said as the tide runs now humphrey you may make a good part of your journey by water and twill do you no harm to be your own waterman indeed no said i for i hated to sit idle in a boat should you reach brentford on the flood there are many who will ease you of your craft and bring her back meanwhile tis an easy road by the rivers bank to kingston we have a good friend there one master udal the minister with whom this letter will procure you a welcome and at his house you are to lie tonight he will lend you a horse and put you on the way to oxford and see here humphrey said my mistress holding up a brave cloak of dark red cloth as long as to my knee here is what will comfort you against the cold morning air and change you into a veritable highwayman on the road it was a brave cloak indeed so weighty and well padded that had my journey been not to oxford but to the poles it would not have been amiss see you take care of it continued my good mistress it is your gift and your making said i so i can readily promise that i can lend you a hat to match it said my master and a sword i have a sword of my own said i proudly for i had taken one from mr merrimans bully a week ago well well the weather promises fair for your journey do whatever the minister bids you and return speedily when your business is over here is a purse which will cover all your needs with something to bring back to me at the end and so farewell humphrey be secret and talk to no one on the way without necessity my mistress also bade me farewell and between them they hurried me off to the wherry in my haste i was near leaving behind me my brave new cloak but my master seizing it came with it angrily and said is this your care sirrah if you end your journey no better than you begin it twill be little enough to boast of which i considered fuss enough about a matter which concerned only my own person and not his errand for what was my cloak to him yet i felt ashamed to have neglected my mistress kindness and i told him so whereat he was pacified the tide served me some three hours and more in which time by dint of hard rowing i reached brentford where i left the boat being weary and hot for the sun was now high and fierce i resolved to dine before i went farther and sought the nearest tavern for that purpose it was an illlooking place and kept by an illlooking host but hunger is no respecter of persons and as he called me your worship and set before me a brave leg of pork with ale to keep it in countenance i forgave him his ugly face and fell to without more ado when i came to pay him and pulled out the purse my master had given me he grew monstrous civil and offered to take me across the ferry himself which he did with one of his men and halfway across the two set upon me with one accord and thought to rob me but i being new to travel and so suspecting everybody was ready for them and knocked their heads soundly together for their pains i also lightened the boat of my hosts servant bidding him get to shore some other way so my host fearing a like ducking for himself took me over quietly enough and never asked a fare from there i floundered through the swamps with the river on my right hand till i came to kingston where it was not long till i found master udals house he was a little grave man whom i might have swallowed at a gulp and yet he had an air about him i durst not disobey and an eye which when i caught it made me think of my sins he asked me many questions about master walgrave and his manner of life which i answered plainly all except one or more that concerned the secret press in the cellar your master keepeth one press out of sight said he if that be so said i tis no wonder if i know nothing of it he smiled then he labours at it himself without your aid if you say so sir no doubt but he does master udal smiled again thourt good at a secret lad and ill tempt thee no more whereupon he did what was worse and began to question me about my own ways and that searchingly so that i was fain to plead weariness and asked for my bed this was even worse for being a lonely man he had but one bed in the house and that was his own and that he might have the more of my company he came to bed too he was a good manthis master udalfor he prayed long with me at the bedside and talked comfortingly to me about my home and the snares of my city life but with his grave talk he would not let me rest even when we lay in bed and it was too dark to see his face i felt his eye upon me still and was fain to confess myself to him like a papist to his priest but when i told him tremblingly that i loved a maiden he gave a grunt of displeasure and turned over on his side and left me in peace and so that fair maiden little as she knew it rescued me that night from a great tribulation and it were strange if in gratitude i did not dream of her master udal roused me betimes and after reading again my masters letter asked me was i a horseman i said i could sit a horse with any prentice in finsbury fields even at the water leap then he asked had i a cloak i said proudly yes my dear mistress had given me one with which i would not part for two others as good he said that was right unless master penry wished it who is master penry then i demanded him you go to see at oxfordand you are to do everything he tells you even if it be to part with your cloak here is a letter to him at saint alban hall you are to go to him privately and submit to him in all things it all seemed strange enough to me but i said i would do as i was bidden for all that i resolved that if it came to parting with my brave cloak to a stranger i would be hard put to it before i suffered so much wrong to my mistress goodness then master udal instructed me carefully as to the way showing me by what roads i should ride and where i should halt for the night he also cautioned me about speaking to strangers by the way and bade me beware lest i fell among thieves then he went to the stable and fetched his horsea sorry nag and ill accustomed to my heavy weight then he fetched me some food to carry in the saddlebag and after a prayer that god would protect me and further the business on hand he let me go i was glad to be alone in the sweet summer morning air with the lark carolling high above my head and the newmown hay scenting the meadows and the early sun slanting through the lime trees and the halfawakened cattle standing to watch me as i passed it was enough to make any heart glad and if i myself sang in tune with the birds as i ambled in it was because i could not help it the road was hard to find betwixt kingston and hounslow for it was across country and the narrow lanes twisted and twined so that had it not been for the sun i should soon not have known if i was going north south east or west except a few yokels trudging to their work and now and then a blithe milkmaid calling to her cows i met no one these looked hard at me and wondered what such a one as i in cloak and sword and hat wanted there at that hour but i let them guess and pushed on along the rivers bank to twickenham and then over the wild heath and through the woods till at last i came to hounslow where i halted to rest my beast as i was leaving that place there overtook me an importantlooking man with two menservants mounted following him he seemed friendly disposed and talkative and as he too was going to oxford we agreed to join company and fell into conversation he asked me my errand and i replied truly enough i went to visit a gentleman at oxford he told me with not a little bluster he too went to wait upon a gentleman at oxford but he guessed the varlet would get little joy out of his visit why said i are you an officer of the courts of law or a bailiff yes and no said he i serve a great master and go to catch a great rogue then being warmed by the ale he had had at hounslow and my questions he told me he was no other than the bishop of londons man and that wind had come to his grace that some evildisposed persons had been issuing a wicked and scandalous libel against the queen and her bishops and clergy and that the arch offender in this bad business was known to be a certainhe would not say whoat oxford he told me how he would give a finger off his hand to have the rascal laid by the heels ay and the printer too who had vilely lent himself to the business he waxed so fierce and eloquent in defence of the good bishops that i promised him should my urgent errand in any way permit it he might count on me to assist him in his righteous hue and cry for i loathed all that set itself up to vex our gracious queen and the peaceful order of her kingdom the man commended my loyalty and we talked of other matters he doing the most of ittill we came to colnbrook where finding my nag slow and his business being very urgent he left me and rode forward appointing to meet me two days hence at the inn at iffley should i still be of a mind to do him and the bishop a service all this talk had made me uneasy for he had hinted broadly that a close watch was being kept on all disorderly printers and i remembering my masters press in the cellar hoped no suspicion might attach to him and resolved to warn him when i returned home from colnbrook i rode solitary in the heat of the day so hot was it that i was tempted to take off my cloak and lay it across the saddle in front of me it was my vanity and the pride of being seen in so brave a garment that hindered me and it fell out well that it was so for just over the heath as you come upon topley there sprang out upon me a rider who without any parley let fly at me with a pistol and but that the ball badly aimed glanced off from the stiff padding of my cloak i had not been here to tell this tale before he could load again i spurred my horse hoping to close with him but the wretched jade was no match in pace for his and he got away but not before i had let fly my club at him from twelve yards away and dealt him a crack on the cheek that should have caused him to bear me in mind for a week i expected him back after that but being dazed by the blow and seeing that i was not the gentleman he took me for he spurred off and i waiting only to pick up my club and make sure that the bullet had done me no harm did the same and rode on to maidenhead here an odd adventure befel me for going to the inn of the place where i meant to lie that night i found it in possession of a roystering crew of gallants who sat and quaffed their sack and sang lustily roaring and quarrelling enough to deafen a man when by dint of hard pushing i had made myself a seat at the table and called for my supperfor i was hungrythey gave over their wrangling and began to look hard at me there was much whispering among them and one said i know the rogue in spite of his cloak call me an ass if there be not a shaven crown under that hat of his if you mean by that said another cavalier that hes a jesuit here the company took up the word a jesuita jesuit they cried and at the sudden accusation i turned crimson and blushed like a girl smelt out cried the company to the gallows with him then it seemed to me to be time to go who called jesuit said i pulling out my sword they laughed at this and one of them cried if you be not drink to the queen where you stand and confound her enemies i took off my hat that they might see i wore no monkish tonsure and drank that shows nothing cried another they might curse the pope himself and yet be all the better jesuits a crew of cowards said another who never dare be what they seem or seem what they are then said i if that be so i can easily prove i am a true and loyal subject of the queen let who will come on two at a time and take back his lie at the point of my sword and i put my back up to the wall and cast my cloak back over my shoulder whereat they laughed again and he who had spoken first said if i doubted it before i am sure of it now for no one but a jesuit could feign a swagger like that come lets hang him and have done with him come on said i i tell you im no jesuit but a loyal london prentice on a message for my master to oxford if you hold it english that twenty men should set upon one then what a plague on you cried my opponent before i could finish why did you not say what you were before we have something better to do than hang prentices get you gonea stick to your back is what you want unmannerly dog fetch it then said i for before i leave here i shall finish my supper and if you like not my company you may go elsewhere i think they were abashed at that for they tried to laugh it off and go on with their carouse indeed i think they meant only to frighten me all the while so perhaps i was a fool to take it all in earnest however that be i finished my supper and bade them all goodnight whereat they laughed again then as an hour of daylight remained i called for my horse and resolved to ride to the next inn and lie there for the night i had no cause to complain of the company here it was the house midway betwixt maidenhead and henley as you come to bisham for i had the place to myself nor did i wonder at that when i saw the pigsty of an inn which it was the landlord a villainouslooking rogue demanded to finger my money before he would admit me and as for my horse i had to see to him myself for there was no one about the place to do it for me however a nights lodging was all i wanted and having brought away the stable key in my pocket i pulled my bed across the chamber floor wrapped myself up in my cloak and slept like the seven sleepers the man eyed me surlily enough in the morning and told me if i doubted his honesty i might go and lie somewhere else next time which i promised to do for i guessed when he talked of honesty that he had tried to steal my horse in the night and being baulked of that had had it in his mind to rob me we parted in dudgeon but i felt well out of that place with my purse in my pocket and my horse under me as i rode through henley who should overtake me but a troop of horsemen among whom i recognised not a few of the roysterers who had used me so scurvily at maidenhead the night before i drew aside to let them pass for i wanted none of their company but onehe who had voted to hang mecame up in a friendly way come lad said he look not glum our gallants will have their jest tis no jest to call a loyal subject of the queen a jesuit still less to hang him said i well well said he next time well call thee puritan and burn theethat will make the balance straight meanwhile join us and scour that frown off thy visage and he clapped me on the back with a whack which made my nag prick up her ears and jump a foot off the ground it took me some time to follow his last advice but as the fellow seemed honest though a fool and he and his comrades made little more pace than i did i made the best of what i could not help and ambled beside him at the tail of the troop then he told me that they were going to wales to get together provisions for an expedition to ireland and offered me good pay and plenty of knocks if i would only join them we shall have a merry time of it said he with a merry man for captain at this i pricked my ears what is his name asked i what i say captain merriman a gallant officer and a desperate man of war i know he is that said i with the blood rushing to my temples you know him then said the man and you will join us ho ho who would thought i could find him such a recruit before i serve under your captain merriman said i losing temper you may do what you promised last night and hang me up on the nearest tree he stared at me when i said that why what mean you that is my business said i shortly but if you would take him a message you may tell him there is as good duckweed in ireland as ever there is in finsbury fields and that humphrey dexter says so the man burst into a laugh did ever i see such blustering roarers as you city prentices i warrant you captain merriman will shake in his shoes when i tell him i do not know if i should not run you through the body for talking thus of a gallant gentleman but ill spare thee humphrey this time tis too hot to fight not for me said i if that is what you mean he laughed again at that come along said he clapping me again on the back join us and you shall tell captain merriman all about the duckweed yourself and a proud man he will be i warrant you i was sorry now i had bragged for nothing but contempt came from it as indeed had i been a little wiser i might have known so i said no more about the matter and let my comrade talk which he did to his hearts content telling me of the battles he had fought in and the spoils he had taken and the triumphs he had seen thus talking we beguiled the time till we came to where we had to part company for the troop went by way of abingdon whereas i following master udals directions continued on the east bank of the river to oxford he bade me think over what he had said about joining the wars and told me where he might be found during the next week or two ask for tom price said he they all know me and on the day youre lord mayor of london which i take it is not far hence find me a humble seat below the salt at your lordships table and so farewell i felt it lonely enough after my company had left besides which i clean lost my way and was forced at last to seek the river and guide myself by that heavy work it was for the rivers bank was swampy and often impassable with bushes and woods so that i had to go miles out of my way to circumvent them leading my horse by the hand at last when i hardly knew where i was night fell and wornout with weariness and hunger i made for the first house i could seewhich chanced to be an innand resolved to go no farther that night had i gone on i am certain of one thing which is that this veritable history would never have been written for i should not then have met the wild person who just as i stood unharnessing my nag at the door dashed past me and flung himself into the house chapter four how i met a runaway scholar as i entered the poor kitchen of the innfor it was a sorry shed altogetherthere rose to meet me a figure which if i live to methuselahs age i shall not easily forget he was tall and had the limbs of a giant his hair was tawny and inclined to red and hung in disorderly waves on his shoulders his raimentfor he had flung his scholars cap and robe to a corner of the roomwas poor and ragged and seemed scarcely to hang together on his brawny back his arms were long and nervous and the hands at the end of them twitched uneasily even while the rest of his body was motionless his carriage was erect and martial and you knew not whether to admire most the weight and solidity of the man as he stood still or the tigerlike spring in every limb when he moved yet it was not one of these things which made me stand almost in awe as i saw him it was his face which if ever a mans face deserved the name was beautiful i cannot explain why for i have seen features more finely carved and better proportioned in faces which never seemed to me so beautiful as his i have seen more strength of mouth more light of eyes many a time and yet never looked twice i have seen faces as noble which never struck me as his did i know not how it was i think it was the expression which moulded all his face into a look partly wild partly noble partly sad and wholly gentle for as you watched it it changed like an april day from cloud to fair from thunder to lightning from night to day yet whatever came or went the look of a gentle man remained man did i say he was scarcely my senior even if he was my equal in years and his beardless chin and the boyish glow on his cheek made him seem younger than he was but why all this picturedrawing of a stray oxford student whom while i talk about him i keep standing in front of me on the floor of that poor kitchen you shall hear it was not to do me obeisance that he rose as i entered his dirk was drawn and his face was thunderous as he took a step forward and spoke i want you not so leave me my lord burleigh himself could not have spoken the words more royally although he would have spoken them with less music and more of an english accent in his voice now moved as i was by the look of my companion it offended me to hear a loyal london prentice talked to thus like a dog or worse like the drawer of the inn by your leave said i and it was not often i said as much to any man unless you be the landlord of the place i have as good a right to be here as you then said he solemnly and as i thought sadly guard yourself i whipped out my sword in my boastfulness i thought i had too great an advantage with my long weapon against his short and not too highly tempered blade and i resolved with myself not to run him through if i could otherwise satisfy him but my tune changed as soon as we closed i could do nothing my fine thrusts and parries wherewith i was wont to set finsbury fields agaping all went for nothing he got in at me over my guard under my guard beside my guard and through my guard nor could i even do myself justice for while i fenced i was fascinated by the flashing of his eyes and the noble gracefulness of his every motion in two minutes he had me disarmed pinned up against the wall as helpless as a silly ox in the grip of a tiger it mortified me as much as anything to find that when he had me thus at his mercy he dropped me half disdainfully half pitifully and put his dirk back into its sheath will you go now no said i doggedly for so chapfallen was i that i wished nothing better than that he should do his worst with me at that he looked at me in solemn perplexity and i expected to see his hand back at his girdle but to my confusion he only shrugged his shoulders and turned away this completed my humbling for no man had ever disdained me thus before i might easily have reached my sword which lay at my feet and run him through before he could face round yet he did not even deign to notice me and walked slowly to the fire where he sat with his back to me i could stand it no longer and crossed the room to face him you have beaten me said iand the words were hard to saytake my sword for by heaven i will never wear it again and fare you well the cloud on his face broke into sunlight as he sprang to his feet and taking my arm said no stay here and let us be friends i am too poor to offer thee supper but heres my hand i took his hand like one in a dream i could not help it strange as it seemed sir said i whoever you be i strike hands on one condition only that is that you sup tonight with me im a london prentice but i know when i meet my match what that had to do with his supping with me i know not but i was so flurried with my late defeat and my enemys sudden friendliness that i scarcely knew what i said if that be the price i must even pay it said he solemnly so long as we be friends so i called to the man of the house to bring us food quickly and while it was coming set myself to know more of my new comrade yet when i came to question him i felt abashed for he looked so grave and noble that despite his ragged clothes it seemed presumptuous to ask him who he was while i doubted how to begin he spared me the trouble are you going to oxford said he i am said i i was to reach there this night but lost my way and even yet do not know how near i am not an hour from the cursed place said he giving his students cap which lay on the floor at his feet a little kick then it agrees not with you said i agrees said he and then dropped silent far more eloquently than if he had spoken a volume pray sir said i after an awkward pause do you know one master penry of saint alban hall he laughed at that the welshman verily i know him what do you want with him i am to deliver him a letter from my master can you take me to him no said my companion for i shall never enter oxford again is your term done then i asked for me it is said he i have been here two months and will have no more of it but are you free to leave i askedfor my curiosity was roused free said he i am here that is enough if my tutor come after me there will be two men who will never see oxford again i pitied his tutor whoever he was when he said that but where are you going then i asked tonight i shall lie here the man of the place is my friend and will shelter me though i have nothing to pay him tomorrow i shall take the road here our supper came in a fine big trout from the river and a dish which mine host called mutton but which i smelt to be venison it smote me to the heart to mark the struggle in my comrades face to keep down the ravenous joy which for a moment hailed the coming in of these good things but the ecstasy lasted only a moment and when i bade him fall to he said indifferently he had no appetite and wanted nothing but it was a bargain said i so he took a small helping it plainly cut him to the quick to receive hospitality from a prentice and he would i think as soon have starved but for his promise i feigned not to notice what he took yet i could not help marking the hungry way in which he devoured what was on his platter then when it was done he rose and went to his seat at the fireplace while i finished my supper at the table before i had done i filled my cup as was my wont and drank to her majesty bidding my guest do the same he came gravely to the table at that and filled a mug of ale to the brim heres to my queen said he this struck me as odd for his tone and manner were as if he were drinking to another toast than mine yet i did not dare to question him about it and only hoped so noble a youth was one of her majestys loyal servants our host had but one small room with a single bed in it to offer us which accordingly we shared for the night nor was it long before we were each sound asleep forgetful of our troubles and quarrels and weariness before we fell over however my comrade said when go you into oxford tomorrow betimes said i for my message is urgent you will have trouble enough said he there is little love between town and gown there and unless you like knocks you had better send your letter by the hand of one who does i mind no knocks said i groaning a little at the memory of some i had received that very evening besides i am bound to give my letter by my own hand then said he take my cap and gown they are no use to me and may be a passport to you lend me your cloak in exchange it will serve to hide me while it would but betray you as an intruder inside oxford this cloak said i is the gift of my dear mistress in london but perhaps your advice is good i will go into oxford in a scholars garb and you meanwhile shall shelter here in my cloak till i return about noon is it a bargain as you please said he and fell asleep i was the more pleased with this exchange as i remembered what master udal had said concerning the fancy master penry might take for my brave cloak it would be safer here protecting my comrade than flaunting in the eyes of the ravenous youth of oxford when i arose next morning with the sun my bedfellow still slept heavily i could not forbear taking a look at him as he lay there his face in sleep with all the care and unrest out of it looked like that of some boyish resolute greek divinity his arm was flung carelessly behind his head and the tawny hair which strayed over the pillow served as a setting for his finecut features but i had no time for admiring greek divinities just then and slipping on the scholars robe and cap which to my thinking made me a monstrous fine fellow i left my own cloak at his bedside and taking my letter started on my errand afoot in the clear morning i could plainly see the towers of the city ahead of me before i had been long on the road but it is one thing to see and another to touch the inn where i had lain was at the rivers bank and yet no road seemed to lead to it or from it as for mounting the river bank that was impossible by reason of the thickets which crowded down to the waters edge i had to tramp inland through marsh and quagmire in which more than once i thought to end my days till after much searching i hit upon the road which led to the city before i entered it the bells were clanging from a score of steeples and many a hurrying form clad like myself crossed my path as i gained the east bridge there was no small tumult in progress for a handful of scholars on their way to morning lecture had fallen foul of a handful of yeomen bound for the fields and were stoutly disputing the passage when i appeared i was claimed at once by the scholars as one of them and willynilly had to throw in my lot with them the fight was a sharp one for the yeomen had their sticks and shares and sickles and laid stoutly about whereas the scholars were unarmed all except a few at last when two of our side had been pitched head first over the bridge our leaders seemed inclined to parley but the countrymen puffed up with success and calling to mind perhaps some old grievance called no quarter to the river with them everyone and closed in then the scholars had to fight for their lives and i forgetting i was not really one of them girt my gown about me and shouting to them to follow me charged the varlets they were sorry then they had not ended the matter sooner two or three of them went over the bridge to look for our comrades beneath others were soundly cudgelled with their own sticks while our fists slowly did the rest all of a sudden up rode two or three horsemen at whose coming our men showed signs of panic while the townsmen cheered loudly and made a fresh stand this vexed me sorely for i had supposed the battle at an end wherefore i made for the chief horseman and putting out all my strength pulled him off his horse scarcely had i done so when my comrades behind raised a shout of tis the mayortis the mayor flyfly and off they made dragging me with them to think that i a loyal london apprentice should have lived to assault a mayor but there was no time for excuses or reproaches the citizens were at our heels shouting and threatening and as they followed the whole town turned out in hue and cry one by one the gownsmen dodged like rabbits into their holes leaving me who knew nothing of the city almost alone at last the enemy were almost up to me and i was expecting every moment to be taken and perhaps hanged when as good luck would have it just as i turned a corner there faced me a wall not so high but that a good leaper might get over it over i scrambled just as the pack in full cry rushed round the corner then i laughed as i heard their yapping and grumbling and questioning what had become of me but i gave them no time to find out for crossing the garden into which i had fallen i quickly slipped out at the gate into a fair cloistered square where adjusting my battle stained gown i marched boldly up to the house at the gate and knocked a porter came at my summons and demanded surlily enough what i wanted i am a fresh man here said i and have lost my way i pray you direct me to saint alban hall saint alban hall said he art thou a scholar of saint alban hall no said i but i bear a message to one there master penry by name how comes it demanded the porter who by the tone of him might have been the chancellor himself that you wear that gown sirrah that is my business said i seeing it was no profit to talk civilly to him and if you want not to see your neck wrung give over questions and tell me where is saint alban hall he grew red in the face as i gripped his arm which he could by no means get free till i let him this is saint alban hall said he and master penry lives over my lodging then i thought it better to be civil to the fellow as he guessed i had no business there in a college gown so i gave him a groat and bad him take me up forthwith master penry was a lean wrathfulvisaged welshman with deep grey eyes and a large forehead and a mass of straight black hair down his neck as i entered his room which was disordered and dirty he was pacing to and fro talking or praying aloud in his native tongue he let me stand there a minute or two amazed at his jargon and scarcely knowing whether i had lit upon a sane man or not then he stopped suddenly in front of me and scanned me well said he in good english are you master penry i asked i am you have a message for me i have from master walgrave here it is said i putting the letter into his hand he tore it open and read it eagerly and as he did so his face relaxed into a grim smile that is well so far said he then looking hard at me he added have you ridden from london in that disguise no said i this gown was lent me by a friend to protect me against annoyance from the wild men of the town his face suddenly turned pale and passionate then where is the cloak your master speaks of in this letter the cloak i knew from the very first there would be trouble about that and i was glad now i had left it behind in the safe keeping of my comrade at the inn what is my cloak to you said i not relishing the tone of his voice i have given it away to my friend fool and jackass said he gnashing his teeth do you know you have ruined me and your master by this no i do not said i and as for the foul names you call me take them back on the instant or i swear i will ram them down your mouth he took no notice whatever of my wrath but went on breaking in on his speech every now and then with welsh words which i took to be curses you must get it back at any price said he lose not a moment where is this friend who is he if he resist you you must slay him so as you get it back if it fall into the hands of an enemy you and i ay and your master and all that belongs to you will perish ah the folly of the man to trust such a missive to this thickheaded blunderer what time lost what labour wasted what peril run what ruin on our holy cause i was well out of temper by this time and but that he looked so miserable and illfed i would have rattled his bones a bit at last that cloak said he coming up to me contained papers sent by your master to me which if they be found on any ones person mean tyburn do you understand that yes said i beginning to see the drift of his coil and if you had told me so at first i had been halfway back to get it by this time heaven is my witness you are welcome to the cloak if that is what it contains and i doubt not my friend will give it up to do you a pleasure hasten cried he with tears of vexation in his eyes there is not a moment to be lostnay i will go with you where did you leave it come nay said i remembering it for the first time i am not very sure where it was twas at a riverside inn about four miles from here and who is your friend is he a true man i know not that either said i he is a valiant man and hath a dirk at his girdle and i pity the man who tries to take the cloak from him by force master penry made another speech to himself in welsh fool exclaimed he half blubbering this precious missive you leave at an inn you know not where with a man you know not whom and yet your master speaks of you as a trusty lad bah lead on i swallowed my wrath and obeyed him he stalked impatiently at my side saying nothing but urging me forward so that i could scarcely keep pace with him i was in luck in one way to have his escort for as i came near the east bridge there lurked not a few of the townsmen who had been in the fight when i assaulted the mayor seeing me with master penry who i suppose was a man of some standing they did not look twice at me else i might have been caught and put to rest my limbs in the cage when we had crossed the bridge and were in the country my companion suddenly stopped this friend of yours said he with the dirk in his girdle was he a scholar he lent me this gown said i an irishman i know not he spoke good english with a foreign trip of the tongue a great big boy with wild fair hair and hands that never are still the very man you know him do i know him for two months i have endured the pains of the lost through him a wild untameable savage subject to no laws a heathen a butcher a scoffer at things holy an idler a highwayman a traitor a rebel an irish papist wolfhound do i know my own pupil andoh my godis it he who has the coat oh we are doubly lost knaves fools all conspire to ruin us i let him run on for he was like one demented but you may suppose i opened my eyes as i heard this brave character of my new friend your pupil is he said i at last then i counsel you to stay where you are for he will assuredly eat you alive if he gets you the welshman paid no head to this warning but rushed on jabbering in welsh to himself and groaning ay and even sobbing now and then in his excitement at last after an hours hard work we came to where i had found the road that morning then for another hour i dragged him through the swamps and marshes his strength had begun to fail him long ere we reached the rivers bank and he was fain when at last we felt solid earth under our feet to cry a halt i must rest for one moment said he puffing and panting and clutching at his side in a way that made me sorry for him then he fell on his knees and prayed in his own tongue and before he was done sunk half fainting on a treetrunk master penry said i helping him from the ground you are not fit to go on i pray you let me go alone this pupil of yours is my friend and will give me the cloak stay here unless you would spoil all for assuredly if he see you he will turn at bay and yield nothing the inn is but a mile from here in less than an hour i will be back with the cloak that i vow he had no strength in him to protest so i left him there and ran on towards the inn chapter five how i parted with my cloak my mind was all in confusion as i hurried forward to the riverside inn everything seemed to be going wrong with me and i wished heartily i was back in london with my fellow prentices and my kind mistress and the sweet jeannette they at least believed in me but here everyone with one consent conspired to tell me i was but a fool i had made myself a laughingstock at maidenhead i had been pinned up against the wall by a boy my own age in this place i had assaulted a mayor at oxford i had parted with my cloak which contained life and death in the lining of it to a stranger and more than all i had given my love to a fellow who if the welshman was right was a horrible traitor and papist a fine piece of work verily and little wonder if my conceit was somewhat abated after it all yet as i ran on i thought more about my wild friend at the inn than about any one else i could hardly believe him to be a rogue although all that the welshman said of him tallied with my own observation nay more to my dismay i found by my heart that even were he all the rogue he was painted i could scarcely bring myself to like him the less at least thought i if he be a knave he is an honest one and my cloak will be safe with him as i came to the inn which i had scarcely yet seen by daylight it seemed gayer and more bustling that i had found it last night three brave horses stood saddled and bridled at the door and voices of good cheer from within showed me that mine host was having some little custom for his sack i wondered if my solemn scholar was of the party or whether the better to avoid detection he still lay abed as i entered i recognised the chief of the four men who sat at the table as my friend the bishops man whom i had met on the road two days ago but whom as well as my promise to meet him today i had since clean forgotten he hailed me gaily as if he expected me welcome lad you are a man of your word i knew you would come come and join us there is brave sport afoot i coloured up to be thus commended for what i did not merit indeed said i ii am glad to meet you again butbut how i stammered just now i am looking for my friend what have you not done your errand said he you told me it was in oxford it was i have done itbut i left a friend here mine host said i turning to the man of the place is my comrade astir yet the host crammed his apron in his mouth to keep in a laugh astir sir ludar astir i warrant thee half the bucks in shotover wood are astir too before now what said i my face falling suddenly is he gone then an hour since and by your leave young sir added mine host i would take leave to remind your grandeur that the score of last nights supper and a trifle my lord took for his breakfast with the shoeing and meat of the horse and the price of your nights lodging awaits your noble acquittance gone cried i not heeding all the rest and did he leave aught for me i doubt not he left his blessing but nothing else but my cloak he had my cloak if he have it not still ay and the nag too it will be because he has met a stronger man than ever i saw yet on earth said mine host but the cloak roared i that cloak had papers in it it was here the bishops man put down his mug and pricked up his ears which way did he go cried i saddle me my horse i must overtake him or all is lost papers said the bishops man what sort of papers prithee i know not said i oh that cursed cloak harkee my lad said the man sternly answer me two questions if you will he laid hold of my arm and looked so menacing that i was fairly taken aback and if i do not said i as i began suddenly to see what it all led to then in the queens name i shall know what to do with you said he beckoning to his three men who rose and approached me i was fairly in a corner now for a man who held the queens warrant was not one lightly to be resisted yet what could i tell him let me hear your questions said i as civilly as i could and edging a little towards the door perhaps i can answer them thats a wise lad said he mollified i know you are but a tool men stand back therei blame you not for doing your duty but you must tell me here the name of the man your master who sent you this errand and the name of him to whom you bore it i can tell you neither said i he turned to his men but before they could rise i had rushed to the door and was outside a key stood in the outside of the lock which mine host used to turn and take with him when business called him to leave his inn empty i had just time to turn this and vault on one of the three horses when the window was flung open and the leader of the band sprang on to the casement but he was too late for before he could level his musket at me i was twenty yards away at a gallop leading by the bridle the two spare horses which had stood at the door beside the one i rode the shot badly aimed whistled past my ear and served to urge on the horses to a wilder pace so that before even the party was outside hallooing after me i was a furlong off plunging deep into the wood i had no time to think if i had done well or ill or what the upshot of it all was like to be time enough for that when i had won clear the led horses after their first fright jibbed at the reins and struggled to get free so as they checked my speed i let them go and saw them plunge away among the trees no easy capture for their lawful owners meanwhile i dashed forward whithersoever the horse took me i remember even amid my panic what a delight it was to sit astride of so noble a beast who seemed to scorn my weight and skim the earth as lightly as if he carried a child had it been my own sorry nag i should long since have been by the heels once clear of the wood i suddenly sighted oxford towers to my left and found myself on the road by which i had passed but an hour ago with the angry welshman i had forgotten him and twas well for him that i had i had no mind to put myself again within reach of his worship the mayor of oxford and his merry men so i tugged my right rein and kept my horses head turned to the wooded hills northward there thought i i can at least find time to draw breath and determine what must be done next to the forest i sped then marvelling at the pace of my brave horse and wondering if the bishops man was yet on the road at my heels on the steeper ground my horse slackened a bit but i urged him forward till we were deep in the wood with a choice of four or five paths any of which led heaven knows where here i let him stand and get his wind while i turned over in my mind what should be my best course while i was debating to my surprise my horse pricked up his ears and gave a loud neigh which was answered from no great distance by another at first i supposed his companions had followed us or that our pursuers were nearer than i reckoned for but on listening i perceived that the strange horse was ahead of us not behind i therefore moved slowly forward in the direction of the sound what was my surprise when i saw my own poor nag tethered to a tree with my cloakthe cause of all this troublelaid carelessly over his back master penrys wild pupil was nowhere near yet i scarce gave him a thought at the time so overjoyed was i to recover my longlost prize i sprang from my borrowed horse letting him stray where he would and fell upon the garment like a mother on her lost child except that i having taken it to my arms whipped out my knife and proceeded to rip it up from top to bottom master penry had been right the cloak was stoutly padded with printed sheets of which i took out fully three score they were all the same a short tractate of twelve pages duodecimo set in my masters type for i recognised the letter and the flowered initials and printed there was no doubt now at his secret press the title of the tractate was a whip for the bishops and to my wrath and confusion as i read i found it contained wicked and scandalous abuse of their graces of canterbury and london whom it called wolves in sheeps clothing antichrists and i know not what horrid names besides and it was to carry this wicked libel i had been sped on this journey decked with my brave cloak and commended to that welsh varlet who no doubt was the author and counted on me as the tool to help him to disseminate his blasphemous treason he little knew humphrey dexter although i had put a queens officer in the duckpond although i had assaulted a mayor although i had defied a bishops warrant and made off on a bishops horse i yet was a loyal subject of her majesty and hated schismatics as i hated the pope himself they had played me a trick among them i would play them one back so i gathered up the libels and dropped them one and all together with the false lining of the coat into the hollow of a rotten tree where for all i know they may be to this day and if years hence some lover of the curious should seek to add to the treasures of his library a true copy of that famous lost tract a whip for the bishops let me tell him in his ear the book is to be had cheap midway across shotover wood somewhere to the left of the lower path which leads to heddendon nowhere else was it ever published to that i can vouch i had scarcely finished my task when i heard a whoop from among the trees followed immediately by the whiz of an arrow which glanced betwixt my cheek and my shoulder and buried its head deep in the trunk of a near tree i had scarcely time to face round and draw my sword when i perceived coming down the glade my wild scholar with a bow in his hand and a dead fox on his back he had plainly not seen who i was at first but recognised me as soon as i turned he marched gravely towards me equally heedless of my drawn sword and of the shaft which a moment ago had all but taken my life is it you said he i took you in your cap and gown for my tutor you all but killed me too said i wrathfully ay it was a bad shot yet had you not moved your head it would have spiked you by the ear to that tree what brings you here i was taken aback by the coolness of the fellow who talked about spiking me by the ear as if i had been the fox he carried on his back marry said i you should know what brings me here my horse and my cloak they brought me here sirrah nay they brought me here but i am not sorry to see you i was about to return to the inn to look for you i flushed to the roots of my hair to think how readily i had set this man down as a runaway thief never was a face less deceitful or a manner less suspicious and i if i had not been a fool might have known as much i did you an injustice said i returning my sword i believed you had given me the slip and were a thief said he with a scornful curl on his lips i thank you master prentice i would sooner he had cut at me with his dirk but further parley was ended by a sudden noise of horns and a tramp of horses close by i sprang to the alert in an instant the bishops men cried i we are pursued fly too late for that said my comrade as a party of huntsmen some mounted some on foot broke through the glade at the very spot where we stood it was not the bishops men but to my horror i recognised in the leading horseman his worship the mayor at sight of me in my cap and gown and of my comrade with his bow and the dead fox and of the horse tethered to the treethe bishops horse had strayed i know not whitherthe hunters raised a loud cry and closed upon us seize the varlets cried the mayor they are caught at last by my life a scholar too if he smart not for this and something else call me a dullard i saw by that he did not recognise me although he cherished a lively memory of that mornings adventure my comrade somewhat to my surprise submitted quietly to superior numbers and i was fain to do the like it were better to be punished for poaching than to be arraigned before the high court of star chamber for publishing seditious libels bring them away bring them away cried the mayor who was in no amiable mood i warrant they shall learn one lesson well for once in their lives scholars indeed a parcel of lewd bloodthirsty poaching scoundrels with no more conscience than a london apprentice come away with them to the city at this a gay young stripling rode up father he said is our days sport to be spoiled for a brace of rogues like these surely they will keep an hour or two while we have our chase let some one guard them in the rangers house and we can take them up with us as we return at evening his young companions seconded his request so the mayor who would have enjoyed more to clap us in the pillory than to win half the antlers in shotover woods consented and bade three of his men conduct us to the rangers lodge hard by and keep us there till the party returned i saw my comrades eye light up at this but he said nothing and looking very crestfallen and abashed we followed our guard with hands tied and heard the huntsmens horns tantivy merrily away for their days sport the rangers lodge was a hut of but a single room into which our keepers thrust us with little ceremony and made to the door they were stout men all of them and carried cross bows besides the daggers at their girdles we heard them grumble angrily to be baulked of their days sport by a couple of college boys like us and to be shut up here all day long with neither drink nor food nor anything with which to make good cheer whereat one of the party pulled out a box of dice and for lack of better sport they began to play meanwhile i watched my comrade who on entering had thrown himself on the floor and composed himself as if to sleep but though he lay with his head on his hands it was plain to see he was not dreaming for the muscles of his face were working and his body once or twice seemed exercised as with some effort what this was i guessed soon enough he was gnawing the cord which bound his wrists whereupon i setto do the same and in a quarter of an hour i was free already my comrade had signalled to me that he was rid of his bonds but warned me to give no sign but wait the signal from him so we both lay still and i the better to keep up the part snored long and loud our keepers meanwhile gave us no heed but played deep and eagerly we could hear by the growls and oaths that kept company with the rattle of the dice that the luck was not going even one of the three won the throw time after time and crowed so loud at each success that the others as was only natural turned first surly then angry but the winner heeded not their wrath but continued to cackle insultingly until their patience being all spent they knocked over the table and fell to blows now surely thought i is the time for us but my comrade still lay low and signed to me to do the same for we were unarmed and had we been too soon all had been spoiled the fight that followed was short and sharp the single man held his own for a few minutes but fell at last borne down by superior numbers and a stab in the thigh from one of his assailants then when in dismay the two dropped their daggers and knelt to see if he were dead or alive my comrade gave the signal and we sprang at one bound to our feet in a moment the two men were in our grip and at our mercy and so taken aback were they by our sudden attack that they cried quarter even without a struggle and let themselves be bound with the cords of which we just now rid as for the third he was wounded though not badly and we left him unfettered then arming ourselves with a cross bow apiece the spoils of war and our own blades we locked the door on our keepers and bade them farewell one thing troubled me in our escape which was this that my nag or rather master udals and my cloak were both gone a hunting with the mayor however we could not both have ridden the one or worn the other and we might perchance run less risk without them than with them as for the college cap and gown my comrade nailed them with our keepers two daggers on the outside of the door when we left in token that here he bade farewell for ever to the life of a scholar it was scarcely three oclock in the afternoon when we made good our escape before sundown thanks to my comrades knowledge of the country which was all the more wonderful that he had been only two months at oxford we had fetched a wide circuit round the north of the city and were safe on the berkshire side of the river beyond wightham on the road to abingdon for four hours my comrade had paced at my side without a word and i finding nothing to say had been silent too when however all danger from our pursuers was past and night invited us to halt at the first convenient shelter he stopped in the road and broke silence friend said he what is your name humphrey dexter at your service said i may i ask yours you may call me sir ludar said he gravely and since we two have been comrades in peril give me your hand and let heaven witness that we are friends from this day i gripped his hand in silence for i knew not what to say my heart went out to this wild odd comrade of mine of whom i knew nothing and had he bidden me follow him to the worlds end i should yet have thought twice before i refused him that night as we lay in a wayside barn for my purse was run too low to afford us an inn sir ludar told me something of his history and what he omitted to tell i was able to guess he was the youngest son he said of an irish rebel chieftain sorley boy mcdonnell by name who desiring at one time to cement a truce with the english had given his child in charge of a sir william carleton an english soldier to whom he owed a service to be brought up by him in his household and educated as an english scholar and gentleman the boy had never seen his father since for though his guardian began by treating him well yet when mcdonnell turned against the english as he had done sir williams manner changed he kept hold of the boy not so much as a ward but as a hostage and ruled him with an iron rod the lad had been handed over from governor to governor from school to school but they could do nothing with him some of his masters he had defied others he had scorned one he had nearly slain his guardian had flogged him times without number and threatened him still oftener his guardians lady had tried to tame him with gentleness and coaxing he had been admonished by clergy and arraigned before magistrates but all to no purpose he snapped his fingers at them all and went his own way consorting with desperate men breaking laws and heads flinging his books to the four winds making raids on her majestys deer flouting the clergy denying the queen and daring all the sir william charletons on this earth to make an english gentleman of him at last his guardian who really i think meant well by the lad rebel as he was sent him to oxford to the care of master penry the welshman who by all signs must have had a merry two months of it at least i could understand now why he had been more anxious to get back my cloak than his truant pupil nor could i blame him if he sighed with relief when ludar having fallen foul of every one and everything at oxford and learned nothing save a smattering of spanish from a jesuit priest took up his cap and gown and shook the dust of the university from his feet and so said my comrade who as i say left me to guess the half of what i have written down i am rid of them all and thank the saints i am no gentleman yet whereupon he dropped asleep chapter six how i walked with a rebel where do we go next asked i in the morning as we shook ourselves free of the hay which had been our bed and sallied out into the air he looked at me with a smile as though the question were a jest to my guardians said he why said i he will flog you for running away from oxford what of that said sir ludar he is my governor it seemed odd to me for a man to put himself thus in the lions maw but i durst not question my new chief you shall come too and see him said he it passes me to guess what he will do with me next unless he make a lawyer or a priest of me i must back to my master in london said i the printer said he scornfully he is thy master no more thou hast entered my service this staggered me for much as i loved him it had never occurred to me to bind myself to a penniless runaway pardon me sir said i i am bound to the printer by an oath besides i know not yet what your service is my service said he is to be free and to put wrong right tis a noble service said i but it fills no stomachs you prentices are all stomach said he sadly but tis always so no man that ever i met believed in me yet i must fight my battles alone this cut me to the quick not so said i last night i swore to be your friend it was a mad oath i know but you shall see if i do not observe it but till two years are past i am bound by an oath to my master the printer and him i must serve then i am with you this i thought softened him well said he who knows where we may be two years hence god knows and we are in his hands so be it said sir ludar crossing himself to my grief meanwhile humphrey we are friends i may claim your heart if not your hand you mayor here i blushed a share of it what mean you by that asked he sharply what man holds the rest no man said i he laughed pleasantly at that a woman i have heard of that distemper before it comes and goes im told had it been a man i should have been jealous there was little sympathy in that for my sore heart so i said no more come said he presently you shall come to my guardians he lives at richmond and it is on our way to london if he turn me off you shall take me to london and make a printer of me if you please i agreed to this and we stepped out on our journey a strange journey it was my comrade for the most part stalked silently half a pace in front of me sometimes it seemed to me heedless of my presence and sometimes as if troubled by it yet often enough he brightened up and began carolling some wild song or else darted off the road after a hare or other game which he rarely failed to bring down with his arrow or else rallied me for my silence and bade me talk to him at these times i asked him about his own country and his father and then his face lit up for though he had not seen either since he was a child it was clear he longed to be back what prevents your returning now said i he looked at me in his strange wondering way know you not that mcdonnell is an exile and that the hated sassenach holds his castle demanded he i confessed i did not for a london prentice hears little of the news outside besides though i durst not tell him as much i did not know who mcdonnell his father might be or what he meant by sassenach but he will feast in dunluce once more cried he and i shall be there too and the usurper woman elizabeth shall here i sprang at him and felled him to the ground the blood left my heart as i saw what i had done as he lay there i could hardly believe it was i who had done it for i loved him as my own brother and never more so than when he leapt to his feet and with white lips and heaving chest stood and faced me i was so sure he would fly at me that i did not even wait for him to begin but flung myself blindly on him but he only caught me by the arm and shoulder and flung me off with such strength that i reeled and staggered for a dozen yards before i finally fell headlong with my face in the dust then he turned on his heel and walked on slowly it was no light thing after that to pick myself up and spitting the dust from my mouth go after him but i did he never turned as i came up behind or heeded me till i stood before him and said sir ludar i smote you just now for speaking ill of my queen a man who is disloyal to her is no friend of mine therefore farewell he glanced me over and his face had lost all its anger she is no queen of mine said he i was born her enemy for all that you did well to strike when i spoke ill of her i would do as much to you were you to speak evil of my queen and here he raised his cap your queen said i and who may she be there is but one queen in these realms i know it said he her i serve do you mean said i that you serve hush said he with his hand at his belt i serve queen mary and all the saints in heaven preserve her now humphrey dexter is it peace or war i pray every day for the confusion of her majestys enemies why not said he so you pray not aloud i do the same not so said i or i should not have struck you nor shall it be peace if you dare to breathe her majestys name again in my hearing heaven is my witness i have no wish to breathe it said he with a curl of his lips nor if you breathe the name of mine need you look for so gentle a tumble as i dealt you just now come your hand on it so we struck hands for the third time and went on my conscience troubled me sore the rest of that day what had i come to to assort thus with a declared enemy of our gracious queen and more than that to love him more every mile we walked i could not help it as i said before he was so unlike a common rebel and so big in his heart to every one and everything that claimed his aid once that day as we toiled along the hot road we overtook a poor woman carrying a bundle in one arm while with the other she strove to help along a little footsore child who whimpered and stumbled at every step without a word sir ludar took the child and bundle both from the scared mother who gave herself up for lost until he asked her gently whither she went and might he help her so far with her burdens then she wept and led us a clean four miles off our road to her cottage where sir ludar put down the bundle and the now sleeping urchin and bade her adieu before she could thank him another time as we were mounting a hill we came up with a haycart which the patient horse could scarcely drag whereupon he setto to push the cart behind calling on me and the bewildered carter to do the same till we had fairly hoisted it to the crown of the hill another time he fell foul of a parcel of gipsies who were illusing an old man of their tribe and a lively fight we had of it we two against six of them amongst whom was the old man himself when at last we had got rid of them i hoped that our adventures for the day were done for i was tired and wanted to rest my bones in a bed but as we passed through reading the righteous soul of my comrade was vexed by the sight of a boy sitting howling in the stocks no doubt he deserves punishment said i deserve or not he has had enough for me said ludar and began kicking away at the boards of course there was a commotion at that and the constable came to see what the noise was about ludar desired nothing better for he made the fellow disgorge his key which saved a vast power of kicking then when the boy was free and had darted off to the woods sir ludar with a grim smile locked up the beadle in his place and flung the key into the pond then as the watch and a posse of the townsfolk turned out to see what the uproar was we ran for it and got clear this last proceeding did not please me for it was defying the queens law and as i said to my comrade it was not for us to set ourselves up against authority but sir ludar would listen to no reason the lad was miserable where he was said he so is the beadle now said i the better the lesson for him said ludar there was no use arguing so we trudged on some miles further till night fell and we took shelter again in a barn the next day guiding ourselves chiefly by the river we came to windsor where i had much ado to hinder my comrade from going ahunting in her majestys forest had it not been that i persuaded him we might almost reach richmond that night i think for mere spite of the law he would have stayed as it fell out we were far from reaching richmond that night for the way was difficult with swamps and thickets so that we were glad enough to reach chertsey by sundown i was for spending what little remained of my money at the inn but this he would not hear of so we took our supper and then as the night was fine slept in a field of hay sweet lying it was too and when early next day we plunged into the clear river and refreshed out travelstained limbs we felt men again it was well on in the afternoon when we arrived at richmond we should have been there sooner but that my comrade was for ever calling a halt or turning aside on some errand of chivalry mad enough i thought some of them but then he never asked me what i thought and if ever i hung back he did what he needed without me yet whatever he did it was to help some one weaker than himself and if my patience now and then failed me the honour i had for him grew as i said with every mile we went i say it was afternoon when we reached richmond as we approached the place my comrades desire to see his guardian waxed cool and he cast about him for an excuse if not to avoid going to the house at least to put it off till night i proposed that we should rest ourselves under the trees in the park to which he agreed but it was an unlucky move for we had not lain half an hour enjoying the shade and i half asleep when he started up with a hist and slipped an arrow into his bow at that moment a fine buck went by he had not spied us while we lay still but the moment my comrade moved he threw up his head and bounded off yet not before a quick twang from sir ludars bowstring had sent an arrow into his quarter are you mad cried i in terror it is the queens deer follow follow shouted sir ludar who was every inch a sportsman i tried to hold him back but he heeded me no more than had i been a fly with a loud whoop he dashed away in pursuit he had not gone twenty yards from me when there was a great shout and clatter of horsemen and before i well knew what had happened i saw sir ludar disarmed in the clutches of half a dozen men i rushed to his help but could do nothing except share his fate for they were too many for us and we had no time even to hit out where is the captain cried one of the men just then up rode a man at sight of whom the blood tingled in all my veins i mean captain merriman i do not know if he recognised me at first for he scarcely gave us a look away with them to your master said he riding on and see they give you not the slip so we were marched off a pretty end to our jaunt and to make our plight worse sir ludar whispered to me as we went along unless i mistake the master of these men is my guardian sir william carleton sure enough it was the house we were conducted to stood in a large park with a view far over the river perhaps the fairest view in england yet i had no mind just then to admire it for the presence of that hated horseman made me forget all except one fair face which i seemed to see as i had seen it that day at finsbury fields he rode forward as we entered the park and bade the men bring us safely in come step out said one of the men giving me a flick with his ridingwhip we have been waiting for you these three weeks my gentlemen and i promise you a warm welcome from his worship the captain his visitor will be in high favour now that he has run the vermin to earthwhat say you hugh i warrant you that said hugh for our master had set his heart on catching the vagabonds and nothing could please him better heigho it is we have had all the watching these weeks past but this gay spark will have all the glory now well so the world goes i shall be glad to see him started on his irish wars for i like him not nor iand yet we are not like to see the last of him soon if the rumour which my ladys maid hath whispered me that some fair company is expected shortly at the hall be true the other laughed no truly he is no proof against the flutter of a skirt as some here know did i tell you what befel him not long since in london town at the place where the prentice boys sport i had it from one of his own men but here we are at his worships you shall hear the story another time and i warrant you will crack your sides over it sir william being an old man and gouty to boot saw his prisoners in his own room whither we were accordingly conducted i had no chance to get a word with my comrade who i noticed kept his hand to his mouth and pulled his cap over his eyesi suppose to conceal himself from those about the place who might know him as for me i had no desire to hide myself from the only man there who knew me sir william was a fine redfaced whiteheaded old gentleman with something of the old soldier in his air and when he came to speak a good deal of him in his words he sat in a great chair with one foot swaddled on a stool before him and the oaths with which he greeted each twinge as it came boded ill for us his prisoners he kept us waiting a long time at the dimly lit end of the hall while he spoke to his guest at last he ordered us to be led forward as we advanced and their eyes fell on us each uttered an exclamation i kept my eye on captain merriman and watched the storm that gathered on his brow and the crimson flush that sprung to his cheeks it was plain he knew me again and i was content as for sir ludar he stared listlessly at his guardian till it should please his worship to speak his worship began with a string of oaths why what means this sirrah how came you here you vagabond irish whelp in this company speak or by my beard illill he did not say what he would do for his foot gave him a twinge which demanded of him every word he could spare i have left oxford sir guardian said ludar i liked not the place or the ways of the place or the welshman my keeper and as for my present company said he turning to me tis good enough for me it was i shot the deer not he and so pray bid these fellows loose him at this the angry old soldier nearly went off in a fit he flourished his stick towards the offender and even tried to rise from his chair a proceeding which brought on fresh pangs and set him swearing hard for a minute or more how now what a murrain on you puppy am i to be told my duty by a rawboned illconditioned irish gallowglass that i have fed at my table and spent half my life in making a gentleman of what do you think of that sir captain how would you like to be saddled with a young wolf hound cub like thatsorley boys son he is no other on my lifethat i was fool enough to take wardship of when he was a puling puppy and his father an honest man what do you think of that curse the whole tribe of them say i by your leave sir william said the captain in a smooth soft voice that made every hair on my body bristle good deeds have always their reward but as for the deer that was shot your ward is generous enough to shield the real offender at his own cost i should be sorry indeed had it been otherwise i could see the veins in my comrades neck swell while this talk went on but he remained silent while sir william said by my soul it wants but to look at the varlet to see poacher written in his face and the queens deer too come you men which of you was it caught the rogue here one of the men seeing how the wind lay swore before heaven that he saw me shoot the deer and took me redhanded with my bow in my hand and when one sheep leads the way the others follow they all swore it was i while some added that my comrade lay asleep under a tree and knew nothing of the matter till i was captured then sir william grunted and turned to his ward tis well for you sir puppy these honest fellows give you the lie had they done otherwise i could have believed them and i promise you ward and all as you are i would have hanged thee for slaying the queens deer as surely as i will hang this cunning rogue here let the boy go men and now you said he turning to me you illlooking hangdog you say your prayers for tomorrow you ride to the assizes and then the lord have mercy on thy black soul it surprised me that sir ludar took his release quietly and now stood by with thunderous face but apparently heedless of my sentence take him away there said his worship and make him fast in the cellar these dogs are slippery vermin so take care when the rope is round his neck he may wriggle to his hearts content come be off with him i looked at ludar but his back was turned i looked at captain merriman and he was smiling to himself i looked at his worship and he was swearing at his foot so as all seemed against me i turned sadly enough and followed my guard to the dungeon i cared little enough what came to me ever since i set foot out of london things had gone against me i was steeped breasthigh in disloyalty and lawlessness i had staked my peace of mind on a rebel and now it seemed even he had done with me yet i could not believe that had i done so i think i should have beaten out my brains upon the wall of that damp cellar as it was i sat there too bewildered to think and so for lack of anything else to do i fell asleep i know not how long i had slept when i was aroused by a hand on my arm as i might have known it was ludar he had a dish of venison pasty and a flagon of wine in his hands which he set before me and in dumb show bade me eat i obeyed heartily for i had not tasted food since the morning then he took me by the hand and led me in the darkness up the steps and into the open air once clear of the house he broke silence farewell said he i may stay here my guardian threatens to send me back to oxford in charge of a troop but i think i shall stay here a while but said i will you not get yourself into trouble over this over what your release said he laughing i think not the old gentleman will rave somewhat at first but when it comes to hanging me or nobody he will hold his peace he cannot afford to see a ward of his swing with his feet off the ground moreover as soon as i can hear news from the north i shall go to find my father so farewell humphrey expect me in london ere long and forget not our oath i gave him my hand in answer and with a heavy heart started on my way i had not gone many paces when he came after me who and what sort of man is this captain said he he is the devil said i and i told him what had passed between us he laughed loud when i spoke of the duckpondso loud that i feared we should be heard oh said he when the tale was done that settles it settles what i asked i mean said he that i think i shall slay him and with that we parted he back to the house i dismally enough to london chapter seven how i found trouble on my return it surprised me to find how desolate i felt as i set out alone on the last stage of my journey for when i started from london not two weeks ago i was blithe enough and well content with my own company but since ludar came across my path i was conscious that there was some man better and nobler in the world than humphrey dexter and to be left now to my own sweet society seemed a poor exchange for the companionship i had had the last few days my first thought was to find my way to master udals at kingston so as to be near my friend and my enemy both at richmond but when i remembered i had lost the ministers horse and failed to carry out his errand it seemed to me wiser not to go near him at present but push on to my masters house and make a clean breast of all to him the dawn was breaking as i got clear of the park and found the road to brentford ferry i cared not much if sir williams men came after me nor was the prospect before me at my journeys end enough to urge me forward with much eagerness so i dawdled the morning away on the rivers bank bathing and lying disconsolately in the shade so that it was wellnigh midday before i reached the ferry here the strangest adventure befel me for as i sat watching the boat come over towards me i perceived that it contained three persons of whom one was a serving man and two were women what was it which made me tremble and catch my breath as my eyes lit on the upright fearless figure of the maiden who sat in the stern i knew her a hundred yards off i stood irresolute not knowing whether to fly or wait if i waited and she knew me not twould be more than i could bear yet if i fled i were a paltroon and a boor i waited and the minutes seemed hours while the boat came over there were four horses also in the boat one laden with baggage as for a journey were they then leaving london for some distant home where i should never see her more yet if so why came they this way as they came to shore i summoned up courage to advance she knew me in a moment despite my travelstained garb and unkempt look and held out her hand with a smile of mingled surprise and welcome my kind protector she said to think of meeting you in a place like this i am returning from a long journey said i and we are starting on a longer said she and a pretty prey we be said the old nurse to all the bandits and man slayers and women eaters with which you english line your high roads in ireland my pretty lady might walk alone from bengore to the head of kinsale and not a body would hurt her but here we durst not turn a corner for fear of one of ye nay judy talk not to our friend here as if he were one of them we fear besides added she seeing i suppose the trouble in my face we are like to have a brave enough escort if what sir william promises come true sir william a great terror came over me when i heard that name are you then going to sir william carletons said i yes and how came you to know it said the maiden madam said i pardon my boldness do you know who is there i thought she looked offended at this for she said gravely sir william is my mothers kinsman is his house far from here not far i pray you let me take you so far by no means said she our ways lie in different directions i have a conductor as you see will you inform him as to the way i obeyed and further bade the fellow look well to his mistress and keep his eye on a certain captain who might be at the place to which they went then as i assisted the maiden to mount her horse i summoned up courage cost what it would to say sir william hath a guest whom you and i saw last at finsbury fields i beseech you maiden let me go thither as your servant she bridled up proudly yet not unkindly no said she if i needed a protector i could have none better than you but i need none farewell and thanks good master dexter the oneills daughter will not forget that one englishman at least never did her harm adieu and without waiting for more she rode forward followed by her attendants then it seemed as if the sun had gone out of heaven what was i a mean london prentice to such as she nay what right had i to suppose she needed either my warning or my protection one thing only comforted me sir ludar was still at his guardians house and with him there no harm could well befall any distressed maiden in my vanity i even wished he could know that in serving her he would be serving me his friend yet i fancied if it came to the point he might as soon wring the captains neck for the maidens sake as for mine the one thing this meeting had gained for me was that it assured me however little she cared for me she yet remembered me and further now i knew her name and that to one in my plight was no small prize if your worship be not pressed for time said a voice i am so good day to you i looked round and there was my old acquaintance the ferryman making ready to put off this roused me and i jumped into the boat this time the illlooking charon made no venture for my purse little enough he would have found in it had he got it he demanded his fare as if he had never before seen me nor was it till i demanded if his rascally mate whom i pitched into the river had ever reached the shore that he condescended to recall what happened ten days before but i was in no humour to heed his bluster and i let him swear on had he been civil i should have had to pay him as it was he spared me that and was lucky that i did not crack his skull with his own oar into the bargain i spent the twopence on bread and meat at his inn and he durst not refuse it then with light purse and heavy heart i set out to reach london that night it mattered little to me that the way was beset with robbers and bullies i had neither horse nor cloak my homely apparel was rent and dirty my boots were in holes and my belt was empty i was not worth robbing and the few who set on me in mistake did not stay long when they found the temper i was in so late that nightit must have been towards midnighti brought my journey to an end and stood at my masters door here a sore rebuff met me for a long time i knocked and called in vain and woke the echoes of the sleeping strand then from an upper window a voice descended who goes there hold your peace with a plague on you or ill call the watch it is i humphrey dexter is that you master walgrave walgrave master walgrave you will find him where he has a right to be in the white lion and if you be the apprentice that he spoke of harkee the less you are seen about here the better for you for they say you are as great a knave as your master the white lion my master in gaol cried i amazed how comes that is it true or a lie by whose order make less noise at this hour said the voice and if you doubt me go and ask but take my warning and be not seen too near here your indentures are ended for long enough go and seek a new master and a better and leave me to sleep in peace with that the window closed and there was no more to be said i could scarcely believe the news the man told me and yet when i remembered my masters disorderly ways and the secret press in the cellar it was easier understood yet it must be for some other business than that which took me to oxford for the bishops man i had met certainly never had mr walgraves name from me nor had a single copy of that scandalous libel a whip for the bishops escaped from the hollow tree in shotover wood if master walgrave were in durance vile where was my mistress and her family it was vain i knew to attempt to learn more from the sleepy caretaker at least till morning nor was there anyone else that i knew of from whom i could get satisfaction so i had een to tramp the streets like a watchman till daybreak and weary enough i was at the end of it then i remembered that mistress walgrave had a constant gossip in mistress straw the horologers wife three doors off perhaps mistress straw could give me news so i waited till the prentices the same two who had shamefully eaten hasty pudding that day the queen came into london came to open the door and set out their ware with them to my surprise i saw peter stoupe my fellow prentice he looked sheepish when i hailed him what humphrey said he in his doleful drawl thou hast returned at last in what misfortune dost thou find us our good master in prison you and i homeless my dear mistress and her poor babes ay what of them demanded i in no humour to hear him out my dear mistress and her poor babes continued he heedless of my tone dependent on the goodness of others oh humphrey hadst thou stayed at thy post instead of a pox on your canting tongue cried i tell me where my mistress is or by my soul ill shake every tooth out of your head and i put my hand not lightly on his shoulder this brought him to reason it generally did peter stoupe could never remember how to talk till he was reminded she is here in this house and i am here to take care of her by my masters orders said he and there is no room for thee too and master walgrave when was he arrested and why i asked only yesterdaypray unhand me good humphrey thy hand is irksomea pursuivant of his graces with timothy ryder from stationers hall and a handful of the company at their backs made a sudden visitation and searched us up and down till they lit onyou know what the secret press cried i like a fool letting him see that i knew of it alack humphrey said he there is nothing secret that shall not be made manifest without more ado my poor master was seized and hauled away to the white lion woe is me said he as he departed an enemy hath done this petera viper whom i have nourished at my hearth look to my poor wife and little ones my faithful friendthese were his wordsand heaven will reward thy faithful service it seemed to me humphrey that when he spoke of the viper he meant thee pray heaven i may be wrong fancy if i felt merry at this speech but that i knew by the blink of his eyes the rogue was lying i could have saved the gallows a job as it was i flung him aside and went into the house no one but the prentices were stirring so i sat in the shop and waited it cost me a pang to see the gourmands devour their breakfast with never a bite for myself yet since peter stoupe was of the company it would have cost me a greater pang to eat had any been offered mewhich it was not for a round hour i sat there like a hungry bear neither speaking nor spoken to when at last there came the sound of a halting footstep on the stairs it was my sweet little mistress and at sight of me she broke forth into crying and laughing oh he has come maman voici notre bon humphrey why did you stay so long why were you not there to save our pauvre pere oh i am glad to have you back we shall be happy again and she put up her face to be kissed which i did with beating heart for she had never looked to me so sweet nor had her voice sounded so like music to my ears they said you had deserted us said she but i knew it was a bad lie peter mechant what think you now he has come back our humphrey go and tell maman and prosper and the little ones you would have been sorry for peter at that his face was glum enough when i kissed my little mistress but it looked fairly ugly when she sent him on this errand what cared i there were some yet who thought not ill of humphrey dexter mistress walgrave my dear mistress received me sadly yet kindly whether she had believed the false tales of my fellow prentice or not i know not but she had nothing but welcome for me when she heard my story and when it was done she told me how she wished i had been home when all the trouble happened tis as well this journey of yours failed said she it might have brought us even greater peril your master is too busy a man one press was not enough for him nor one libel what they took was i know not what some lamentable complaint far less harmful than that we sewed in your cloak how they knew of it we know not and what is to be done now i asked we cannot stay here said she mistress straw kind as she is hath not the room nor the means to keep us besides my husband bade me when this happened seek shelter from master udal the minister at kingston to him we must go anon as for you and poor peterwho means well i thinki grieve for you for i can give you neither work nor board nay said i you are not done with me mistress i will at least see you and the little ones safe to kingston but first i would see my master if i may you may try said she brightening up but before that you must have food for you look weary and halfstarved come jeannette make ready something for breakfast and do you peter help us after much ado i was admitted to see master walgrave in the white lion he was in a sour mood and well disposed to look on me as the author of his troubles when i showed him how that could not be he softened a little i make no complaint for myself said he tis a good cause on which i am embarked and i shall see it through yet as for my wife and little ones let your last service to me be to see them safe to master udals had it been possible i would have had them safe at rochelle where even their graces have no jurisdiction but for the present i have a claim on the minister for this shelter peter stoupe i mistrust the more so that he bade me mistrust you when i am released you may still claim me as master though i can no longer claim you as apprentice i assured him i wanted no better master and hoped i might yet serve him meanwhile i promised that same day to conduct his family to kingston i had some trouble to persuade peter stoupe that his service was neither expected nor desired nay he claimed so stoutly his masters authority to be the guardian of the family that i had to shake his obstinacy out of him a bit before he would be still my mistress and the pretty jeannette were i think glad to be rid of him and after many thanks to mistress straw we embarked on a fair tide by which prosper and i plying the oars diligently we reached mortlach whence in a cart we drove as night fell to kingston little enough baggage we had for the companys men had forbidden aught to be removed from the house till such time as a further search should be made so all had to be left until then you may fancy master udals amazement when we landed at his door he had gone to bed and had our cart come to take him off to tyburn he could scarcely have shown himself more alarmed however he was a good man and owed much to master walgrave so after praying for strength he took us all in and bade us lie as we could till morning when he would make better provision his own chamber he gave to my mistress and her little ones while prosper and he and i lay on the hard floor of the kitchen many were the religious exercises in which he led us before he let us sleep and even when they were done he fell on me and drew from me a full and penitent account of my journey to oxford and my follies there for the which he called me many hard names and bade me take shame to myself and pray god i might not one day become a knave as well as a fool which prayer i humbly uttered then and there and many a time since chapter eight how i was cast adrift master udal the minister was not a man to bandy compliments he told me as we rose next morning that he had neither the means nor the desire to keep me at kingston there was nothing to make my stay of any service to him nor did the thickness of my skull encourage him to keep me there for my souls sake in short said he what is to prevent you from going at once you can find breakfast for yourself on the road as soon as i could find it for you here and it beseems a body of your sizeheavens what a name to call mebetter to be serving your calling in london than dangling here at the skirts of a parcel of women so away with you humphrey dexter and if you should visit us a week hence come at an hour when you can return by the road you came the selfsame evening i should have been angry but that i knew i had lost him his nag at oxford and that the good man how i could not guess was going to board and lodge my poor mistress and her little ones while their distress lasted i had nothing for it but to obey him meekly only i was glad he hinted that i might presently come back to see them and now what was to become of me my master was in the white lion my mistress was at kingston the house without temple bar was in the custody of timothy ryder there was warrant against me for assaulting a queens officer if i went to richmond there was a dungeon for me there if i went home my mother could ill afford to keep me if i went to the stationers company i was too old now to apprentice to anybody i was in a bad plight and what was worst of all it seemed as if no one cared much what i did or what became of me at any rate said i to myself as i jogged londonwards i can go to the wars and fight for my queenheaven bless her it was a sore temptation as i passed near richmond to climb the hill and see what was going forward at the hall that house harboured the two people i held dearest in the world and the one i hated most yet i was afraid to go not because of captain merriman or the cellar but lest i should not read a welcome on ludars brow or should be scorned by that fair lady no i must wait till ludar came to me in london meanwhile forward thither i took the boat we had left last night at mortlach and went down on the tide the hard labour of rowing did me good and made me forget all but the biggest of my troubles i resolved first to go to my masters house and see more closely how the land lay there to my surprise as i entered unexpected i found great noise and revelry afoot and there sat in my mistress snug little parlour timothy ryder himself making merry with no other than my fellowapprentice peter stoupe and if i mistook not the good cheer on the table came out of mistress walgraves own larder oh he thought i you are a pretty pair now there is like to be a pretty three of us so i walked in and just as master peter was lifting the tankard to his hypocritical face i caught him a whack on the back which sent him off his chair choking and groaning aloud that the end of the world was come when they saw who it was their jaws fell a bit and timothy ryder began to bluster come come said he what do you here who bade you here pray know you not this place is in the companys keeping come make off with you rascal or some of us will see you go keep your rogue of a master company hold your peace beadle said i or you shall swing on the beam over your head here peter get up peter rose purple in face and not very steady in the knees now said i tell me where got you that ale indeed humphrey i was invited to it i never where got you that beef and bread ioh dost thou think so ill of me as to suppose that when your master is in gaol and your mistress and her little ones are homeless you would come here and gorge your vile paunch with the food that belongs to them yes i suppose every word of it peter stoupe but said he i have a right as a prentice prentice shouted i you a prentice a mean chickenlivered gluttonous sneak like you a prentice fore heaven you do the craft honour come bustle away with you and god save my master from such dirty thieves as you here timothy ryder was foolish enough to laugh which enraged me past all enduring so beadle and all as he was i took him by the nape of his neck like a puppy and flung him into the strand bidding him as he valued his bones not come within arms length of me or my masters house till i asked him as for peter he made off without my help and here i was with the house to myself then i knew i was in a scrape beside which all the troubles of the past few weeks were as nothing i had shamefully outraged the beadle of the worshipful company of stationers acting under the authority of his grace the bishop of london nothing i could say or do could undo that even if i fled nowwhich i was not in the humour of doing since my blood was upit was too late for already a crowd was in the strand some led by curiosity and peters lamentations others by timothys halloos and before i knew where i stood i was besieged i had barely time to bolt the door and heap up reams of paper across the passage before such a battering began as you never heard i ran upstairs and surveyed the enemy from a window there were half the men of the watch therethey wanted me for assaulting a beadle there were timothy and a body of companys menthey wanted me for defying the authority of the master and wardens there were my old friends the court bulliesthey wanted me for the trouble that had happened in finsbury fields there were a crowd of idle townboysthey wanted their fling against a prentice take it altogether i seemed to be in request it was not much use hurling types at them from the window there was nothing bigger than brevier to give them and that was too small to break any bones nor had i any other weapon so i put out my head and shouted clubs clubs with all my voice and then went down to be ready for the first man that should break in twas not long before the door came down but then they had to pass the barrier i had put up in the passage i had at a few of them across that and sent them sprawling but the enemy was too many for me and the clubs outside although they rose to my call kept themselves to the townboys and court bullies and were handsoff to the watch and the company at last one slippery rogue scrambled over the barrier and dodged past me and while i was engaging him three or four more did the same till presently it seemed the game was up i had to yield the outer passage and retreat to the printing room where three of the besiegers got in with me before i could make to the door there was no time to lose for the door was a weak one and in five minutes would be down so i laid about me with the printers balls and stunned one of my men and upset another then i put the third down the trapdoor which stood open just as the door began to totter inwards it was time to go no good could be got by staying and whatever came of it no one would be the better for my capture so i darted out by the back way that i knew of where nobody looked for me and running down the garden and over my lords ground to the rivers edge i took a wherry and made for the other bank i could see the crowd presently break through my masters house into the garden and stand disappointed when they saw i had given them the slip but i was beyond pursuit and they trooped back angrily i suppose to make fast the place against my further intrusion much good i had done by my silly riot my masters house was wrecked where it need only have been robbed my mistress goods and chattels were no nearer being handed over than they were before and since some one must suffer for it all and i had escaped it was likely enough my masters lot would be all the worse for him by what had happened i had no cause to be proud of myself and to be just i was not proud now i knew enough of peter stoupe to be sure he would guess i had fled to kingston so to disappoint him and the watch both i turned my boats head down stream and resolved to lie hid a week in the city before i showed myself again there by that time the hue and cry would have ceased and further the time named by master udal for my visit would be come as luck would have it i was hailed as i rowed under london bridge by a man from a vessel which had just dropped anchor in the pool she was a french craft full of merchandise part for london and part for leith in scotland and being undermanned the captain seeing me idle offered me and a few others plying about three days work in helping to unload the offer suited me well and if ever a free man worked like a galley slave i did for that week yet the french fellow was kindly enough and hearing i was a fugitive from the law he suffered me to lie on his boat at nights and even let me feed with his men finding too that i could talk a smattering of his tongue he tempted me sorely to take service northward with him and become a sailor i would have done it but for two thingsi must see how my mistress and jeannette and the little ones fared and further i knew not when i might receive a summons from ludar to fulfil my pledge to him so i refused to his regret yet we parted friends and as you may hear later on not for the last time at the weeks end i found myself once more knocking at masters udal door at kingston the place looked pleasanter already for the presence of my gentle mistress and her daughter the little garden was trim and well kept the windows were brighter and the childrens voices near made the air gladder as for master udal himself when he opened the door i could have laughed to see the change in him his hair was kempt and the rents in his garments were mended there was a peep of ruffle at his wrists and his stockings which had ever lagged down at his heels now held up bravely by the buckle at his knee more than that he looked scared and jaded like a man undergoing some penance and doubtful what will be wanted of him next but when he saw me his face grew black and without a word he flungto the door in my face i was so taken aback that i was minded to laugh and suppose the good man to have lost his wits but when i came to knock again and no answer then the jest went out of the business what had happened i walked round the house hoping to meet someone but not a soul could i see then i tried the door again but with the same luck as before at last quite dazed by the mystery i gave it up and wandered off anywhere in the village i met an old man carrying wood him i accosted and asked how the minister fared he cackled and laid down his faggots grammercy the poor lads head is turned neighbour the frenchwoman who has come has looked over him whyhe hehes been to the barbers andhe hehe preached an hour short on sunday and forgive us he hath gotten him a new shirt shes a witch i tellee and mark me if the next bundle of sticks i carry up be not for her burning ha ha i told him he was a fool but the idea was firm stuck in his head and more i could not get out of him no doubt but the presence of two sweet women in his house had sorely exercised the minister but that was not enough to make him shut the door just now in my face and vouchsafe me not a word after my journey i wandered on towards the river wondering what i was to do when i came upon a sight which explained everything in a twinkling down on the bank sat side by side peter stoupe and the boy prosper fishing amicably in the stream it needed no conjurer to say now who had come betwixt me and my masters family peter no doubt had brought down a pretty story of me from london and if as i feared my riot with the company had made matters only worse for my master in the white lion it would be easy for my mistress to believe any evil that was told of me and as for master udal peter stoupe was just the lad to pay dutiful heed to his exhortations and so find admittance where i a fool and reprobate was not allowed i came on them so suddenly that i had not time to retire before they saw me peter seemed taken aback at the sight of me but the boy prosper being a gallant lad and greatly emboldened by the presence of his protector rose up with a red face and shouting there goes the villain have at you flung a stone my way and would have followed it up had not peter taken his arm and forcibly held him back that was quite enough for me had i been guilty of the villainy they suspected i could not have turned tail more miserably had peter been there alone i might perhaps have solaced myself by pitching him out into the river as it was i could find nothing to say or do except to sneak away and leave themone smiling the other storming at my retreat that was not the worst as i passed once more near the ministers house on my way to reach the london road i came upon my mistress and jeannette walking slowly beneath the willows at sight of them my heart thumped hard within me and i resolved at least to say a word for myself but as i doffed my cap and crossed the way to meet them i saw that my mistress looked hurt and distant and turning her head from me drew the maids arm in hers and walked forward without heeding me it stunned me so that i could not even put one foot before the other but stood there in the road cap in hand gasping for breath and gazing after them like a man in a trance once when they had gone a step or two jeannette glanced round with tears in her eyes and a look that seemed not all reproach but her mother drew her forward and she turned after which for long enough i saw her face no more that moment as i stood there was a crisis with me my old life seemed suddenly to have drifted from me one after another the bonds that held me to it had snapped and sundered the pleasant prentice days were over my master was in gaol my occupation was gone the company from which i hoped promotion were out against melondon was no place for me now even my mistress frowned on me and my sweet jeannette who was wont to believe in me through thick and thin had turned away was it a wonder then if my mind turned with a swing to the only friend that was left me or if i vowed with myself that if sir ludar would have me i would follow him wherever he should lead my spirits rosesuch is the buoyancy of youtheven as i turned and walked towards richmond ten days ago i had not been my own master to follow him when he bade me today save my queen no man but he had a claim on meay and what use had her majesty for a villain like me who had assaulted a beadle it was late at night when i came near richmond i durst not show myself in the village but hid that night in a hut near the river wondering how i should apprise ludar of my presence and ever and anon in my weakness asking myself how it would fare with me were i to find that he too had deserted me all the next day i wandered about hoping for news but getting none one man whom i accosted looked so hard at me when i questioned him about the hall that i gave him no time to answer but slunk away to avoid him at night my patience came wellnigh to an end and i resolved come what would of it to go to the park if by chance i might meet ludar there or at least send him a message it was dark when i climbed the palings there was little chance unless i marched boldly to the door of the hall of seeing him that night so i resolved to bide my time and lying somewhere within view of the house watch till he came out in the morning i found a thick clump of bushes separated from the house by the width of a lawn behind these i ensconced myself and composed my limbs as best i might to await daybreak i was almost dozing when i started suddenly to hear footsteps and voices not far away could it be he it was too dark to distinguish anything and as yet their voices were not near enough to detect the words but they were coming nearer and in a moment my suspense was at an end it was not ludar that is well said a voice which i knew to be captain merrimans you say he knows to expect you yes sir i sent him word that a week hence we should join him at milford good then we must start tomorrow the men have orders to be at maidenhead tomorrow night well now laker you understand our plan i am called hence suddenly tomorrow to london by the queens order yes sir tomorrow night an express comes to you that i am detained at the court and ordering you my second in command to haste forward to join our men in wales sir william shall also receive a letter telling him that my heart is broken that i cannot take charge of the young lady to ireland but that you an honest elderly dullard will give her safe escort i thank you sir that will pacify our young wolfhound he counts you a friend then laker two days hence at the hush i know the place she shall be there sir that was what i heard and fool as i may have been i had wits enough to guess what it all meant it was no time for marvelling by what strange chance i had been brought there to hear what i did how to prevent the villainy was more to the purpose at daybreak the captain would depart and a day after unless we could hinder it the dove would be in the hawks clutches yet for five hours that night had i to lie still and do nothing if i showed myself and was caught all might be lost yet if i missed my chance of warning ludar betimes of the peril impending it might be too late so i sat there chafing through the brief summer night and at dawn was on the watch true to his plan an hour after daybreak captain merriman mounted his horse and sped briskly away from the hall let him go we should meet perchance again but after that i watched the door for hours and never a sign of ludar should i have to fight for the maiden singlehanded after all at last when i was wellnigh desperate he sallied out crossbow over shoulder with solemn face and walked towards the woods hiding myself well by the trees and shrubs i made across to meet him his countenance lit up as he saw me but otherwise i might have parted from him but an hour ago i expected you said he come along this is no place for talking so i followed him in silence deep into the wood where presently he flung down his bow and put his great hand on my shoulder humphrey said he and i could see that something big was on his mind am i the same ludar you parted with a week ago no said i for i had never seen him thus before humphrey my lad said he i am undone i have lived ill and the saints have found me out my arm hangs feeble at my side i am turned back from being a man into a boy i am unworthy of youand a shame to myselfhumphrey said he clutching my arm till every vein in it tingled i am bewitched for my sins dost thou heari am in love said i with sinking heart i had known what it would come to the moment i parted with the maiden at the ferry that day i had prayed against it i had laughed myself out of the terror that was on me i had called to mind his scornful jests at love but all the while i knew what was to come of it and i knew that what he had won i had lost so i finished his sentence for him and in reply he took my hand and looked at me with an almost humble gaze and you do not scorn me said he i love myself said i ah yes said he you told me so and i scorned you for it now but what brings you here humphrey the change in his voice was so sudden and resolute that it forbade me to say another word about the matter our hearts were fullest of who knows but that had i spoken then he might have guessed the truth and so our lives might have broken asunder at that point now the chance was past but the chance was come to tell him my news which i did then and there and marvellously it moved him not that he spoke much still less raved but his face grew thunderous and his eyes flashed and the few questions he asked me he put in a voice which half startled me by its smothered passion he took in the whole peril in a moment and if once i had been fool enough to imagine i should direct the enterprise which was to thwart the villainy i was soon undeceived humphrey aid he are you free to stand by me in this i told him that now i owned no master but him his face cleared up joyously for a moment at that good i claim you then not as a master but as a comrade be here tonight as the sun sets take this bow and dirk and farewell my friend till we meet again and he left me chapter nine how i caught the misericorde so restless and anxious was i as the day passed that i hastened back to my hidingplace in the wood early in the afternoon determined rather to lie there than run the risk of being seen in the village it was well i did so for i had not been there halfanhour when i heard ludars heavy tramp crashing through the underwood he threw himself beside me haggard and dejected how is she to know of this said he tell her i answered he smiled scornfully had you ever seen the maiden said he you would know that it is no light task she has me at arms length if i tell her of her peril and offer my protection she will perhaps say she needs not my protection or that if i like not the peril i need not face it or she may suspect me of serving myself while i denounce my enemy or she may take the case to sir william whom i believe to be the captains friend to speak plain humphrey i am afraid to speak to her and for that reason i have come to you indeed said i if she would not hear you how would she be like to heed a plain london prentice like me at least she would not suspect you of any motive but that of serving her little he knew yet i never saw him less courageous or more humble than now he was a rude uncouth outlaw he said and knew none of the arts and speeches of a fine gentleman she laughed at his clumsy ways and despised his ignorance she would as soon think of trusting her safety to him as to this elderly rascal laker i did my best to reason with him but in vain at length by sheer compulsion he dragged me with him towards the park reminding me of my vow and bidding me as i loved him be his deputy in this matter by a lucky fortune as we approached the gate who should ride up on her palfrey but our maiden herself she was alone and without attendant ludar told me afterwards that such was her wont once he had offered his escort and she had replied he might come if he could promise her merrier company than her own whereat said ludar i stayed behind she reined up as she saw us in the path before her and a flush of surprise and pleasure sprang to her cheeks how much may a man see in a moment as she sat there glowing with her rapid ride and glancing from one to the other of us i read a long history in her eyes they were frank and fearless as ever but as ever and anon they lit on ludar where he stood uneasy and blushing they seemed to me to soften for a moment into a gentleness in which i had no share if before i had only guessed my fate something in her air made me sure of it now and yet had you seen her there you would have said the maiden thinks no better of one of these lads than the other nor does she think over much of either humphrey my friend said she i am glad to see you and in this brave company have you taken service under our knight of the rueful countenance or does he follow you may it please you said i gallantly sir ludar and i know no service but yours i knew not that you knew one another said she ignoring my speech have you been hunting the english queens deer again sir knight no maiden said ludar gravely but humphrey here hath news for you if you will hear it thus put forward i related as shortly as possible what i had overheard in the park she listened calmly but i could tell by the paling of her cheeks and the heaving of her bosom that my story was a shock to her if this be true said she presently as i suppose it is why stand we idly here the captain quitted the hall at daybreak said i i saw him go to night the letter should reach sir william announcing his detention at court and committing you to the charge of this man laker before which time said the maiden resolutely i shall be far enough away and with a better escort what say you sir ludar when shall we set out so she had accepted our protection before ever we offered it it would have done you good to mark the joyous smile on ludars face as he saw all his difficulties vanish at a word and found that she took him after all for her champion in an hours time said he if it be not too speedy a making ready tis a long journey said she which way do we go and are we to gallop from here to ireland all the way with the enemy at our heels then i spoke by your leave said i i know of an easier and safer way than the road there is a trading ship sails tomorrow from london bridge to leith i know the captain a frenchman if the lady will trust herself by sea trust the sea cried she with a laugh why humphrey my heart bounds at the thought of it i was born on the sea i played by it as a child it is the only thing free under heaven of course we will go by sea and while our pursuers play hide and seek by road we shall be drinking the salt breezes listening to the music of the waves and watching the happy gulls as they wheel round our heads or speed forward to those we love with tidings of our coming and she laughed like a child to whom a holiday is offered so that we had there been a thousand roads could have chosen no other for her or ourselves two hours later as it grew dusk i lay in a boat beneath the willows where the park sloped down to the rivers edge thanks to sir williams gout and the absence of the captain his guest no one had taken the trouble to recognise me and ask me my business and any one who may have seen me there would certainly have set me down as waterman to some visitor at the hall waiting my orders so indeed i was and as the moments passed i grew impatient and anxious the tide would scarcely serve us all the way and should the frenchman haul his anchor too early on the morrow we might find him gone besides every moment they delayed the man laker might perchance suspect what was afoot and take measures to spoil our escape at length they came ludar supporting the old nurse the serving man carrying a box the maiden walking quietly in front as calmly as if she were taking an evening walk to hear the nightingale sing not a word was spoken as they embarked or until the boat with ludar and me at the oars was dropping swiftly down the stream then the old woman broke out in a torrent a plague on all these schoolboy antics cried she here be we at an hour when honest folk should be abed slinking down the river like pirates with neer a pillow to our backs or a covering to our bones and for why what am i to say to my master your father child when he knows of your running thus from your lawful guardian and committing yourself to a brace of rawboned gallowglasses that ye scarce know the names of and for all we know are bringing us into worse plight than ever they pretend to save us from ochone glad i shall be to see ye safe under oneills roof for since the day i had charge of ye i never knew a moments peace are ye not ashamed hussy had ye not lesson enough among the low prentices that day in the fields and among the gallants here at richmond that ye trust yourself now ay and me to poor body that deserve better of you to a parcel of loons on a wild voyage like this are ye fool enough to expect any good of such as they was not i myself served thus when i was a fresh young maid like you innocent indeed i fancy i can see the ship they talk of and the hills of old tirconnell take my word tis a trap to lead ye back to london girl and no more and then you had better have gone west with the captain than east with these smoothfaced schemers thus she complained and the maiden soothed her as best she could and composed her gently to rest amongst us we made the poor body a bed on the floor of the boat where she might at least lay her limbs at ease for an hour or more she broke fitfully into murmurs and complaints but presently as we neared chiswick sleep came to her help and ours after that the night seemed to me like a dream the serving man lay snoring in the prow and only we three sat up to feast on the beauty of the night the moon rode high above our heads changing the river into a silver band and deepening the mysterious shadows of the crowding woods on either bank not a sound was heard but the regular plash of our blades naught moved but our gliding boat and the silent water which bore us ludar lugging steadily at his oar spoke not a word yet i knew though i was at his back where his eyes rested and what was the big content in his heart as for me lulled by music of our oars and entranced by the balmy brightness of the night i forgot my great sorrow and with my eyes on naught but one fair face felt a strange peace nor i think was she as she sat there erect in the stern her form clear cut against the silver water behind indifferent to the restfulness of the scene her eyes gazing far away seemed to gather in them the wandering rays of the moon and when presently scarce heeding perhaps what she did she broke into a soft murmuring chant which rose and fell with the cadence of our oars i at least felt the bewitchment complete little dreamed any of us how soon the peace of that brief voyage was to be broken when the midsummer dawn chased the moonbeams from off the water we had reached battersea on a fast failing tide before we reached lambeth the stream was turning against us and it needed all the strength of our arms after that to make headway yet how could we tire she never drooped the livelong night nor when she perceived what vigour her music lent to our rowing did she weary of chanting to us keeping close under the marshy southern bank to escape the current we slowly made our way till we came at length within sight of the bridge then ensued a toil beside which the labours of the night were as nothing for the angry tide swirled fiercely through the narrow way threatening when we approached it to drive us back up stream yet by dint of much effort and clinging to the piles and more than all ludars notable exploits with the oars we won through at last the first sound that met our ears was a cheery yeoho somewhere near and looking up i saw the frenchman with the queens flag at his mast head making ready so soon as the tide turned to weigh anchor and drop seaward he looked over at us doubtfully as we hailed him and came alongside but when he saw me and heard what was in the wind he lowered his ladder and had us up into the ship he was a poor man he said and his ship illfitted for so brave a company yet if we misliked not his price and the ladies would put up with the rest why then he would take us then the maiden told him to make himself easy about the price she had wherewithal to satisfy him on that score whereupon the frenchman grew monstrous civil and bade her consider the ship as her own while as for ludar and the serving man and me what we lacked in money said he he would take out of us in work this suited us well and the business was settled as it wanted two hours yet to the turn of the tide i begged my new captains leave while we waited to take the boat in which we had come to where it would be restored to its rightful owner the frenchman agreed not without difficulty for said he so soon as the tide gives i must weigh anchor with you or without you nevertheless if you must go go ludar too dissuaded me from venturing but the maiden said why hinder him sir knight humphrey is no child that he cannot be trusted and to prove it my friend said she drawing forth her purse as you return pray buy me a large warm cloak for my good old nurse who is ill used to the sea and is shivering already spend what you need and bring me back the rest the purse was a heavy one and i wondered at her freak in trusting it all to me when one piece from it would have sufficed however it was not for me to question her so promising to be back in good time i let myself down to the boat and rowed lustily to the steps below the bridge i durst not venture further citywards where i was known but i remembered my old enemy will peake on the bridge and resolved to commit the boat to his care knowing him for an honest prentice who would see it duly returned to its owner besides where better thought i could i find a shawl for old judy than among the mercers on the bridge so up to the bridge i clambered merry to think how soon i and all i loved best would be far away on the free sea with our enemies all behind and our hopes all before will peake hailed me civilly and hearing of my plight readily charged himself with the business of the boat then it seemed to me i could not do better than consult him about the cloak and i did so whereat he puffed himself very big and said if i meant to make the garment myself he could sell me the stuff if not i must go into cheap and buy one ready made at the shops so i thanked him and hastened with quick strides citywards i had hoped to get my merchandise over on the bridge yet there was ample time to spare even without haste for all that i ran longing to be safe back on the misericorde now just as i came near the steel yard where you turn by dowgate towards wallbrook i met a party of soldiers loitering in the road as it seemed in quest of somebody seeing me running their way they closed upon me as i came up and bade me halt i bade them angrily enough unhand me and let me go by as i was an honest citizen and pressed on an errand to cheapside at this they laughed and said that was what every man they caught vowed and since they did not like the looks of me i must away with them to see what their captain would think of me i protested in vain that i was in urgent haste they laughed over again and had me away to a tavern hard by where said they their captain lodged and would see me anon all this time the minutes were flying and i was at my wits end what to do it seemed to me wisest if i could to humour them if perchance they might be cajoled to let me go but when after waiting halfan hour the captain did not appear i felt i must do something or give up hope of reaching the ship in time so i beckoned the leader of the band to me friend said i as civilly as i could indeed i am not the man you take me for i am a sailor bound to a merchant vessel which in half anhour is to sail on the tide for sea a sailor quoth he nay by my body thourt a soldier now my lad and a brave one to boot we want lads of thy build for the wars so rest thee content to travel by land instead of by sea heres money on it thrusting silver into my hand lets see how neatly thou canst turn up a tankard to the queens health no cried i letting the money drop i am no soldier and as for money said i pulling out my ladys purse here is an angel for you good man if you but let me go oh ho cried he tis a lad with a purse is it so much the better for us here comrades cried he but i waited for no more the bells of cheap were already chiming the hour with a blow of my fist i felled him and breaking through the rest of them before they comprehended what i was about i took to my heels then ensued a hue and cry the like of which thames street had not often witnessed the soldiers encumbered as they were with their harness could only shout and raise the town others more fleet pressed me hard others coming to meet the uproar hustled me and struck me at and tripped me as i went by but i had not wrestled and played football in finsbury fields for naught at length the crowd became so great all running one way that not a man knew why he ran or what it was all about as for me when i saw that i mingled with the crowd and shouted stop thief with the loudest of them then when no one thought of me i slipped quickly down to the waters edge and flung myself into the first wherry i found but by this time the hour was long gone by for we had been chasing halfanhour up and down up watling street across cheap behind the new exchange up cornhill down gracious street and along the new fish street towards the bridge so that when more dead than alive i struck out into the stream and shot the bridge not a sign was there of the misericorde i was tempted to give it up then and let who would take me and indeed there seemed a good chance of that for the owner of my wherry supposing me to be the thief i seemed was already out after me and in another few minutes the hue and cry by water would be as loud as that by land so on i went on the rapid ebb for dear life and casting my eyes upward i noticed that the air was still and windless so that wherever she was the misericorde could be getting little help from her canvas and if she were only drifting on the tide why should not i with my oars make as good or better pace than she yet i confess i was sorely vexed to think that they had gone without me and when i remembered further that i had the ladys purse with me i could have thrown myself in despair over my boats side what would they think and say of me i could see the watermans boat behind me come through the bridge and guessed well enough that some other craft near it were joining in the pursuit so i pulled desperately and made my boat fly down the stream yet ever as i turned and looked ahead there was no sign of the misericorde worse still a flutter of breeze on my brow showed that the wind was already coming and then i knew i might row my arms off and never catch her the dogged waterman behind me still held on and seemed to be gaining little wonder if he did for i had been rowing all night and now my arms began to flag yet what was his stake on this race compared with mine so away down the stream i pulled past deptford and the queens palace at greenwich heaven save her turning my looks now forward now backward and praying each minute for a sight of the misericorde a little past greenwich i was near meeting my end for looking eagerly for a sight of my pursuers behind i failed to perceive a boat crossing the river ahead of me nor was it till my boats nose struck her full in the side that i was aware of the obstacle the man and woman in the boat which seemed to be a floating pedlars shop plying among the ships swore at me roundly and i had much ado to persuade them that no harm was done and that if any one had a right to complain i had i was rowing on to put an end to the parley when my eye caught sight of a bundle of garments on the boats poop stay cried i to show i bear you no malice i will even make a purchase of you if you have what i require name it said they doubtfully have you a cloak warm enough and smart enough to wrap my poor old mother in when i take her on the water said i that have we cried the woman fumbling in the heap but tis more than you will pay how much i remanded she said a halfangel but when i too eagerly pulled out my mistresss purse to pay her her eyes gleamed and she said she was mistaken she had no cloak there for less than a gold angel show it me said i coming alongside it was what i wanted yet i durst not say so so i snatched it by force and tossing the woman an angel made off with my prize leaving them amazed and swearing by all the heathen gods they had been robbed and left beggars while i delayed thus my pursuers had gained rapidly upon me and i saw i must pull away in earnest if i was to avoid them so comforted to have the cloak and resolved if i rowed all the way from here to the sea i would overtake the misericorde i cast aside all languor and made my craft once more leap through the water the wind was freshening fast and helped me on alas i well knew it would soon do the same both for the frenchmans sails ahead and for my pursuers behind i own these latter were stronger rowers than i for still they seemed to be creeping up upon me at every stroke and by nothing i could do was i able to put more distance between us should they overtake me there would be more delay and that whatever came of it meant that the ship would be gone beyond all reach however when at length i swung round the point and looked up the broad reach that leads to woolwich there to my joy half a mile ahead was the misericorde setting her sails and waiting on the coming breeze i paused not to shout but gathered together all my powers and let out with my oars until i thought they would crack for halfanhour i could not say whether i was gaining on her or my waterman on me at length i resolved to risk the short delay of a signal so i stood in my boat waving the cloak over my head and shouting halloo with all the breath in my body i durst not wait more than a moment to watch for a reply none came but instead the yards bellied with the wind i flung myself with a groan on my seat and took back my oars already the waterman was within shouting distance and his comrades not far behind but i heeded not their cries and plunged my oars once again in bitter chase it was long before i durst look round then to my surprise i saw her standing away in to the essex shore with all her sails full of wind then all seemed lost till i reflected that she must come back for another tack before she could clear the bend if so i was safe so i kept steadily on scarcely holding my own with my pursuers until at length to my joy i saw her put about and bear down full upon me it was an anxious time as she came up no one on board it was clear guessed who i might be nor i think did any one perceive me as i lay there except the man at the prow who seeing me resolved to be run down left me to take my will by this time my pursuer was a hundred yards away thinking himself sure of me at last and saving his breath it was a race whether he or the misericorde would be upon me the sooner but i settled that for as the ship came up slowing towards the end of her tack i took a few strokes out to meet her and then turning my boats head quickly slipped close under i had already marked a rope that hung from the poop within reach and on this when the moment came i ventured my all taking the cloak over my shoulder and casting away my oars i sprang to my feet and gave one leap which sent my empty boat staggering back into her owners hands while it left me hanging twixt heaven and earth to haul myself aboard was the work of a minute even as i did so i could see out of the corner of my eye my pursuer staring round at me amazed while he reached out to secure his truant craft but that was all i saw of him for next moment i stood on deck halffainting face to face with ludar and the maiden and a stranger chapter ten how we sailed with a poet of the first water ludar told me when presently i had revived enough to hear his story that when the tide turned and i did not appear the frenchman laughed and bade them haul the anchor and thank heaven they were rid of a thief whereat said ludar we came to words and the maiden took your part and besought the fellow to wait a halfhour but he would hear none of it he said he was master here and if we liked not the ship we might go out of it indeed added he he had a mind he said to put us all out and be rid of so ill a company then there was nothing left but to let him have his will and we sailed yet i was not surprised to see you back and sheshe did not deem me a traitor i asked that maiden said ludar gravely knows not what traitor means whereat i felt partly humbled partly comforted yes said ludar i am glad to have you back humphrey for this voyage bodes uneasily how do you mean i asked our messmates said he and then i noticed that he wore a sailors jacket are a scurvy crew as you will presently discover the captain already repents that he has taken us the old nurse is hard to please here he sighed the serving man is a fool and the stranger ay what of him who is he he is a halfwitted spark a fugitive from justice and to boot an impudent coxcomb whom i have had ten minds already to pitch over the ships side he was hidden here on board before we came having killed a man at court he brags and seeking shelter in scotland till the storm be past but here he is the stranger was a slim wellshaped youth with a simpering lip and dainty ringlets descending to his shoulders he was dressed extravagantly even for the land and for the sea ridiculously his doublet was of satin bravely slashed and laced and puffed to the size of a globe on either thigh his hose were of crimson silk gaily tied with points and knots his shirt was of the same hue with a short taffeta cloak over bound at the neck by a monstrous ruff out of which his face looked like a calfs head from a dish of trimmings to crown all a white plume waved in his hat while the rapier at his waist was caught up jauntily behind him so that the point and the hilt lay on a level at either hip his face was both cheerful and weak and as he strutted up to where ludar and i stood his gait reminded me much of a chanticleer amidst his spouses he was delivering himself of some poetic rapture addressed as it seemed to the mud banks of the essex shore and feigned to perceive neither ludar nor me till he came upon us so said he then eyeing me here is our flying dutchman our bolt out of the blue our dragons tooth turned to man and by my sword a pretty fellow too count me as thy patron my hollander and if as i judge by thy face thou hast a tooth for the honey of parnassus his garden and the dainty apples of the muses orchard thou shalt not starve verily to be brief i favour thee therefore thy fortune is made i was bewildered enough by this speech not a tithe of which could i understand i took it ill to be called dutchman and dragons tooth nor albeit i was a printers prentice did i know what he meant by parnassus still as he seemed friendly disposed i answered i thank you thank not me said he raising his hand let not the groping man thank the lamp nor the briar the brook thank the sun whence the lamp hath his light and the ocean to whom the brook oweth his waters thank that incomparable paragon that consummate swan that pearl of all perfection my mistress of whose brightness i am but the mirror and medium pardon me sir said i feeling very foolish to comprehend not a word of his fine talk if you have anything to tell me pray say so but for the life of me i cannot discover what you mean by all this i mean said he that she my lady the aphrodite who rules these waves the star who guides our course the nymph who suns her locks on this poor ship the same condescends to call you her servant wherefore owe it to her that thou mayest also call me thy master i began to weary of this jargon moreover the fellow now seemed to be talking about matters which he had better leave to ludar and me so i said you are none of my master i have a better he looked a little hurt at this i thought and said can an ass call the horse its master when a man claimeth both who is this mortal sirrah that i may scorn him this gentleman is my master said i growing very hot and laying my hand on ludars arm the gallant laughed pretty on my life the dog hath its parasites the scullion his menial the earthen pot his mug and each puffeth himself into a gentleman thereby and who may you be forsooth ludar mcsomhairle buidhe mcdonnell of the glyns said ludar solemnly the fellow laughed outright i do remember said he a pretty jest of dan aesopus about a jackdaw who thought himself a peacock because he had a monstrous long feather to his tail prithee thou silly son of neptune knowest thou not that if i did bid thee carry me my box from the foredeck there to the poop thou must crawl with it like my jackporter and by my soul i have named the very service that brought me hither therefore my lord sir ludar mcsorley boy mcneptune mcmalapert mcdonnell of the glyns fetch my box below and should the burden be too heavy for thy dainty fingers pray thy serving gentleman here to lend thee a hand ludar who was leaning against the mast yawned whereat the gallant dropping his fine speeches turned as red as a lobster and with a loud french oath drew out his rapier and flourished it ludar watched him contemptuously for a while until the blade getting courage at every pass ventured a modest prick then he leapt out like a cat on a mouse and caught the silly fellow such a grip of the wrist as sent his sword spinning on the deck picking it up he quietly broke it over his knee into three pieces which he pitched one after the other overboard now master jackanapes said he returning to his adversary and catching him by his starched ruff you shall follow your sword then the poor fellow scared out of his wits let go a string of oaths and vowed to heaven he did but jest and loved us both like his own brothers and would ludar but unhand him he might count on him as a friend for life and so forth even ludar could not help laughing at the figure he made and having lifted him a little on to the gunwale let him down again with a get you gone then twas wonderful how the gallants courage came back as soon as he stood free by my soul said he with a gay laugh thourt a brave lad and i like thee for t a jest is like marrow in a dogs bone and life without sport is a camels track come thou and i shall be friends i see and crack more jokes than one ere this voyage be over and in sooth achilles doth well to make proof now and again of the strength of hercules why my hercules i warrant thou couldest lift that box of mine with thy finger and thumb i pray thee for my admiration see if thou couldest so carry it from where it now lies to my cabin in the poop and our flying dutchman here shall be judge that the feat be fairly done ludar with a grim smile owned that he had the worst of this encounter and made the fellow happy by carrying his box in one hand although he alarmed him not a little by offering to carry him in the other when this little jest was over the captain came to us with orders to join the crew in making all things ready for presently meeting the sea breezes at the rivers mouth so we had no more time just then to think of master coxcomb it moved my admiration to see with what a will ludar worked at his task he made no question of the frenchmans right to order his services and methought as he hauled away cheerily among his illfavoured messmates he looked as noble as had he been marching at the head of an army the ships crew was to tell the truth a scurvy company not counting us there were but eleven of them mostly french who talked and cursed while they worked and three english who sulked and grumbled they stared in no friendly way at ludar and me when we joined them nor did they like us the better that without much knowledge or seamanship we yet put our backs into what we did and bade them do the same ludar indeed born to command was not sparing in his abuse of their laziness and it vexed me a little to see how he thereby made himself an enemy of every man among them towards nightfall we were all shipshape and the watch being setof which ludar was onei had leisure to go below to seek the sleep i sorely needed i would fain before doing so have visited the maiden to satisfy myself that all went well with her but i durst hardly venture so far without her bidding i sought my berth below thereforeand a vile foul corner of the hold it wasand laid myself down wondering what would be the end of all this journeying there was a sailorone of the frenchmendown beside me who when he saw who i was sat up and began to talk in a foolish moment i betrayed that i understood some of his french lingo whereat hebeing more than half drunkenwaxed civil and his tongue loosed itself still more who is she he whispered presently in his foreign tongue a lady said i shortly so and monstrous rich by our lady comrade said he i helped carry her box on board do you take me for a fool there is something weighs more in that than a maidens frockseh my friend you are a fool said i a fool ha ha tis well and i am fool enough to you be her man they say and an honest fellow ha ha ay ay said i drowsily enough let me go to sleep ay ay said he even if it be silver pieces and not gold twill be enough to make men of thee and me dost hear sluggard thee and me and no more planks and ropes and i had ceased to hear his maunderings and was sound asleep when i awoke it was to hear the thundering crash of a wave on the deck overhead and i knew we were at last on the open sea alas when i turned over to recover my sleep i fell into so horrible a fit of shuddering and sickness that i believed the hour of my departure was come the ship rolled heavily through the uneasy water and at every lurch my heart sunki know not whither i could hear the shuffling of steps overhead and the dash of the waves against the ships side and the voice of the sailors at their posts little recked they of the comrade who was dying below presently a call came for the new watch to turn up on deck i was helpless to obey and lay groaning there not caring if the next lurch took us down to the bottom at last after much shouting the captain himself came down and shook me roughly leave me said i to die in peace die cried he thou sickly lubber if you rise not in a minutes time we will see what a ropes end can do to liven thee come get up i struggled to my feet but in that posture my sickness came back with double violence so that i tumbled again to the floor and vowed he might use every rope in the ship to me but up i could not get i do not well recall what happened those next few days i believe i staggered upon deck and went miserably through the form of work jeered at by my fellow sailors despised by my captain and wondered at by ludar but when after the sickness gave way i one day found myself in a fever with my strength all gone i was let go below and lie there without more to do i know not how it came to pass but ill i was for a day or two perhaps it was the vexations of the last few weeks or the weakness left by the sickness or a visitation of the colic from heaven however it was i lay there humbled and ashamed of my weakness and wishing myself safe back outside temple bar at these times ludar was a brother to me he came often to see me and talked so cheerily that i almost forgot how solemn his looks used to be more than that he fetched me dainties to eat without which i might have starved for while the fever lasted i could not stomach the strong ships fare and i suspected more than once that he had secured my peace from the captain by offering himself to do a good piece of my work as well as his own he spoke little enough about the maiden though i longed to hear of her once when i asked him his face grew overcast that maiden said he is never so merry as when the waves are breaking over the deck yet i see her little for in sooth the old nurse has been nearer death than you and will allow no one to go near her but her young mistress nor dare i offer myself where i am not bidden humphrey added he i prefer to talk of something else now i must tell you that to my surprise i found i had another friend in these dark days i mean the poet contemptible as was my plight and mean as was the cabin i hid in when he heard i was ill he came more than once to see me it suited him to make a mighty to do about it as if his condescension must heal me on the spot yet the kindness that was in him and the wonder he afforded me made up for all these airs and graces alack and well a day exclaimed he when he first came vulcan hath fallen from the clouds and lieth halting below the apple which was rosy is become green and the dutchman who of late flew is now become ships ballast nay my poor ruin thank me not for coming tis the common debt the high oweth to the low the sound to the broken the poem to the prose nay tis the duty a knight oweth to his ladys humblest menial and how is the lady said i for i wearied to hear of her even from any lips hast thou seen the swan with wings new dressed float on the summer tide hast thou heard the thrush fullthroated call his mate across the lea hast thou watched the moon soar up the heavens sweeping aside the clouds and defying the mists of earth hast thou marked my dutchman the summer laughter on a field of golden corn hast thou tracked the merry breeze along the ripples of a dazzled ocean yes yes said i but what has that to do with the maiden we speak of he smiled on me pityingly such poor youth is she and such methinks am i become who sit at her feet and sun myself in her light tis dark down here i said but you seem to me neither swan nor thrush nor moon nor a corn field nor an ocean but i thank you even as you are for coming tis a sign of a sound mind said he when gratitude answereth to graciousness and now prithee how do you do i told him i was better and that i might not have mended so far but for my dear master sir ludar then he bridled up and his cheeks coloured ah hercules is a good sailor and a strong animal tis fit he should wait upon you since you be in my present favour moreover like cureth like as it is said therefore he is better here tending you than casting sheeps eyes on one who is as the sun above his head i have had a mind to admonish him to remove the offence of his visage from her purview for i perceived by my own mislike of it that it was a weariness to her the pure glass is dimmed by the breath of the beholder and a face at the window darkeneth a chamber sir ludar will be here soon said i i pray you stay and tell him this no said he looking i thought a little alarmed if the cloud withdraw not from the suns path of his own motion neither will he scatter for our bidding therefore let him be and indeed i stay here too long my dutchman who shall say but the dove sigheth already for her truant mate so farewell and count me thy patron he came often after this always with the same brave talk one day however he seemed more like a plain man and said tis time thou wert up my hollander there is thunder in the air the horizon is big with clouds the dull sea rustleth with the coming storm and i smell the wind afar off why said i starting up ludar told me but just now the weather was fair and settled and that the breeze was shifting to the south i spoke not of the weather said he let it be the thunder may hide beneath a brow the lightning may flash from out two eyelids and the storm may break in a mans breast for heavens sake speak plain said i what do you mean wait and see said he i like not these french dogs only let thy eye be keen thy ear quick and thy hand ready my hollander and stand by me when i call on thee more i could not get out of him when i spoke of it to ludar afterwards he said maybe the little antic is right yet they are too sorry a crew and too small to do mischief they suspect us of carrying treasure aboard and your friend the captain i take it is the roundest villain of them all i vowed the captain was no friend of mine yet i believed him honest but as for the crew it came to my mind then what the drunken fellow had blabbed out the first night and i said it was like enough to be true that afternoon i rose from my sickbed and came on deck i remember to this hour the joy of that afternoon the day was bright and fair land was nowhere to be seen only a stretch of bluegreen water through which the misericorde spanked with a light breeze at her stern the white sails shone out in the sunlight and the happy gulls called to one another above our heads as i faced round and drank in mouthful after mouthful of the fresh salt air my life seemed to revive within me and i felt the strength rush back into my thews but the greatest joy of all was that the maiden seeing me stand there came up and bade me a joyous welcome to the upper air once more alas said she laughing it has been dull times while you have been below humphrey my good old nurse has not ceased to cry out that she was dying since we took our first lurch into the free sea your knight of the rueful countenance flies from me whenever he sees me afar your french captain might be an englishman he is so sulky and as for your english paragon thereand she pointed to the gallant who was strutting on the forward deckhe frightens me with his frenzies and raptures do you all make love that way in england no said i i think not why humphrey you talk as if you knew not i would have vowed you had a sweetheart of your own with the rest of them maybe i have said i just then to my relief ludar came up sir ludar i said this lady complains that you who are so brave run away whenever she looks your way neither the maiden nor ludar liked my clumsy speech nay sir malapert said she i complain not of what contents me besides sir ludar has been better employed in nursing you if i be a coward said ludar its because i dread a frown more than a battleaxe the maiden looked up at him with the gentle light in her eyes which i had marked before now if you dread frowns said she laughing never look in your mirror sir ludar for by my faith you glare at me now as if i were an english poet such as now approacheth we looked up and there was our gallant at our elbows as the loadstone to his star as the compass to the pole as the river to the sea so come i fair tyrant of my heart for thy sake i even salute these thy satellites o moon of my vision who derive from thee their lustre witness sir ludars countenance said the maiden but now that the sun has come on the horizon sir poet shall not we lesser lights all pale pray did you catch any fish today nay mistress mine how should the silly fish dazzled by thy heavenly brightness see the humble bait of a mortal i know not said the maiden but i saw one sailor an hour ago catch three is it a wonder since you watched the quivering line mark you my humble friends said he turning to ludar and me i relieve you of your further attendance on me and this lady i thank you and so farewell till we summon you further nay sir poet said the maiden if you must be gone adieu as for me sir ludar is about to teach me the mystery of the angle and humphrey waits on sir ludar therefore concern yourself not for me i am well attended oh said he rather chapfallen your condescension is a lesson for angels when the planet deigns to shine into the humble pool shall the star not do the same i will even abide at your side and be gracious too but his brave intention was thwarted for a call came just then from the old nurse which carried the maiden off to her side while ludar and i receiving a summons from the captain went forward and so left the poet to his own devices a sterner summons was not far off as you shall hear chapter eleven how the misericorde changed her crew we were i reckon somewhere off the yorkshire coast for we had been sailing a week for the most part against foul winds tonight as i said the light breeze had backed to the south and was sending us forward quietly at some six or seven knots an hour all seemed to promise a speedy end to our voyage and yet as i stood there drinking in the beauty of the evening and rejoicing in my recovered strength i would as soon we had been bound on a voyage ten times as long i was standing idly near the foremast on the high poop behind sat the maiden singing beside her old nurse who like me was enjoying the air for the first time tonight ludar lolled near me on a coil of rope watching the sun dip as he listened to the singing and betwixt whiles unravelling the tangles of a fishing line on the forecastle the french seamen sat and whispered scowling sometimes our way and sometimes laughing at the poet who strutted near them intent on the sunset and big with some notable verses thereupon which were hatching in his brain an english fellow was at the helm half asleep while the captain grumbling at the slackness of the breeze paced to and fro with an oath betwixt his lips and an ugly frown on his brow suddenly i seemed to detect among the frenchmen a stir as if something had just been said or resolved upon in their whisperings the captain at that instant was near them turning in his walk when without warning two of their number sprang out upon him there was a shout a struggle the gleam of a knife and then a dead man lay on the deck all was so quick and sudden that the murder was done under my very eyes before i knew what was happening then in a twinkling the whole ship became the scene of a deadly fight three of the traitors threw themselves on ludar the poet reeled in the grip of another two others made for me back back shouted ludar in a voice of thunder as he began his struggle twas well i obeyed him for the two who had made an end of the captain were already rushing in the direction of the women and had i reached the ladder a moment later all might have been lost the men i think in laying their wicked plan had scarcely taken me who late was so weak into account as a fighting man they had reckoned to carry the poop where lay the supposed treasure and the arms without a blow and once there the ship would be theirs it staggered them therefore to find me standing in the way and laying about me the two women as i said were on the upper deck which formed the roof of the poop house to that there was no access save by the small ladder which i accordingly wrenched from its place and swung round with all my might at my assailants the blow knocked over two of them and before they could regain their feet i had struck another a blow with my fist which needed no second the fourth varlet did not wait for me but closed on me with his knife luckily the blade missed its mark grazing only my ribs and before he could strike again i had him by the wrist and the blow he meant for me went home in his own neck after that twas easy work to hold off the other two one of whom was the drunken fool who had blabbed his secret days ago had i only heeded it in my sick cabin finding me stubborn and further passage barred they sheered off with a curse and hastened forward i durst not follow them for it might be a feint to decoy me from my post so with all the haste i could i threw up an outwork of lumber sails spars and boxes across the deck some distance in front of the poop and relieving my two fallen assailants of their knives i stood ready for whatever next might betide humphrey called the maiden from above put up the ladder quickly and let me down nay said i tis no place for you maiden you are safe there stay obey me humphrey said she in so commanding a voice that i fetched the ladder at once she looked pale and stern but otherwise was cool and collected as she descended now said she as she stood beside me go and bring down my nurse give me that knife i will mount guard here till you are done i durst not waste time by arguing she took the knife from me and motioned me to my task the poor old lady more dead than alive was hard to move nor was it till i wickedly threatened to cast her overboard that she consented to come at all as i was catching her in my arms the man at the helm whom i had all this time clean forgotten sprang suddenly on me from behind with a pole which had it been better aimed would have ended my troubles then and there as it was the timber fell on my shoulder almost cracking the blade but i was in with him in a twinkling and had him by the throat before he could strike again next moment the wretch woe to us that he was an englishman was over the board and the lord have mercy on his soul the delay was pitiable for the old woman whom when i came to her again i found to have swooned away it was all i could do with my bruised arm to lift her and bring her to the ladder how i got her down and into her cabin i know not but when i came out again to my ladys side the ship seemed to swim before my eyes i remember a vision of ludar bloody and gasping reeling across the deck towards us fighting his way foot by foot with four or five savage devils who followed yelling at his back then for a time all seemed dim and horrible i knew that we were fighting desperately for our lives that men fell heavily and with a groan on to the deck that the maiden stood by us undaunted that presently there was a report of a pistol followed by a hideous shouting and shrieking after that all seemed to grow still of a sudden and ludar shouted look to humphrey when i came to we were still on the deck the maiden was bathing my brow with water ludar pale and bloodstained stood gloomily by of the enemy not a man stirred my swoon could not have lasted long for the hues of the sunset lingered yet in the sky i tried to gather myself together but the maiden gently restrained me no humphrey said she lie still there is no more work to be done thank god you are safe as we are twas sorely tempting to lie thus so sweetly tended but the sight of ludar shamed me into energy i struggled to my feet my arm hung limp at my side and my head throbbed but for that i was sound and able to stand upright ludar when i came to look at him was in a worse plight than i he was bleeding from a gash on his face and another on his leg while the jacket he wore was torn in shreds on his back he came and took my arm and then motioned with his head to the ghastly heap of dead men on the deck take her within said he and then come and help me maiden said i thank heaven you are safe and that we are alive to guard you your old nurse i fear is more in need of help than we i left her senseless will you not go to her i think she guessed what we meant for she said nothing but went quickly within then ludar and i went out to our task of the seven frenchmen who had set on us not one lived beside these lay the captain the maidens waiting man who ludar said had taken side with the traitors and one other of the english sailors who had fought for us what of the poet said i when after much labour the ship had been lightened of all that was not living he is safe at the masthead said ludar there sure enough when i looked up clung the poor gallant peering down at us with pasty face and hugging the mast with arms and legs let him bide there a while said ludar he is safe and out of the way he skipped up at the first assault and wisely cut the rope ladder behind him so that no man could pursue him but tell me how do you fare i am less hurt than you said i only my arm is numbed by the whack the english knave gave me while you ludar are bleeding head and foot i was scratched said he the villains who set on me were too quick as you saw and had me down before i could shut my fist why they did not despatch me then and there i know not but in seizing me they carried their blades in their teeth the better to use their hands so that i was able to snatch one for my own use as i fell it served only to rid me of one of the company yet i got my feet again under me when the other two made at me as well as the two who had fled from you among them all i got these scratches when the fifth came who had seen the poet aloft i knew i could hold ground no longer so i gave way as you saw and made for your barrier after that you know and how the maiden stood by us all through and in the end fetched the pistol which finished the business had these villains but been armed it is they who would have buried us but come in now humphrey and take counsel twas a strange ships company that met that evening in the dead captains cabin the maiden ludar i and one of the english fellows who had been sleeping below and knew naught of the fight till all was over as for the poet ludar still refused to have him down till our conference was over of all our party the maiden was i think the most hopeful god and his saints said she have ordered this to try us and see of what mettle we be shall we despair sir ludar when he has proved his goodness to us the past is done the future is all before us you are our captain now and humphrey and i and this brave sailor here ay and our poor poet aloft there are your crew to follow where you lead i can man a gun and haul a rope as you shall see come humphrey what say you i have vowed said i to follow my master to the death nor can i think heaven will desert us while you who belong there are aboard she blushed at this and turned it off nay my friend it depends on how we do the duty that lies to our hand whether we belong there or not here ludar broke in abruptly seaman where be we now the sailor got up and went out to ascertain our bearings maiden said ludar then more grave than i had ever seen him i can make no fine speeches such as humphrey here or yonder monkey at the masthead but i accept you as one of this crew with a prouder heart than if i were offered my fathers castle then he held out his great hand and she lay her little hand in it and her true eyes flashed up to meet his and i who stood by knew that the compact i witnessed then was for a longer voyage than from here to leith i was glad when presently the man came in and reported by your leave captain we be eight leagues east of flamboro with a southerly breeze falling fast the ship lies in the wind and the tiller is swinging take the helm master and keep her head straight humphrey fetch down the poet he and i will mount the first watch tonight maiden do you get what rest you may ere your turn comes in the morning ay ay my captain said she cheerily and went humphrey said ludar calling me back when she had gone do you wonder that i love that maiden i do not said i is she you love as fair as brave as noble she is i answered every whit as fair every whit as brave every whit as noble then why he asked looking hard at me are you sad when you speak of her alas said i she loves me not ludar talk not to me of her i will go fetch the poet the poor fellow was by this time wellnigh at the end of his patience for though he had fixed himself cunningly in the rigging of the foremast seating himself on the royal yard and hugging the mast lovingly with his arms and legs he found himself unable to budge or even see what was going on below by reason of the dizziness which afflicted him how he had got up so far and managed to cut the ropes behind him he never could explain but a man will do desperate feats for his lifes sake it was no light task to dislodge him with my maimed arm i could not haul myself up the rigging even to the lower topyard much less carry up to him his dangling ladder all i could do was to hail him and bid him be of good cheer till we had him down cheer he cried cometh not in a voice from the void neither is there help in empty breath come up for i am weary of my perch and verily if the mountain come not to mahomet the prophet must abase himself to the mountain in short my man i am near tumbling hold on cried i i shall fetch help and all will be safe oh that the giants would pile pelion on ossa and get me out of this heaven i heard him say methought however the fellow could not yet be in desperate straits to talk thus at last the seaman scrambled up and fetched him down not without many protestations and caveats by the way once down however he shook his fluttered plumes and crowed like any chanticleer facilis descensus averni as our maro hath it as the muse droppeth from the heights and the golden shower descendeth so visit i once more the arcadian plains which remindeth me where is my danae and how fareth she apprise her i pray you of my return and by the way added he puffing himself valiantly where is the varlet that late sought my life he and i must settle scores before this night be an hour older fetch him hither and by my see here sir popinjay said ludar coming forward impatiently and cutting the speech in twain the time is gone past for this fooling if you be a man you may prove it now if not on my soul you shall go aloft again come you share this watch with me put some food into your body and then keep sharp lookout ahead you see the entire crew of this vessel save the two women therefore cease to be half a man and make yourself two the fellow turned pale at this news and cast a glance up and down the empty ship then without a word he took up half a loaf and a mug of beer from the cabin table and walked forward humphrey said ludar get to bed your turn will come but to bed i could not go and ludar for once i found was not hard to persuade there was in truth much to be done before we could think of rest together we overhauled the ships rations and found what would last us for long enough yet we examined too our ordnance which was but meagre and illfashioned we had three pieces on either side besides a small swivel gun on poop and forecastle the ammunition was sufficient for these and for the few pistols and muskets which we found in the frenchmans cabin further we looked long and hard at our charts which seemed well marked for the passage we were bound on the english fellow we discovered had been several times that way and though he was no pilot he said he yet knew the bass rock from a mud bank and provided we fell in with neither pirates tempest nor the spaniard could put us into leith roads right side uppermost as well as any man whereat we felt easier in our minds than we had been by the time all these consultations were ended the watch was half spent ludar therefore ordered me below whether i would or no to rest in truth i was ready for it and fell asleep almost before my head touched my pillow when i awoke ludar stood beside me up said he all goes well and your watchpartner awaits you ludar said i springing up why do you give me the partner who belongs of right to you tis a time for work said he with a smile not for play am i not captain here to your watch humphrey i went on board there stood she on the forecastle looking ahead and singing softly to herself i left her and went aft the sailor was still at the helm having volunteered a double watch to see us through the night all behind was shipshape and trim ludar had been busy clearing the decks and bringing back to order the confusion left by the late battle there was nothing for me to do therefore with beating heart i walked forward once more she turned at my coming and greeted me frankly welcome messmate said she is all well all is well said i the captain has done the work of ten men and nought is left for me and you but to look ahead and he is resting asked she think you his wounds were dressed i helped him tend them before i went below said i they were but scratches and your arm said she it still hangs heavy may i not bind it for you humphrey i wished i was the heathen briareus then with an hundred arms there was magic in her touch and no charm of witch or fairy could have mended my bruised limb as did she after that we sat silent awhile looking out to sea the soft light was spreading on the east heralding the coming day the slack breeze flapped lazily in the sails overhead and scarce ruffled the drowsy ocean the stars one by one put out their little lights and vanished into the blue there was no sound but the creaking of the yards and the gentle plash of the water on the hull only these and the music of a maidens song it went hard with me that night for a while as i sat there gazing into her face and listening to her music and feeling the touch of her hand on my arm i was fool enough to think all thisall this peace all this beauty of the ocean dawn all this lulling of the breeze all this music this gentle smile this tender touch spelt love and there came a voice from the tempter that i should tell her as much then and there what hindered me i know not twas not alone the thought of ludar or the remembrance of my own honour or the fear of her contempt be it what it may i was helped by heaven that night to be a man and with a mighty effort to shake off the spell that was on me so i rose to my feet and walked abaft many a time i paced to and fro cooling my fevered brow ere i ventured to return but when at last i did i was safe she stood there motionless radiant with the first beams of the royal sun as he leapt up from the sea look humphrey she cried is not that worth keeping watch for then she broke again into song is that an irish song you sing i asked it is how knew you that i guessed it what does it mean she blushed tis a song the maidens sing at homean old old song said she that i learned from my nurse i pray you sing it again said i she turned her face to the rising sun and sang in english words as follows who cometh from the mountain like the sun for brightness whose voice ringeth like the wave on the shingle who runneth from the east like the roe who cometh is it the wind that kisses my tresses or is it the harp of innis thrilling my ear or is it the dawn on ramore that dims my eyes who cometh is he far is he near whence comes he riding dazzling in armour and white of brow is it for me that he filleth the mountains with music who waiteth who cometh tis a wild song full of riddles said i maybe there is a song somewhere which has the answers i know it not said she not yet said i she looked up at me quickly as if she doubted my meaning but i looked out seaward and asked where in ireland is your home maiden is it near ludars castle on the sea hard by said she the mcdonnells and oneills are neighbours and foes and her brow clouded my father humphrey is the bravest of the oneills as ludars father is the bravest of the mcdonnells and does your father hold dunluce asked i i know not said she i have never seen my father turlogh luinech oneill though i love him as my life at two years i was sent away to england with my english mother who was but a handfast bride to the oneill and what may that be i asked tis a custom with us said she for the chiefs to take wives who are theirs only so long as a better does not present herself my mother alice syngleton the daughter of my fathers english ally and preserver captain syngleton was thus wedded and when i was two years oldso my old nurse tells mehe married the great lady cantire of the isles wherefore my mother was sent home to england with me and there we lived till she died three years ago since when i have pined in a convent and am now in obedience to my fathers summons on my way to my unknown home my father being as i understand allied to the english who have dispossessed the mcdonnells i was to come over under the escort of an english officer of sir william carletons choosing who was my mothers kinsman you know what peril that brought me to and how thanks to you i am now making a safer journey and a happier humphrey said she till i met you and sir ludar i had thought all men base twas the one lesson they taught us at the convent i have unlearned the lesson since pray heaven you never have to relearn it said i groaning inwardly to think how near i had been to giving her cause thus we talked that morning at every word what little hope i had once had of her love faded like the stars above our heads yet instead of it came the promise of an almost sisterly friendship which at the time seemed poor enough exchange but which was yet a prize worth any mans having she bade me tell her about myself and heard me so gently and concerned herself so honestly in all that touched me and praised and chid me so prettily for what i had done well and ill that i would my story had been twice as long and twice as pitiful the only secret i did not tell her you may guess she did not but she heard me greedily when i came to tell of my meeting with ludar and of our adventures near oxford and for his sake as much as for my own she thought kindly of me and promised me her friendship our watch was ended and we were in the act of quitting our post when the maiden taking one last look seaward cried is not that a sail away there sure enough it was sparkling on the westward horizon some two leagues to the larboard who cometh said i to myself echoing the maidens song chapter twelve how we sailed into leith a strange joy seized me as i sighted the unknown ship for my heart told me she was no friend and i was just in the humour for a fight i was one too many on board the misericorde and a brush with the queens foes just now would comfort me amazingly and yet when i came to think of it she lay in nearer the english coast than we and was like enough to be no queens enemy after all but a queens cruiser on the lookout for suspicious craft like ours for we floated no colours aloft after the late fight ludar had hauled down the frenchmans flag but it was in vain i begged him to hoist that of her royal majesty in its place he would not hear of it no said he i sail under no false colours this is a voyage for safety not for glory else i know the flag would fly there as it is humphrey tis best for us all to fly nothing the masts shall go bare the blue of a maidens eyes is colour enough for you and me to fight under i could not gainsay him we were in no trim for receiving broadsides or grappling with seadogs however merry the ports might be for a man in my plight our business was to bring the misericorde safe into leith roads and to that venture we stood pledged ludar ordered the maiden to her quarters and me to my cabin in this calm said he twill be hours before we foregather if foregather we may so below while the poet and i whistle for a breeze towards afternoon we lay much as we were drifting a little westward but then came some clouds up from the southeast and with them a puff into our canvas we may be glad to take in a reef on her before daybreak captain said the seaman time enough till then said ludar take all you can now we had not long to wait before the misericorde had way on once more then ludar called his crew to him and said tonight be yonder stranger who she may we run a race maiden you have the keenest eyes keep the watch forward humphrey do you and the poet see to the guns and have all ready in case we need to show our teeth pilot budge not one point out of the wind but let her run we may slip past in the dark and then we are lightheeled enough to keep ahead old nurse i warrant you have loaded a piece before nowwe may need you to do it again meanwhile to bed with you then the race began the wind behind us freshened fast so that in an hours time our timbers were creaking under stress of canvas before that the stranger ship though still a league and a half to larboard had caught the breeze and was going too canvas crowded with her nose a point out of the wind into our course for a long while it seemed as if we were never to come nearer so anxious was she to give us no more advantage than she could help but towards sundown we may have been a league asunder running neck and neck shes an english cruiser captain cried the helmsman and takes us for a spaniardthats flat then run as if we were so said ludar budge not an inch from your course even if we scrape her bows as we pass so we held on straight down the wind while the englishman closing in at every mile held on too and no one was to say which of us gained an inch on the other the sun tumbled into the sea and the brief twilight grew deeper while behind us the wind gathered itself into a squall just before daylight failed we could perceive the cruiser not two miles away leaning forward on her course with the queens flag on her poop and a row of portholes gaping our way then we lost her in the dusk the poet who stood near me at the gun said night is as a cave of which none seeth the end from the beginning and a man hooded feeleth what he before saw my hollander i bargained not for this when i took passage here i wish it were tomorrow why do we not under cover of night change our course because since that is what our pursuers will expect of us it will delude them the more if we keep straight on o truth many are thy arts said he but if my soothsayer the wolfs cunning be a match for that of the lamb what then then you may want your match and your knife too said i he shivered a little my hollander said he if i fall say to my lady twas for her and i pray you give her the gem in my bonnet say to her its brightness was dimmer than the remembrance of her eyes and its price meaner than the dewdrop on her lip bring her to see me where i lie and compose my face to greet her tell me my dutchman doth a cannon ball give short shrift or were it easier to die by the steel a peace to your nonsense said i you have more sonnets to write before we need think of laying you out he was comforted at this and we resumed our watch in silence the night grew very dark and at every gust our masts stooped further before the wind the misericorde hissed her way through the water and still our pilot turned not his helm an inch right or left presently ludar came up to where we stood i could see his eyes flash even in the dark go forward now said he to me should we both be running as we were and as i think we are our courses ought to meet not far hence send the maiden to mei need her to take the helm while we three stand to the guns pray heaven we win clear if not it will go hard with you friend in the prow let go your pistol at first sight of them and if you can come abaft to join us before we strike i could tell by the tone in which he spoke that he took in every inch of our peril and trembled not for himself but for some one else the maiden was loth to quit her post for she too knew the risk of it and claimed it as her right but when i told her the captain had so ordered and required her at the helm she obeyed without another word then followed a quarter of an hour that seemed like a lifetime as i stood craning my neck forward gazing under my hands seaward there crowded into my memory visions of all my past life i seemed to see the home of my boyhood and looked again into my mothers face and i stood once more before my case in the shop outside temple bar and listened to peter stoupe humming his psalmtune and heard my types click into the stick i marched once more at the head of my clubs to finsbury fields and there i saw captain merrimandrat himwith his vile lips at a maidens ear and i passed too along the village street at kingston where met me my mistress and her sweet daughter and as i looked back jeannette turned too and what was that surely in the darkness i saw something no all was pitch black the wind roared through the rigging and the water seethed up at the plunging prow but though i saw nothing i felt the pursuer near so near i wondered not to hear the swish of her keel through the waves on we went and nearer and nearer we seemed together oh for one sign of them were it even a gun across our path but sign there came none the darkness seemed blacker than ever and all of a sudden i seemed to detect somethinga spark or a glow or the luminous break of a wave so swiftly it came and went that it was gone before i could look a trick of my vision thought i no there it was again this time nothing but a spark close by on a level perhaps with our mizzen so near was it i wondered whether it might not be the lighting of a match at our own guns it went again and as it did so my finger almost without my knowing it tightened on the trigger of my pistol and it went off at the same moment there was a blaze a roar a crash and a shout for an instant the misericorde reeled in her course and quivered from stern to stern then another shout and a wild irregular roar astern then our good ship gathered herself together and leapt forward once more into the darkness and the peril was passed all was over so suddenly that the pistol was still smoking in my hand as i leapt from the forecastle and rushed aft is all well i shouted all well said ludar quietly she grazed our poop and no more and the maiden said i all well cried she cheerily from the helm and fair in the wind stand at your posts still cried ludar so for another halfhour yet we stood at our posts just as we had stood before the crisis came and not a word said any one then in the stormy east came a faint flush of dawn and we knew that this perilous night was over seaman said ludar relieve the maiden at the helm and bid her come hither she came radiant and triumphant sir ludar she said i thank you for letting me hold the helm this night you gave it me as the place of safety but i had my revenge since it proved the post of honour it was indeed the post of danger said ludar had you swerved and not held straight on we might not have been here to honour you for it but say did none of the englishmans shot reach the poop some of it witness the sail there and the rail and the stern windows but it spared me i think said ludar we maimed them in one of their masts in passing and their bowsprit broke short when it touched our stern i doubt if we shall find them following us as for our hollander said the poet who had been wondrous silent thus far he hath this night proved himself twice a prophet he said we should win this race he said moreover i should live to write another ode and lo he spoke true by your leave captain i will go celebrate this notable occasion in a strain worthy of it and to the glory of my fair amazon who go below and cook this company some pottage said ludar and see you be not long over it whereat the poet with the muse taken out of him departed we stood watching the dawn till there was light enough to look back on our nights work there was the englishman with her mainmast gone and draggled about the bows beating up under reefed sails for the coast it was plain to see although we were two long leagues away that she had had enough for one night and was going to leave us in peace for myself as i looked i could not wholly glory in having thus flouted her majestys flag but i considered that we had run that night for our lives so i hoped the sin would be forgiven me and now when we come to look round us we found the wind still running high and shifting a point or so to the eastward promising a stormy day so ludar bade us shorten our canvas and put out our ships head a bit so as to give the coast a wide berth and in truth as the day wore on the wind freshened into a gale and the gale into a tempest so that if we had promised ourselves relief after the perils of last night our hopes were dashed the sea which so far had been easy ran now high and washed over our prow as we stood across the wind and it was plain we were going to find out before long of what mettle our brave timbers were twas no light thing to face a night like this even with a good crew how much less with but four men and a maid yet i never saw ludar more at his ease in the danger of last night his face had been troubled and his manner excited now he gave his orders as if this were a pleasure trip on a quiet lake what is there to mind said he in a capful of wind tis sent to help us on our way whereas had we been taken last night where should we be now come my men help me shorten sail for a little will go a long way a night like this maiden to you i trust the helm with a light heart twill tax your strength more to keep her head thus than to run as you did last night clean before the wind but you are strong and brave and teach us to be the same the subtlest courtiers speech could not have won her as did these blunt words she said no more than i go my captain but the look of her eyes as they met his spoke volumes of joy and gratitude a tithe of which would have gladdened me for a lifetime then we fell to shortening our canvasa perilous task when that was done leaving only the topsails spread ludar bade us make good the hatches and fall to and eat which we did all but the poet who being either big with his ode or misliking the wildness of the night sat idle come sir popinjay said ludar eat for no man can work on an empty stomach and even poetry will not help haul a rope we avoid scylla my captain only to fall into charybdis methinks scylla were the better fate at least i might have passed this night recumbent the eagle at the days end flieth to his nest and the lion hath his den to all toil cometh an evensong save to the shuttlecocks of aeolus nay sir poet you did bravely last night fall to and eat now and we shall see you do more bravely tonight orpheus his weapon is a harp not a gun nevertheless i am one of five and shall yield me to a mans bidding for the sake of her my mistress to whose glory i have this day indited my ode and into whose sweet ear i will even now go recite it no no said ludar stay here and eat and then go make a better one on the starboard bow with your hand on the forestays and your eye seaward he obeyed at length and swallowed his supper then lamenting the maidens fate at being deprived of his ode he went gallantly forward there goes a brave man in the garb of a fool said ludar humphrey in this wind the maiden will be hard put to it to keep her post on the poop twould help her to lash her to her helm will you go and do it that task belongs to the captain said i she will suffer it from you he smiled at me grimly and went astern and as i said the maiden let him have his way and there she stood as night closed erect and steadfast with her hands on the tiller and her brave face set seaward twas a fearful night of shrieking wind and thundering wave often and often as the brave misericorde reared and hung suspended on a waves crest we knew none of us if she would ever reach the next lucky for us we were a flushdecked ship and our hatches sound for the seas that poured over us would have filled us to the brim in an hour lucky too the frenchmans cargo had been snugly stowed or we should have been on our beamends before midnight halfway through the night there was a loud crack and over went our main topmast with her sails in ribbons we had scarce time at great peril to cut her away when another burst snapped our mizzen almost at the deck that lightens us still more said ludar let go all the forward canvas and cut away we must put her into the wind and let her drive under bare poles with that he went to the helm where indeed the maiden must have needed succour and there he stayed beside her till the night passed afterwards he told me that he found her there half stunned by the wind but never flinching or yielding a point out of the course i know not if she was pleased to see me there said he she said little enough and hardly surrendered me the tiller but when we put the ship into the wind there was little to do save to stand and watch the sea and shield ourselves as best we might from the force of the waves that leapt over the poop and fierce enough they were in truth but what was worse was that our course now lay due west bringing us every league nearer the coast should the tempest last much longer we might have a sterner peril to face on the iron northumbrian shore than ever we had escaped in the open sea the night passed and morning saw us driving headlong with but one mast standing and not a sail to bless it the maiden who had stood at her post since sundown yielded at last and came down pale and drenched to her quarters the poet too who had clung all night to the halyards looking faithfully ahead and polishing his ode inwardly at the same time also crawled abaft half frozen and stupid with drowsiness indeed there was little any of us could do and one by one ludar ordered us to rest while he whom no labour seemed to daunt clung doggedly to the helm thus half that day the wind flung us forward till presently far on the horizon we could discern the sullen outline of a cliff we are lost said i humphrey you are a fool said ludar see you not the wind is backing fast so it was and as we drove on ever nearer the fatal coast it swung round again to the southerly and the sun above us blazed out fitfully from among the breaking clouds heaven fights for us said ludar quick rig up a sail forward and fly a yard and do you seaman look to your charts and say where we are that i have done long since said the sailor we are scarce a league from the holy island and tis full time we put her head out sir come and take the helm then for a while it seemed as if we were to expect as wild a tempest from the south as ever we had met from the east but towards evening the wind slackened a bit and veering southeast enabled us to stand clear of the coast and make battered and ill canvassed as we were straight for the scotch forth the maiden slept all through that night and when at dawn she came on deck fresh and singing we were tumbling merrily through a slackening sea with the bass rock looming on the horizon methinks the jaded greek felt not otherwise when leaving behind him the bloodstained plains of troy he espied the cloudtopped mountains of hellas said the poet who joined us as we stood which means said the maiden you are glad shall pyramus rejoice to see the wall that hides him from his thisbe or hector leap at the trumpet which parts him from his andromache mistress mine in yonder rock shall i read my doom rather read us your ode sir poet said she it has had a stormy hatching and should be a tempestuous outburst as indeed you shall find it if i have your leave to rehearse it said he i beg no greater favour said she then the poet poured out this brave sonnet go grievous gales your heads that heave ye foamflaked furies of the wasty deep ye loudtongued tritons wind and wave go fan my love where she doth sleep and tell her tell her in her ear her corydon sits sighing here the tempest stalks the stormy sea the lightning leaps with lurid light the glad gull calls from lea to lea the whistling whirlwind fills the night bears each a message to my love whose stony heart i faint to move tis too short said the maiden we shall be friends i hope long enough to hear more of it meanwhile sir poet said ludar who chafed at these civilities go forward again and keep the watch call if you spy aught and keep your eyes well open fortune favoured us that day as she had handled us roughly in the days before the wind held good and filled our slender canvas the pilots charts deceived not nor did friend or enemy stand across our path before night we had swept round the rock and found the channel of the forth up which on a favouring tide we dropped quietly that evening and at nightfall let go our anchor with grateful hearts albeit weary bodies in leith roads where for a season the misericorde and we had rest from our labours chapter thirteen how we brought the maiden to her fathers house a month later ludar and the maiden and i stood on a cliff in cantire which overlooks the irish coast the september sun was dipping wrathfully on the distant donegal heights kindling as he did so the headlands of antrim with a crimson glow below us the atlantic surged heavily and impatiently round the rugged mull oppositeso near it seemed we might almost shout acrossloomed out sheer from the sea the huge cliff of benmore dwarfing the forelands on either hand and looking as we saw it then anything but the fair head which people call it scarcely further on our right lapped in the lurid water lay the sweet isle of raughlin ablaze with heather and resounding with its chorus of seabirds a finer scene you could scarce desire a scene which one day when the sun is high and the calm water blue may glisten before you like a vision of heaven or on a wild black day of storm may frown over at you like a prison wall of lost souls or as it seemed tonight like the strange battlements of a wizards castle which while you dread you yet long to enter we looked across the narrow channel in silence i could mark ludars eyes flash and his great chest heave and knew that he thought of his exiled father and his ravished castle the maiden at his side as she turned her fair face to the setting sun half hopefully half doubtfully thought perhaps of her unknown home and her unremembered father as for me my mind was charged with wonder at a scene so strange and beautiful and yet with loneliness as i recalled that for me at least there waited no home over there the sun has gone said the maiden presently laying her hand on ludars arm he said nothing but took the little hand captive in his and stood there watching the fading glow then she began to sing softly and i knowing they needed not my help left them i remember as i made my way stumbling through the thick heather towards the little village feeling that this trouble of mine would be less could i tell it to some one and then i know not how i fancied myself telling it to sweet jeannette and how prettily she heard me with her bright eyes glistening for my sake and her hand on my arm just as a minute ago i had seen that maidens hand on ludars heigho i who called myself a man was becoming a girl happily the heather was thick and the path steep so that i presently had some other care for my head to busy itself with so i came down to the little bay and set the boat in readiness for to morrows voyage and then having nought else to do for the old nurse was abed already i curled myself up in my corner and fell asleep dreaming of i know not what now you are not to suppose that from the time we dropped anchor in leith roads till now our travels had been easy on the contrary the perils we had met by sea had been nothing to those we encountered by land well for us in parting company with the misericorde which we left in the hands of the honest pilot to render up to the frenchmans agents in scotland we had taken each our pistol and sword for scarce had we set foot in edinburgh but we were called to use them sometimes it was to protect the maiden from the gallants of the court who deemed each pretty face their private game and were amazed to find ludar and me dispute their title sometimes it was to defend ourselves from the hungry redshanks who itched to dig their daggers into some body little matter whose sometimes it was from rogues and vagabonds whose mouths watered at the sight of the box sometimes it was from the officers who took us one day for english spies and the next for lords in disguise as for the poet the day of our landing he had fled for his life from the terrors of the place and so we lost him i cannot tell what battles we fought what knocks we got or what we gave in return how night by night we slept sword in hand at the maidens door how day by day we sought to escape from the city and could not how at length under cover of a notable fray in the streets we fled back to leith where we found a boat and so reached falkirk from there how like so many gipsies we wandered over the hills and among the deep valleys till we came to lennox and so once more met the sea on the other side then by what perils of storm and current in a small rowboat we crossed to the wild isle of arran on which we were wellnigh starved with hunger and drowned with the rains and at last how using a fine day we made across to cantire where so soon as ludar declared his name we were hospitably received by the mcdonnells there and promised a safe conduct over to ireland from the wild men herehalf soldiers half marinerswe heardnot that i could understand a word of their tongue but ludar and the old nurse couldthat sorley boy ludars father was already across hiding in the antrim glynns where joined by many a friendly clan he was waiting his chance to swoop down on the english and recapture his ancient fortress turlogh luinech oneill the maidens father we heard was still lending himself to the invaders and in return for the queens favour holding aloof if not getting ready to fall upon the mcdonnells when the time came of these last alexander ludars brother first and favourite son of the great sorley boy for donnell the eldest of all had been slain in battle was reputed next to his father the bravest he was also in the glynns but james and randal his other brothers were in the isles raising the scots there and waiting the signal to descend with their gallowglasses on the coveted coast ludar had he been alone would have stayed i think to join them but with the maiden there he could think of naught until he had rendered her up safely to her father foeman though he might be so to morrow we were to sail for castleroe turloghs fort on the western bank of the river bann whence having left our charge we would repair ludar said sword in hand to his fathers camp at daybreak we quitted the mcdonnells hut in which we had sheltered and went down to the little harbour in the bay the long atlantic waves thundered in from the west as if they would bar our passage and i wondered much at the peril of crossing that angry channel in so frail a craft but ludar laughed when i questioned him these galleys said he have carried my fathers on stormier seas than thisay and the maidens fathers too therefore they may be trusted to carry you now humphrey i care naught for myself said i and you know it nay ludar if it comes to that i had as soon be under those waves as upon them he looked at me in his strange solemn way friend he said you are unhappy was it always so or is it because i with a great happiness in me see more than i once did humphrey added he that maiden has said to me that she loves me can you credit it i locked his hand in mine would that i could show him to you as he stood there his face ablaze with triumph yet almost humbled with his good fortune then as he looked on me the blaze softened into a look of pity i am selfish said he while you are far away from her you love yet i could not help telling it humphrey heaven give you the same secret one day to tell me but here she comes take her beside you at the helm as for me the light is too strong in my eyes for me to steer i must be alone here in the prow till the world take shape again the galley was a long open boat with a single square sail and thwarts for twelve rowers today six sturdy scots took the oars all mcdonnells who wondered much that ludar should lie forward leaving the fair maid and me at the helm as for the old nurse whose courage revived as the opposite headlands rose up to view she ensconced herself amidships and crooned in her native tongue with the rowers we needed to row many a mile round the island before we could hope to hoist our sail yet i could not help marvelling at the vigour of the oarsmen and at the speed and steadiness of our boat over the billows the maiden who by her blushes when we first met that morning had confirmed ludars story was content enough to sit in the stern with me while he courted solitude in the prow she sat a long while silent looking seaward and i think with the selfsame light in her eyes which dimmed those of ludar presently however she turned her face to me and said almost suddenly humphrey tell me more of that maiden you spoke about why does she not love you i knew not what to say the question was so unlooked for i tried to laugh it off ask her that said i why should she i am not sir ludar no said she gently and then her face blushed once more and she dropped silent looking away seaward i was sorry for my churlish speech and feared it had given her offence but here i was wrong for presently she said again is she the little maid who talks to you at home in french and whom you carried in your arms tell me more of her humphrey to please her i obeyed and somehow as i recalled all the gentle ways of my sweet little mistress and the quaint words she had spoken and in fancy saw once again her bright face and remembered how she had always taken my part and chased away the clouds from my browsomehow i knew not how the memory seemed very pleasant to me and i called to mind more yet and wondered with myself how little i had had her in my thoughts since last we parted that cruel day in kingston street as i talked the maiden listened her eyes stealing now and again to where ludar lay wrestling with his mighty happiness in the prow and then returning half frightened half pitying to encourage me to tell her more which i did and then when all was said she asked again and why does she not love you indeed replied i i never asked her nor do i know if i love her myself she smiled at that may i answer for you no at least i love her humphrey and for her sake and yours she shall be a sister to me and and ludar said i as she stopped short yes to me and ludar then we fell to talk about ludar and so the day wore on till as the sun stood over our heads we breasted the fair island of raughlin here ludar with gloomy face came astern to tell a story twas neither brief nor merry but as he told it with flashing eyes and voice which rose and fell with the dashing waves we listened with heaving bosoms twas of a boy who once played with his comrades on that selfsame island of raughlin how in the pleasant summer time he had learned from his noble brothers to draw the bow and child as he was to brandish the spear how maidens were there some of whom he called his sisters and how they sang the wild legends of the coast and told him tales of lovers and fairies and heroes and how now and again a white boat came over from the mainland and on it a noble warrior gigantic in form with his yellow locks streaming in the breeze and the sun flashing on his gilded collar and naked sword that noble man was the boys father and the scarcely less noble form at his side less by a head than his sire yet taller by a head than most of his clansmen was the boys elder brother and how the boy followed these two wherever they went and begged them to take him to the wars on the mainland and they smiled and bade him wait ten years so he was left with the women and children on the island while the men went off in galleys to fight the invader then one fatal day how they woke to see whitesailed ships in the offing and boats of armed men landing on the shore and how in doubt and terror women and children and old men hastened to yonder castle on the hill and begged the few armed men there stand to their guard then said ludar with thunder in his face the strangers spread like flies over the fair island and surrounded the castle to resist was useless the armed men offered to yield if the women and children and old men were spared yield then said the captain and the gate was opened then the false villains shouted with laughter and slew the armed men before the eyes of the helpless captives bring a torch shouted some drive them back into their kennel shouted others then a cry went up so terrible that on the light summer breeze it floated to the mainland to where on the headland the noble father of that boy stood like a statue of horror as the flames shot up the wretched captives fought among themselves who should reach the door and die on the sword of the enemy rather than by the fire that boy saw his playmates tossed in sport on the swords of their murderers and heard his sisters shriek to himboy as he wasto slay them before a worse death befel then he forgot all except that when days after he awoke he was in the heart of a deep cave into which the sea surged carrying with it corpses for a week he stayed there tended by a rough shepherd living on seaweed and fish and wellnigh mad with thirst at last came a boat and when that boy woke once more he was in the castle of his noble father whose face was like the midnight and whose once yellow hair was as white as the snow that is the story said ludar i was that boy and the murderers said i falteringly for i guessed the answer the murderers humphrey said he were of the same race as your worst enemy and mine this gloomy story cast a cloud over our voyage until after long silence during which we sat and watched the rocky coast of the ill omened island the maiden said sir ludar there are older stories of raughlin than yours listen while i sing you of the wedding of taise taobhgheal which befel there when yonder hill was crowned by a beautiful white city with houses of glass and when warriors shone in golden armour then she sang a brave martial ballad of a famous battle which was fought on those coasts for the hand of the beautiful taise taobhgheal and the clear music of her voice to which the rowers lent a chorus helped charm away the sadness of ludars tale and while away the time till having rounded the island we hoisted our brown sail and flew upon the waves past the great organshaped cliffs of the mainland the sun had long set behind the western foreland ere we caught ahead of us the roar of the surf on the bar which lay across the rivers mouth our rowers had passed that way many a time before and plunged us headlong into the mighty battle of the waters where river and sea met for a short minute it seemed as if no boat could live in such a whirl but before we well knew the danger we were in calm water within the bar sailing gaily down the broad moonlit river then ludar and the maiden grew sad at the parting which was to come and i being weary of the helm left them and went forward beautiful the river was in the moonlight with the woods crowding down to its margin broken now and again by rugged knolls or smooth shining meadows to me it was strange to be in ireland and yet have all remind me of my own thames all except the wild chant of the foreign rowers many a mile we rowed then or rather glided for ludar bade the men slacken speed and let the night spend itself before we presented ourselves at castleroe therefore we took in the oars after a while and floated idly on the tide the old nurse came forward to where i sat very dismal and complaining ochone said she this has been a sore journey master humphrey my bones ache and my spirits are clean gone musha its myself would fain be back in london town after all therell be none to know judy ocahan here and ive nigh forgotten the speech and manners of the place mysel and my heart sinks for the sweet maiden why what ails her i asked has she not come to her fathers house ay ay so its called so its called tis turlogh owns castleroe but tis my lady of cantire owns turlogh he durst not bless himself if she forbid she wants no english stepdaughters i warrant ye or if she do twill be to buy and sell with and further her own greedy plans i know my lady and i know how it will fare with my sweet maid i tell thee master humphrey turlogh brave lad as he was must now do as his grand lady bids and twere better far the maiden had stayed in her nunnery school why judy said i you forget he sent to england for her and that now since this voyage began she has found a protector who will ease both the lord and lady of castleroe of her charge she laughed little you know master prentice but there comes the dawn sure enough in the east the grey crept up the sky and at the same time the banks on either side of us rose steeply while the roar of a cataract ahead warned us that our journeys end was come we waited yet another hour moored under the bank till the sun lifted his forehead above the hill then the note of a bugle close at hand startled us and ludar bade us disembark castleroe was a house perched strongly on the western bank of the river with a moat round and a drawbridge separating the outer courtyard from the house itself as we approached we were loudly challenged by a sentry who called to us in broad english who goes there halt or by my life you shall have a taste of my musket if you advance further my heart leapt to my mouth twas not at hearing the english speech once more but because the fellows voice itself was familiar to me and when a moment later its owner came in view i saw the man i had met once on the road to oxford the same tom price who had gone near hanging me for a jesuit and afterwards had tempted me to take service in the troop of his master captain merriman for these irish wars was it much wonder i gasped aloud as i saw him tell turlogh luinech oneill said ludar advancing that his daughter is come from england with her ancient nurse and take us to him that we may deliver our charge safely into his hands ludar cried i taking him by the arm halt for heavens sake this is one of captain merrimans men the soldier looked round as i spoke and recognised me in a trice hillo cried he what have we here my little jesuit lord mayor of london as im a sinner and in what brave company sure they told me my lady expected visitors and here he is with his sweetheart and old mother and private chaplain woes me the flag is not aloft so lad thourt come to join our wars after all and tell the captain about that duckweed and thou shalt my little humphreyyou see i even remember your name one word tom price said i breathlessly as you are an honest man is the captain here here he is my ladys honoured guest this three weeks since he arrived here in a temper enough to sour the countryside why hadst thou run away with his own sweetheart thou couldst not is my father is turlogh luinech oneill here then asked the maiden coming up thy father said the soldier gasping why i took thee for and art thou then said he pulling off his cap art thou yes yes said she i am rose oneill pray say is my father here madam said he he left us a week ago for his castle at toome howbeit my lady ludar said the maiden back to the boat quick i will not go in here nay fair angel said a voice at our side now we have found our truant bird we must cage her it was captain merriman himself smirking hat in hand before he could well speak the words ludar had sprung at his throat and hurled him to the ground then ensued a pitiful uproar the guard in a moment turned out upon us it was useless for two men to stand against twenty our mcdonnells at the boat were beyond call we fought as long as we could nor was it till ludar received a gun shot in his arm and i a slash that laid bare my cheekbone that we knew the game was up the maiden had been carried off into the house the old nurse lay in a swoon three men besides the captain were disabled as for us we could but stagger to the gateway more dead than alive once outside the gate was closed the guard from within sent a few flying shots after us one of which lightened me of my little finger and another missed ludars knee then seeing us gone and hearing the shouts of our mcdonnells who at the noise of the shots had come up to help us they forbore to follow further and let us get clear and it was in this manner we brought rose oneill safely to her fathers house at castleroe chapter fourteen how ludar fired the beacon on knocklay i think had it not been that ludar immediately fell into a swoon with the wound in his arm we should never have got him back to the boat for such was his wrath and despair that he would have turned and invaded the castle singlehanded preferring to meet his death thus to leaving the maiden in so dire an extremity as for me twas well i had this new care thrust upon me or i too might have fallen into a despair scarce less than his i guessed so soon as the panic was over and captain merriman brought round that order would be given to follow and capture us at all hazard therefore so soon as our mcdonnells arrived we bore ludar among us to the boat and cast loose without delay in this we were none too soon for we had not been long rowing ere a noise of bugles and shouting at the castle gave us to know that the pursuit was begun lucky for us the woods on either bank were too dense to allow them to get within shot of us nor after we had got safely past the town of coleraine was there much fear that they being unprovided with boats could get at close quarters with us once clear we looked to my comrades wounds the bullet which had gashed his arm had happily not lodged there but it had lost him so much blood that although we bound it up and stanched the flow it was yet a long while before he recovered life enough to open his eyes then he said whither are we going seaward said i leaving her amid wolves said he bitterly twould do her no good if we returned said i to be slain before her eyes so long as she knows we are safe there will be hope for her and she is brave enough to defend herself till we come again ludar smiled bitterly he knew as i did there was nothing in the words my men said he presently to the scots wherever sorley boy my father is take me sorley boy is a fox that leaves no tracks said one of the men but we last heard of him at bonandonnye sail thither said ludar and fell into silence twas a strange return voyage that down that broad river on the ebb of the selfsame tide which had carried us up neither of us spoke a word but as we watched the banks and one another we wondered if this could be the same world and the same men as a few hours ago it was a relief presently to meet the salt sea air on our faces and to hear ahead once more the angry roar of the waves at the rivers mouth just as we reached the place where the channel narrowing suddenly tears its way through the sand into the ocean a posse of horsemen dashed down on the western shore and shouted to us so near were they that i could see tom price among them and beside him that rascally captain laker whom i had seen or heard last in sir william carletons garden at richmond one of the rowers pulled me down to the bottom of the boat just as a volley of shot whizzed over our heads up now and row like fiends cried our men when it had passed give me my pistol said ludar i have at least one arm so we tore through the water letting fly at them as best we could while they stood reloading ludars aim missed for he had only his left hand mine was more lucky since it knocked over the villain laker just as he raised his gun for a second shot this saved us for it gave us time to pull further beyond reach so that when the next volley came it pattered harmlessly in the waves around us this time we could not duck our heads for our boat was already in the hurlyburly of the surf and needed all our skill and all our strength to get her over that angry bar more than once we were glad to fall back right side uppermost and more than once we looked to see every timber we had fly asunder but at last between two lesser waves we slipped over taking in half a boat of water as we did so but winning clear of the peril and leaving our pursuers who had waited to see us perish to turn back sullenly to report their ill success to their master twas a far cry to bonandonnye which lay behind the eastern headlands some four leagues beyond benmore nor durst we approach it the shortest way because our men had heard that the coast was closely guarded by the english who made short work of all suspected craft so we were fain to hoist our sail and stand out to sea rounding raughlin on the far side and running back on cantire there for a week and more ludar lay in a fever shouting to be taken to his father yet too weak to turn in his bed tenderly his clansmen nursed him and me for the matter of that for i had wounds too until at least we were both in better trim meanwhile one of the men had rowed across to the mainland and come back with the news that sorley boy was deep in the woods of glenshesk behind the great mountain of knocklayd where he was rapidly bringing his forces to a head for a swoop on dunluce this news decided ludar to tarry not a day longer that very night as the sun set we embarked on our boat it was the time of the autumn gales and hard enough were we put to it to get safely across for that very reason perhaps we were able to land unobserved by the careless watchmen on the coast who never dreamed to look for a boat on such a night whereas had they known more of the mcdonnell oarsmen they would have doubled their guard instead of going asleep i was glad to find that ludar having resolved on the journey had strength enough to go through with it indeed his step grew firmer every pace we took and although his brow remained black and he would i think have felled me to the ground had i mentioned the maidens name in his ear yet on other matters his spirits revived twas a difficult journey from the little bay where we landed to glenshesk nor dare we make it in broad daylight we took care to clad ourselves like herdsmen yet even so it would have been a risk to accost a stranger or enter a hut for shelter for the oneills and the english among them had overawed the peasants and although it was commonly believed the turlogh would hold aloof in this quarrel yet he had his own grudge against the mcdonnells and was not lightly to be run against so we lay hid all day in the thick heather and at night crossed rapidly at the back of benmore and plunged into the woods on the slopes of the domelike knocklayd ludar seemed to know his way by instinct the mcdonnell had told us where we should meet with a friendly clansman who would take us to the chief and had warned us what paths specially to avoid in crossing the mountain his instructions served us well and at daybreak we came upon the friendly hut just where we had expected a little below the summit on the seaward side of the hill the man would by no means let us lie in his hut for fear of being seen but showed us a deep cave in the hillside where we and a score of men beside had it been needful might hide as we lay there waiting for night ludar for the first time referred to what had befallen at castleroe humphrey said he i am torn in two how can i go out to take a castle while she lies in the wolfs clutches yonder yet how may i a loyal man pursue my private quarrel while my brave father demands my service for the clan in this great enterprise maybe said i in doing the latter you will achieve both ends for assuredly so soon as an alarm is raised for the safety of dunluce this merriman and every trooper he has must come thither so the maiden will be left free of him besides said i if what the old nurse says is true my lady cantire is not the woman lightly to abandon her rights in the maiden she is more likely to hold her as a bait to trap the captain into some benefit to herself and to that end she will at least keep her safe out of his clutches for a while ludar groaned humphrey said he you are a glib comforter tell me he added from this height we should surely be able to see castleroe yes said i i remember seeing this round hill as we stood parleying with the sentinel ludar said no more but sat at the mouth of the cave looking westward till sunset then a new resolve seemed to have taken hold of him he led me to the cairn on the mountain top where was piled a great heap of wood and briar ready for a beacon fire when shall this be lit he asked our guide when sorley boy is ready tis the last signal agreed upon when knocklayd is fired friend and foe the country round will march then said ludar pile up more fuel and fetch a torch the man and i stared at him in amazement do you hear he thundered am i mcdonnell or are you then when the man scared and terrified went off to obey ludar said to me i cannot help this humphrey the signal must go out tonight or all will be too late something tells me she is looking this way even now praying for deliverance something tells me too that a days more delay and dunluce is lost to us for ever this shall bring all to a head for better or worse but your father said i if he be not ready sorley boy mcdonnell is always ready said ludar proudly so we stood silent and waited till the shepherd brought the torch can we see dunluce from here i asked presently he took my arm and pointed to where away in the west a gleam of moonlight struck the sea there said he then as we both strained our eyes there arose as it seemed from that very spot a strange wild sound like the rise and fall of some wailing music which moaned in the air and died away what was that i asked hush said he listen it came again rising almost to a shriek and sinking again into a sigh once more i looked at ludar and once more with pale face he motioned me to hold my peace and listen a third time the sound came like a snatch of some mad song ending in a sob after it you could almost feel the silence we stood rooted to the spot until presently the footsteps of the herdsman broke the spell then ludar said that is the banshee it means that in this business a mcdonnell of us will fall heaven help us then scornfully throwing off the fear which for a moment had seemed to overtake him he resolutely snatched the torch from the mans hand and plunged it into the pile we stood and watched the fire as first it crackled amidst the under layer of twigs and dry heather then caught the branches above and finally shot up in a grand tall column of flame skyward showering high its sparks and casting a fierce glow far and wide over land and sea twas a strange a wondrous sight yet as i looked the midnight fire itself was not so strange as the sight of ludar standing there noble huge and motionless illumined by the strong light gazing out with shaded eyes into the far distance to me it seemed like a scene in some weird play of which i forgot that i was myself an actor but as soon as the flame bursting forth with a great roar reddened the sky overhead ludar drew me to a little distance and pointed seaward then i perceived suddenly on our right a twinkle of light which presently increased to a lurid flame at the same instant on the left appeared a like fire which in turn was taken up one by one from headland to headland till the whole coast from cushindun to ramore was ablaze even on the far distant donegal headlands there glimmered a responsive signal a wondrous sight indeed with the atlantic almost at our feet reflecting angrily back the glare of the fire and traversed by paths of light each seeming less fierce as the distance increased until from the remotest there travelled but a tiny streak above the sky still more fiercely carried the red signal while from their rocks swooped up the great army of seabirds and flew crying out to sea thither my two comrades still eagerly gazed though scarce five minutes had passed since the first flame shot aloft the impatience of the herdsman became extreme and he muttered angrily through his clenched teeth as he strained his eyes into the irresponsive darkness altacarry exclaimed he at length when presently on the point of raughlin a light shot up and cantire he added when later the eagerly looked for light on the scottish mainland broke aloft and mingled its glare with that of the antrim fires then at last ludar relaxed his motionless posture and taking my arm plunged hastily from the summit with the herdsman before us for a guide halfway down the guide halted and pointed out two new signals inland one to our right the other straight before us yonder said he pointing to the right comes from the ocahans country beyond the bann above castleroe where be english troops that in front shows that sorley boy is afoot already tis a wily fox added the man talking as they all did in their irish tongue among these score of lights who shall say which is his or whither he foregathers but we know presently we dropped into the marshland at the base of the hill and lost all save the red glare in the sky above us by many a cunning path the man led us between bogs through woods and over piledup rocks till we stood on a new hillside and caught sight again of the distant beacons that on knocklayd behind us was already burning low but it had done its work for as we mounted higher a dozen new fires inland met our view and standing for a moment to look our ears caught a distant sound of shouting and the clattering of horses feet we were now our guide told us looking down into the deep vale of glenshesk at the head of which the chieftain lay a wild impassable valley it looked crowded with forest and flanked with rugged mountain i could scarcely wonder as i looked down at the tales the man had told us of how in time of war the country people would drive their cattle together with the women and children far into the depths of these glens for safety while they went out to meet the enemy on the seaboard or of how tempting him to follow the booty up one of these they had caught him many a time in a trap between two fires and cut him to pieces the descent into the valley was perilous enough even for us for the greater part of the way we had to swing ourselves down by the trees many of which threatened to break under our weight and hurl us headlong to the bottom but when at last we reached the stony land below it was easier walking and we reached the stream in safety here we halted impatiently till morning humphrey said ludar by this time unless we have ventured for naught an alarm has gone out which will send merriman out of castleroe and bring back turlogh into it so far we have done well but unless sorley boy reach dunluce quickly the enemy will be in the place before us and we shall have done harm why do they not come if i had but fifty men like you humphrey we need not be sitting thus but sit we did till the sun looked at us over the hill then ludar could wait no longer but summoned me to my feet and stalked up the valley we had gone about an hour when a loud tramp and shouting ahead together with a vision of wild figures on the hills on either hand told us that the long expected meeting had come at last the next turn of the valley brought us full in view of the mcdonnell host it stretched in a wild irregular line far up the glen the men marching four or five abreast armed some with spears some with swords and bucklers others with bows and a very few with firearms they sang a loud wailing song as they marched mingled with cries of defiance and now and then of laughter but what moved me most was the aspect of the two men who marched a dozen paces in the front of all the elder was a giant huge of limb towering above his clan like saul in the bible among his israelites his white hair hung wildly on his shoulders and tossed defiantly with every step he took he may have been seventy years of age yet his face was knit as hard as a warriors of thirty and he stepped out as lissom and quick as his youngest gallowglass yet all this was as nothing to the noble sadness of his face and the blaze of his deep blue eyes which had i not known it already would have betrayed him to me anywhere as ludars father the younger warrior at his side a man of thirtyfive joyous of mien his yellow hair glistening in the sunlight and his massive form only less massive than his fathers moving with a careless ease it was not hard to guess was alexander the darling of the clan and the pride of his fathers life seeing us in the path they suddenly halted while the musketeers behind levelled their pieces but ludar stepped solemnly forward father i am ludar said he the old man uttered a quick exclamation and stepped back a pace to look at this stalwart man whom he had seen last a young boy ten years ago then with a face as solemn as that of his sons he laid his great hand on the lads shoulder and said thou art come in good time ludar my son that was all the greeting that passed betwixt these two for immediately the march began again the old man stalking first alone and the two brothers who had kissed at meeting following arm in arm twas a noble sight those three great menthe old chief and his first and last born sons but to my mind much as i loved my master sorley boy was the grandest of the three while he was by a man could look at no one else every gesture every toss of the head and swing of the arm had force in it and to me it seemed a wonder that such a man should need an army at his back to carry him anywhere he willed he halted again presently and wheeled round on his sons why did you fire the beacon he asked of ludar because the time had come said ludar today dunluce is slenderly guarded tomorrow it will be full of the enemy then he coloured up with a flush as he added father i demand a favourthe first for ten years it is granted lad i know what it is you shall take the castle then ludar grew radiant as he clutched his fathers hand and thanked him for this mighty honour and alexander seemed scarcely less happy for his young brothers sake we be a thousand armed man said the old chief he spoke in his own tongue to which even i was growing somewhat familiar by now take three hundred with you ludar my son and turn westward alexander with three hundred more shall march to the sea northward as we go now i with the rest will strike eastward to bonandonnye tomorrow boy if dunluce be not yours alexander shall come to take it for you the day after if you both fail i shall be there myself with the clansmen from the isles who are already upon the sea here we part company lads when we meet again one of us shall not see the other two last night i heard the banshee and i said alexander and i said ludar farewell then said sorley boy do you ludar choose your three hundred and begone after you alexander do the same i will take the rest the pipers shall come with me to draw the enemy eastward the division was soon made ludar chose the clansmen who knew best the parts about dunluce and the country we should have to cross to reach it in an hour we were ready to start farewell said the old chief we meet all at dunluce two days hence dead or alive said alexander then the order was given to march and we turned suddenly up the westward slope of the glen the men behind us shouting dunluce froach eilan ludar till our several parties lost sight of one another then ludar ordered silence and speed and so all day long we tramped over the rugged hills and across the deep valleys till near sundown ludar having halted his men in a deepwooded hollow took me forward and brought me to the summit of a little green hill here he took my arm and pointed ahead dunluce said he chapter fifteen how ludar took dunluce at first i saw nothing but a jagged line of clifftop lower than where we stood with the sea beyond then i perceived that where ludar pointed the line broke suddenly and disclosed a great naked rock standing alone sheer out of the water which leapt wildly all round it and thundered into the cave at its base i looked further i saw a narrow bridge across the chasm while what i had first thought to be rugged piles of rock took the form of grim battlements and towers rising so straight from the edge of the rock that i had thought them a part of it across the bridge frowned an angry portcullis as the place stood it looked as if one man could hold it against a thousand so unapproachable did it seem on our side the bridge on the mainland was a large courtyard or barrack with an outer wall and moat round it of itself no easy place to carry and when beyond that hung this angry castle perched like an eagle over the sea i marvelled not so much that the mcdonnells should hope to take it as that they should ever have lost it i could understand ludars excitement as he stood there and gazed at this old fortress of his fathers with the standard of the foreign invader floating above its topmast tower he said nothing yet i could tell by the heaving of his chest what thoughts were passing in his mind what hatred of the usurper what impatience to stand once more on those battlements and fling open the gate to his noble father the light faded from the sky as we stood there until turrets and rock and flag melted away into a common blackness and left us only the thunder of the waves in the hollows below to tell us where dunluce stood then ludar led me quickly back to his men we found no little stir afoot for the mcdonnells scouts had come in with a man of the english garrison whom they had found foraging for meat while almost at the same moment a herdsman from ramore which was a district westward of us had come to tell us news of the enemy ludar heard the soldier first we be but thirty men in yonder hold said he for so soon as the alarm spread that castleroe and the town of coleraine were to be attacked fifty of our guard and three cannon were drawn away thither this very morning i know it for i stood sentinel when captain merriman he is he there demanded ludar no in truth said the soldier twas he rode over from castleroe and took away half our men leaving us in place a parcel of puling women to mind whom he might have kept with better grace at castleroe and who are these women asked ludar with heightened colour they say the fair one is a sweetheart of his owna straight enough lass but not of the sort i would willingly undertake myself some say she is kinswoman to the oneill or his lady whom the captain was sent to guard hither but to my thinking he was on his own business more than turloghs and when this fighting be over we shall see him come back for his ladybird i pray you gentles continued this man who was of a careless sort and distressed by no mischance permit me to return to the castle with this brace of birds they are in fact for this same young lady to whom our coarse fare hath little to recommend it and who being sickly needs a dainty i stand a fair chance to be shot for a truant when i get back yet i may as well be that as hanged here by your worships the only difference will be that the maiden will get her supper in one case and miss it in the other go back said ludar if you be a liar you are a rare one if you be not you are an honest fellow and can be trusted to report nothing of what you have seen here that will i not said the man but when i see thee on the drawbridge i shall let fly at thee by your leave as at an enemy of my queen you shall said ludar i would scorn you if you did not but hearken take the maiden this flower and he pulled a poppy flower from the grass and tell her before it droop he who sent it will be in dunluce marry will i said the soldier laughing but thou wilt need to hasten my master for poppies fade fast and if as i expect thou get no further than the bridge or over the edge of it you may trust me to look to the lady for your honours sake so the man departed amidst not a few murmurings from our men who understood not letting an enemy go scot free unless it were to betray his party into their hands the other fellow one of the men of the route who served which ever party he must confirmed what the englishman had said respecting the movements of the enemy sorley boy had for weeks past let it be hinted that when he came to strike it would be at the castle on the bann on the one hand and at knockfergus far to the south on the other therefore while turlogh luinech oneill tarried at toome to watch what passed in the latter region captain merriman strengthened coleraine and the forts on the bann in order to hold the former meanwhile sorley boy having thus made the enemy busy elsewhere was coming down as i have said betwixt the two at dunluce no doubt but the english suspected some scheme for they withdrew only parts of their garrisons along the coast depending on the natural strength of dunluce and the other castles to hold off any attack till succour should arrive but since the old fox never showed front till he was ready to spring no one knew exactly where to expect sorley boy whereby the enemy was forced to remain scattered in little companies all along the coast from larne to the bann mouth at any rate said the man after the signals with cantire last night no one would expect the blow to fall till the scottish clansmen were landed which might be this time tomorrow ludar bade the man remain in their company and then called me and two others of his chief men aside tis plain said he our chance is now or never give the men time to sup and then take forward your guns and have at them in front you two said he addressing the two scots with the main body are to carry the outworks and pounding at the enemys gate keep him busy to landward humphrey and i and twenty more must try the sea front as soon as you hear us shout from within let drive every bolt you have and the place is ours but said i you said that on the seaward side the place is unassailable it is except to mcdonnells i did not play on these rocks for naught when a boy only pick me out twenty resolute men and bring them round secretly to the first break in the cliffs eastward i shall be there twas easy to find twenty men ready for the venture nay the hard thing was to take no more than twenty for a hundred were eager to come no sooner were we started than the main body as agreed leapt from their hidingplace and marched rapidly on dunluce our guide took us a mile eastward of the castle where at the head of the narrow gully that led from the cliff to the shore stood ludar pistol in hand waiting for us he turned silently as we came up and motioning to us to follow began at once the steep descent the cleft was so narrow that one man could only lower himself at a time and that swinging as often as not by his elbows and hands for me it was harder work than for the active redshanks as for ludar he stood at the bottom while i with half the troop growling at my back was stuck midway yet we all reached the bottom in time and as we did so the boom of a gun from the rocks above us told that our men were already before the castle knocking for entrance then we waded and scrambled in the darkness at the waters edge till we came to the base of the great black rock on which the fortress stood often we were wading waistdeep in the pools and often on hands and knees drawing ourselves over the surfswept ledges ludar seemed to know every step of the way despite the years that had passed since as a boy he hunted there for seabirds nor was he in the humour now to slacken speed for us who knew not when we put out one foot where we should land with the other above us the noise of the guns was already lost in the thunder of the waves as they echoed in the cave under the castle rock it seemed as we stood there and looked up that not a foot further could we go the great angry cliff beetled over our heads and on its very edge far above we might discern against the gloomy sky the dim corner of a buttress but it was not here that ludar meant us to ascend now my men said he put your powder in your bonnets and follow me whereupon he took a step up to his neck in the deep water and started to swim one by one we followed him armed and clad as we were into the angry surf twas a perilous voyage and had not the tide been full and high above the rocks we should not have come out of it some of us sound in limb or wind once or twice as i was flung upwards with a swirl almost upon the jagged cliff i thought my last hour was come and wondered whose eye would be dim at the news of my end then when with a like swirl i was heaved back into the safety of deep water i thought what a big venture was this and who would not follow when ludar led so i scarce know how we rounded the mouth of that resounding cave and stood panting on the narrow ledge on the far side i say we stoodyet not all of the twentytwo men who had plunged only nineteen foregathered at the far side twas bravely swum said ludar and though it has cost mcdonnell three brave sons it has won him dunluce i promise you we shall go back by land i asked him where next and he pointed up to what seemed a rock as sheer and threatening as ever we had met on the other side nay on this side the castle itself seemed to hang clean over the edge there is a path i remember said he by which in old days the mcquillans came down to the cave i went up it myself as a boy see here and he led us a few steps round as if back towards the cave where was an iron spike driven into the smooth rock a little above the edge of the water he reached forward at this and swung himself out over the water till his feet rested on a narrow ledge beyond scarce the width of his boot at the waters edge above this was a jutting nose of rock by which he raised himself on to the peg itself and from that by a long stride on to a safer ledge above follow me he cried and look not back painfully and clumsily i achieved the perilous stride and found myself at the entrance of a crack in the rock into which the waves below dashed and thundered and then beaten back shot up in an angry column high over our heads descending with a whirl that all but swept us headlong from our perch up this rift i watched ludar clamber losing him now and again in the shooting foam and now and again as the spray cleared off seeing him safe and ever a foot higher than before how i followed him twould be hard to say yet the rock seemed riven into cracks which gave us a tolerable foothold the better as we got higher up and had it not been for the constant dash of the water and the darkness it might have been accounted passable enough as it was but for ludars strong arm above me i should have lost my feet twice and in my fall perchance might have carried away one or more of those who followed when we reached the top of the rift a still worse peril awaited for now we had to crawl painfully for some distance along a narrow edge on the face of the naked rock with little hold for our hands and since the ledge slanted downward and was wet and slippery with the spray still less for our feet even ludar i could see was at a loss but to halt now was useless to turn back impossible so gripping as best he might at the rugged rock he stepped boldly on to the ledge i could but follow yet at the first step my feet slid from under me and but that my hands held firm i should have been headlong inch by inch hugging the cliff with our backs to the sea we crawled over that treacherous ledge sometimes slipping to our knees sometimes hanging sheer by our hands once in a moment of weakness i looked back to see how our men were faring as i did so a youth next after me a tall brave youth who had been foremost in all the peril suddenly staggered and slipped for a moment he hung by hand and knee to the ledge the next with a loud groan he fell backwards into the darkness i heard the crash of his body on the rocks below and in my horror my own grip for an instant relaxed and i felt myself following but a strong hand caught me and held me up and ludar said humphrey are you a fool lookup man or you are lost after that i had eyes for naught but the cliff before me and although before that terrible passage was ended i heard five more groans and as many more crashes on the rocks below i managed to keep my own footing till at last with my head in a whirl i stood beside ludar on a broader straighter ledge within a dozen feet of the clifftop ludar was pale and his breath came and went hard as he made room for me beside him he too had heard those terrible crashes that path said he is easier passed by a boy than a man had i known what it would cost us yet come on now there was indeed no time to tarry for the men behindall that were left of themcame up and we must perforce move forward to make them room now once more we heard the guns above and a mighty shouting on the far side of the castle but towards us all frowned black and solitary the short distance yet to climb compared with what we had passed was easy for steep as it was and often overhanging the sea the rock here was rough and dry and our feet held fast just as we came to the top ludar turned follow close my men shout and discharge your pieces if you can called he and once entered make for the drawbridge almost as he spoke we heard a shout above us and the report of a musket discharged into the darkness a sentinel had heard our voices and this was his greeting next moment i saw ludar on the top struggling with a man it was too dark to discern which was which but a moment later one of the two staggered a step backwards to the edge there was a yell a shower of loose earth then as i stood below clinging to the rock a dark mass fell betwixt me and the sky brushing me as it passed and bounding from the ledge below with a hideous crash out into the deepness i stood there an instant as cold and pulseless as the stone against which i leaned what if this were ludar who had fallen a voice from above restored me to life quick there come up and the place is ours in a moment i stood beside him on the narrow edge of grass between the castle wall and the brink we could hear the shouts and firing away at the gate but not a soul was left here to bar our passage even the sentinels shot had passed unheeded there was a low window leading to one of the offices of the castle through which we clambered next moment we found ourselves standing within the walls of dunluce froach eilan shouted ludar drawing his dirk and waving on his men froach eilan ludar shouted we some of us discharging our pieces to add to the uproar while one man exploded a swivel gun which stood on the seaward battlement the effect was magical there was a sudden pause in the fighting at the bridge then rose a mighty answering cry from our mcdonnells outside while the garrison caught thus between the two fires looked this way and that not knowing against which foe to turn though we were but thirteennay only twelve for the english sentinel in his fall had swept yet another of our brave fellows from the ledge it was hard for any one to say in the darkness how many we were or how many were yet behind and the thirty defenders to the place when once the panic had spread were in no mood for waiting to see many of them laid down their arms at once some still more terrified attempted to descend the rocks and so perished others plunged boldly into the gulf and there was an end of them ludar meanwhile rushed to the bridge many a brave fellow tonight had met his fate on that narrow way for so far no assault from our men without had been able to shake the strong portcullis or make an opening on the grim face of the fortress indeed it seemed to me a single child in the place might have defied an army so unassailable did it appear our men had carried easily the outer courtyard across the moat driving the slender garrison back with only time to lower the gate and shut themselves within before the assault began but though they thundered with shot and rock all was of no avail the guns of the besieged swept the narrow bridge on either side and scarce a man who ventured across it returned alive now all was suddenly changed ludar with a wild shout fell on the keepers of the gate within and drove them from their post so sudden was his onslaught that none had time to ask whence he came or how many followed him only a handful of soldiers withstood us among these was the gay english fellow whom we had let go an hour or so back and who now true to his word rushed sword in hand at ludar i wondered to see what ludar would do for kill the fellow i knew he would not he met the englishmans sword with a tremendous blow from his own sheathed weapon which shivered it then with his fist he felled him to the ground and thus stunned lifted him and laid him high on a parapet of the wall till he should come to ere this was done i and the rest of our men were at it hand to hand with the few fighting men of the garrison that remained it did not take long for there were but halfadozen of them and valiantly as they fought we were too many and strong for them one by one they fell or yielded all except one stout man the constable of the place peter gary by name who fought as long as he could stand and then before our eyes flung first his sword then himself headlong from the cliff that ended the matter next moment the english flagalas that i should say ittumbled from the battlements and with shouts of ludar froach eilan the portcullis swung open and dunluce belonged once more to the mcdonnells leaving us to guard the tower where most of the enemy had shut themselves ludar stalked off to a remote corner of the castle whence in a short time he returned and called me humphrey said he the maiden is safe thank god go to her and see what she and the old nurse may need i have other work to do friend added he is this all a dream is this indeed the castle of my fathers and when sorley boy comes shall it be i who will give it into his hands you and no other said i for the place is yours alas he said at what cost when i heard my brave men fall from the cliff like sheep humphrey i was minded not to stay there myself but adieu now to the maiden keep her safe for me he waved his hand and stalked to the gate where i watched him erect amid his cheering clansmen with a joyous smile on his face such as i had rarely seen there before and which i knew belonged in part to the noble chieftain his father and in part to his true love the maiden alas twas many a long day before i was to see him smile again like that as you shall hear for the present i went light at heart to the maiden whom i found pale indeed for she had been ill but serene and happy the old nurse who i thought ill liked my intrusion forbade me to weary her young mistress with talk or questions a plague on every man of you growled the old woman youre only matched by the women who be worse did i not tell you humphrey dexter my lady cantire would be no friend to my sweet mistress twas in vain the silly child tried to wheedle her over wheedle the tether stake my lady bade her be civil to the captain if she would please her stepdame and when the maiden put down her little foot at that she was clapped within walls like a rogue and fed on bread and water little harm that would have done had not the captain himself served her as jailer and every day thrust his evil presence into our company i tell thee humphrey that maiden hath fought as well as you or any of them and shame on your sex say i that this devil should be one of you ill no wonder if she was ill with not a soul to pity her save a poor old body like me wheres her father to leave her thus eh you mugfaced champion you indeed judy said i taken aback tis a terrible case but you cannot blame me not blame you when instead of playing soldier you might have ridden to toome and brought turlogh to help us take shame on yourself and when you see the maiden weak and white thank god her death be not on your head for dead she would have been like the brave maid she is before ever she would have looked at this fellowcountryman of yours he thought he had her safe forsooth when he whipped her off here and took the key with him fiend little wonder if she hates the name of you english i grew angry at this and told her she was a churlish old woman and had best leave me in peace till her temper was better so we parted ill friends i to guard the door she to carry her waspish tongue where she list chapter sixteen how sorley boy mcdonnell came home to his own i was not left for long to a solitary watch at the maidens tower for just as dawn began to break and my head after the labours of the night began to nod i was roused with a thwack betwixt my jaw and my ear which sent me backwards to the ground when i picked myself up i found it was the english fellow whom ludar had put snugly to roost on the parapet an hour or two since he had come to in no very merry frame of mind and finding the castle in the hands of the besiegers and his own life not worth an hours purchase was minded to hit out a bit for his queen before giving up the ghost more than that i suspect he was a little jealous to find me on guard at the maidens tower where till now he had stood sentinel anyhow he caught me a crack which i have scarce forgotten yet and which might have left me lying on my back to this day but for the blow which ludar had dealt him first he was unarmed so that i could not make an end of him as shortly as i was minded nor had i sword to offer him to cross with mine so i had him by the leg and the collar and walked him to the cliffs edge you will do less harm down there said i than here so say your prayers as you please comrade said he i should have sooner have had breakfast first as for the blow i gave you i thought you saw me come at you else i would have woke you up first and knocked you down next i set him down at that if that be so said i you are not the cur i took you for for i had no business to be nodding stay here and i will fetch you a sword and you shall die like an englishman i ask nothing better said he even if it be at the hands of an englishman turned traitor that took the spirit clean out of me was it not true was not this fellow a truer servant of her majesty than i who for months had done naught but break her laws assault her mayors fire on her flag and slay her soldiers yet how could i help it the fellows gibe made me so miserable that instead of fetching him a sword i gave him mine and bade him do to me as i deserved he laughed by my soul no said he if you be a servant of her majesty tis not for me to touch you if you be not the sword belongs to you and i call it no shame to die by it yet if you are minded to fetch me a weapon i warrant you i shall not run away till you come again so i went and fetched him a sword and we fought there a halfhour by the clock till our breath failed us and never a blow could we get home on one another i had no stomach for the business and yet when i found him so stubborn a swordsman my blood got up and i think i should have run him through if i could but he had no mind to let me and put me to it hard to keep my own skin whole so we halted to fetch breath and before we could go to it again the maiden came out of her lodging and stood betwixt us put by your swords said she i command you both what is your quarrel and have you no work for your captain that you thus bring civil war into his castle by your leave fair maiden said the englishman no man here is my captain this brave lad is an enemy to my queen therefore it is my duty to slay him if so said the maiden i too must be slain for i love not your queen but you be no traitor like this here i whipped out my sword and we were at it again ere the maiden with flashing eyes could step once more between us humphrey dexter cried she in a voice i hope i may not hear from her lips again give me your sword sir i obeyed meekly twould have been impossible to do aught else and you sir said she turning to the englishman give me yours marry tis yours already said he handing it up mine was shivered by a blow from the young mcdonnell and i am his prisoner but by your leave added he looking hard at me did you call this honest lad humphrey dexter why may i perish if it is not the same swashbuckling ruffler i once knew in london town i thought i had seen his gallows face before why humphrey my lad dost thou remember how i cracked thy skull at quarterstaff a year since in finsbury fields and how thy jack prentices groaned to see thee bite the dust i liked thee none the less for it though i beat thee for twas a fair fight come since tis thou give us thy hand and tell me how thou comest here amongst the enemies ay ay ill tell you said i not wanting to hear the end of the sentence sure enough this was a brawling soldier lad i had once met in the fieldsjack gedge by namewith whom i had had a bout at the quarter staff but he lied vilely when he said he beat me thereat for although he felled me once i had him down three times and the last time so that he had to be carried from the place by his legs and arms howbeit twas strange enough to see him here and when after the maiden had left us having restored us our swords under promise of peace i told him my story he took my hand and said had he been in my shoes he had been a traitor too yet he thanked his god he stood in his own and now it may have been ten oclock there came a great shouting and noise of guns from the outer walls and presently ludar came into the hold sword in hand and told us that captain merriman and his soldiers had arrived from castleroe and were preparing to assault the place humphrey said he whateer betide i commit the maiden to your care till this fighting be over this prisoner of mine added he pointing to the soldier will also stand by you unless i mistake him marry so will i said the man for a maiden in distress is no alien to a true servant of the maiden queen count on me for so much captain i do humphrey i must go out and meet my enemy he is in force and must be scattered before he can blockade our illprovisioned hold capture it he cannot but he may starve it go then said i yet will you not see the maiden first she would be sorry not to bid you godspeed he seemed for a moment as though he would refuse then a look of great longing came into his face as he glanced up at the turret window while he debated a messenger arrived with news that alexander mcdonnell and his men were at hand and that the englishseeing their constable hang from the walls on one side for we had found his body and displayed it thus as a signal of our triumph and hearing the shouts of the mcdonnells on the otherwere falling back and making ready to turn tail it was even so while he spoke we could see on the cliffs eastward the mcdonnell standard and hear the shouts of alexanders company as they bore down upon the english who for a moment ceased their assault on the castle and turned doubtfully to face them ludar laughed if alexander be there said he our minds may be easy call in our men and keep them within the walls for he who yielded me the glory of taking dunluce shall not be robbed by me of the glory of sending these knaves packing it needs not two mcdonnells to do that humphrey see to this keep a watch how the battle goes and come again presently you know where to find me and he went with a light heart into the maidens tower i know not why i grudged to see him go in twas not jealousyi was beyond that now nor was it that his help was needed without for alexander i guessed would have easy work with the foe and twas like ludars nobleness to leave this new glory to his brother twas not that he did not deserve the rest and comfort for he had worked like a lion that night and denied himself till now the greeting the maiden owed to her preserver yet for all that i know not why i had sooner he had remained sword in hand on the walls with us i scorned myself for my silly qualms and hastened to call in our men and bid them give fair field to alexander and his company they obeyed with difficulty yet when they heard that it was ludars order that no man should baulk his brother they came in and lined the walls to view the combat the mcdonnells on the cliff when they saw the constable hang over the castle walls and perceived the great bunch of heather on our topmost tower stopped a moment to cheer and wave their bonnets then alexander shouted to them in a voice we could hear halfamile away and they broke into a run meanwhile captain merrimans party was as i said taken aback by this new danger and threatened to draw off but when they saw our party retire into the castle and understood that the battle was between them and alexander only they stood their ground again and wheeled round to meet him they were some five hundred men against the mcdonnells three hundred and contained not a few of oneills men in their number from where we stood we could see but little of the fight except that within a few yards of the enemy alexander halted his men and then stepping forward sword in hand boldly dared the english leader whoever he might be to single combat i marvelled to see if captain merriman would accept the challenge for a while amid the shouting and threatening on either side i could not discern what followed but presently as alexander brandishing his sword stepped up and repeated his challenge there sprang out upon him without warning a huge gallowglass of the oneills men who with a club smote the young chief to the earth the blow was so sudden and unexpected for alexander was not even looking that way that the mcdonnell was reeling back in the arms of his men before friend or foe knew what had happened then with a terrible yell the scots seized their weapons and closed on the enemy but alexander staggering to his feet his head streaming blood called to them once more to halt as he leapt forward half stunned on his assailant the duel was short and swift for at the first onset the great gallowglass amazed to see his man yet living and ashamed perchance of his foul stroke missed his mark and tumbled in a heap upon his foemans sword then with a mighty shout for all thought this was the english leader slain the two bands closed in and a deadly fight began but i kept my eye on alexander whom despite his prowess i could see to be wounded hard gradually as his men fell on the enemy and the battle roared off eastward he himself drooped and drew out of the fray i could see him stand a moment waving his sword but his body swayed like that of a drunken man and he leaned at last against a rock to keep from falling then it was before i could determine whether to warn ludar of this accident or no that a horrible deed was done for i was not the only one who had kept his eyes on the wounded chief while he stood there fainting yet still shouting his men forward captain merriman an englishman who had lagged behind his host crept stealthily round the hill to where he stood and suddenly fronting him dared the dying man to single combat from where i stood i could mark the curl of scorn on the young chiefs lips as he drew himself up and strove to lift his drooping arm next moment the english captains weapon flashed between and as alexander fell the cowards blade plunged through him twice instantly a mighty cry went up from the enemy for captain merriman waving his bloody sword above his head ran through the ranks yelling victory mcdonnell is slain and the mcdonnells when they heard the shout reeled under it in a panic and were slain by the score as for me i had stood there like a lump of stone not able to stir or shout but at last by a huge effort i sprang to the ground and with a cry of horror rushed to find ludar i found him standing on the cliffedge grave and happy with the maiden beside him looking down at the great atlantic waves as they flung their eternal surge up at the castle rock his sword lay on the ground at her feet she was fixing a tuft of flowers in his cap singing softly as she did so and he as he gazed now at her now at the sea below looked as if cloud could never come more between the sun and his noble face alack that i myself must bring the cloud ludar to the front something is wrong your brother may i never hear again the cry with which he snatched up his sword and rushed to the gate i followed close to his heels only bidding the maiden get to her tower whither i would send her english squire to guard her but ludar as we reached the gate turned and ordered me back stay said he hoarsely and white as a sheet stay here then as he waited for the portcullis to open i hastily told him what i had witnessed and where he would find his brother my brother he groaned my brother humphrey if i ever return here it shall be with this dogs blood on my sword farewell and in a moment he had passed the bridge and was rushing headlong on the foe my heart sank as i saw him go thus and whether it vexed him or not i shouted aloud who follows ludar follow follow instantly a hundred mcdonnells started at the call and leapt over the bridge then with my own hand i let down the gate and bade the rest in their chiefs name stand and guard the walls alexanders party were already in retreat halfamile away for they had no leader and the english flushed with victory and strong in numbers were pushing them back at the swords point nor did this new company help them much for ludar when he saw who followed him angrily ordered them to stand while he went alone to the place i had told him of in search of his brother but brother there was none i could see my friend from where i stood stalk round the place now deserted of friend and foe shouting and calling like a man possessed perhaps the murderer had taken off the body as a trophy or perhapsperhaps alexander yet lived and was safe but sign of him there was none for a weary hour ludar called and searched then weary and sick at heart i saw him call his men and march off in pursuit of the enemy thus all that day we stood and waited in dunluce and not a man spoke to his fellow for the joy of our victory was turned into mourning the clan had lost one hero and who should say whether the banshees warning was not to be fulfilled on another the only man who kept up heart was the englishman these mcdonnells said he have the lives of cats you shall see your lordling back yet he oweth me a bout and is too honest a man to rob even an enemy but humphrey lad added he i pray you see to these women there is sore distress in their camp and i durst not put in my head besides i know not if they have so much as a crust of bread to eat the honest fellow was right when i went in the maiden was in strange woe pacing up and down her chamber with pale face and heaving breast humphrey said she and her voice was dry and hoarse this is my fault my fault he will love me no more i tempted him to stay when he should have been at his brothers side i for my own comfort made a woman of him who should have helped make him a hero nay said i you are wrong maiden had he been there he could not have helped this it was in nature he should humphrey she exclaimed in a voice which staggered me talk not like a fool i have forfeited his love he did well to leave me without a word i have been worse to him than his worst enemy i dare not see him again for he will loathe me you must take me hence or truly i will go without leave maiden said i have patience this is the act of god not of man and ludar when he returns may need your comfort sorely she laughed bitterly i know ludar she said you know him not think you the sight of me will not drive him mad when he comes back brotherless at least said i be content to wait here till tomorrow i should be a traitor to him and myself were i to let you depart unattended and i may not leave here till he or the old chief comes will sorley boy be here tomorrow asked she he will he has said so then said she i stay on this condition tell him naught of me but that i am an oneill a prisoner here who demand to be restored to my father turlogh luinech oneill ludar will not return yet when he does he shall find me gone go back to the wall humphrey no man shall say again i stood between him and his duty i returned sadly enough to my post and all that night we kept weary watch on the walls straining our ears for ludars call or news of the battle but neither ludar nor news of him came at daybreak however as the sun rose over the headlands there came a noise of pipes and shouting and a flutter of pennons on the hilltops then we knew sorley boy had come before him fled scattered parties of the enemy yet far enough beyond our range nor when they sped away into the hills westward did the chief allow his men to continue the chase the mcdonnells gave a wild mighty cheer when they saw the heather of the clan flying aloft on their ancient castle and in the silence that followed i could see the old chief stand a moment to pass his hand across his eyes as if to make sure he saw aright then erect with a proud step he advanced at the head of his men and crossed the bridge our men waving their hats aloft answered back the cheers and as the gate swung up to let them in all else seemed forgotten in the triumph of this homecoming of the grand old chief but when a moment after he halted and looked round him the shouting suddenly ceased and there fell a dead silence my sons said he where are they no one seemed ready to answer so that i was fain to step forward sir said i saluting sir ludar your son renders you your castle which he won by his own arm two nights ago he is not here to salute himself as he is tending his brother who was traitorously wounded in the battle yesterday the old man said nothing but blazed on me with his eyes as though he would blast me where i stood had i been the murderer myself i could not have trembled more at length alexander where is he he demanded in a hollow voice i said i had seen him last near the hill but that ludar not finding him there had gone to seek him i know not whither then the old man handed his great sword to his esquire and flinging off his cloak walked into the hall of the castle where none durst follow him i longed to ask his permission to follow ludar besides making the maidens petition but his look that day was too terrible to be faced so we stood to our guard as we had stood all day long when at evening no sign came yet of ludar i braced myself up with a great courage and entered the hall the old warrior was sitting at the head of the empty table immovable like a man stunned looking straight before him but when he saw me he seemed to recover himself and said what news none said i but as his servant i pray you let me go and seek sir ludar you shall not go said he and there was naught left to say after that i obey you sire said i there is by your leave a maiden in this castle a prisoner and daughter to the oneill she craves your permission to return to her father and hath bidden me ask it of you he nodded his head as if the petition were too trifling to be heeded and having got what i was in need of i withdrew thankful next day at daybreak the maiden white as a sheet and with lips closepressed to hinder their trembling walked slowly across the bridge to the castle gate i had got her two horses one for her and one for the old nurse and a trusty escort of six mcdonnells and the english soldier to conduct her to toome at parting she held out her hand humphrey said she tell him of this and may she who loves you never lose you as i have lost him all is not lost said i we shall meet again and all will be happy yet and i lifted her to her horse now sirrah said the old nurse as i did the like service for her be happy for a year and a day you have broken a sweet heart among you and what matters it to you so you be rid of us mark my word some heads shall ache for this what is to become of us do you suppose in this oneills house little trouble to you to send us from one cruel fate to a worse be proud that you a soldier forsooth and calling yourself an honest man thus betray my poor maiden to her step dame and your english captain he is dead by now said i not he said she what is to become of us dost thou hear who is to help us now dame said i is there no god in heaven that you chide thus farewell we shall meet again i think in a happier season then i stepped once more to the maiden and said lady that maidens name we spoke of is young mistress walgrave the printers daughter in london should chance bring you thither she will be your friend for my sake if it be possible pray send us word presently of your welfare by this english fellow thus that maiden left dunluce and still the days passed and no tidings of ludar but one evening as i watched at the gate a haggard figure crossed the bridge scarce dragging one foot after another for weariness ludar said i as i admitted him what news no news said he between his teeth and he flung his sword with what little strength was left him to the earth then he himself fell beside it and when we carried him within he was in a fever and raving chapter seventeen how a dogs head was set on dublin gate three months after as the february snow lay deep on roof and road ludar and i walked in a strange procession through the streets of dublin in front went three trumpeters on horseback with the pennon of england drooping from their trumpets behind them rode a picked troop of english horse gaily caparisoned and very brave with ribbons and trappings then alone went sir john perrott the lord deputy a smirking man who seemed to doubt the whole business he was mounted too and at his tail rode three officers of his house and after them more trumpeters and troopers then came the strange part of the procession for at the heels of these english cavaliers stalked fifty huge redshanks with the mcdonnells heather in their bonnets and their hands on their swordhilts yet still stranger was what came next for unarmed with long slow strides walked a noble figure of commanding stature whose eyes flashed now and again on the shouting rabble and whose white hair escaped from his cap waved tempestuously in the winter wind there walked sorley boy upright sullen disdainful and behind him came ludar with tight pressed lips and thunderous brow his fingers twitching nervously on his belt and his feet at every step kicking the snow impatiently from his path i followed my master as in duty bound and behind us stalked fifty more silent scots such was the procession which conducted sorley boy mcdonnell at the end of his stormy career to do homage to the english queen how it all came to pass i know not but once possessed of dunluce with his favourite son gone from his side the old man broke down and sighed for peace twas said the english paid a good price for his alliance in territory for himself and lands and title for his elder sons be that as it may he sheathed his sword and called in his fighting men all round he heeded not ludars demand for vengeance on his brothers murderers and indeed forbade any man to mention sir alexanders name in his hearing yet day by day the empty chair stood beside his in the castle hall and day by day at the muster call the young chiefs riderless horse fell into its place betwixt that of the father and the second son sir randal as for ludar when after many weeks the fever left him and he rose from his bed his father and he met rarely and spoke less for the old man sad to tell from the day that he came into his own had changed towards his youngest son and blaming him for the ill that had befallen the house ceased not to reproach and scorn him for his brothers fate never did i see ludar so noble a man as during those gloomy months never once did he waver in his loyalty to his father never once did he suffer a word to be said to rebuke the old mans harshness never once did he complain if more than a common soldiers hardships with a common soldiers fare fell to his lot never once would he allow the men who were ready to die for him raise a shout when he came among them or even salute him in his fathers presence he took his punishment as beseemed a hero and it was the hard work and stern discipline of those few months i think which braced him up once again into his former manhood and brought back the glow into his cheeks and the fire into his eyes concerning the maiden he spake not a word nor would he suffer me to speak of her only when the english fellow returned who had escorted her to her father did ludar order him back charging him to look to her safety as he valued his own life which charge the faithful fellow cheerfully accepted and departed of all his trials this journey of submission to dublin was the bitterest to ludar and i as i walked at his heels that day in dublin city could see that every step was a pang the old man chose to bring ludar and not his elder brothers for this very reason and never a duty taxed the lads courage and loyalty more so to me the pleasure of marching once again under the royal flag of my queen was tempered by the concern i felt for my master a vast rabble lined the roads to see the doughty sorley boythe hero of the north against whose arms england had fought in vainmarch thus to the tune of english trumpets to her majestys castle but if any looked to see a hanging head or a meek demeanour they were sore mistaken for as the procession moved on and the shouts grew louder the spirit seemed to come back into the old warrior and he walked rather as one who marches to war than to peace perhaps had the way been a mile longer or had the smirking lord deputy looked round oftener this notable treaty would never have come about for by the time sorley boy reached the castle gate he was glaring round him defiantly and the hilt of his sword was an inch out of the scabbard at the gate the deputy stood and bade him enter the old fox gave a suspicious look round like one that suspects a trap and then beckoned to ludar stay here with the men let your squire follow me so ludar stayed with the mcdonnells at the gate while i followed sorley boy amid shouts and flourish of trumpets into the castle all was prepared to do the old chief honour attendants bowed guards saluted and my lord deputys womenkind waved handkerchiefs from the windows sir john perrott himself all smiles chatted affably but never a word spake sorley boy he stalked on at a pace which made the deputy trot at his side and heedless of lackeys guards ladies and all else flung into the great hall i followed as in duty bound and beside me no man but sir john and sir johns secretary then followed a strange scene sir sorley boy began the deputy motioning his guest to a high chair on the dais this is a happy occasion and i would her majesty had a deputy more enough of this said the chieftain impatiently i came not from dunluce to make speeches or bandy words with you i owe you naught or if i do tis a debt you had rather i paid not i said sir john pulling himself up as representing her gracious majesty here sorley boy stalked off to where a miniature picture of her majesty hung on the wall is this elizabeth demanded he that is a presentment far short in splendour of her majestys admirable presence said the deputy sorley boy took the picture in his hand and mused on it in silence at length pray heaven she be no worse favoured in the flesh yet being a woman i do her homage and like an old gallant he doffed his hat and raised the picture to his lips thus it was the mcdonnell made his peace with the sassenach he handed the picture to me gloomily to replace which i did after humbly doing it obeisance on bended knee then he summoned me to follow him from the hall sir john witnessed this strange scene in bewilderment and displeasure he had reckoned on the satisfaction of hearing his old foe renounce his enmity and sue for terms and it vexed him to find the ceremony thus taken out of his hands and curtly disposed of by the proud old scot yet he knew enough of sorley boy to take what he could get and must needs pocket his pride only he made one effort to save his own dignity sir sorley in her majestys name i accept your dutiful homage it remains for you to sign this written document of fealty in return for which i am bidden hand you her majestys gracious permission to you and your heirs to enjoy your territories without let or hindrance the old man laughed scornfully my lands are my own let who dares come and take them keep your papers john perrott come squire out into the fresh air and he stalked out followed angrily by the deputy at the castle gate we found a tumult afoot for the hotheaded scots who waited there face to face with their old enemies had not been able to restrain their impatience and goaded alike by the jeers of the rabble and the taunts of the englishmen had answered threat by threat and gibe by blow ludar himself already exasperated had said not a word to hold them back and as the old chief and i came out the gate the street was full of war and dead men lay strewn on either hand a shout from sorley boy restored order among the redshanks in a moment and without waiting for further parley with the deputy he stalked to the head of his men and with the single order to dunluce turned his back on her majestys castle at dublin but sir john fearful perhaps of an outbreak in the city or in pursuit of a still deeper design mounted his horse and bade his men form again the procession to conduct the queens new ally to the city gate he himself rode forward at a hands pace beside the old chief who heeded him no more than if he had been me or ludar we had come to the gate at the bridge and the english troops were halting to let us go out the strange ceremony of the day was near ending and the free country beyond shone in the winter sun when the deputy suddenly bending level with the old mans ear said look up behold your sons head sorley boy stood as did we and looked up there on a pole rocking in the breeze above the city gate looked down upon us a head livid and scarred with eyes set and tawny locks streaming in the wind twas a terrible ghastly sight for battered as it was even i could recognise the once noble features of alexander mcdonnell as i had seen him last reeling under the cowardly blow of that foul englishman the old chief uttered a cry scarcely less terrible to hear than the head was to see then suddenly commanding himself he blazed round on the deputy and hissed through his teeth my son hath many heads i never saw a man change colour as did sir john perrott when he met that look and heard those bitter words men say he went home that afternoon with that look burned into his breast and those words dinging in his ears nor go where he would could he escape the one or the other they possessed him waking and sleeping in council and in war at home and abroad and when at last he died some say he was found crouched in a corner of his room with his fingers over his eyes and his thumbs on his ears nor after what i saw did i find it in my heart to pity him as for sorley boy he walked out of dublin like a man in a dream none of us durst speak to him or say so much as a word in his hearing nor had we the heart to do it ludar with his clenched teeth looked straight before him and the scots who followed only half comprehending what had happened dropped into sullen silence and gave no sound but the dull beat of their steps on the road about an hour beyond dublin sorley boy halted and turned to ludar ludar mcdonnell said he sternly we part here i have no sonno son farewell and he and the soldiers marched on without another word leaving ludar and me looking after them and marvelling if all this were what it seemed or some horrid vision ludar recovered himself sooner than i come said he why stand you here humphrey when all the world except dunluce is before us let us back to the city i knew why he wished to go back he was thinking not of sorley boy or dunluce but of that cruel trophy above the city gate and in my heart i pitied the keepers should they chance to withstand him in his purpose twas dark when we crossed the bridge and found ourselves once more within the walls the streets were empty for the night was bleak and the troops had long since been called into their quarters only a few sentinels stood about the gate who to keep away the cold and cheer their stomachs huddled together in a sheltered nook and discussed the news of the day over ale and sack little heeded they the creaking pole with its horrible burden as it rocked and swung in the winter wind above them while we waited the snow began to fall and drove the tipplers further into the shelter of the guardroom where was a merry fire now was our chance ludar led me round to where over some tumbled stones we were able to scramble on to the wall and thence back towards the gate so thick fell the snow that as we crawled along we were as white as the ramparts we passed over and not a soul could have heard or seen us had any been there it was easy to get from the wall on to the gate and all might have gone well had not a wolfhound imprisoned in the tower or left there to do the watching which the sentinel neglected sprung out to meet us as we stepped on to the battlement with a mighty howl so sudden was his leap that he had ludar by the throat before we knew what had happened and ere i had drawn my sword and saved my master from so savage a death there was a noise with shouting and lights in the road below quick cried ludar springing to his feet and running to the pole in a minute he had scaled it and robbed it of its fearful burden already i could tell by the shouts below that we were pursued but ludar as he stood there panting with his precious burden held to his breast heeded nothing come said i we are followed he laughed bitterly humphrey said he as you love me cut me this hounds head off and put it there where my brothers head stood quick i did as he bade me though it cost us precious moments nor would he budge till the grim exchange was made then suddenly he descended on the far side of the gateway it was well he did so for there being no regular way on to the wall that side our pursuers had mounted by the other leaving only a couple of stupid sentinels to watch below happily for us the snow lay thick and soft for more than once we fell as we scaled the ramparts and might have broken our limbs our pursuers behind having come to the gate top and finding no one there liked not to follow us the way we had gone and contented themselves with discharging their pieces into the darkness our way but we were out of their reach for once on the wall twas easy going and instead of descending we made a quarter of the way round the city till somewhere near the northeastern tower we slid down by a drift of snow into the deserted street then ludar leading we returned some distance along by the foot of the very wall on whose top we had lately crept to where stood a church with a graveyard verging on the wall here my comrade halted and reverently set down his burden and between us as we knelt in the snow we digged a grave to shelter it our swords served us for spades nor alack did it need many inches of kind mother earth to hold all that remained of alexander mcdonnell with a prayer each ludar in his way i in mine we buried that dear relic then beside the place ludar drove his sword deep into the earth till the hilt stood up like an iron cross to mark the spot we stood in silence while the pure snow fell and laid its white shroud upon the grave then when all was done he took my arm and we walked sadly away as we passed down a street not far off the glow of a tavern fire and the sound of voices within brought us to a halt for we were cold and famished and weary and the good cheer of the place tempted us within was mine host a merry irishman who loved every man that drank his ale round his great fire sat halfadozen guests two wayfarers like ourselves a soldier a merchant a sailor and one who seemed by his look a private gentleman they gave us little enough heed as we entered even when mine host catching sight of us came to take our orders they went on with their carouse and pulled their benches closer round the fire with scarcely a blink our way as we sat apart thawing our frozen limbs in the warmth of the room and reviving our inner man with food and drinkwe had staked nearly all we had on this mealwe could not forbear hearing some of the talk that went on at the fireside by my valour said the soldier i was there and saw it with my own eyes the old dotard turned the colour of my teeth when he looked up and spied it ay ay said the merchant i know it was he i saw the lad in cantire once and a fine lad he was they tell me said mine host a woman was at the bottom of it as usual this captain merriman who oweth me a pretty score for entertainment in this house and this lad had a quarrel over a wench and twas for that he pursued him as he did why sirs for six weeks the lad lay hidden in a cave and for a week more lay quick in a grave before sir captain who had never ceased to hunt him caught him and sent up his head to the deputy here and now they say the wench who is particular not fancying a headless trunk hath struck her colours and said yea to the next best man poor lass whos to blame her not i said the soldier albeit you are all wrong mine host about this quarrel for i heard of it from tom price the captains man it was this headless chiefs brother the lass doated on but its like enough she thinks the head was her sweethearts there was a son of old sorleys in the pageant today a plaguey ill favoured hound who walked with his father said the landlord with a face sour enough to curdle all the milk in dublin that was sir ludar said one of the strangers i had it from one of the redshanks ludar said the soldier the very man tis his wench the captain hath run away with she thinketh him gibbeted and here the door was flung open suddenly and in rushed another soldier have you heard the news he cried news cried the others turning round to look at him why yes her majesty hath been robbed of a jewel the traitors head that grinned on the gate hath been stolen i tell you and there sticketh a dogs head in its place tis true who has done it thats the point said the messenger who was plainly proud to have so much news to tell thats the point for we were all on guard i tell you not a soul passed us tis said twas some spirit here he doffed his cap we stood below i tell you when there came a blast of wind in our faces with a smell of brimstone in it i smelt it then something curled up past us like a white shroud and shrieked as it went up and before we could look in one anothers faces a great howl of devilish laughter broke over our heads and drops of blood yes i felt them heres one on my sleeveit burns like fire i tell you that was all we fetched lights and went aloft who is to be afraid of a spirit or two but we saw naught not a footstep in the snow or a sign of man or fiend eitherexcept only a headless dog ay you may stare but i saw itit smoked brimstone neighbours and the snow all around it was redhot and what was most horrible of all when we cast up our lights i tell you the scots head had changed to the head of a dog which grinned and leered at us with eyes like coals and tongue all ablaze till we could scarce stay where we were thats all and ere i go back to that gate neighbours may i turn pope and spaniard give me a drink host for by my soul i know not which end of me is uppermost by this time the company had left their benches and were scattered about the room gossiping over this last great news and questioning the fellow more some came to the table where ludar and i sat and the soldier looking hard at me exclaimed where saw i that gallows face before who be you sirrah a printer said i you lie said he for i saw you today accompany the old scotsman to the castle and by my body that slouching dog there should be hillo comrades cried he amazed at his discovery more ghosts may i perish if there have not been sitting in this very room while we talked of him this same sourfaced lovesick clown master ludar and one of his merry men marry come up the very man skulking here while his lightoflove is on her honeymoon and the old dotard his father with his pockets full of english gold he said no more ludar had no sword but the blow he gave him silenced his foul tongue for a week instantly the room was turned into a shambles twas no time to mince words or blows and we did neither nor were we two left alone to withstand all the rest for the gentleman of the party whom i have mentioned sided with us as did also the sea captain who owed mine host a long score and saw a good way to cry quits without shortening his purse among us we made so good an account of ourselves that when at length we took our leave not a man bade us stay come said the captain my ship lies at the bridge tomorrow we shall see england chapter eighteen how i found myself again in london three days later as our ship laboured up the gulf of the solway ludar came to me as i stood on the poop and said humphrey i have news good or bad i asked neither said he for it means we must part i call that bad news how is it ludar our fellowvoyager said he and i could see he spoke nervously like one who doubts his listener is in the service of my queen mary of scotland there fly not out humphrey i never said she was your queen heaven forbid said i and as for this stranger i mistrusted him all along how calls he himself he is one captain fortescue and hath a commission to engage loyal men to the queens service and indeed she needs it for she lies in prison watched and solitary with scarce a face about her that is not an enemys what would you do humphrey were your queen in such a plight were my queen a traitor i began and stopped i cannot help myself said he i owe her my life only one woman else could claim it and her i have lost but said i are you sure of this man may this not be some trap to your ruin what if he be a spy and no more ludar laughed if so said he he would have better sport on foot than to practise on an outlaw like me no humphrey he is a loyal man as pray heaven so am i and he commands me in a name i cannot resist then said i sadly we part i would have served you ludar on any other service but i too have a queen who owns me so be it said he i expected it and naught else could part me from you be sure we shall meet again humphrey when all is over who knows but it may be on the field of battle said i sadly yet tell me where i shall hear of you and take note where you shall hear of me for i will back to london to your love said he with a sigh so be it you shall hear of me there humphrey and before we part said i taking his great hand swear me an oath ludar that you will not forget me he flung my hand away impatiently do you take me for a knave brother i swear to you that next to my queen my father and the memory of her who once loved me you have the chiefest right to say ludar help me and if i forget you twill be that i have forgotten i am a man that comforted me vastly and i too made my vow next to my queen said i and no one besides you are still my master and my life goes for nothing so it shall serve you and her you love who i am sure is true to you still and waits for you somewhere whatever men say he gripped my hand hard at that and sorrowful as it was we loved one another the more at that parting than ever before next day we landed captain fortescue suspecting me to be no friend to him or his cause was in haste to reach carlisle and shortened our leavetaking in consequence we had but time to renew our vows when the boat which was to carry my friend and his new master from me came alongside and severed us i watched him till the envious hills came in between and as i saw him last standing and waving his hat methought a great piece had gone out of my life and that there was left of me but half the man i once was and now must my story hasten on by strides such as never the laggard months took after i had said farewell to ludar for tis of him not of humphrey dexter that i am the chronicler and till my history meet him once more my reader is without his hero yet there are one or two scenes awanting to fill up the gap which even though they concern chiefly me i must relate in their proper place two months had gone by and in the budding woods the spring birds were wakening the earth out of her winter sleep when i stood once more footsore and friendless in the streets of london how i had got so far it matters not nor how like a vagabond i begged and worked my way staying now here for a few days ploughing now there to break in a colt held in bondage in one town because i lacked the money to pay my score and chivied from the next for a rogue which i was not not a few men i fought by the wayfor i clung to my sword through alland not a few constables i laid by the heels heaven forgive me in mine own defence be all that as it may i stood again in london town whence it seemed i had been absent not nine months but nine years with tattered hose and doublet with coat that scarce held together at my back with no cap to my head and scarce one shoe to divide betwixt my two feet twas little wonder if no man but the watch heeded me still less suspected me to be the once famous captain of the clubs without temple bar my way into the city led by finsbury fields where were many prentices at their sports and citizens taking their sweethearts to sniff the sweet spring air no one wanted me there the lads bade me make way for my betters and the maids held back their skirts as they swept by so i left them and wandered citywards i marvelled to see all so little changed forgetting how short a time i had been away there stood stationers hall as lordly as ever and timothy ryder the beadle taking his fees at the compter there too was the great cathedral with its crowd of loungers and fleet street full of swaggering prentices and the river sparkling in the sun then as i came near temple bar my heart fell a thumping not that i forgot the place was deserted and the old home broken but because it reminded me of what once was before all these troubles began i crawled at a snails pace wishing to put off the pang as long as possible in fancy i was at my case as i had been a year ago clicking the letters into my stick in time to the chirping of my little mistress who sang at her work within at my side i could hear the dull groaning of the heavy press and not far off the whining of peter stoupes everlasting psalm tune all was as if was i dreaming or was this the selfsame psalmtune come again to life and to accompany it the dull grinding of the selfsame press strange that the bar was off the door and as i came to it a fellow with a ream on his back laboured out i had expected naught but the desolation and silence which i last remembered in the place and it staggered me to find all going on as before no doubt here was some upstart printer standing in my late masters shoes and working at his forfeited press in no pleasant mood i walked ragged and travelstained as i was into the shop sure enough it was peter stoupe my late fellowapprentice who was whining and beside him a new journeyman lugged at the press peter knew me not at first so changed and unkempt was i with my long journeyings come said he surlily bustle hence thou varlet we keep nought here but sticks for rogues like thee to taste get you gone and he advanced on me with the stick just to remind him of old days i whipped it from his hand and gave him a crack on the skull which brought him to himself at once why said he dropping his jaw and gaping at me as if i had been a ghost if it be not humphrey dexter as im a sinner as certain as thou art a sinner said i it is none other what of that peter stoupe why said he i warn thee to pack hence for master walgrave hath had enough of thee i warrant and there is none else here wanteth thee then master walgrave is out of gaol i asked no thanks to thee he hath made his peace with the company and is restored to his own and my mistress and jeannette and the lad i asked they are naught to thee answered he curtly are they here i asked again i tell thee that is naught to thee humphrey dexter i marvel after what is past you dare name them by heavens you shall have something to marvel at said i laying hold of him by the collar and shaking him till his bones rattled answer me are they here to be sure to be sure gasped he i pray you unhand me humphrey my old friend you are too rough i flung him off to the mirth of the new journeyman who it was plain loved him no more than i and walked through the shop to the parlour behind there in a nook beside the window which was open to let in the sweet scent of the spring and the merry chirping of the birds sat my sweet young mistress jeannette reading out of a book to the little sister who sat on her knee and ever and anon looking out at the swift shining river as it washed past the garden wall i remember the very words she was reading as i entered unheeded so it fell that knight returned and none knew him no not even the dog in the outer court but when he spake there was a certain little maid knew his voice whom as a child he was wont to make sport with but now because she was grown from child to woman and her mirth was turned to love did she say never a word when he appeared but ran away and hid herself and do tall knights and ladies play at hideandgoseek like boys and girls asked the little sister jeannette laughed at the question and as she did so she looked up and saw me standing there she at least knew me for a moment the colour left her cheeks in fear and doubt next it rushed back in a crimson flood then she uttered my name and hid her face in the bosom of the little child i was but a plain prentice with no more than my share of brains yet i had need to be slowwitted indeed not to read a long wonderful story in what i saw then ay said i stepping forward and answering the littles ones question and sometimes they find one another too and as in the old days i kissed them both and was very happy when presently master walgrave returned and saw me there he seemed not too well pleased yet i suspected he was not altogether discontented to see me back for he counted me a proper workman and handy at my craft and when i setto and told them a plain tale of what had befallen me and how ill i had been slandered by my fellow prentice and how ready i was to serve them now he grew less sullen and bade me abide where i was till he considered the matter from my mistress in turn i learned something of their doings since i saw them last in the street of kingston the minister she said had pinched himself to shelter them for many a week while they worked for him among the harvesters and in the dairy in return but at last when autumn came and they could do no more to serve him they departed and petitioned the company to admit them back to the printing house which after much ado was granted and so they continued with much labour to subsist but peter i was told afterwards made himself master of everything and in return for his services exacted all the profit little as it was they made by the printing at last after lying six months in gaol master walgrave grew weary and permitted his wife to sue for him to the bishop which she did and so prettily that his grace allowed the prisoner to go free on his submission since then all had fared well peter stoupe who could hardly be parted with was put back to his place and a new journeyman obtained business came back winter went springtime returned and roses blossomed once more in sweet jeannettes cheeks and all went merrily as for mistress jeannettes cheeks it seemed to me as i sat and watched her that evening that the roses had not done blossoming yet but i said little to her for i guessed she would not talk only when bedtime came and i went as of old to carry her up the steep stairs she looked up brightly and said i can walk now humphrey voila that was one good thing your going did for me i would it had been any other good said i for it was pleasant to help you but see you still want some help well sometimes i walk better but tonightno i am not a baby truly said she laughing as i offered to take her up give me your arm humphrey that is enough so i helped her up the stairs and at the top she thanked me and said she was glad i was come back for her fathers sakemeaning master walgrave her stepfather i asked was she glad for no reason else and she said perhaps for my sake twas good to be at work once more anyones sake besides peutetre said she in her french jargon vanishing into her chamber i was a better scholar than i once was and could translate the words in a way that made my heart beat so i left her and came down to supper there i found peter stoupe very black in the face awaiting me he tried to look civil as i came to the table but twas plain he had little stomach for his meal my master telleth me said he he is content to give thee another trial humphrey pray heaven he may never hear how much it is he forgiveth thee as for me this folly of his is like to cost him my service as i told him when are you going i asked that concerns myself said peter but since we be alone humphrey dexter let me say to you one thing whether i go or stay know that i desire you hold no converse with my mistress daughter and that for a very sufficient reason she is promised to me i laughed at this since when i asked that too concerneth me said peter who liked not my mirth i shall wed her anon and till then i would have her kept clear of your company pass the mug peter stoupe and cease your funning the day sweet jeannette weds with you i will saddle the horse shall carry you to church till then if i catch so much as her name on your foul lips i will drop you feet uppermost in the mud of fleet ditch so make a bargain of it he turned green at that for he guessed i meant what i said what began he you who ruined my master and robbed here i sprang to my feet and he stopped short robbed whom demanded i enough said he motioning me to sit down i resolved when you came to hold no parley with you and i repent me i have done so henceforth humphrey dexter we are strangers be what you will said i only keep a civil tongue in your head and i went up to bed now this was yet another trial to peter who had been used to lie alone while i was absent and now loathed that i should rob him thus of half his kicking room but he durst say naught only he lay at the far edge and instead of saying his prayers cursed me between his teeth it was in my heart to pity peter stoupe that night for it was plain i had come in an evil hour for him master walgrave had been hoodwinked by his smooth manners and lying tongue and was fain to believe he owed him more for the duty he had done while his master was in gaol than in truth he did nor durst my mistress thwart him over much for the same cause as for jeannetteif she humoured him and endured his civilities twas because she was ever kind so all was going well with peter when i chanced home who knew him for his worth and promised to spoil his sport little wonder then if he hated to see me and kept at the far edge of the bed however i had more to think of than him and finding him deaf even when i tried to be civil i busied myself with other thoughts and fell asleep to dream a jumbled dream of ludar and jeannette and the captain of the misericorde i remember i dreamed that ludar and jeannette were keeping the watch on deck while i slept below and that my hour being come the captain had come down to fetch me and was standing over me when i awoke suddenly and in the dim moonlight saw a real figure at the bedside it was peter stoupe and though i could scarce see his face i knew he was glowering on me white in his hand he slowly lifted a knife above my heart i was motionless not with terrorfor his hand trembled so it could scarce have dealt a deadly blowbut with horror to find such a man at such a deed so though my eyes were open he saw not that i was awake and with a gasp brought down his hand mine was out in time to catch him by the wrist peter stoupe i cried are you gone mad twas pitiful to see him then drop on his knees his face as white as the sheets and with quaking lips beg for mercy oh humphrey he gasped forgivei knew not what i was yes i was madforgive this once forgive said i you ask the wrong person you are on your knees ask him who is above to forgive you tis him you have wronged more than me and when you have done come back to bed for i am weary i know not if he prayed or what he did but presently when he came back to bed he lay very still and cold and when we rose in the morning never a word spake either of us of what had passed that night but as i expected we were none the better friends for all that for though he durst never lift his voice in my hearing again he scowled at me under his brows and as i suppose wished he had done what he tried to do that night i found it best to let him be even when he made up to jeannette which happened but seldom and then little to his comfort but when after a month or more his articles being ended he took his hat and left the shop for good i was not surprised nor were my master or mistress overmuch cast down as for me i had a shrewd guess peter stoupe had not yet done with me all went happily then in the house without temple bar only my little mistress held me off more than she had been wont and was graver with me yet it was happiness to see she counted somewhat on my company and scorned not to ask my arm whenever she needed its help often and often she made me tell her of my journeyings and of ludar and the maiden and her bright eyes would glisten as she heard how they were parted and what they had suffered for one another and she longed to see both and was ever wondering where they were and how they fared but the spring wore into summer and the summer grew towards autumn before a word of news came then one sunday will peake my old adversary walked into the shop with a monstrous letter in his hand tied round with blue silk and sealed black at either end i had seen will often since i came back to london but had always forgotten to tell him that when i was put to it to advise ludar where he might hear of me i had told him to send to my brother prentice on london bridge who if any might be counted on to know where i was to be found so now when a letter was come will was vastly wroth that he should be mixed up in the matter and needed much satisfying that twas a sign of friendship and nothing else that made me give his name he beingas i told himthe only trusty man of my acquaintance in london i like it not humphrey dexter said he tossing down the letter the air is full of treason only today there is talk in the city of some new conspiracy in the north and tis not safe to get a missive from so much as your ladylove there take it i am rid of it and hark you let no man know i had it in my fingers farewell the letter was in a great and notable hand which i was sure did not belong to ludar yet it was addressed to the worthy prentice humphrey dexter by the hand of one will peake a mercers man on london bridge give these with beating heart i took the letter to where jeannette sat in the garden and bade her break the seal chapter nineteen how i was concerned in treason and love the first words of the letter left me in no doubt as to who the writer might be to a certain hollander once my servant and honoured still to live in my memory know my son of neptune fledgeling of the nymphs and half brother to the tritons that he whom thou knewest once in parnassus grove whither he himself led thy halting feet respireth still in sighs for beauty and exhalations of sweet verse know too that he hath of late composed a notable and admirable epic in praise of the sun which if it please heaven to bring him ere the year fall to london thou mayest have the high honour of setting in print thereby assisting at the birth of an immortal know further that after many bufferings from the jade fortune and tossing such as ships neer endured on thy brawling element my hollander i am here in chester beloved of the muse yet illbeholden to the men of the place who as the mantuans their maro clapped me in ward because forsooth i stirred the rabble with my moving measures the moon hath not kissed the golden locks of galatea four times since i was let out now is no zephyr freer than ior emptier yet hath heaven need of her needy sons and the meanest of olympus denizens hath his part to play amidst the earthlings know then that on the second day after i had ceased to eat my bread at her majestys cost i met in eager haste a certain irish achilles who knoweth more of war than verse and whose arm is more terrible with the sword than is my hand with the pen this sir ludarsuch is gratitude and reverenceo tempora o moreswould have given me the goby had i not stood boldly in his way that he might at least see how great an honour he avoided when he saw me to be brief my hollander he honoured himself by seeing in me the god mercury who beareth messages to the dim regions of the earth he bade me tell thee by a means the receipt hereof will apprise thee that the cause goeth perilously what cause i know not but be it what it may it taketh him hence on what perchance may be his last journey he biddeth you remember your oath and would have me advertise you that one merriman hath been heard of in these parts travelling for london with a party of whom one is the lady of the castle on the river with her ward he is a dark mysterious man this irish wolfhound of thine my hollander and did i not suspect him to have a secret tooth for the olives of parnassus i had not thus condescended to act as go between you when i enquired of him concerning her that incomparable swan that bright and shining star that white snowflake that cupids elder sister my ladyloveto serve whom i counted as nought the perils of a certain fell voyage you wot ofwhen i enquired him of her he asked me back did i desire to flounder in the castle moat by which talk it appeared to me much care hath weakened his mind and i misdoubt me his present journey bodes no good my hollander i beg not any mans bread yet am i hard put to it to show the world that heaven doth not desert her favourites if the pity of a prentice can reach from you to chester lend it me i pray you as i sit here gazing into the empyrean for my next meal if i may i shall shorten the space betwixt us meanwhile count for thyself a lodging in at least one poetic breast which is that of thy patron and friend thomas graves post scriptum i have overtook my messengera poor country carrier to tell thee strange news this ludar hath returned suddenly from his journey in the custody of a troop i saw him marched through the streets but just now amid cries of treason away with him hang him sad to hear the talk runneth that he is party in some great conspiracy against her glorious majesty whose foes may heaven confound if it be true then is our achilles wounded in the heel and is like enough to journey from here to tyburn free of charges farewell from thy wellwisher this letter cast me into terrible woe for it was plain by it that ludar was in mortal peril and without a friend to help him i could do naught for i knew not where he was taken or if i did what could i outside a stone wall do for him within besides the message about the maiden put a service on me i was bound to fulfil yet what could i do jeannette saw my trouble and shared it and being a shrewd lass advised me to go to will peake and hear what was this news of a new discovered treason and who were in it so i went and found the bridge sunday as it was in a flutter will peake i could not see but from another gossip i heard that news was come of a terrible plot to murder her sacred majesty and place on her throne with the help of spanish rogues the upstart mary of scotland many wild stories were afloat concerning the business one that not a few of her majestys trusted advisers were mixed in it others that the scotchwoman herself was prime mover another that it was the work of the spanish king whose armies were on the coast waiting the signal to land but as we stood there came a mighty shouting from the tower hill and running thither we saw a man in a cart being conducted by twenty horsemen to the prison he was clad as a papist priestyet when i looked at him i seemed to know his face who goes there i asked of one who stood near the head and front of it all said he a renegade priest ballard by name who hath travelled said another on this accursed business in the garb of a soldier by the name of captain fortescue fortescue cried i why to be sure it was he i knew i had seen him you saw him where what know you of this asked several persons round suspiciously if you be a friend of his get you up on the cart beside him i had a mind to make a rush that way if haply i might get a single word with the traitor as to where ludar was but i might as soon have tried to get within hail of the scotch queen herself so closely was he fenced in he is no friend growled i but a vile enemy and traitor whom i would to god i had run through the body when i had the chance at carlisle months since then to avoid more questions and get away from the rabble i hastened back and told all to jeannette she was very grave what think you now she asked i can think nothing said i save that whatever has befallen ludar he could not knowingly be guilty of plotting against the life of a woman even if she be the queen herself jeannette said i i could no more believe that than i would believe you to be unkind or untrue she smiled at that and said she too could not think so ill of this ludar of mine as the days passed news came in thick and fast the plot we heard was a devilish one to murder the queen and her ministers and give england up to the heretic spaniard men stood aghast as they heard of it presently came word that the worst of the traitors were in hiding in london being mostly young gentlemen of the court who had fed at the table of the very lady they plotted to slay try all i would i could hear nothing of ludar nor durst i name him to my comrades for fear i should bring him mischief thereby one day in the middle of august it was a man came into our shop in hot haste to tell master walgrave that the company had been taken hidden in a barn in harrow never shall i forget the joy of the city as the news spread like wildfire through the wards no work did we prentices do that day we marched shouting through the streets calling for vengeance on the queens enemies and waiting till they should be brought in on their way to the tower as for me my joy was mingled with strange trouble for if ludar should be among them the leader of them is one babington said will peake and besides him are halfadozen dogs as foulenglish all of them save one said another who i hear is irish irish cried i as white as paper what is his name not dexter said the fellow looking at me in amaze why man what ails you tell me his name as you love me said i how should i know the name of every cowardly hound that walks the streets go and ask them that can tell you i walked away miserable and waited at the aldersgate to see the prisoners come by when at last the cry was raised i scarcely durst look up for fear that among them should tower the form of ludar but when i lifted my eyes and saw only six hangdog men who held their hands to their ears to keep out the yelling of the mob and shrunk closer to their guards to save them from a worse fate than the hangmans the beating of my heart eased for he was not amongst them so joyful was i that i could even lend my voice for a while to the general cry and when night fell bring my torch to the flaming barrels that blazed on finsbury fields yet i came home that night ill at ease fresh news had arrived already that other men had been taken in the countryamongst them certain who had been in attendance on the scotch queen yet ask all i would never once could i hear of ludar by name or of any man resembling him a month later we prentices had another holiday this time to witness the end of that terrible business on tyburn hill twas a horrible sighti would i could forget itto see those traitors die foul as their crime had been yet what sickened me the most was to think that ludar perchance might presently follow to the same fate if indeed he had not already shared it but no news came the weeks slipped by men ceased to talk of babington and spoke rather of the coming trial of the scotch queen for her life and presently a time came when they even ceased to speak of that and all the while never a whisper came to me of ludar now you are not to think that all this time i had forgot the message contained in the poets letter concerning captain merriman and the maiden far from it i haunted whitehall after work hours in the hope of seeing or hearing something of them but all in vain it would have been easier to hear of ludar i think than to get any news of an irish maiden and her stepdame at court or of a swaggering captain what is that to thee said most whom i asked and others pricked me out of their company with their swords but late in the year chance put in my way what all my pains had failed to procure i remember it was that same day that the news came to town that mary queen of scots was condemned to die london went mad with joy at the news for our pity of the woman was swallowed up in joy that the evil destiny of our country was mastered and that our gracious queen was to be freed at one stroke from all her enemies be that as it may we burned bonfires that night in moorfields and i had my mistress leave to take jeannette with me to see the sport for by this time the sweet maids lameness was nearly cured and like a prisoner newly uncaged she loved to spread her wings a bit and go abroad had the arm she leaned on been that of peter stoupe instead of mine i wondered if she would have mended as fast as she did i was a vain coxcomb those days and thought no yet for anything she said to me or i to her we were still prentice and young mistress only the duty i owed her was my great joy and the service she had a right to claim of me she sometimes prettily asked as a gift twas a wild weird scenethose hundreds of citizens lit up by the fierce glare of the bonfires whose roar mingled with the shoutings and whose heat was less than the loyal fires which blazed in our bosoms i could feel jeannettes hand tighten on my arm as the rabble surged closer round and presently seeing her tired and frightened i made a way for her through the crowd as we reached the skirts there reeled against us a drunken man who had i not caught him in my arm would have fallen against my young mistress and done her some hurt he was not so drunk but that when i set him on his feet and gave him a kick or two he was able to stand upright and talk and at the first word he uttered i recognised the voice of my old acquaintance tom price the captains man whom i had seen last with his master the day alexander mcdonnell fell outside dunluce so dark was it away from the fire that but for his voice i might not have known him certainly he as he then was could hardly know me patience whispered i to jeannette here is a man can give us some news he shall not hurt you only i must speak with him hold close to me and to guard her better i put an arm around her while i parleyed with the sergeant come comrade said i concealing my voice as best i could tis time you were in quarters the captain will be calling for thee captain me no captains stand thee still steadywhen came heugh hell be here to look for thee i warrant an thou go not home got back what for when came harkee comradekeep it snughell not find herhe he hell not find her not he said i making a guess we know

and i vow thou shalt share my noble get thee gone that moment jeannette gripped my arm and pointed to a figure which slouched away from us towards the fire i got but one glimpse of him he may have been anyone for the crowd was spreading fast yet jeannette and i both fancied the form was like that of peter stoupe whom we had already seen once in the crowd that evening poor peter said i no doubt he envies me my charge of you jeannette she disengaged herself from my arm and put her hand on my sleeve let us begone said she uneasily i am sorry i came here so i left tom price sitting on the grass singing to himself and full of my great news yet troubled at jeannettes speech i walked with her silently homewards as we neared temple bar i could not refrain from questioning her you are silent jeannette said i the better company for you said she are you tired yes and vexed yes because peterif it was petersaw me with my arm around thee he would not know that it was only because i feared the drunken man said she he would suspect me instead of being thy sweetheart asked i ay said she peter hath a long tongue what if he suspect me aright jeannette i felt the hand on my arm give a little start as she dropped her eyes and quickened her flagging steps she said nothing but you might have heard the beating of my heart as i looked down at her and laid my hand on hers if peter guessed aright repeated i what then jeannette this time her hand lay very quiet and her footsteps grew slower till at last they stood still then she lifted her head and looked me in the face then humphrey i should not mind what anybody said so all was peace betwixt us two and we were sorry when our walk was ended chapter twenty how there came visitors to master walgraves house so occupied was i with my new joy that for a day or two what i had heard from drunken tom price in moorfields slipped me or if i thought of it it seemed all was well for i gathered from his wild talk that the maidenleft no doubt by her harsh stepdame to fight her own battleshad fled from the captains persecutions with the help of tom to canterbury where as i knew was the convent school in which she had been brought up here she was safe from his clutches even if he knew where she was which tom took care he should not and to make all surer there was that english soldierludars prisoner whom he had charged to protect herhovering near true to his trust and ready to defend her from all and every foe that should assail her therefore i felt easy in my mind to leave her thus secure and set myself to win my mistress and masters goodwill for my match with the sweet jeannette twas no easy task for my mistress said the child was over young and my master told me i had somewhat else to think of than such tomfoolery howbeit when i told them that say what they pleased jeannette was mine and that so soon as my time was up two years hence i should take her to myself with leave or without they thought better of it and yielded somewhat my mistress said two years hence we should all be grown older and if we were then of the same mind perchance she might be of another my master too counting to retain me in his service as a soninlaw said there was time enough betwixt now and then and thus it came to pass jeannette and i were left to our hopes and needed no sweeter comfort to make the weeks fly but one day early in february as i walked on my masters business near charing i saw a sight which made me uneasy on anothers behalf for there at the road corner as you go to whitehall i perceived a man who pulled out a purse and gave it to another and when i looked closer i saw that he who gave was captain merriman and he who received was my old fellowapprentice peter stoupe instantly although i heard not a word and there might have been a hundred other considerations i took it into my head that this business meant mischief to ludar and cudgelling my brains further i called to mind how that memorable night in moorfields while i talked with the drunken sergeant peter had sneaked past us and put my sweet little mistress in a flutter what if instead of heeding us he had been listening to what the soldier said he knew or guessed enough of the maidens storyhaving heard me tell it oftento put two and two together what if he as well as i had learned the soldiers secret and to despite me and profit himself had sold it to the one man from whom it was by all means to be kept i cursed my wickedness who lapped in my own happy fortune had thus neglected my absent masters interest and let this knave get beforehand with me for be ludar alive or dead i owed it to him to save the maiden from the captain even if it cost me my life so as i say this vision of the passing of the purse woke me out of my dream and warned me that there was danger in the wind that afternoon the same providence which gave me the alarm put into my way a means of acting upon it my master i found in a sore state of vexation because a certain book he was printing from which he expected some profit was refused a licence by the stationers company they liked it not said the clerk and had sent it on to his grace who had other matters to think of and was besides away in canterbury on a visitation at this my ears pricked by your leave master walgrave said i here is a matter that presses if we get not his graces licence now the occasion for the book will be gone by how if you let me go to canterbury to wait upon him master walgrave shrugged his shoulders have you forgot your last journey for me said he for if you have i have not oh said i rather sheepish i am older than that now besides i know what i go for this time and have not my business sewn up in my cloaks lining tis bad weather for so long a journey said my mistress i heed not that said i like a hypocrite so i get my master his licence beside said jeannette who knew what was afoot humphrey likes to travel and he pines i know to be freed a day or so from my apron strings i vowed she wronged me there but between us all my master yielded and said i should start next day to see his grace nay said i i will start tonight there is no time to lose but they would not hear of that and for fear of betraying myself i forbore to press it and went betimes to bed promising to be away before daybreak on the morrow early as i was next morning jeannette was astir to bid me godspeed and give me my breakfast humphrey mon ami said she i should not grudge to see thee go on so good an errand yet i shall be glad to see thee home perhaps said i it is all for nothing and ludars maiden may be safe from harm yet something tells me she needs my help you may tell that maiden said jeannette that i lend you to her and if she need shelter she shall have it here i thanked her for that brave speech and tore myself away by dint of hard walkingfor i had no nag to carry me this timei arrived late that night at rochester where i was glad enough to turn into the first inn i met and sleep i know not how it was i dreamed all night that ludar was calling to me to turn back while the maiden was bidding me go forward and betwixt them i was torn in two and lay kicking all night listening to the clatter of hoofs that went past and fancying that while i tarried there his grace of canterbury was carrying off my sweet jeannette i know not whither it must have been towards morning when at last i shook off my nightmares and fell asleep and thus it happened that instead of being far on my road at ten of the clock i still lay snoring with all my days work before me to reach canterbury that night as it fell out i did not even do that for close by feversham i met a parcel of knaves who laid hold of me and rifled me of all i had save one noble that i had hid in my hat and because i showed fight and ran two of them through they wanted to hang me at the roadside and so end my travelling days for ay but as they must needs find a tall tree which was not to be had at the roadside they hauled me away to the wood to make an end of me there and since i walked meekly with my head hung down they slackened their guard of me so that presently i was able to make a dash away from them and hide myself in the forest i escaped them but it cost me a whole afternoon for i lost myself among the trees and daring not to show myself must needs lie low while the hue and cry lasted and afterwards find my road under shelter of night as best i could you may guess if i chafed not under this delay specially as the way from there to canterbury was too hard to be walked in the dark halt where i was i must but i did it feeling that i might be too late and that each moment lost to me was a gain to that foul captain at early dawn i was afoot and before midday stood in the city of canterbury as in duty bound i asked my way first of all to his graces palace which was hard by the great church where i longed to have my masters business disposed of alack his grace was not to be seen being away on a visitation and his graces secretary had other matters to attend to and sent word to me to enquire again tomorrow about the same time so i was forced to let the business wait much to my sorrow and meanwhile seek to hear some news of ludars maiden i remembered what tom price in his drunken speech had said of the nunnery hard by which was a certain tavern by name of the oriflame where i was like to hear of the english soldier jack gedge thither accordingly i went being told i should find it outside the walls on the dover road twas a low mean house with little accommodation for man or beast being indeed as much farmhouse as hostel with naught but the flaming sign to tell me i might wade through the muck and litter to the door and there call for refreshment the host was a civil stupid fellow who eyed me like one from whom he suspected mischief and seemed impatient till i had drained my pot and was gone but i had no thought of going and bade him since business kept me that night in canterbury get me a bed he declared he had none to spare and that i might get better quarters in the town but i replied i wanted no better quarters than the oriflame and if it came to a lack of beds he and i could do with one betwixt us or said i if as i am told my old friend and comrade jack gedge once a soldier lodgeth here he and i will not quarrel over our share of a crib at that he looked uneasy and said jack gedge was not there he would have me believe at first he knew no man of the name but i wormed it out of him that a month back a fellow had come and taken service with him as drawer and labourer calling himself plain gedge but only a week ago as this same fellow was bringing in the pigs a handful of men had set upon him with a magistrates warrant and arrested him as a deserted soldier skulking to avoid her majestys service and had carried him away to rochester gaol i questioned him as to who his captors were but he said he knew them not but supposed them to be men in the company of the captain whose colours the fellow had abandoned knowing what i did i guessed this was so and that it had been part of a plan against the maiden thus to get one of her protectors out of the way and have you had much company here of late i asked that your house is so full he looked queerly at me for he knew as well as i there was no guest but myself beneath the roof by your leave said he i am ill prepared to make any guest welcome and pray you do me the favour to seek entertainment elsewhere nay said i i like the place and if you suspect me let me tell you i am a plain london printers prentice come to seek my graces licence for a book which i hope to receive tomorrow i hope you say true said he for i have had trouble enough with guests here lately not as honest as you why sir said he filling my mug only yesterday there came here such a surlyfaced varlet as you never saw who whined and sang psalms as he drank my ale and then when the time came to pay told me to score it to one captain merriman in whose sendee he was and who would come and pay it presently i ask you sir how would you like that at your inn thank heaven i have no inn but tell me landlord this varlet was he a long pale fellow with straight hair and eyes half shut and was this the tune he whined and i hummed peters favourite tune the very man said my landlord rising to his feet with a start you have hit him to a point and be you then this captain merriman that is to pay my score not so said i laughing and you may bid farewell to your money if you are to look for it to him i know the villain landlord and if i saw him here i warrant you this sword of mine would not be lying thus in its sheath but tell me this surlyfaced rogue what did he do what was his business indeed i know not save to ogle all the women that came this way not sparing the popish nuns in yonder convent and he pointed to a plain building close at hand peeping from among the trees and walled all round with a high wall he asked so many questions of the place and was so curious to see the sisters and their scholars walk abroad that had i a daughter in keeping there i would be glad to get her safe back under my roof and did he see them i warrant you yes for while he was questioning me the bell sounded and they walked across to the popish chapel in the wood and there was my gentleman turned papist all of a sudden and must needs go and worship images too and where has he gone now i asked i know not neither do i care so i am rid of him but come guest if you must stay get you to bed for we be early folk here i slept not a wink that night and before daylight was astir and out of doors for i too was curious concerning this nunnery and its inmates and was minded to turn catholic too for occasion and see if amongst the ladies might appear the stately form of her whose fate had been so oddly woven with mine own but ill fortune attended me for early as i was matins had been sung an hour ago nor was there another service till noon and that only for the sisters i must wait till evensong to satisfy myself and with much misgiving at the delay dragged myself back to the oriflame just as i turned off from the dover road there passed me in haste two men habited as priests travelstained as coming off a long journey yet apparently familiar enough with the path which led to the friendly shelter of the convent i saw neither of their faces for both were bent over the books they read but i marked that one of them was tall and lean while the other who walked with more of a swagger was shorter and better fed i doubt if either of them saw me but somehow i liked not the sight of them or the path they took it seemed to me to bode ill to the maiden and i longed to have my business with his grace ended that i might return and be near the place where she was for three mortal hours that forenoon was i kept kicking my heels in his graces antechamber and in the end was told curtly his grace had no leisure at present for such business and that i must come again on the morrow i own i spake disrespectfully of his grace when they gave me this message and was fain on that account to retreat from the precincts more hastily than most suitors are wont to do here was another day wasted and who was to say that the same putoff did not await me tomorrow it was late in the afternoon when i found myself again at the oriflame and there i found mine host in a monstrous flutter thinking i too had given him the slip without paying my account i made him happy on that score with the moiety of my gold piece and thereby bound him to me for ever and a day for he seemed a man whose wont it was never to get his due i was solacing my impatience as i waited for vespers by pacing to and fro in the wood which divided the road to dover from the convent wall when i was startled to come suddenly upon a horse saddled and bridled tied up in a covert it had a pillion on its back and seemed like the beast on which a farmer and his wife might ride together to market so indeed i thought it to be when looking about me i perceived in the saddlebow a knife the hilt of which i had seen before it was in fact a knife i had myself given to peter one day two years ago when i had won a new one at finsbury fields and when my fellow prentice and i were better friends than we became later on the sight of this knife suddenly brought the blood to my head with a mighty rush for it showed that this horse waited here for peter and if for peter for what lady was the pillion provided i had wit enough without a moments delay to hide myself among the trees assured that whatever mischief was in the air it would come at length to this trysting place and so it fell out i heard the chapel bell begin to toll ere long and pictured in my mind the sisters and their wards crossing devoutly from the convent garden to the little chapel in the wood no doubt the sleek peter would be there to eye them as they glided in and when the service was done perchance he would seek to make his wicked swoop on that poor unsuspecting lamb and carry her off to his foul paymaster in an hour what was that i suddenly heard close to me staggering footsteps and a stifled groan accompanied by the hard panting of a man who laboured with a heavy load that they were coming my way was evident by the crackling of the underwood and the impatience of the horse what a year did those two minutes seem as i waited there sword in hand then there broke into the covert a man dragging on his arm the fainting form of her whom though i had not seen her for a long year i knew in a moment to be rose oneill my master ludars maiden but what amazed me most was the man who carried her i had looked for peter stoupe to a certainty but instead of him i saw the taller of the two priests whom i had passed only that morning on the way to the convent the delusion lasted only a moment for as he turned his head i saw beneath the cowl the wellknown cadaverous hungry visage of my masquerading prentice and knew that i was right after all he flung his senseless burden to the ground with a curse and was turning to the horse when i stepped out sword in hand and faced him i gave him no time for parley or excuse i heeded not the yell he sent up as he saw who i was and felt nothing of the one savage blow he aimed at me with his knife time was short at any moment that other masquerading priest whose name i guessed shrewdly enough now might be here on the top of us so i had at him and ran him through the carcase and without waiting to look twice to see if he lived or no or to restore his fainting victim i lifted her on to the horse in front of me and dashed in the gathering night through the forest roads two days later as the snow fell thick in the london streets i stood with the maiden at my masters door without temple bar there were crowds in the strand i remember talking over some notable news which had just come in and so full was every one of the same that we passed unheeded and not a man had time to recognise me or wonder who was my companion even my master and mistress were abroad gossiping so that to my vast relief when i opened the door and walked in there was jeannette to meet us and no one else thee art welcome dear humphrey said she coming forward and so is this lady and she dropped a curtsey as she turned to my companion but seeing her pale face and sad looks she went to her and taking her hand kissed her on the cheek i think that sisterly welcome put new life into the maiden for the colour came again to her face and a smile to her lips as she said we are not strangers sweet jeannette it does me good to see thee now and somehow i was overlooked in the talk that ensued betwixt those two and so left them and went out to the street to hear what this great news might be it was indeed great news yesterday in the early morning the scotch queen had paid the penalty of her grievous treasons and had been beheaded at fotheringay castle men seemed half dazed by the news to many it had seemed that the dangers of which she was the author were to trouble englands peace for ever and now that by a single blow the cloud had been lifted some of us fetched a great sigh of relief and had time to pity the fate of the fair woman whose name we had so lately hated so there was not much shouting or burning of bonfires but every one felt something wonderful had happened and rubbed their eyes like those awakened out of some long drawn nightmare when i returned my master and mistress were still abroad jeannette i found had carried the maiden to her own bed and having left her there to restand indeed she needed it for we had travelled hard two days by long and tiresome roadsawaited me with a grave face all this is passing strange said she and i love this maiden but my humphrey i have sad news to tell you since you left twas the evening of the very day you went as i was helping the father draw his charges there came suddenly into the shop a man tall haggard but noble to look at and seeming like a hunted lion he looked round him wildly and then asked was this the printers house outside temple bar the father answered shortly yes then said he is there one here humphrey dexter by name no said the father who i thought mistrusted the fellows looks and wanted to be rid of him without a word then he turned and left us before i could so much as cry to him that you would be back anon where he went i know not but that this was sir ludar and that he goes in peril of his life i am as sure as that i speak now to thee now i understood why as i lay dreaming that night at rochester i had heard my masters voice calling me back while that of the maiden urged me forward to think he had been here in this very spot calling for me and i not at hand to answer it was too bitter a cup and late as it was i rushed out once again into the street in the foolish hope of seeing or hearing of him but it was all too late chapter twenty one how a certain man was hanged at tyburn months passed and the irish maiden became one of master walgraves ordinary household and she and my jeannette were as sisters it was not without a struggle that my master and mistress were prevailed upon to open their home to the fair stranger at first my master being sorely wroth with the miscarriage of my errand to his grace vowed so roundly that he would turn both me and my papist wenchso he called herout of doors that it seemed likely there would be broken heads as well as hearts over this business for it was hard to keep my temper even with jeannettes stepfather when he talked like that but i deemed it wise to leave the management of the matter to daintier hands than mine and when jeannette clinging to her fathers knees besought him with tears at least to let the maiden stay a few days till she could find a shelter he surlily yielded so much provided she stayed in a chamber by herself and brought not her papist blasphemy within earshot of any in the house then when a day after my mistress being won over by her sweet daughter saw how ill and withal how gentle the maiden was it was even permitted her to walk in the garden and exchange civilities with the two ladies of the house soon after yet another event served to put my master in humour for a message came from his graces secretary permitting the printing of the book and that evening as i observed master walgrave even condescended to speak to the maiden himself and last of all when she told him prettily that she was rich enough to recompense him for his hospitality and begged him take charge of her purse so long as she lodged with him he had no more to say but let her go in and out as she pleased pledging her only to speak not a word of her religion to jeannette or anyone else in his house it was not much i saw of her for despite her liberty she never strayed beyond the little garden and many a day kept close to her chamber yet often i heard of her from jeannette and now and again she herself enquired for me and asked me to walk with her i soon learned what little she had to tell of her own adventures after leaving dunluce she had been kept close prisoner in toome castle by her old stepdame despite her fathers protest who had no more voice in his own house than a dog and was not sorry to escape from it to castleroe the english soldier who had been sent to guard her was not admitted within the walls but pacedfaithful fellowoutside within sight of her window the only reminder she had of the happiness she had lost presently rumours came that ludar had been slain in battle and after a while captain merriman came on a visit happily this time he returned not to the violence with which he had persecuted her at castleroe but tried to win her by civilities which were scarcely less loathsome to her than his old rudenesses amongst other things he told her ludar had cursed her for being his brothers murderess and that he believed it was true as had been reported that the young mcdonnell was slain and two days after to confirm this an officer came to the castle with news that ludars head was set on a pole above the gate at the bridge of dublin after that the maiden said she wished no longer to live for she knew not what to believe or how much was a wicked plot to deceive her into yielding to the captain presently her father came home and she begged him on her knees to send her to england he consented but when my lady heard of it she took the whim to go to court too and invited the captain to be their escort so nothing was gained by that moveor nothing would have been gained had not providence directed that captain merriman and my lady should grievously fall out on the journey about some act of disrespect to herself such as the neglecting to see her lifted to her horse before he assisted the maiden whatever the cause was it saved the maiden much trouble during the journey for the captain was kept thereby at arms length and never permitted to come near and to add to her comfort she had espied among the men who formed the escort the same english fellow who had escorted her from dunluce to toome and who it was clear was still true to his trust but as they neared london my lady feeling in need of some little pomp to make good her entry took the captain back once more into favour and with that the maidens troubles began again for the captain bargained as a price of his goodwill that he should wed the maiden so soon as they reached town to this my lady seemed to consent and told her stepdaughter sternly enough to prepare herself for what was no longer to be avoided thus made desperate on a certain morning about a days ride from london the maiden made some pretence of her saddle being broken and beckoned to the english fellow to come and attend to it but instead of him for his head was turned came tom price the captains sergeant and while he made good the straps she took heart of grace and begged him for pitys sake help her and slipped into his hand some gold pieces and he having no liking to see his master married and himself perhaps cast out of service willingly offered to help her when the time came so she bade him be ready with a horse at midnight of the very day they reached london and to bring the other english fellow if needs be also the rest of the story i knew how tom price had carried her to her old nunnery school at canterbury and how the fellow gedge though tom had no mind to share the reward with him discovered what was afoot and went to canterbury too and how peter stoupe having heard the secret from the drunken sergeant had found out the captain and sold the same to him and finally after getting the honest watchdog out of the way how disguised as priests those two villains had invaded the convent and but for the providence which took me thither might have had her across seas and at their mercy long since so my good humphrey said the maiden once more i owe you more than my life i cannot repay you but heaven will nay it is doing so already in giving you this sweetest little jeannette to love you and then as her eyes grew dim and her bosom heaved i could guess whither her thoughts had flown and how my happy lot contrasted with her own i had told her all i knew of ludar up to the time of the poets letter but for a long time i durst not tell her of his visit to my masters house that evening while i was at canterbury at last however i summoned up courage with jeannettes help to tell her that and it was pitiful to see how it moved her talk of it no more said she he will not return or if he does the sight of meto whom he owes all these troubles who tempted him to desert his duty and ruined his lifewill drive him hence jeannette said she taking my little mistress hand in hers why must one live when it would be so happy to die maiden said jeannette boldly you do wrong to talk so and i shall love you less if you say it again of course he will come and of course he loves you and of course all will be happy yet is the god you pray to less kind and strong than ours the maiden said nothing but her cheeks flushed as she lifted jeannettes little hand to her lips and after that we seldom spoke together of ludar yet he was in all our thoughts as for me i wandered about the town night by night for many a week hoping to hear of him but never a word could i hear and in time people ceased even to talk of the scotch queen and all the troublous times which had ended at her death and a leaden weight was falling on my heart as i wondered if i was never again to hold my friends hand in mine when one day i chanced to stumble on news of him in the strangest way it was near midsummer that a journeyman came urgently one day to my master from master barkers her majestys printer desiring his aid in the setting up in type of certain matter which was to be printed forthwith but which master barker being crowded with other work must needs hire out to be done my master who desired by all means to keep the good graces of the queens printer undertook to give the help asked for and handed to me the paper to put in type i opened it and found it headed thusa list of persons who in these late grievous times have suffered punishment for treasonable acts against the state and person of her most gracious majesty to wit then followed a goodly list of names of persons suffering death in the ill cause headed by that of the scotch queen herself afterwards came the names of certain persons imprisoned together with a note of the place where each was imprisoned and the term of his punishment amongst these towards the end was a line which made my blood suddenly run cold and set the stick a trembling in my hand it ran thus one ludar an irishman who carried certain letters abroad he lieth in ye tower of london waiting her majestys pleasure the summer passed and each week the maidens cheek grew paler she had said little when jeannette showed her the name on the proof which i had kept but she quietly took the paper and hid it in her bosom and for a day kept herself to her chamber after that she rarely mentioned ludars name and when we spoke of him to her she always changed the talk to something else once or twice in the late summer evenings i took her and jeannette to row on the river and on each occasion we dropped on the tide to below london bridge where standing out in the gloom of twilight we could see the great frowning tower which held still as we hoped a life dear to us all but as the weeks sped by with one consent we let go even that hope and on the last evening when we rowed the maiden said humphrey row us some other way tonight and as she spoke her face looked to me scarcely less white than the shivering moonbeams on the water about the middle of the autumn i met will peake one day who told me that there had been of late not a few men hanged at tyburn and elsewhere some for recent treasons and others whose sentence had been overhanging ever since the conspiracies concerning the scotch queen when i pressed him closer he said he had been present at one hanging at tyburn but that was of a debaser of coins but a friend of his said he had seen four traitors hanged drawn and quartered of whom he knew the names of three but the other thought to be a scotchman or irishman no one knew his name i begged will to take me to his friend that i might hear more and plainly told him my reason whereat he drew a very long face and said he thought better of me than to consort with such vile carrion as these traitors to her majesty nevertheless he took me to his friend to hear what he had to say his friend sickened me with a long story of the horrible death of these men whereby he thought to entertain me as he had entertained not a few other idle fellows during the past month oh said he pity on us you saw not the fourth rogue danglebe hanged to him that he had no name i tell you master dexter it almost made me creep to see all they did to make an end of him first of all hold thy peace beast roared i keep it to thyself but tell me what was he like if i be a beast said he mightily offended thou art like to hear that better from anyone else your pardon said i but my imagination is quick and your horrible story wellnigh made me ill he took this as a mighty compliment and smoothed down forthwith ay ay said he some stomachs are squeamish but i thought you one of the stout ones this fourth fellow say you marry by the build of him he might be a brother of yours for his feet dangled a foot nearer the ground than the others and when it came to was he dark or fair i asked hurriedly frightened lest he should turn again to his horrible relation why he had a shock of hair as like straw for colour as anything i saw i tell you no man knew his name some said he was a highlander and he looked it though i never saw one but a wilder more boldface shameless villain i neer set eyes on ay and he kept it up to the end too after the hanging and when they have done cried i angrily no more of that but tell me one last thing said he anything before he died never a word but there was a curl on his lip as if it were we who had the rope round our necks and not he and when the chaplain came to exhort him he swung round on his heel and pulls me out his papist crucifix and kisses it before all the people what think you of that for a stubborn dog the others died with their tails betwixt their legs i tell you but this notable ruffler from the moment he swung aloft to the moment i could stand him no more and left him telling his horrible story to the church steeple while i crawled back scarce daring to think to my masters house i told this news neither to jeannette nor the maiden for it might be false as former panics had been and if it were not false what good could it do to break that gentle heart a day sooner than heaven ordained so the year ended miserably in doubt and gloomy foreboding and jeannette and i as we looked at the maidens white cheek and suffering brow dare scarcely claim as our own the happiness which came of the love that grew daily betwixt us now i grieve to say that early in the new year my master who had of late seemed docile and obedient to the orders of the worshipful the stationers company fell once more into his evil practices of secret printing i know not how or why it was but more than once he was absent visiting the minister at kingston and once that same welshman master penry whom i had met in oxford came to our house and had a long conference there and left behind him certain papers which my master carefully locked away and one night after i had been late out when i came back i spied a light in the cellar below and heard the rumble of a press there and knew that cost what it would my master was once more risking his liberty and fortune at the bidding of his bishophating employers master said i boldly marching below to where he stood busily working his press since i am to be your soninlaw i may as well share your peril have i your leave he looked halfvexed and halfcontented and declared that what he did though it might be against the rules was yet a righteous thing and he wanted not my help unless i thought the same this tract said he could it but get abroad would save gods church from much evil that threatened her and to that end he was willing to risk his liberty in printing it now whether he was right or wrong i was not scholar enough to understand all the tract said concerning the state of the church but since no one wished to see the church improved more than i i was ready to believe my masters cause a righteous one and told him as much and having once lent myself to the work it suited my humour to carry it on without question though not without sundry misgivings as to how far it sorted with my loyalty to my queen to be thus flying in the face of a decree of her honourable star chamber but before this labour was done a new task fell into my hands for one day as i worked at my case i heard a voice at the door say is it here i find my hollander like pegasus clipped of his wings yet giving wings to the thoughts of the wise so that they may fly abroad as in sooth shall presently mine own burning numbers salute me my once servant now honoured to be called my friend and the goal of my musesped wanderings it was the poet but how changed from the gay popinjay i knew on the misericorde he was so lean that the skin scarce held together over his bones his face was shrunk and nipped with hunger a ragged beard hung from his chin his attire was the same as he had worn when last i saw him but so tattered and dirty and threadbare that it was a marvel to me it did not fall to pieces before my eyes the great ruff drooped brown and dank upon his shoulders the gay shirt and doublet hung like grey sackcloth on his limbs his shoes flapped in fragments about his feet and the empty scabbard at his belt swung like the shreds of a worn rope between his legs he was a sorry spectacle in truth and but for his unchanged speech i might have looked at him long ere i knew him i am come said he when i had greeted him and bidden him sit and rest like a dove from the ends of the earth yet with not so much as an olive leaf to fill my mouth withal my hollander even the poet friend of the immortals can eat even the honey on mount athos satisfieth not and nectar leaveth its void as a sign of peace and goodwill my humble comrade i will eat whatsoever bread and meat you may place before me for in truth my teeth have lost their cunning and he who late warbled elegiacs hath almost forgot how to swallow a cup of vulgar sack twas not long before with jeannettes aid i set before him a meal the very sight of which filled his eyes with tears and set his hand a trembling it seemed kinder not to stand by while he devoured it yet even in the adjoining room we could hear him betwixt his mouthfuls talk of hebe and ganymede and utter brave speeches about venus who ever haunted his wandering steps and in mortal guise waited on her favoured servant by which i understood he was struck with the beauty of my sweet jeannette for the which i forgave him much but when after a little we returned to see how he fared he was fallen forward on the table in a deep sleep from which it never even roused him when i lifted him in my arms and laid him on a clean straw bed in the corner of the office and for twenty hours by the clock did he sleep there never turning a limb till it seemed a charity to rouse him and give him more food then when he found himself refreshed and filled he gave us his news which shorn of all its flourishes was shortly this after he had written his letter from chester he was detained many a week in custody as a vagabond and a lunatic and at last shaking the dust of that city from his feet he tramped to the next where a like fate awaited him and so tossed about like a drift log on the unpitying ocean he had found himself cast up at last in london where remembering me he had with many a rebuff sought me out and here he was when he discovered that the maidenhis once mistress and incomparable swanwas of our household he fell into strange raptures concerning the indulgences of the gods towards their favouritesmeaning himself and the sight of her and her goodness to himfor with her own purse she found him a lodging not far offcalled up from him many a burst of poetic fire such as it grieves me to think cannot now be recovered more than that he told us a little of ludar whom as has been said he encountered at chester more yet he had one piece of news which was of no little import to the maiden and us all as you shall hear chapter twenty two how master walgrave fell short of type what the poet had to tell might never have been known had he not chanced to hear me speak to the maiden one day of turlogh luinech oneill her father and the lady cantire her stepdame he pricked up his ears at the names hath fortuna then reserved it to her mortal favourite to discover in my mistress my paragon of all virtue the lady rose oneill my hollander why this churlish secrecy why told ye not as much before why said i i supposed you knew the name of the lady you call your mistress groundling said he a poet needeth no name but love and beauty but had i known this lady was she you say i had relieved my mind of a notable piece of news for her ear say on sir poet said the maiden who had approached and heard these last words now then mistress mine said he and thank not this voiceless dabbler in ink for the mercy that travelling not a week before i reached london i chanced into the company of a stranger who fell captive to my wit and displayed so lively a tooth for the sweets of parnassusto wit my poesythat hearing i was about to issue the same imprint prayed me enrich him with a copy the which i condescended to promise him being thus established in a brotherhood of poetic kinship we opened our hearts one to another and in our talk he confessed to me that he was an irish gentleman in the service of one turlogh luinech oneill a notable chieftain in the isle of the saints and that he travelled to london on an errand to no less a man than her majestys secretary of state to report to him the death and burial of one lady cantire an aged servant of her majesty and sometime wife to the said turlogh this was news indeed and the maidens face flushed with many mingled emotions as she heard it can it be true said she sir poet tell me briefly what else this gentleman had to tell of my father nay mistress mine i can remember little else for i was thinking not of his master but his poetic tooth not of his defunct mistress but of my living muse yet stay he told me the old man was desolate his sons being all established elsewhere and his one daughter lost by which i take it he spoke of thy celestial self and strange indeed if the loss of such a one were not as blindness itself to one who hath looked in they resplendent face humphrey said the maiden turning from the poet to me and taking jeannettes little hand in hers this news means much to me if it be true i must to my father a cloud that sweeps over the april sun could scarce have cast the gloom which did this little speech on us who heard it for the maiden lady as she was had become a sister to us yet she was resolved and hearing that the poet had remembered where he might hear of this gentleman in london to deliver to him his poem she begged me to go with the man of verse and find him out and if possible bring him to her which i did with no great difficulty for the irishmanwho seemed a sort of steward of turloghs householdwas still in his lodgings waiting an audience with the secretarys secretary and when he heard who it was had sent me he fell on his knees and thanked the saints for vouchsafing his master this great mercy and never looking twice at the poet he came with me joyfully to the maiden it was all as the poet had reported and the fellow had somewhat more to say which was that when the lady cantire now six months ago had returned home to die she had confessed to her lord her wickedness with respect to the maiden whom she fully believed despite her flight to be in the clutches of the wicked english captain who had vowed to move heaven and earth to find her and as had been reported had been as good as his word turlogh found it hard to forgive his lady this great wrong and since her death had longed for his child as he had never longed before furthermore being now old and past fighting he and his old foe sorley boy had become friends and all was quiet in the country of the glynns there was naught to be said to all this and the maiden though the tears stood in her eyes as she spoke told us she must leave us and go home to her father it went hard with me then for my duty to ludar seemed to demand that i should see the maiden safe to her journeys end yet while a shred of hope remained that he still lived how dare i quit the place i was in besides my master every day had more need of my service for his secret printing and was indeed so restless and nervous concerning the work that he even grudged my walking out of an evening or stealing an hour now and again in the company of my sweet jeannette but one day the maiden called me to her and said humphrey you have been a friend and a brother to me i have two things to ask of you now one i even command the other i beg as a precious boon before you ask said i i will obey the command for you have a right to command anything and i will grant the boon for nothing i can give you can come up to what i would fain give you she smiled gently at that and said wait till you hear humphrey my command is that you quit not london at present i understand said i and had already resolved that only your command should move me hence that makes me happier said she with a sigh of relief now for the boon what if i asked you to spare me jeannette for a season i think i looked so taken aback by that that she had it on her lips to take back the request but i recovered myself in time what says she i asked i have not asked her said she i will ask her then said i and we went together to where jeannette sat waiting for us jeannette said i this maiden asks me to lend her the most precious thing i possess say shall i do so yea humphrey and with a willing heart then sweetheart said i kissing her i will even lend her thee it surprised me that when it came to asking my master and mistress they gave their leave after but a short parley for the two maids were so bound together and the lot of the one was so pitiful and desolate that it seemed after all not too great a boon to ask and when jeannette herself seconded the request and i encouraged it they yielded in truth my master was just then so full of his work and of the peril he ran that i think he was all the better disposed to see one of his family thus provided for besides he might safely reckon on the more work from me when i should have naught to tempt me nightly from my case as for my mistress she was already making ready to take her younger children to visit a gossip of hers one mistress crane and it eased her of some little difficulty to find her party lightened by one for a season so all fell out well for the maiden and sorrowfully for me yet when she reproached herself for her selfishness in robbing me of my sweetheart i had not the heart to show her all i felt in sooth this maiden needed a friend and comforter sorely and how was she to fare on that long troublesome journey with no comrade but a rough man and perchance a halfwitted poet for the poet vowing that aphrodite should never need for a gallant nor a maiden in distress for a knight begged so hard to go too that she was fain to yield and admit him of the party twas late in march when our house was left desolate on the last evening before they went she asked me to row her and jeannette once again on the river i guessed why she asked and needed no telling which course to take and as our boat lay on the oars beneath the shadow of that gloomy tower she looked up long and wistfully as one who takes a long farewell then with a sigh she motioned to me to turn the boats head and row home not a word did any of us say during that sad voyage only when we reached home and i handed her from the boat she said humphrey i am glad you are staying near him so then i discovered she believed him living still and that i should see him again that night as jeannette and i stood in the garden watching the moonbeams play on the water and feeling our hearts very heavy at the parting that was to come we heard the splashing of an oar at the river side and presently a man stepped up the bank and stood before us saluting at first i was so startled that my hand went to my belt and i had out my sword in a twinkling but i sent it home again directly i heard his voice and recognised not an enemy but that same jack gedge whom ludar had charged long ago at dunluce to see to the maiden only two days since he told us had he been let out of rochester gaol when he had gone forthwith to canterbury and heard from mine host at the oriflame that a certain printers prentice by name dexter if any one could tell him what had befallen the nunnery maiden whereupon he had travelled all the way to london in a day and had not been able to hear of me but spying us just now in a boat as he stood near london bridge he had taken craft and followed us and here he was ready to take up his charge and whether we willed it or no look after the maiden this was a great joy to us all not least of all to the maiden herself to whom it seemed like a message from an absent one so it came to pass when on the morrow the travellers started westward there were five of them and methought if any harm came to those two fair women with such champions to guard them it would indeed go hard with all they had not been gone three days and the desolate house occupied only by me and my master seemed as void and dull as ever when one afternoon who should step into the shop but a fine gentleman whom i had never seen before but whom i guessed to be no friend as soon as i saw him i am told said he that an honest prentice one dexter dwelleth here you be told very right said i affecting to be as simple as he wished me i am he to be sure honest fellow said he we have met before where might that be asked i no matter where said he but i remember you for a fine honest fellow and indeed tis for that reason i am come i have but lately lost my servant a drunken scoundrel whom i am well rid of and hearing from more than one a likely report of you and knowing you myself that you are the sort of fellow i needhonest strong in the arm and quick of witi resolved to offer you the service and as for wage if you will come marry i value a good servant so well that there shall be no question betwixt us on that score here is a purse for thy first months service and if you be the man i take you for you shall have the like each month you serve me i am mightily beholden to you said i gaping at the money and smelling villainy in it all and by your leave sir captain what may be your service easy enough for a lad of thy mettle indeed whether you take my service or no you shall keep that purse provided you tell me where a certain maiden ward to the lady cantire and daughter to the oneill is now now i guessed whose messenger i talked with and what his business might be with me it surprised me that he came to the point so quickly but the greedy way i fingered his money deceived him and he supposed me won already and how should i know aught of her said i come now said he tis i am here to ask you questions not you me if you want not the money you need not answer there be others whose tongues it can loosen so hand it back hereupon i feigned to be in a monstrous panic and said nay sir captain i said not that i did not know of her but why do you ask i desire not any harm to the maiden for she hath been good to me harm said he what do you take me for i am commanded to deliver her a jewel bequeathed by her stepdame and if you refuse to answer me it is not i but you who do her harm your pardon said i but there be so many evildisposed persons in the world and the maiden is so very fair come said he getting impatient where is she alas said i she is not here i heard of her indeed not long since in kent yes and where he asked getting excited twas in canterbury where she hid from a villain one captain merriman he looked at me hard but i looked so simple and fingered the money so greedily he suspected naught where is she now he asked again look you captain said i getting close with him if you truly mean well by this maiden i shall tell you where to look for her only you must keep it secret and above all things tell it not to this captain merriman who is a very devil and whom i would like to split with my sword could i catch him yes yes said he eagerly i know him notwhere is she in faith whispered i if you seek her you must be quick for a week hence she may be flown where is it he asked impatiently tisbut the name slips me yet your patience captain i have a paper i will fetch and i left him and wrote hurriedly on a paper pontmarie at calais in france look you captain said i you are to go to the place named here tis across seas in france i can tell you no better than this paper i pray you breathe not to the maiden if you see her that twas i told you where to look for her for she would be vexed as would others i know of and to prove i am honest here take thy purse for i will never touch it till you tell me you have found her and given her the jewel as for thy service i will think of that betwixt now and the day i see you again therefore i pray you appoint no servant meanwhile and remember not a word to the maiden how you came to find her he took me for a simple fool and went off very content with the paper in his pocket and leaving the purse with me so i knew i was rid of him and his fellow dog merriman for wellnigh two weeks and by that time the maiden and her party would be beyond all reach as to what would happen when they returned from their tripwell i had two hands and a sword as well as others but whether they came back or not i know not for weeks went by and i forgot all about them when one night as my master and i worked secretly with closed door at the press i feeling very desolate to know that the whole house was empty and that were i to open the parlour door there would meet me no merry note of singing from a sweet voice withinwhile we worked thus i say there came a rustling at the threshold and presently a piece of paper was thrust under the door by the dim rush light we took and read it it said simply this have a care walgrave the wolfe prowleth o nights what make you of that asked i of my master it comes from a friend said he with evil news for ever since this greedy john wolfe was appointed beadle of the company in room of timothy ryder he hath had a jealous eye on me and being an old offender himself he is like to have no terms with others who do as he once did humphrey our hands are too far gone in this business to pull back now therefore wolfe or no wolfe we must end it and how said i since he will be here tomorrow and find two presses where there should be but one and the libels hanging here yet damp from the printing he must find neither said my master we have time yet to give him the slip then he told me how it was arranged should this mischance befall which he had expected long since that the secret press and stuff pertaining to it should be removed to mistress cranes house near the dowgate where mistress walgrave now lodged and thence taken secretly to her country house at moulsey and since there was no time to lose we set to then and there to take the press to pieces and bestow it and the printed sheets in barrels which when all was done my master bade me trundle to the rivers edge and place on a wherry and so convey to dowgate the which with much sweat and labour i accomplished and about eight of the clock next morning delivered them at mistress cranes house who asked no question but gave me a sixpence for my pains and bade me return at once the way i came now you must know so soon as i was back in my boat i pitched that sixpence into the thames for although to please jeannettes step father and because i wished well to my church i had lent myself to this business i liked it not and remembered it each day in my prayers as a thing to be forgiven so that i could not take mistress cranes sixpence and hoped the throwing of it away would stand somewhat to my favour when all was reckoned up i had not been an hour at work that morning when in comes john wolfe with hungry maw and demands to search the house which my master craftily tried to put him off thereby making john the more sure that he was on a right scent at last master walgrave yielded and bade him take his will so after overlooking the usual room and finding naught there disorderly he walks me with a smack of his lips to where the reams stood piled on the secret door and with great labour and puffing he and his men setto to move them with no help from us and the door being thus uncovered he calls for a light and goes below now my master whether of purpose or by chance so soon as the cellar had been cleared the night before had let run some water over the floor which by standing there had made a pretty slough in the place and master wolfe not knowing as well as we did that the bottom step of the ladder was awanting and being encumbered with his candle fell flat on his face into the mire and lay there spitting and kicking a round five minutes before we above had the good fortune to hear him i went below to help him upand it was sad to see so great a man in so brave a livery so befouled instead of thanking me for my pains he vowed this was a trick put on him and that some he knew of should smart for it but for all that he found neither press nor forme nor printed sheet contrary to regulation no not by searching the whole house over even to my sweet jeannettes deserted chamber when he inquired where mistress walgrave and the children were gone my master bade him go packing and concern himself with his own business and not hinder honest men in theirs so john wolfe and we parted not too good friends he threatening to be even with us yet and we bidding him go wash his face and get a change of raiment twas in good time we were warned said my master after he was gone yet still am i in a great strait for what can a press and paper do if we have no type i durst not use this i have here for it will be known and from no one else can i borrow it for those that be not jealous of me are too timid of his grace to lend letter for such a cause humphrey type i must have if not from at home from abroad what said i from whom abroad will you get any my wife hath kinsmen in the town of rochelle who be printers i have had type of them already but not enough but how will you get it now i asked who will fetch it i think you will humphrey said he i i cried no master i would serve you in much but i cannot in this for i am bound to stay here by an oath i would not break if i could master cost what it may i will not go this errand little knew i how soon i was to change my mind chapter twenty three how the misericorde sailed for rochelle my master was very surly with me when i refused to go his errand abroad yet he had too much need of my service in the business he was engaged on to fall out with me as he would have liked and seeing me resolved to abide where i was he bade me stay and look to the place while he himself saw after the removing of the stuff from mistress cranes house to moulsey as to the type said he we will speak of that again but mark me humphrey a prentice who is not good enough to do an errand like this is not good enough to be my soninlaw and he went off in dudgeon leaving me very lonely and miserable and to tell the truth at any other season i should have hailed this voyage and when next day i saw lying near london bridge the misericorde herself and hailing the captain who was that same shipmate who had steered us into leith roads heard from him that in a week he should sail for france i wished i could divide myself in two and go half with him and half remain at my post in london a day or two later being evening i had locked up the printing house and was wandering to take the air towards smithfield i had passed under temple bar and was making my way down fleet street when there knocked up against me a great carter fellow whom by his gait i took to be more than half drunk being a prentice and not in the humour for knocks of that kind i swung round on the fellow to kick him for his clumsiness when he looked me suddenly in the face and uttered my name it was ludar it was my turn now to reel like a drunken man and so mighty a knock did my heart give against my ribs that i believe i should have fallen had he not roughly caught my arm and muttered not a word but lead on and he staggered away smacking his whip and calling to his horse to go forward i walked on in a dream knowing by the crack of the whip behind that he followed at a distance yet never daring to turn my head at last as we came near smithfield i looked back he lay on the top of a load of hay in his cart singing aloud noisily and cracking his whip and seeming no more concerned in me or any one else than the patient horse he drove the market place was full of carts amidst which he was presently able to leave his own and come near where i stood with a crowd looking at some bulls just brought in he had left his whip behind by which i guessed he had done with his cart and was free to follow me on foot so presently i edged out and wandered slowly back citywards it was already dusk and by the time i got back to my masters door and unlocked it night had fallen i durst not look back as i entered and indeed made a great noise as of fastening bolts and bars within then i stood and waited in a fever had i been wrong after all an hour passed and never a footfall on the pavement then the watch marched by and as their slow tramp died away in the distance the door quietly opened and there stood ludar very pale but as cool and unconcerned as the day i first met him near oxford are you alone said he yes is there any food in the house i flew to get him some while he slowly took off his faded carters cloak and flung himself wearily on a chair he kept me waiting while he ate nor had i the words to question him but when his hunger was appeased he said six days i have waited and thought you lost yet i knew i should find you at last and i did you escaped i asked the words coming slowly and charily yes humphrey my friend after six months with great labour and by the help of a nail i filed my wrist chain and freed my hands then when my warder came one evening later than usual i flew on him and felled him he was but stunned and lay still scarce long enough for me to strip him and put him in my clothes then i left him and walked out jingling the keys in the dark no one looked twice at me even when at the porters lodge i went to hang up my keys you be late in your rounds tonight said the porter who dozed at the fire i grunted in reply and sat beside him till he was well asleep then i slipped the great key from his belt and bade him goodnight to which he muttered something at the great gate stood a young sentry who seeing me to be a warder asked me where i went at that hour i told him a state prisoner was very sick and i was bidden by the leech go to the druggist for a plaster a pretty errand to send an honest fellow said i who has work enough of his own without being waiting gentleman to every knave in the place who has a fit of the colic the soldier laughed and said twas a pity they did not keep a supply of plasters in the place to which i agreed and unlocking the gate bade him guard the key while i was out as twas a risk to carry it beyond the precincts but i pray you comrade said i be at hand to admit me when i return ay ay said he with a grin there be some in here who would not tap hard to get in again so we parted good friends and out i got after that i went down to the river where all was dark and being anxious to part with my warders clothes which might tell tales i stripped and filling the pockets with stones dropped them into the tide then i set out to swim to the other shore and you may guess if it was not brave to feel free once more twas a long swim and the tide carried me far down to rotherhithe where as luck would have it as i neared shore i struck against something floating on the stream at first i thought it a log but as i laid my arms upon it i found it to my horror to be a corpse of a man drowned i was going to cast off again when i bethought me here was a man whose clothes were no use to him or any one else while i went naked so i dragged him to a desolate part of the shore he seemed to be a carrier and having no wound or sign of violence on him i concluded him to have fallen in the water either by accident or of his own accord these garments i wear are his i shuddered as i looked at them they seemed scarce dry yet that was a month ago said he since then a month cried i and i only find you now i have hidden here and there and worked for my livelihood across the water not daring to show myself this side till two weeks ago i was sent to smithfield with hay and after that came daily but till yesterday i never saw you nor expected it then but you have news for me humphrey said he tell it for i can hear it then i told him all that had happened since i saw him last and much the story moved him and when i came to speak of the maiden this great strong mans hand trembled like a leaf as he stretched it across the table and put out the light which burned there we can talk as well in the dark said he hoarsely so in the dark never seeing his face yet guessing every look upon it i told him how the maiden had gone often by boat and gazed up at the great tower and how when she left she had said to me stay near him and how hardly she had torn herself away to return to her father he heard me and said not a word nor moved a muscle and when there was no more to be told he sat on in the dark breathing hard until i supposed he had fallen asleep but when after a while the early dawn struggled through the casement it found him still awake with a look on his face half hope half bewilderment and a light in his eyes such as i had seen there only once beforeon that day we crossed from cantire to the bann with the maiden but the sight of day roused him humphrey i dare not be seen here said he there is a hue and cry after me where shall i hide that was a question had been troubling me all night for stay where he was he could not and if he fled was i to lose him thus the moment i found him almost as he spoke there came a step without and a loud tap on the outer door at sound of which ludar started to his feet and his hand went by instinct to his belt hush whispered i tis only my master the printer here follow me said i leading him up the narrow stairs here is a room where you should be safe and i put him into the chamber that was once the maidens presently i will return meanwhile give yourself to guessing who once called this little room hers then i went down drowsily and admitted my master humphrey said he the stuff is safely removed to moulsey but without type we can do nothing as it is i must take what we have here till i can get more i have no one i can send but you once again are you willing to go or must i lose a prentice and jeannette a husband while he spoke a thought had flashed on me and presently i replied humbly enough master i am bound to obey you when you asked me a week since i answered you like a fool i have thought better of it and if you will yet trust me i am ready to start tonight at that he gripped my hand and said he knew i was a good lad all along and was content to forgive me and he told me what grief my disobedience had caused him and my mistress and read me a long sermon on the sinfulness of my course as to thy voyage said he i hear there sails a ship from the pool for rochelle tomorrow at dawn make ready to start therefore and meanwhile i will write you your letters for my kinsfolk there it seemed he would stay all day and presently he sent me a message to a stationer on ludgate hill which i must needs take and so leave him and ludar alone in the house while out i got a great fright for the watch were abroad in search of the notable villain who had late escaped from her majestys tower and who was reported to have been seen lurking in the disguise of a carter not many days since near newgate and it was said i heard that he had been seen even later than thatto wit yesterdayat smithfield where he had suddenly left his cart and disappeared and some said it was known he had a confederate in the city who was giving him shelter and of whose name the watch had a pretty shrewd guess whereupon ill at ease i said pray heaven they may find both the rogues and so hastened back as fast as my legs would carry me to temple bar there i found my master ready to leave here are the letters said he and money while you are gone i must hire a man to see to the printing here since my duties will take me elsewhere should aught befall me humphrey you must keep the work going for the sake of your mistress and the children for it is like enough my head is none too safe on my shoulders or if it is it may chance i must hold it up a while across the seas my lad god hath chosen you to assist in a mighty work which whether it succeed or fail will be a thing to pride in some day hence farewell my son see you get good type for the money and bring it quickly so heaven speed you when he was gone i went up and found ludar mad with hunger and impatience what news said he and speak not to me unless it be to say dinner is served he looked pale and harassed and i think although the little room had a bed and a chair he had stood upright in it all day touching nothing but when i had him down to dinner he touched a good deal and told me in explanation that the meal i gave him last night had been the first for three days and that then he was too eager for news to take all he might when i told him of the hue and cry and how near the watch was on the scent he turned to me and said where shall we go humphrey which meant that wherever he went he counted on me to follow so i told him of my errand to rochelle and of the misericorde which lay below the bridge then his face brightened that is well said he it matters not whether we go to france or the pole so i breathe some freer air than this of england let us start now we must not go together i will take the wherry while you go by land first said i put on this castoff suit of mine which i thought to give away to a beggar man once but thank heaven i did not you give it to a beggar now said he and i thank you humphrey for a gift i never expected to take from you then we hid the dead carters clothes in the river and not long after a skiff put out from shore with a big prentice lad in it who rowed lazily bridgewards i stood watching him when suddenly the outer door opened and a company of the watch trooped in good een to you master dexter said the leader of them whose head i had once chanced to break and who had been monstrous civil to me ever since we must search this house by your leave what for i asked for villains and lurchers said he and if you keep any such in hiding you had best speak and save trouble wert thou not on a good service said i blustering i would knock some of your heads together for supposing i harboured villains the only villains in this place are some of you sirs what do you take me for nevertheless said the leader we must look round and if there be naught to find there is naught for thee to fear master humphrey you must bring twice your number before i shake in my shoes at you said i come look where you will and when you have found them i pray you let me have a sight of the rogues and i went on with my printing of course they found naught but i as i stood at the press could see from the window far down the river a boat lolling on the stream and thanked heaven all this had not fallen an hour earlier they searched upstairs and downstairs in the wet cellar and in the maidens chamber they peeped in the cupboards and up the chimneys and put their heads out on the roof then when they were satisfied i asked would they like to spy in my pockets whereat they departed somewhat ruffled and left me to breathe again late that night i stood on board the misericorde the captain was on the lookout for me by your leave said he you be none too early comrade your fellow prenticehere he gave me a knowing lookhath been here this hour and is in his berth so i went below and there lay ludar sound asleep in a hammock in the very cabin where he and i had lain once before about midnight i could hear the grinding of the anchor chain at the bows which was music to my ears as was the heavy trampling on deck and the shouting and the dabbling of the water at the ports amidst it all i too fell asleep and when i woke and stood next day on deck i could see on our right the sullen forts on the medway and behind the long low green line of the essex mud banks ludar was there before me pacing restlessly with troubled brow the joy of his freedom had vanished before the sad memories which crowded the ship humphrey said he presently when and where is all this to end how does it bring us nearer to our hearts desires indeed said i with a sigh tis a long way round yet patience the farther east the nearer west he looked at me as much as to say he knew i was not such a fool as my words showed me and after rochelle said he what then time enough when we are there said i time enough indeed chapter twenty four how the invincible armada came into british waters we had scarce got our head round the south foreland when there met us a gale of wind such as boded ill enough for our quick voyage to rochelle june as it was it was as cold as march and along with the rain came sleet and hail which tempted us to wonder if winter were not suddenly come instead of summer i feared good man petrie the captain would run for shelter into dover or some english port where who knows ludar might be seen and taken but instead of that he stood out stoutly for the french coast and after a weeks battle with the waves put in battered and leaking at dieppe there we waited some two weeks mending our cracks and hoping for a change of weather but the gale roared on defying us to get our nose out of port and sending in on us wrecks and castaways which promised us a hot welcome from the open channel but after about two weeks the wind slackened and shifted a point from the seaward so although the waves still ran high we put out and with short sail laboured towards cherbourg this storm suited ludars humour and while all of us whistled for fair weather his spirits rose as he turned his face to windward and watched the good ship stagger through the waves of his own accord he volunteered to help among the seamen and ordered me to do the same and the captain was very glad of the aid for it was all the crew could do to keep the misericorde taut and straight in her course when we came off cherbourg we resolved to lose no more time by putting in and finding our timbers sound and our canvas well in the wind we stood out for ushant but master petrie repented a day out that he had been so hardy for the nearer we struggled to the open ocean the greater grew the seas which presently broke across our bows with a force that made every timber creak and laid us over almost on our beamends it was soon more than we could do to carry any but a reefed foresail and all day long some of us were hard at work at the pumps how long we laboured thus i can hardly say it must have been three weeks or more before we breasted ushant and by that time the water was gaining on us in the hold and our victuals had fallen short whether we liked it or not we must try to make brest and heaven would need to work a miracle on our behalf if we were to do that our captain brave man as he was lost courage when he found the water coming higher in the hold and saw the misericorde labour harder with every new wave and ship more water each time than the last as for the men they gave up the labour at the pumps in despair and took to what liquor they could find to drown their terrors but ludar alone never lost heart or head he took charge of the deserted helm and bade the seamen cut away spars and throw over cargo and they obeyed him as they would their captain and plucked up a little spirit at sight of his courage humphrey said he on a night when although the gale was slackening fast it was plain even to him the end of this voyage was near your master will need to wait for his type come and stand by me here for there is nothing else to be done for the brave ship now i would have liked to save her for the sake of one who once stood at this very helm but it seems to me we are near our last plunge perhaps said i god has not done with us yet and those who pray for us pray not in vain here the misericorde reeled upwards on a huge wave for a moment she hung quivering on the top and then plunged into the trough i felt ludars hand on my arm and caught sight of his face steady and stern with a flash in his eyes as he looked ahead he was right it was the misericordes last plunge for instead of righting herself she seemed entangled in the water and like one who writhes to get free heeled half over on her side then before she could recover up came the next wave towering high over our heads and fell like a mountain upon us the next thing i was aware of was that i was clinging to a spar in the water with a strong arm around me and a voice in my ear hold on hold on then when i opened my eyes i saw ludar and some floating timbers and nothing more but towards one of these timbers he was striking out desperately which proved to be a small boat bottom uppermost which had lain on the deck and which having been wrenched from its cords had floated free of the wreck between us we reached it and with much labour turned it over it had neither oars nor sail yet as we clung to it we could see it was sound of bottom and would at least hold the two of us how we got in i know not yet i think between two waves ludar steadied it while i got in and then between the next two i hauled him in at first it seemed in this cockleshell we were little better off than clinging to the spar for every wave threatened to swamp it yet by gods mercy it carried us somehow not a sign could we see of any of our late shipmates only once a body clutching at a board even in death crossed us and when we reached out and hauled it to it was one of the sailors not drowned but with his skull broken presently as i said the waves grew less and drifted us we knew not whither save that it was far from where we had gone down with no land or sun in view nothing but a howling waste of waves and we two at its mercy ludar and i looked at one another grimly it was no time for talking or wondering what next for nearly two days we had not tasted food or moistened our lips and here we were perhaps a week or a month from land in a bare boat on a hungry sea might we not as well have gone down with the misericorde the daylight went and presently it was too dark even to see my comrade across the little boat the last i saw of him he had closed his eyes and seemed to be composing himself for sleep but i guessed it was the sleep not of weariness but of hunger the night went on and presently i could hear him mutter in his sleep he fancied himself still in the tower with his warder whom he charged with messages to me and the maiden and sometimes he was in the presence of the scotch queen and sometimes in dunluce with his father it was all a fevered jumble of talk which made the night seem weird and horrible to me and full of dread for the day that was to come when it dawned which it did early the sea was tumbling wearily shrouded in a thick mist which chilled me where i sat and blotted out everything beyond a little space around the boat ludar by this time was awake but still wandering in his mind with hunger and fever while i after my sleepless night felt my eyelids grow heavy how long i slept i know not but i know i dreamt i was at the foot of the great rock of dunluce and looking up could just spy a light on the battlements and hear a gun and the shout of battle on the top when suddenly i woke and found it was more than a dream high above my head in the mist there loomed a light and from beyond it there sounded the tolling of a bell and as i thought a clash of arms i looked across at ludar and saw him too looking up but too weak to speak or move then the light seemed to plunge downwards towards us showing us a huge black outline of a ship within a few yards of where we drifted instantly i sprang to my feet and shouted and called to ludar to do the same for a moment it seemed we were unheeded the light swung once more upwards and after it the great ship carrying a swirl of water with it and throwing off a whirlpool of little eddies in which our boat spun and shook like a leaf in a torrent again we shouted frantically and then it seemed the bell ceased tolling and instead there came a call after that something sharp struck me on the cheek and flinging up my hand i caught a cord and felt the boats keel grind sharply against the side of the great ship what i next remember was standing bewildered on the deck amidst a crowd of soldiers many of whom wore bright steel armour and who exercised on the heaving planks wellnigh as steadily as on dry ground the deck was ablaze with pennons and scutcheons somewhere near the noise of trumpets rose above the roar of the waves the sun as it struggled through the mist flashed on the brass of guns and the jewels of sword hilts the poop behind rose like a stately house illumined with its swinging lanthorns now and again there flitted past me a longrobed priest to whom all bowed and after him boys with swaying censers there was a neighing of horses amidships and a tolling of bells in the forecastle the great bellying sails glittered with painted dragons and eagles and sunbursts and the men who lined the crosstrees and crowded the tops shouted and answered in a tongue that was new to me above all higher than the helmsmans house or the standard on the poop shone out a gilded cross which looked over all the ship little wonder if as i slowly looked round me and rubbed my eyes i knew not where i was but ludar standing near me steadying himself with the cordage called me to myself this must be a spaniard said he faintly a spaniard gasped i an enemy to our queen and look yonder said he stopping me and pointing seaward where the mist was lifting apace there i could discern as far as my eyes could reach a great curved line of vessels many of them like that on which i stood some larger and grander some smaller and propelled by oars all with flags flying and signals waving and their course pointed all one way not even i landsman as i was could mistake what i saw this could be naught else but the great fleet of the spanish king of whose coming we had heard rumours for a year past but in which i for one had not really believed till thus suddenly i found myself standing on the deck of one of its greatest galleons in the horror of the discovery my first impulse was to fling myself back into the waves from which i had been saved my second was to seize my sword and fly at the first man i saw and so die for my country then and there but alas i was too weak to do either when i took a step it was to fall in a heap on the deck faint with hunger wrath and shame when i came to i lay in a dark cabin and ludar scarcely less pallid than i sat beside me come on deck said he this place is stifling if the dons mean to make an end of us they may as well do it at once so bracing himself up to lend me an arm he made for the deck a sentinel stood at the gangway whom ludar brushing past bade in round english give us food and lead us to the captain the man stared in surprise and muttered something in spanish which as luck would have it ludar mindful of his smattering of spanish learned at oxford understood to mean we were to remain below whereupon he pulled me forward and defied the fellow to put us back we might possibly have been run through then and there had not a soldier who had overheard our parley come up are you english said he in our own tongue my comrade is english i am irish said ludar and unless we have food forthwith we are not even that i am an irishman myself said the soldier who by his trappings was an officer therefore come and have some food i know i felt then hard put to it whether despite my famine i could eat food in such a place and from such hands but i persuaded myself if i was to die so soon i might as well meet death with a full stomach as an empty while we ate the irishman questioned ludar as to his name and the part of ireland he lived in he himself was the son of a southern chiefone desmond and after living some years in spain was now attached to the enemys forces he was close enough as to the movements of the fleet and so soon as he had seen us fed he bade us come with him to the don the deck was as crowded as fleet street and as we passed to the poop very few of these gay spaniards took the trouble to look after us or wonder how we came there only when ludar as we reached the commanders door suddenly took his sword and flung it out to sea did a few of them stare i followed my comrades example the sea had as much right to my weapon as a spaniard and i was thankful to see that ludar in this respect was of the same mind with me in the cabin was a tall elderly slightly built man clad in a fine black steel breastplate with a crested helmet on the table before him he stood bending over a chart which several of his officers were also examining and as he looked quickly up at our entry i was surprised at the fairness of his complexion and the grave mildness of his demeanour our irish guide briefly explained who we were and how we came on board don alonzofor that was his nameeyed us keenly and addressing ludar said in a broken english you are irish your name ludar mcsorley mcdonnell of dunluce and the glynns said ludar the commander said something to one of his officers who presently laid a map of ireland on the table and placed his finger on the spot where dunluce was situated senor has no sword your calling my sword is in the sea it belonged to my father my mistress and myself said ludar shortly the spaniard inclined his head with a faint smile his majesty is unfortunate not to be a fourth in so honourable a company said he ludar looked confused and his brow clouded he was no match for any man when it came to compliments sir said he i am indebted to your watch for my life and to his majesty your king for my dinner i am sorry it is so but i cannot help it if you command it i am bound to make payment and since i have no money you have a right to the service of my hands till we be quits don alonzo looked him from head to foot and smiled again sir ludar is his majestys guest on this ship said he with a fine motion of the head any service he may render i shall be honoured to accept i refer him to captain desmond here for further intelligence and you senor said he addressing me with somewhat less ceremony you are english i thank heaven yea said i a humble servant to her majesty queen elizabeth and a foe to her enemies and your estate demanded he coldly ignoring my tone i have no estate i am a plain london prentice we shall have the honour of restoring you to london shortly said he meanwhile sir ludar shall not be deprived of the service of his squire then turning to his officers he occupied himself again with the chart and left captain desmond to conduct us from the cabin neither ludar nor i was much elated by this interview but it relieved us at least of any immediate prospect of execution and unless the don were jesting consigned us to no very intolerable service on board his ship from captain desmond who was not a little impressed by the commanders reception of ludar we learned rather more of the expedition and its prospects than before if all go well said he we shall be in english waters tomorrow and a week later should have dealt with the enemys fleet and be landed at dover this don alonzo it is said will be appointed governor of london till the king arrive he is a prime favourite at the spanish court in proof whereof the rata carries a crew of the noblest youth of spain committed to his care for this great venture they are hungry for battle but alack i fear we shall none of us get more than will whet our appetite as for you and me mcdonnell this business is like to settle scores between our houses and the vixen stay captain desmond said ludar interposing suddenly betwixt me and this blasphemer my comrade here is a servant of elizabeth and has no sword as for me my queen is deaddead on the scaffold i hate the english queen as you do but if i fight against her it shall be in my own quarrel and no man elses therefore appoint us a duty whereby we may repay the spanish king his hospitality without fighting his battles the irishman shrugged his shoulders i understand not these subtleties said he whom i hate i slay however as you will this voyage will soon be over but if you choose while it lasts to keep the forecastle deck clean none shall interfere with you and perchance when we get into action you may find it an honourable and even a perilous post so we were installed in our ignoble office on board the rata and since captain desmonds duties never brought him before the foremast and since don alonzo whenever he went his rounds never looked at us and since not a man on the forecastle comprehended a word of english or could speak a spanish which ludar was able to follow we were left pretty much to ourselves except that the sentry kept a close eye on our movements all day long the soldiers paraded the trumpets played the pennons waved and the blazoned sails swelled with the favouring breeze so that towards afternoon ushant was far behind and every eye was strained forward for the first glimpse of the english shore the other vessels of the fleet which had spread out somewhat in the mist now gradually closed in at nearer distance and passed signals which i could not understand some were so near we could hear their trumpets and bells and see the glitter of the sun on the muzzles of their guns then about sundown with great ceremony a priest came forward and recited what i took to be a mass and after him at the sound of three bells the whole company trooped to the middle deck where at the mainmast the purser read aloud a long proclamation in spanish at the end of which huzzahs were given for the king and the lanthorns lit for the night i confess i turned in to my berth that night uneasy in my mind for i never saw ships such as these no not even in the medway what could our small craft do against these floating towers and what sort of hole could our guns make in these fourfoot walls and when it came to grappling what could our slender crews do against this army of picked men who even if half of them fell would yet be a match for any force our english ships could hold so i turned in with many forebodings and all night long i could hear the laugh and song of coming victory mingled now and again with the fanfare of the trumpets and the distant boom of the admirals signal gun next morning when we looked out there was land in sight ahead chapter twenty five how the dons sailed up channel for a long while we could discern only a blue haze on the horizon then towards noon when the sun stood higher and the wind behind us freshened there appeared a grey line through the mist and above that a gleam of green the sight was hailed by the gay young spaniards who crowded the deck with a mighty shout and a defiant blare of the trumpets and ere the noise died away we caught a faint answering echo from the vessels nearest us then acting on some arranged signal the whole fleet seemed to gather itself together and closing into a great crescent at about cable distance advanced with sails full of winda majestic sight and to me who gazed with dismay from end to end of the magnificent line fraught with doom to my poor country the rata held a post near to the left of the line and was thus a league or thereabouts nearer to the coast than the ships of the other flank already out of the mist the black headlands were rising grim and frowning to front us and already betwixt us and them a keen eye might detect the gleam of the afternoon sun on a little white sail here and there but except for a fishingboat or two which cruised along our line taking a good eyeful of us and then darting ahead before the galliasses could give chase we saw no sign of the queens ships anywhere towards dusk we opened a great break in the coast which we knew presently to be plymouth sound the dons as they stood fully armed on the decks and gangways laughed at the sight and all eyes turned to the dukeadmirals vessel ahead to see if he would sail straight in on the unprotected sound and so take possession of the coveted land before supper that night it looked at first as if this were his purpose when suddenly there was a stir among the onlookers and ludar taking my arm pointed down the coast to our rear where from behind a high headland peeped out a small cluster of sails there are your ships said he lying in wait and with the wind of the don too my heart leapt up at the words for till now i had supposed our poor fellows cooped up by the wind in plymouth water unable to get out and waiting like sheep for the slaughter i was tempted to cheer in the spaniards face when i saw them thus clear on the right side of the wind and ready to show fight for their queen and country the sails were seen by other eyes than ours and presently up flung a light from the dukes ship and with that we hove to and dropped anchor where we lay for the night great was the discontent of the grandees on the rata to be thus put about by the sight of a parcel of herringboatsas they chose to call them but it came as a little comfort to them when a message went round for the men to be under arms and ready for battle at daybreak and with a proud laugh they went off to their quarters for the night as for ludar and me we sat on the forecastle with our eyes straining westward and full of a strange excitement humphrey said ludar if it be any comfort to you i like not these dons i thank god to hear that said i and if it come to a fight said he i had as soon see your pirates yonder sweep the sea as these milords they did little enough for my queen while she lived and they cannot bring her back now she is dead think you we shall come to blows in the morning asked i anxious to hurry off the sore subject tis said so replied he it would not surprise me if yonder sea dogs did not wait till then after that we sat and watched the beaconfires ashore blaze up one after another and spread the news of our coming far and wide presently too the moon came up and by its light looking westward we could discern sails to windward which fluttered nearer and nearer till it seemed a shot from one of our pieces could reach them the news brought many of the ratas men on deck some of whom doubted what to make of it all and others cursed the impudence of this english drake and his lowborn salts but at daybreak when we looked out there hovered some threescore or more english craft drawn up in an irregular line from south to north looking at us foremost sailed their great flagship called the ark raleigh so near that i could plainly discern the royal cross of saint george at the poop compared with the mighty rata she was a small craft yet beside the light low ships that followed her she towered aloft like a castle and looked the only ship of all that fleet could stand a quarter of an hour of our ordnance while we looked there came a dull boom from the spaniard who lay nearest her we could see the shot pitched high plough up the water some twenty yards short and thenas i thought rather foolishlywe sat glaring across at one another in the still air waiting for a breeze it came at last freshly from westward we could see the english catch it and come along with it before ever it filled out our great sails nay when it did reach us there was not enough to give us way i marvelled to see how like a log the rata lay while the lively englishmen slipped through the water then followed the strangest beginning to this great seafight for the ark and one or two others having run in towards the end of our line which lay as near as possible west and east looking into plymouth suddenly put into the wind and ran jauntily down our rear putting a broadside into each of the dons as she went by us included nor was that all when she reached the end of the line and everyone looked to see her sheer off out of reach she gaily wore round and came back the way she had gone giving each spaniard her other broadside on the road her consorts behind following suit i think i never saw any men so taken aback as were the spaniards by this performance for the rata and the rest of them lay almost helpless in the light wind while these lighttimbered englishmen darted hither and thither at pleasure almost as fast in the eye of the wind as down it the surprise at first was so great that the ark was halfway down the line before any attempt was made to close with her and stop her but she waited on no man and even when one great galleon with a mighty effort swung round to face her she swerved not a fathom out of her course but let off two broadsides instead of one to help the presuming don back again into his post loud and bitter was the wrath among the noble youths on the rata as they saw the invincible armada of spain thus flouted by a handful of englishmen bitterer still was the rage of the sailors when by no manner of luffing and trimming of sail could they stand out to chastise these impudent cruisers but when after as i have said careering down the line the english admiral put about and came back the wind freshened and lent some little life to our great hulls one or two got round far enough to let fly with their culverins and great pieces but their shot if it reached the englishman at all whizzed over his head and never stopped his course don alonzo however having rather better wind than his unlucky comrades decided on a bolder stroke to punish the enemy ludar and i as we stood and watched could see the troops paraded on deck and grappling irons and chains laid in readiness the small arms were loaded and every man stood with his naked knife in his belt he means to come to close quarters and board her said i ludar laughed his sportsmans blood was up and for the first time for many a day the care had vanished from his face and left there a glow of sheer enjoyment a cow might as well try to board a cat said he and he was right for as the ark bore down our way blazing out at every galleon she passed don alonzo dropping clear of the line put his nose in her course and so to say bade her stand and answer him then for the first time that day the ark swerved on her tack and put out her nose too so that presently we two lay well astern of the line closing in on one anothers course then there was great joy on board the rata the noble youths shook their lovelocks and gripped their swords the gunners lay with their eyes on the captain waiting his signal to fire and the men on the tops and in the rigging got ready their grappling tackle and held their cutlasses betwixt their teeth ready for a spring ludar and i on the forecastle watched the ark as half in the wind she bore down our way her decks like ours were cleared for action and above the gunwales we could spy many a bare head peeping over at us i marvelled that she had not long since given us a shot but like the spaniard she seemed bent on close quarters and was saving up for a handtohand fight so at least we and all who watched them thought when suddenly scarce a cables length away she put about full in the wind and letting fly at us with every shot in her broadside slipped gaily under our helm on her way to regain the course she had left and finish her career down the line of the dons don alonzo was so taken by surprise and unready for this sudden move that he had not a word to say his broadside when it went off fell wide of the mark in the open sea at the very moment when the english shot rang about his stern riddling his sails and knocking the gilded cross in shivers by the board nor did they give us shot only for a cloud of clothyard arrows whistled through the rigging picking off a dozen or so of the men perched there and grazing the polished breastplates of not a few of the bewildered grandees on the quarterdeck never shall i forget the howl of spanish curses which greeted this misadventure the grandees swore at the sailors and bade them put about and give chase the sailors swore at the grandees and bade them come and try to turn the ship quicker than they if they knew how the gunners blamed the captain for holding them back and the captain blamed men and crew alike for behaving like spoiled children and forgetting their honour and dignity as for ludar he was so tickled by the whole business that he laughed outright and i had much ado to sober him in the presence of the angry foreigners but presently a message came for hands to go aft and look to the damage done to the stern and we partly from curiosity partly from duty went with them twas sad to see how the stately poop was battered about windows were knocked in flags tumbled guns unmounted and as i said the great cross shot in pieces while all around lay bodies of men dead or wounded i think what troubled the dons almost as much as the better sailing of the english was to find that these thick wooden walls of theirs were no proof against the enemys shot which crashed through the stout timbers sometimes letting daylight in and here and there leaving us plenty of work to do to make them good against the inroad of the water by the time the rata had put back into line the ark and her consorts had ended their merry jaunt by tumbling over the mizzenmast of the viceadmirals ship and the other english ships having by this time come up showing their teeth the duke sent up a signal to give plymouth the goby and sail up channel which was done in a very chapfallen manner and the great armada huddled together and standing not on the order of its going turned its heads into the wind and struggled eastward the rata being near the rear of the procession the englishmen hung doggedly on our heels now and then coming up within shot and then having let off their broadsides dropping away before we could put round to engage them never once did they come to close quarters much as the spaniard longed for it and never once did they give him time to try conclusions on equal terms the rest of that day ludar and i were so busy at our carpenters work abaft that we had no clear view of what passed we heard dropping shot now and then and now and again a bolt thundered on to our own hull and buried itself deep in our timbers while once a terrible blaze ahead followed by a rumbling which set the rata shivering in all her planks told us of disaster and explosion somewhere near among the spaniards themselves what it all meant we could only guess for the night came on us roughly and as darkness closed it was all our helmsman could do with a sharp lookout to give his fellow ships a wide berth without going out of his course to look after them as soon as ever it was dark ludar and i and some dozen others were ordered over the stern in baskets to patch up the holes made by the english shot and repair the insulted gilding of his majesty of spain no light work it was suspended betwixt wind and water groping with lanthorns at our work rearing and plunging with the waves and every now and then hearing the boom of a gun behind which made us wince and wonder whose head was wanted next once i thought it was mine for a great crashing shot came past me out of the darkness spinning my basket round like a top and lodging fair in the hole i was mending scarce had i time to thank god for my escape when the man next me uttered a cry and flung up his arms and there he hung a moment pinned to the stern by a clothyard arrow which pierced his back before he tumbled over a dead man into the sea one after another of our comrades dropped till at last it seemed to me ludar and i alone were left humphrey he said when at last we stood on deck i reckon we be almost quits with the king of spain by now ay indeed said i and i think further that they who dream of us far away need not despair for assuredly heaven wants something more of us before we go under else we had not been standing here but whatever heaven wanted of us the ships master angrily ordered us off to the forecastle to look to the tackle of the bowsprit this but for the plunging of the vessel was safe work compared with our labour on the poop for here we were clear of the enemys shot but ludar and i were clumsy with the tackle not being seamen born and on that account a trouble arose for the fellow who overlooked our work chose not only to swear at us by all the saints in the spaniards calendar to which he was welcome but he pulled out a whip from under his coat and gave ludar a crack with it which laid open his cheekbone and well nigh sent him backwards by the board whereupon ludar seizing the whip with one hand and the fellow with the other gave him such a lashing as the wretch may be wished he could give to any man himself and when he had done that he threw the whip overboard but the fellows howls and yells for he had a great voice soon brought a parcel of his mates around him who seeing him wallowing on the ground and pointing at ludar and me asked no questions but set on us with oaths and spanish cries of english curs so we too had a pretty time of it and but that we got our backs against a bulkhead and had our splicing tackle in our hands we might have seen no more of that great seabattle we fought for our lives for five minutes or so and then so great became the uproar that up came some of the soldiers and an officer who seeing two men set upon by twenty ordered every man to stand the officer as fortune would have it was our old acquaintance captain desmond who demanded what the noise was all about whereupon the fellow whom ludar had flogged hobbled up in a white heat and proclaimed his wrongs to heaven and earth accusing us of being on the rata for treasonable purposes and vowing even he had heard us plot to get at the powder and blow up the ship before we could say a word up came a messenger from the don himself who on hearing the story ordered us to accompany him forthwith to his excellency i could not help observing as we marched abaft the gloom which seemed to have fallen on the ship not that the gay young lordlings did not still swagger and laugh but it seemed to me their mirth was more hollow than it had been and when now and again a sullen shot out of the darkness behind whizzed through the rigging or rattled on the hull they ground their teeth angrily and swore in their grand spanish style at the fate that kept them beyond arms length of the foe don alonzo stood on the quarterdeck gazing earnestly in the direction of his admirals lanthorns and between whiles discussing some grave matter with the lieutenants we stood a long time before he had leisure to attend to us then he beckoned to the officer to bring us forward when he saw who we were he knitted his brows and demanded to know the cause of the uproar in the forecastle whereupon ludar his face still streaming with blood saluted and said master don yonder is one of your lads pointing to the smarting spaniard who has mistaken a guest of his majesty your king for one of his own galleyslaves and struck me i have chastised him as he deserves and thrown his whip overboard if that be a crime in your country i pray you hang me at once for i shall not promise not to do the same thing again tomorrow if he touches me as for my comrade here he has done naught but help me defend myself from a score of your brave fellows who thought it not unworthy of their honour to set on us two that i so offended broke in i rather foolishly is the fault of my being an englishman not a spaniard sir don then the fellow whom ludar had flogged suddenly found words and broke out in a torrent of rage with his accusations which grew as he went on and bade fairhad he but had breath to make an end of themto picture us as very fiends twas a fine sight by the glare of the swinging lanthorns to see don alonzo stand there calm and grave with the admirable curl of his lips deepening as the fellow raved himself out when the story was done he turned shortly on him and said something in spanish which sent the wretch slinking off with his tail between his legsa pitiful object to behold but for the scowl of hate he bestowed on ludar and me in passing as for you senor printer said don alonzo turning contemptuously to me you shall not make me believe all englishmen are boors i commend the top of the mainmast to senor as a spot of spanish territory where he may learn better manners sir ludarand he turned to ludar before i could say a word his bearing changing to that of a gentleman who speaks to a gentlemani desire a letter of import to reach the duke admiral by an honourable hand will you take the cockboat and deliver it this sudden complimentfor it was nothing shortstaggered ludar for a moment and he looked quickly up to see if the don were not trifling with him but don alonzo was grave and serious so ludar said shortly i will and the interview ended it went sorely against my stomach then to have to mount to my perch in the maintops and i felt a little hurt that ludar had put in never a word on my behalf i remember reflecting as i slowly scrambled to my penance how strange it was that for so small a difference of demeanour i should be sent aloft while ludar was appointed to a task of honour but i understood not spaniardsthank heavennor did i know much about gentlemen at the foot of the mast ludar came up i am sorry for you humphrey said he yet you are like to get a better view of the fight than most i shall see you soon again if the waves are kind to me and the englishmans shot falls wide think you not he means you to escape and get clear said i would i were with you humphrey you were ever a fool said he gravely expect me back soon and if i come not twill not be my fault or yours get aloft comrade and keep a good lookout so i went up very sadly and presently from my high perch i heard the running of a cord and the splash of oars and saw on the pale water below me a black shadow glide out from the ships side and lose itself in the darkness chapter twenty six how ludar brought back the dukes letter it may have been near midnight on that sunday night when i went aloft to the maintops the sea was still running high and it was all i could do in the drizzling rain and wild wind to hold on to my perch now and then a wild gull terrified by the invasion of its peace whirled past me and shrieked away seaward once with a swish and dull boom behind it a shot passed below me and once or twice a quiver up the tall mast told me the ratas guns were at work i could detect nothing in the darkness save the twinkling of many a dim light ahead and the glare of the ships lanthorns on the deck below but amid the howling of the squall i heard the thunder of a battle somewhere near with now and then a loud shout and a rattling of chains and knew that king philip of spain had not yet muzzled the english sea dogs so the night passed and when morning dawned cold and grey i was stupid with sleep and hunger and loneliness the storm had died away and the water lay sullen and still while the sails below flapped heavily in the wind the rata had dropped to the rear of the armada which spread eastward in a long irregular line very different from the grand curve with which she had swept on plymouth behind us some three miles away cruised the englishmen looking at us while betwixt us and the far distant portland headland i could see the vast hull of one of our own galleons the same which had blown up in the night surrounded by a swarm of little craft that picked her bones like crows on a carcase nearer still lay a great disabled spaniard with bowsprit and topmasts gone and flag struck being towed by her capturers into port as for the rata herself twas sad to see how dingy the gay gilding had become in one day and how sails were riddled tackle flying and scutcheons toppled over yet i had but a passing glance for all these where was ludar was he returned or was he in the englishmens hands or was the little cock boat perchance floating somewhere bottom uppermost and he beneath it i scanned the waters till my eyes ached far ahead miles away i fancied i could see towering among the other galleons the dukes royal standard but amidst these huddled ships and water littered with many a spar and little boat with galleys gliding here and there signals going with movings in and out this way and that who was to find a solitary man in a cockboat yet i think love has keener eyes than most and so i looking again towards where a few stout english craft returning to their line after a cruise up channel cracked out their broadside on the nearest spaniard within reach i seemed to see between us and them something in the water which made me look twice it may have been halfamile away a speck on the water like some floating barrel or spar yet for the stillness of the water it moved as i thought more than an idle log and once as the sun flashed out for a moment along the surface i thought it to be a head and shoulders presently i lost it for the glare of the rising sun blotted it out like a speck on a shining mirror i began to think it was but fancy or even if it be a swimmer it could never be ludar who would come from the other quarter where the dukes ship was when once again i saw the figure this time near enough to know it was assuredly a man who between each few strokes he took waved a hand above his head i was down the mast in a twinkling caring nought if i were to swing at the yardarm within an hour and ran wildly to the quarterdeck sir don shouted i breaking in upon him and his lieutenants by your leave yonder comes sir ludar swimming for his life the don rounded on me with knitted brows but i cared not put out a boat to save him or he is lost i cried has your night aloft sirrah taught you no better manners said he go back but here looking over towards the swimmer i saw him throw up both arms and heard a shout which set every vein in me tingling i waited not for his donship or anyone beside but flung myself headlong over the tall side into the sea and struck out with all my might for the place a spanish sentinel on deck seeing my sudden plunge and smelling treachery and desertion in it let fly at me with his musket grazing my elbow and sending me ducking a dozen yards or more before i durst show head again above water but i had somewhat better to think of than spanish bullets for a few minutes i could see nothing of the swimmer and was beginning to fear i was too late after all when suddenly a wave brought him close beside me sure enough it was ludar wellnigh spent keeping himself up with short breathless strokes but unable to do more he was alive enough to know me and to lay his hand on my arm for support hardpressed as he was he held betwixt his teeth a paper which i guessed to be the dukes despatch and which to give him better use for his mouth i took from him and stuck in my own collar after that he revived and together we paddled towards the rata which lay with sails flapping almost motionless in the rapidly calming sea the spaniards on board seemed to have changed their minds as to myself for instead of the sentinel with his gun a sailor with a rope stood waiting at the gunwale to receive us i think had we gone down where we were he would hardly have troubled himself to come after us but since we held up and drifted within reach of his line he honoured us by casting it our way and so with some hauling we got aboard ludar had partly recovered from his fatigue when he stepped once more on the deck and took the letter from my neck you have done me a good turn said he with a glow in his face which i prized as much as all the gold pieces in the hold of the rata you have made it possible for me to keep my parole with the don thank you humphrey then bidding me follow he led the way to the quarterdeck and without a word handed his missive to the don senor has returned by a strange way said the commander i have returned the only way open to me his majesty your king has lost a cockboat he has found what will compensate hima gallant servant your pardon said ludar shortly i am no servant of the king of spain i was his debtor as was my friend we are quits up to now what more we accept from him we shall be bound to repayno more the don frowned and then smiled and then with a quiet gesture raised his hand to his helmet accepting this salute as a dismissal ludar took my arm and walked away no more was said about me just then but i think after what passed the don however much he disliked me deemed it not worth his while to separate me from my comrade ludar told me what he never told the don that he had been captured as he returned in the cockboat by a boat of the enemys belonging to the ship revenge the men of the boat perceiving him to be of their speech and suspecting he carried news though he had hidden his letter in his shoe resolved to carry him to their captain drake to which he seemed to submit but waiting till he came somewhere near where he suspected the rata to lie he had slipped overboard and hanging quietly under the sternsheets till they were tired of looking for him had got off and after beating about an hour and more had sighted us in the dawn and as he confessed but for my sight of him might not have been there to tell the story well after that for two days the weather remained calm and as i said the spaniard though now and again he had the better of the breeze could do little with the enemy which hung doggedly on his skirts sometimes coming near enough for a broadside but never as the impatient gallants on the rata prayed he might do running in to close quarters twas pitiful to hear the grinding of noble teeth on board the ship as day by day the english admiral plucked his majestys feathers one by one yet never gave a chance of a battle even don alonzos grave mild countenance grew heavy and as for the sailors forward where we were our friend of the whip had a busy time with them to keep them from breaking into open mutiny so there was much comfort all round when on the thursday the wind got up and gave us a chance at last of serious business for when we looked out at daybreak there scarce two gunshots off cruised a handful of english craft gaily hauling after them two great spaniards which so i heard were full of stores for the fleet and which the rata had kept an eye on for many a day how in the night they had got separate from the main line and so fallen into the hands of the sleepless englishmen i know not but this i know that when daylight discovered them being towed at the tail of their captors towards an english port a cry of rage and fury went up from the rata all hands were called guns were manned arms were served out and although by so doing he left the armada without its rearguard the don luffed out into the wind and gave chase then followed merry sport for no sooner were our backs turned than the main body of the english who wished nothing better slipped into our place and blazed away at the spanish line right and left till the whole sea was white with smoke and you might fancy the thunder of the guns would be heard in fleet street itself as for us we had better have stayed where we were for while the fight went merrily on ahead a pretty wild goose chase were we led for we never got near enough for so much as a broadside the store ships lay between us and the english who cunningly used them as a shield so that from whichever quarter we approached there were the dons own vessels betwixt us and them besides that we could see boats busily taking over the chief of the treasure under our very eyes while every hour we stayed we dropped further and further astern of the main armada so that had it pleased the englishmen to spare a ship or two to look after us i verily believe we might have been cut off for good and towed into an english port like these same illstarred store ships we professed to be rescuing two galliasses that joined us in our errand made a gallant attempt by parting company and coming suddenly upon the enemy one from either quarter to compel an action but the englishman was ready for this keeping the store ships as a shield on the one side he had a royal salute ready for the galley on the otherso smartly dealt and with such deadly aim that the wretched slaves at the oars tumbled off their benches and rolled over like so many ninepins and before others could take their places a second broadside and a third swept the craft from stem to stem the spaniards shot flew high and harmless and for every broadside he let go the english gave him back two or three thus all that morning and well into the afternoon the rata hung miserably in the wind watching the sport which the englishman made of the king of spain and his galleons and never once able to get within speaking distance at length amid many a bitter curse and many an angry taunt the don gave orders to put about and leaving the store ships to their fate rejoin the fleet where at any rate now that it seemed a general fight had at last come about there was some certain consolation in store for the fluttered grandees alas that i should live to pity her majestys enemies but i did so that afternoon for when we came upon the scene the battle was well nigh at an end and the dukeadmirals ship sorely battered in the bows was hanging out signals to the fleet to draw off the sea was strewn with helpless galleons amidst which the active english craft slipped in and out giving a broadside here a shot there a flight of arrows there yet never getting within grappling distance or offering the don a chance of boarding not a single one of their ships could i see in distress while many a spanish topmast and bowsprit draggled shamefully and many a spanish corpse could i mark being slipped overboard don alonzo wrathful and baffled affected not to see his admirals signal and made one brave attempt to close with the ships nearest him and so retrieve the honours of the day but he got more than he gave for the englishmen suddenly slipped to the wind of him despite all his efforts and lying snugly on his flank as he yawed over with the breeze pounded him merrily betwixt wind and water while his own shot aimed at the sky flew yards above the english topsails the young nobles shouted in vain to the enemy to come alongside if they dare and try conclusions the englishman laughed back out of every port in his broadside and bid them catch if they could meanwhile to pass the time they slid round by our stern and newblacked the gilding there and even hovered a few minutes to leeward to pick off a score or so of the crew on the deck with their arrows before running back to their quarters on the other port how long it went on i know not for a cry suddenly came of hands below and down we went to patch up with all our might the holes the english shot had made on the water line and here we worked all night amongst a swearing savage gang who threatened aloud to blow up the ship rather than fight any more and wished themselves safe back in the drinkingshops of lisbon when about midnight halfstifled with the heat we came on deck the rata was running before the wind at the rear of the armada heading for the french coast and the lanthorns of the english had dropped a league behind never saw i a company so changed as were the gallants of spain by that days fight they still cursed and laughed and shouted but when they shook their fists it was at the lights ahead and when they dropped silent and downcast their faces were turned to the lights astern humphrey said ludar to me as we stood a moment looking round before we turned to go to our quarters i like not this business why said i the spaniard is being beaten and he knows it our english seadogs are too many for him ay said he with a curl of his lip your english are brave enough when there is no helpless womans head to be taken but it is because these dons are a pack of curs that i like this business less and less it contents me well enough to see them shuffled and routed said i yes but how is it to end a little more and instead of sailing up channel we shall be sailing down instead of finding ourselves in london we may arrive in lisbon what then this had never occurred to me i had calculated so surely on finding myself back in england that i had forgotten we were prisoners on the rata and must even go wherever she took us how can we get away i asked if we swim to the english they will mistake us for spies or spaniards and we are too far from the shore in a day or two said ludar unless the english stop us we should be near the french coast wait till then perchance your master has a better chance for his type after all than he thinks for but any plan of escape was fated to be thwarted then and there even as we laid it for as we passed a black corner turning below towards our bunk there came a sudden gleam and a spanish curse out of the darkness and ludar next moment with the blood rushing from his side staggered forward and fell to the ground in an instant before the villain could slink away i had him by the neck it needed no cudgelling of my brains to guess who it might be for once and again that day while we worked i had marked the fellows evil eye on ludar ludar had laughed when i had told him of it and had not deigned so much as to turn his head to see if i spoke true and in the bustle that had followed i too had forgot our enemy of the whip but he had not forgotten us although i caught him in the dark he was too quick for me he had his blade still and though he struck wildly and only scratched my arm the blow loosed my grip for a moment and in that moment he dashed past me and up the ladder i followed madly as i reached the deck i saw him before me running forward and casting a glance behind to see if i followed then tripping on a rope he lost his feet and sprawled forward as i supposed my easy prey but heaven had taken his punishment out of my hands for at the very spot where he fell the gunwale of the ship stood open at a place where the refuse of the late battle was being let out from the deck into the water and here before a hand could be stirred or a cry raised the wretch plunged shrieking to the fate he deserved and there was an end of him when i returned below i found ludar gasping but his wound bad as it was was not so bad as the villain intended the blade which had aimed at his heart had turned aside on the rib leaving indeed a hideous fleshwound in the side but not threatening life he was faint with loss of blood and i think with pain and when i spoke to him he turned a white face to me and said nothing therefore in no little panic i lifted him gently to his bunk and went in search of help by good fortune i met captain desmond to whom i told his fellow irishmans plight and presently he came forward with a leech this learned grandee seeing the wound not to be desperate and having plenty of business i suppose elsewhere among his seasick lordlings bade us bandage up the wound as best we could and find a better place to lay the sufferer in than that foul hole saying which he dawdled away then captain desmond questioned me as to how it all happened and when i told him he shrugged his shoulders and said help me carry him abaft heaven knows there are plenty of empty cabins on our ship tonight the don has enough to think of without this coming to his ears therefore when we have him safely bestowed do you attend to your duties here as before and i will see to him come now this was a sad blow to me to be parted from my master and friend in this hour of danger yet it seemed better for him to get to the gentlemens quarters for in the hole where he was he could scarce have lived so i was fain to submit captain desmond promised me that once a day i might come to enquire and further that if his mana spanish clown who shook in his shoes whenever he heard a gunshould by any chance be killed i might take his place whereupon i grieve to say i prayed devoutly that night that heaven would speedily relieve the poor fellow of his fears for good next day i was too miserable toiling alone at the rents in the hold to see or care much what passed but i know that towards evening when i looked out the low cliffs of france were in sight and that the english sail were a league in our rear standing out as it seemed to me for the white walls of their own land chapter twenty seven how ludar sailed north and i south the next day it was saturday i was hovering near captain desmonds quarters on some excuse to enquire after my comrade when there came a summons for hands forward and a general stir as of something untoward afoot so far as i could judge we were bowling along before a smart westerly breeze with all canvas set just about where the channel straitens betwixt dover on the english side and calais on the french though we were towards the french side we could clearly see the white cliffs of england to our left and betwixt us and them scarcely a mile to rear of us hovered a certain number of english craft which had not followed their greater ships into dover to our right the towers and steeples of calais town rose up clear and bright while straight ahead of us the long line of the armada of which we closed in the rear swept forward as though they would dart clean past the straits and make for the dutchmans land beyond but as i went forward i marked a rapid passing of signals along the line and a crowding on each ship at the forecastle the great anchors of the rata were swung in readiness over the prow and a score of men stood by to pay out the cable then as we strained our eyes eagerly ahead we could see the tall masts of the dukes ship and of all the ships betwixt him and us suddenly swing round into the winds eye there was a great flapping of canvas a rattle of chains and a plunging of anchors and then as if by magic the great armada stood still at bay it was easy to guess the object of this strange movement and as i looked away towards the english fleet i felt uneasy for so suddenly was the spanish fleet halted and so near upon its heels were the pursuers that unless these could halt as suddenly they would assuredly slip past and so give the spaniardwhat he so greatly desired and longed forthe wind of them already the young nobles on the rata were laughing at the smart policy of their admiral and rejoicing in the near prospect of a turning of the tablesfor could they once get the englishman betwixt them and the duke of parmas fleet which was waiting on the dutch coast they would crumple him up like chaff between two millstonesalready i say they were counting on seeing the enemy run past them down the wind when lo with a derisive shot or two into the air the englishmen put about quietly and after hovering a little and running a little in the teeth of the wind to get a nice distance from us they dropped anchor too and turned every one his broadstern upon us so that we might all have an eye full of the queens ensigns which floated there i confess i lifted my hat in joy and loyalty to see how cunningly the don had been outreached and the spanish oaths which hissed out from a hundred lips as they saw the same thing sounded to me heaven forgive me like music so overjoyed was i that without leave i went off laughing to tell ludar the news but alack at the very entrance to the officers quarters whom should i run against but don alonzo himself so smartly did i come against him that had i not caught him roughly by the arm he might have fallen backwards when he saw who it was his brow darkened and little wonder and he said something in spanish that i was glad i did not know the meaning of he recovered himself however and drew up coldly a moment after this eternal printer said he the way to the mainmast you know already sirrah take with you this time to the top three days rations if you are found lower than the topmast yard before then you swing at the bowsprit i was sorely tempted to retort thenso put about was ithat there was less chance of my countrymen seeing me if i swung at his bowsprit than if i swung at his stern but i prudently forebore sire said i permit me first he turned on me with such a look that i ventured no more parley and sad at heart wondering what ludar would think of me for not coming to him and wishing this cursed seafight was at an end i went to the hold for biscuits and a bottle of water and with no better armour than this crawled miserably aloft little i guessed what a revenge i was to have on the dons before my three days were over for a while not a little of my pleasure in seeing her majestys ships on the right side of the wind was lost by this untoward accident and since the wind freshened increasingly during the day and the channel in those straits is wickedly rough i was soon too ill and out of humour to think of anything at all i had more than one mind to venture an escape and perhaps swim to the french coast yet so long as ludar was on the ship i could not do it and he in his grandees quarters was as close a prisoner from me as if he had still been in the tower i was growing tired of the invincible armada and thought with longing of the snug parlour in the printing house without temple bar where i had sat of old listening to the music of a certain sweet voice which now seemed all but lost to me in the howling of winds and booming of guns and grinding of spanish teeth where now was she and that fair maiden whom ludar loved what hope were there of our ever meeting or hearing of one anothers fate the night passed and as sunday dawned i could see the english ships still hovering not far to rearward while across toward the english coasts shone many white sails as of the greater queens ships returning to join the fleet the wind slackened so that the anchorage of the armada which had been sore strained in the night held good and with the french town so close on their flank i thought despite their loss of the wind they rode safely enough where they were and would have leisure to say mass and celebrate their popish rites without fear of disturbance that sunday so it fell out all day long bells sounded instead of cannons and instead of powder the smoke of incense rose to where i perched moreover i could guess by the merry laughter which now and then came the same way that their donships were in better heart than yesterday perchance the duke of parma was already on his way as for the english they lay quietly in their moorings sparing powder and shot too and as it seemed ready to wait on the spaniard for the next move towards nightfall i seemed to detect a stir in their quarters and presently some seven or eight moderate sized craft fell out of the line and with sails set bore down our way i marvelled very much that if an attack was to be made it should be left to illarmed craft like these to make it while the greater ships hung idle at a distance but i supposed it was but a device to take off the spaniards notice from something else and waited curiously to see the result they came leisurely towards us those eight ugly craft about a cable length apart steering towards the very centre of our line as they approached night fell rapidly but still they held on i could see their lights hoisted one by one and strained my ears to catch the first sound of a shot strange to say they saved their powder the last i saw of them as night closed in they were bearing down full in the wind each with his cockboat in tow within a gunshots distance of the centre of our line one of the spaniards there gave them a disdainful shot by way of challenge but they gave never an answer then all of a sudden there was a flare and a roar of flame which leapt up and lit the heavens and eight blazing vessels drifted full into the middle of the invincible armada never shall i forget the scene that followed there was a moment of bewilderment and doubt then a hurried random shot or two then as the burning masses spreading before the wind scattered their fires within the lines a mighty shout a rush of footsteps on deck a hacking of cables and running of chains a frantic hauling round into the wind and then amid panic cries the galleons of spain swung round and huddled together with tails turned stood out for sea the glare of the english fireships lit up the sea like a lake of hell and amidst the roar of the flames and the yells of the spaniards might be heard the crashing of bowsprits and tumbling of masts as galleon ran into galleon in the race for safety a few of them took fire from the english fireships some blew up others stove in by their own consorts foundered miserably some went ashore on the shallows but most got into the wind and fled for their lives out of the straits the rata being last of the line escaped with little hurt for all the vessels ahead of her had cleared off before she got under weigh that was a merry night for me up in my perch i hallooed and cheered and shouted god save the queen till i was hoarse i jeered the king of spain and hooted his men no one heard me but it did me good when day broke there we were the glorious armada like a scared flock of sheep six miles away from calais looking round at one another with white faces and counting the cost of that nights fireworks a few charred hulks drifting in the distance were all that were left of the terrible brands which had routed the don from his beauty sleep while many a disabled galleon on our side told of the panic they had caused like sheep at a safe distance the spaniards swung round cautiously to face the danger that had passed and a cry presently arose not unmingled with shame of back to calais but the cunning englishmen had risen too early in the morning to permit that already their sails crowded the western horizon and as we lay in a long crooked line waiting the admirals signal to beat up again for our lost anchorage down they bore upon ushalf of their sail swooping on the right of our line the other half on the left then followed the biggest battle of all that great seafight for taking us on either flank the englishmen coming for the first time to close quarters huddled our ships in towards the centre sending us one on the top of the other so that for every ship they sank by their own shot another went down stove in by her next neighbour where i was the smoke was soon so dense that i could see but little clearly more than once i know the rata was in the thick of the fight pounding away at the englishmen and receiving broadside after broadside in return which crashed against the hull and shook me where i hung at the masthead the sails round me were riddled with shot and once or twice i coming suddenly into view became a special target for the enemys marksmen little cared i for at every shot that day the banner of spain tottered lower and lower to its fall and the flag of old england spread wider and more proudly in the breeze presently i remember an english ship named the vanguard slipped suddenly in betwixt the rata and another tall spaniard so close that we swung there all three together with our yards entangled and blazing away at one another till i wondered if there could be a man left alive below as for me up where i was i thanked heaven that the smoke around me rose in clouds and hid me as it was many a bullet shot at random whizzed through the cords to which i clung and once a great booming shot tore away the streamer at the masthead but so busy were all down below that no one troubled himself to look for the skulker aloft who sat there as it seemed above the clouds not even knowing as the day wore on whether the rata still belonged to the king of spain or to her glorious majesty suddenly hard by i heard a loud shout and looking round saw on the yardarm of the englishmans ship a smokebedimmed fellow with his knife betwixt his lips crawling towards where at every lurch the pole on which i squatted swung across his own i was in a sore strait when i saw him for how could i fight against my queen yet if i let him and the fellows that swarmed up the tackle after him pass what of my debt of honour to the king of spain the matter was settled for me for perceiving me as we swung together the fellow made a wild grab at me and slashing with his knife at the hand by which i clung to the mast forced me to quit my hold and clutch at him instead then as i did so the masts swung asunder and lo and behold i was no longer on the rata but a prisoner of my own queen i made a dash to spring back to the spanish ship but it was too late the don was already hauling off and every moment the gap between him and the english ship became wider halfadozen stout british hands held me fast and as many blades at my breast warned me that the game was up handsoff comrades i shouted i am an englishman at that they laughed and bade me say my prayers for my hour was come and they had other work on hands god save her majesty queen elizabeth and curse the king of spain cried i then one or two of them stared round and cursed me for a jesuit i am no jesuit but a london prentice lad said i and have broken heads better than yours for my queen before now as i will prove to any two of you that like even here this pleased them better and they bade me as i loved my queen take a musket and slay them the first spaniard i could spy on the enemys deck give me the gun said i with a laugh and bullets enough for every dog of them at that moment the smoke below me drifted so that i could just espy as in a frame of cloud a little spot on the deck of the rata where stood a man he was tall like a giant the tawny hair waved carelessly in the wind he carried no weapon but leaned with both hands heavily on the rail like a man wounded and his face when he turned it was pale there was a grim smile on his lips as he watched the panic stricken sailors hauling off their ship and once he turned and looked up not at me but at where i had been fire shouted the men at my side or we strike i dropped the gun into the waves below and with a mighty lump in my throat whipped out my knife and waited for what should follow they fell back amazed at my madness and while they consulted what to do with me i took my chance to grip the first of them by the throat and swing him off his perch at that moment a shrill whistle came up from below you are wanted on deck comrade said i will you go down by the mast or a shorter way the mast he gasped so i had my way and we all went below together the english captainone admiral winterswore roundly when he saw me and when he heard my story said he had bellies enough to fill without a great hulk of a fellow like me to eat more and he promised me if he caught me idle at my work he would trip me by the heels himself whereat i thanked him and went forward but i was in doleful dumps for i had lost my friendperhaps for ever come haul away land lubber that thou art cried a voice at my side looking round whom should i see but that same will peake the mercers man of london bridge with whom i had had so many a merry bout in times past he was too busy just then to do aught but grin in my face and bid me haul away for the other spanish ship had fared worse than the rata and was already heeling over on her side haul away you hulking lubber yelled will or shell be on her beam ends before we are clear so for five minutes we and a parcel of other fellows worked might and main to cut away tackle and clear ourselves of the doomed galleon which settled over farther and farther showing her whole broadside from gunwale to keel and blazing despairingly heavenward with her guns why not give her a broadside to help her over asked one who worked near because said will wisely we have no shot left to do it what i asked are we in such a plight as that tis true said will i heard it from the gun officer an hour ago and not only are we at an end but so is all her majestys fleet then we are lost i said no doubt replied he yet we had merry sport with the don while it lasted and methinks he will run a bit without our help before he find out that we fight him with one arm bound so it turned out the fight dragged on through the afternoon and ship after ship of the king of spain went to her doom or drifted helplessly on the mud banks of gravelines but the english fire dropped shorter and shorter and as evening closed had the enemy but known it we had scarce a broadside left among us yet heaven remembered us in our extremity for no sooner had our guns become mute than the south wind came down on us with a burst catching us in the small of our backs and sending the don away in front of us staggering and reeling seaward for his very life twas a sad spectacle for me i had long since lost sight of the rata in vain i scanned the smokeladen horizon for a sight of her i never saw her more i could fancy ludar stalking the deck or scaling the masts wildly in search of me and then when he found me not with the cloud deep on his noble brow crawling to his berth in the dark to tell himself that i was dead i wished that night he could have thought it truly will peake when the work of the day was done was in vast great humour to find me of the ships company he had scarce known me at first so changed was i by the perils of the last weeks a score or more of swashbuckling prentices were on board the ship he said and presently when i saw them all and heard their jests and knocked some of their heads together i could have believed myself in cheapside having been some two weeks on board they were mightily proud of their seamanship and delighted to call me who had sailed as many seas as they had ponds landlubber however it mattered not and we spent a merry nightat least they didscudding before the wind and watching the spanish lanthorns rocking uneasily in the darkness a mile ahead of us when daylight came there they were in a long disorderly line never looking back with canvas set and still running some of our ships hung close on their heels like dogs at a flying ox but scarce a shot boomed and never a tack did the dons slack off their northward course as for us there were two good reasons why we on the vanguard should not keep up the chase we had neither shot to fire nor food to eat when i came forward that morning to receive my morsel of biscuit with the rest i understood how illpleased master winter had been to see another hungry body on board his ship even yesterday as we had helped the bodies of the brave fellows who had fallen for their queen overboard it was plain to see that there was something of consolation joined to the pity we all felt for our lost comrades and the sight of my beggarly rations when i received them made it clear what that consolation was so when after a days chase the word was given to put about and beat up for margate roads scarce a man among us had the stomach to grumble twas a long dismal voyage that in the face of the tempestwith short and tedious tacks that sometimes left us at the days end little nearer our haven than at the beginning and long before margate was reached half of our company was sick with famine i think as brave as any men who fought in that great seafight were the few fellows of will peakes sort who kept up heart and spirit on that sorry voyage back to margate i know i myself had been tempted often enough to give over but for his cheery word in my ear and if half the crew remained loyal to their captain till we reached land master winter owed it not a little to his prenticesailors as for me i was plague stricken before we passed the thames mouth and when at last we dropped anchor in margate roads will told me he doubted whether i was worth the lifting ashore yet he did as much for me and more he nursed me like my own brother and when a week or two later i was able to stand on my feet and set one foot before another londonwards i owed it to him that i found myself at last once more in the great city and had life left in me to look round and know where i stood chapter twenty eight how i enlisted on a new service london was merrymaking with bonfires and pealing of bells when will peake and i entered it every day that passed men took in more of the great victory which had been gained against the king of spain and rejoiced louder and louder at the deliverance god had vouchsafed the land so when it became known as it soon did among our old friends that will and i had fought in that glorious fight we lacked neither food nor shelter for our poor bodies at first will fared better than i for he was monstrous little altered from the swaggering lad who tried a bout with me years before at finsbury fields but as for me men looked once twice and thrice at me before they would believe it was humphrey dexter and when one day in a tavern i came upon a mirror i learned the cause my beard unkempt now for many weeks had grown till it made my face look very fierce and manly and my hair once closecropped now fell heavily below my ears and the scar i got on the rata gave me so ferocious a look that i had a mind wellnigh to doubt myself when first i saw it tis little wonder if they know thee not said will for thou art passably handsome now whereas once here he left me to guess what i had been be that as it may i was pleased enough with the change for so far and spared my fee to the barber and as for my old comrades i had other signs to make myself known to them as they soon discovered by the aching of their heads and the soreness of their ribs for i soon shook off my sickness and was as ready for knocks as ever yet you may guess if with it all i was merry the printinghouse without temple bar was as black and desolate as a tomb with a great lock belonging to the stationers company hanging on the door when i asked the neighbours concerning my master they pulled long faces and told me he was given over to desperate ventures and with his family had fled the country and twas well for him said they no one knew where he hid i knew not which way to turn my sweet jeannette was far away amid perils i little dreamed of ludar was perhaps even now a prisoner in spain my occupation was gone and my pocket and my stomach were both empty could i have lived on naught i think i should even have tried to make my way to spain as if it were no bigger a place than temple gardens and so find ludar then i changed my mind and thought to set out for ireland to seek jeannette then when i saw a fellow enlisting troopers for the dutch wars i wellnigh sold myself to him i might have done so straight out had not there come a loud thump on my back as i stood in the crowd and a voice in my ear that made me start are you so weary of life comrade that you want a leaden pill or two to cure it verily i am said i wheeling round and facing tom price captain merrimans man at first he knew me not nor when i told him my name would he believe he spake to humphrey dexter but when at last he knew me he clapped me again on the back and said thourt well met my little lord mayor by my soul i might have walked a league and never met thee you might have walked farther than that said i what villainy are you and your master now upon for i take it you still serve the captain he laughed as for my master let him be hes snug enough i left him look you here comrade said he taking my arm and looking hard at me where saw i thee last once when you lay as drunk as a dog in finsbury fields and a good turn you did me comrade and more than me by what you blabbed then he gaped rather foolishly at this and asked did i want my ears slit for a noisy malapert then i told him just what passed and how i had been able thereby to save the maiden from the captains clutches when he heard that he laughed and swore and thwacked me on the back till i nearly dropped by my life you gallows dog you if my master only knew what he owed you why my pretty lad i never saw a man so put about as he was when he came back from canterbury that time without his prey where is he now i asked where else do you suppose but smacking his lips near the doves nest he hath comforted himself for all he hath suffered ere now i warrant thee what i shouted has he followed the maiden to ireland he laughed so then you know where the pretty one has flown i warrant thee if thou couldst see her at this moment thou wouldst see my master not a bowshot away ha ha i do not say nearer for when i left the fair vixen still held him at arms length but he is getting on and now since the maids lover is dead he is not dead said i i parted from him scarce a month ago and i told him where and how he shrugged his shoulders a fig for his life if that be his case said he at any rate he is believed to be dead and the captain as i say is getting on having made himself monstrous civil to turlogh luinech oneill who i think favours him somewhat for a soninlaw the foul dog i exclaimed would i had him standing here for my friends sake tell me tom what of a little maid who went from london as waiting gentlewoman to the lady how fares she sadly i hope since she and i are parted said he for to tell you the truth master dexter she is the sweetest wench and hath looked kindly on me indeed twas for this reason i think my master sent me off here on this business to get him more men for he is apt to amuse himself while he waits for the mistress with the maid and i doubt when i return i shall find the little witch hath clean forgotten how to smile on me i hope i may be forgiven the words i uttered when i heard this i flew at honest tom price like a wolf and cried why what mean you hound what does he dare to do tom shook me off roughly and pulled out his sword look ee here master humphrey if that be the way you ask your questions your ribs shall know the way i answer them i ask your pardon said i panting hard but for gods mercy say what all this means it means said he that you are mightily concerned with this same little waiting lass she is my sweetheart said i and is to be my wife it was his turn to look blank now and catch his breath he whistled and stared at me from head to foot and whistled again then he found words and held out his hand if she be thy sweetheart she is none of mine i go halves with no man and this merriman i asked scarce heeding what he said this merriman said he why take a shame on yourself that you stand skulking here and leave the defence of those two fair maids to a crack brained poet and a swashbuckling soldier i tell you humphrey dexter those two fellows little as i love them are your friends and your masters and if the maids be still safe they owe it to them and not to your idle whimpering here heaven bless them said i but tom price how can i who have scarce shoes to stand in or food for one day go to them this way said he i am here to engage men for my masters troop join us what i exclaimed serve that villain i had as soon serve the devil himself may be you can serve both at one time said he with a laugh but join us you must he would hang me at the nearest tree so soon as he saw me he would never know you i scarce did we stood eyeing one another a minute then i held out my hand when do you start in two days if i can find the men by then meanwhile come with me and put your big carcase in a soldiers trappings and drink health to her majesty and captain merriman a week passed before tom price got his company together i chafed and grumbled at every hour that passed on the day before we set out i went to show myself in my soldiers bravery to will peake on london bridge every man to his taste said the latter i think thee not as fine as thou thinkest thyself by the way thou art like to have knocks enough where thou goest i hear for news is come that the spaniards mean to land on irish shore and strike at us from that quarter this was great news to me and on every hand i heard it repeated till at nightfall there was something near a panic in london and orders were given for all troops possible to set out forthwith therefore tom price though his company still wanted a few of its number bade us be within call and ready spurred at daybreak the road from london to chester was full of straggling companies of soldiers hastened forward like us by the alarm of the spanish attack on ireland we being mounted distanced most of them and so eager were the country folk along the march to see our backs that had we been minded to tarry long in any place we should have soon outworn our welcome i saw little of tom price during the early part of our march but when presently he had leisure to gossip he told me one piece of news which moved me not a little it was that sorley boy being now an old man and broken down in spirit longed for his lost son sir ludar as eagerly as he had hated him not long since he lived a restless life at dunluce often and again stalking abroad as of old and seeming to expect him who was lost he had even made friends with turlogh and the only time that captain merriman had hung his head and slunk out of castleroe said tom was when the lord of dunluce came thither to visit his new ally so long as he stayed the captain found business elsewhere sorley boy when at castleroe saw the maiden who after what had passed scarcely durst meet him but by degrees her sweet brave ways took the old man captive and ere he left he knew her whole story and loved her as if she were indeed already his daughter he wellnigh broke his truce with the oneill because he would not permit the maid to visit dunluce for turlogh dreading perhaps the ill graces of the captain would not part with her from castleroe so sorley boy departed discontented like a man robbed all this i heard and more than ever chafed at the slackness of our laggard steeds how i wished that looking round i might but see ludar spurring at my side alas i saw him not but one day as we neared chester i did see a face in a troop that had joined ours on the road that made me rub my eyes and wonder if ghosts truly walked on earth if it was not peter stoupe my old fellow prentice it was as like him as one pea is to another nay once when to satisfy myself i made a pretext to ride near him i could have sworn i heard the humming of a psalmtune amid the clatter of the hoofs our troops parted company a day after and i was left marvelling if all this world and the next were marching towards ireland early next day i had no leisure left me to cogitate more on that for tom price reined his horse in beside mine and said humphrey here is a message come from the captain in hot haste to prevent our going north and ordering us to dublin i let my reins fall with a groan on my steeds neck tom heeded it not but continued the spaniard it is said has been gathering in the northern seas and is coming down on the western irish coast where he counts on the papists of the country to further him we are ordered to stay in dublin for orders from my lord deputy why how black you look comrade who would not you know tom price why i came on this venture i were better in london unless our journey lead us to castleroe tom laughed and i could have knocked him from his horse had he not quickly added gently my fireeating jack printer i came not to tell thee only this the captain addeth these words send me six trusty men here for my affairs require such before i am free to join you send them forward with all speed do you cross leisurely to dublin and there await me i am in hopes it may not be needful for me to return again thither send trusty men and speedily what say you humphrey art thou a trusty lad could i trust thee to pick out five honest fellows like thyself and show them the way to a certain pair of black eyes and rosy lips on the banks of the bann i loved tom price like a brother then and told him as much in an hours time i had chosen five stout fellows all of whom i could trust with my last farthing and whom i could count on for any service i had them armed to the teeth well mounted and provisioned and then without a moment lost called them to horse farewell comrade said tom as he saw me go i could even envy thee though it is like to cost thee somewhat for the captain hath twenty men already and hath eyes and ears in his head commend me to thy lass and let her know she hath had a narrow escape of a sweetheart in tom price she shall thank you for your honesty comrade with her own sweet lips said i and hallooed my men forward next day we were at the sea and embarkedhorses and allon a barque that was even then weighing anchor with other troops on board for knockfergus to my surprise among the men that crowded the deck was the fellow i had seen two days ago who had reminded me of peter stoupe when i saw him now i knew for certain it was he i stood full in front of him to see if he would know me again for i cared not if he did he looked at me meekly without a sign of recognition and humming ever passed his eyes to some other place so so peter thought i as you know not your old shopmate why should i disturb your humming and i carelessly asked a man who stood next him whither his company was bound and on what service westward he said to look for spaniards and you to join one captain merriman in the north it tickled me much to see peter start and change colour at that ah tis a brave gallant im told said the man twas he slew sorley boys son was it not ay a brave deed that was said i i saw it the fellow laughed you know him then ha ha you can satisfy peter here better than i can he desireth to know the captains whereabouts and when i tell him he is no further off than the nearest pretty face he turneth up his eyes as if he expected to see him at his own side he he what say you peter i say alack that such men should wear her majestys colours said he with a snivel amen to that said i giving him a thwack on the back that made him jump tis a pity her majesty hath not more like you peter how do you call your name stoupe said he looking up at me meekly and rubbing his shoulder after that we went to look to our horses and i saw little more of him that voyage for from the moment we put out to sea he fell as sick as a dog and lay on the floor of the ship praying heaven to put an end to his sorrows till we reached knockfergus there i suddenly missed him and heard he had had so sorry a time serving her majesty thus far that he had skulked so soon as ever the ship came to land and made for the hills where no doubt he meant to lie till he could go back the way he had come whereat i laughed and ordered my men to horse at the town gate much to my vexation we were met by a guard who ordered us to report ourselves to the english governor i had looked to get a fair start of the other troops going west but now so far from that two days passed idle on my hands before i even got audience of the governor and by that time many companies had started westward for the panic of the spanish invasion was very great among the english soldiery at knockfergus and every man that could be had was being hurried across the country when i saw the governor and told him my orders he said shortly captain merriman has already had orders to go forward to tyrones land and will have left castleroe before now you will join him sooner by sea than by land be ready to sail three days hence till then leave not the town but abide at the hostel for further orders this was a thunderbolt to me i knew the captain well enough to be sure that if he had indeed left castleroe he had either not left it alone or had left worse than desolation behind him he was too wellknown to his comrades in these parts to leave much doubt of that and when that same night i heard by chance that turlogh for a month past had been away in dublin leaving the protection of his castle to this english champion of his i made sure what i had feared all along that i was come too late one thing i was resolved on come what would i would make for castleroe and learn the worst for myself twould be better even to be hanged for a deserter than live a day longer in this misery and suspense so i bade my men if they were minded still to serve me be ready and stand by for the first chance of escape it came soon enough bands of soldiers were coming in and going out of knockfergus all the night long and while we sat in the hostelry and watched them depart with longing eyes like prisoners through a dungeon cage i suddenly found myself calling myself a fool and starting to my feet follow me i cried to my men and led them to where our horses stood still saddled in the stable mount i said and stay under the shadow of this wall till you see me ride out then fall in quietly at my heels presently as we stood there came a noise of trumpets and a clatter of hoofs down the steep street as they passed we could see by the torches of those that marched beside them that this was a great company of foot and horse dragging a gun or two with them twas more of a rabble than a troop for the horses frightened by the glare of the torches and the shouts of the footmen reared and plunged and scattered the townsfolk who had turned out to see them pass right and left as they passed the corner where we lurked some of the horses plunged in among us and in the darkness all was confusion for a moment then i quietly rode in among them with my five men at my heels and so unseen and unheeded we joined the troop and passed the gate in safety into the black country beyond once outside twas easy enough to get clear i bade my men lag behind all they could till at last we must have dropped fifty yards or so where in the darkness we were quite lost to view then i gave the order to gallop and overtaking the company as in hot haste i rode up to the officer and saluted a good journey to you captain said i twill be slower than ours for the troop we are to join is already beyond the bann and we ride posthaste to overtake it you are of merrimans troop then said the officer that are we goodnight to you captain lay to my men and spurs all and so we rode forward chapter twenty nine how captain merriman came and went betwixt me and the light our speed did not last long for very soon the hard road turned off to the coast whereas i being chary even of minutes resolved to strike inland and make direct for the bann i was a fool for my pains as i presently found for we were soon crawling and floundering among thickets and morasses like blind men add to that that the weather grew boisterous and stormy that our provisions were sunk very low that now and again we were set upon by the clansmen of the glynns who for all the truce hated england with all their hearts and you may guess if we made quick progress at length we captured a countryman who to save his neck offered to guide us out into the route country where castleroe was but ten precious days had been lost us in that journey during which who was to say what evil might not be befalling those two helpless maids twas a dark evening when at last we swam the river and rode to the gate of turloghs house well i remembered the place lights were moving in the courtyard there was a noise of horses standing and of men calling to one another even the sentry at the gate was not at his post to challenge us and we rode in almost unobserved where is your captain demanded i dismounting and addressing a fellow who stood busily harnessing his horse he looked round and seeing a stranger dropped his saddle and shouted here they be at last tell the captain presently as i waited scarcely knowing what to make of it captain merriman himself came up and at sight of him twas all i could do to hold my hand from my sword he ordered lights to be fetched and when they came said so you are here at last sirrah by my soul i know not what tom price calls nimble men but i could have walked as far on foot in the time come who is your leader let me see your papers i stood forth and handed him toms letter whereby the captain was to know we were the good men and true he was in need of he eyed me keenly and said had you come an hour later you would have had a longer ride still for we are even now setting out westward nevertheless laggards as you be you are come in good time harkee you said he beckoning me aside a word in your ear i was ready to make an end of the villain then and there for i smelt falsehood and devilry in every word he spoke but i waited to let him say his say out first there was little fear in the dark night and the unsteady flare of the torches of his guessing to whom he spoke i require you and your men to stay here said he to guard this place tom price tells me you are a trusty fellow that understands his business and asks no questions which is well in this house are two fair maidens who when we leave will have no other protector but you and your men now then i bid you guard them close let no one in to them and see they go not out they are my captives and but for this cursed war i should not be leaving the charge of them thus to a stranger hold no talk with them and if they be riotous lock them fast in their chambers so soon as i have shown myself to the deputy lord i shall return or i may send you word to bring the maids to me remember handsoff and if you serve me well in this i may perchancefor they are both fair enough exclaimed i through my teeth and digging my fingers into the palms of my hands till the blood came i understand you captain depend on me thanks good fellow said he not heeding my troubled voice we shall meet again soon and by the way see specially that a certain harebrained poetic fool and a swaggering bully his companion come not near the place if you catch them you will do well to hang them on the gate heaven knows they have marred sport enough and now farewell your hand on this i gave him such a grip that he wellnigh danced with pain and let him go i was in a state of wild tumult within those very walls then unconscious of all that came and went lay the two sweet maids for whose sake i have travelled thus far from london and this fool of a villain was even now leaving me to guard them while he deferring his crime for a more convenient season went to show himself to my lord deputy twas more like a dream of good fortune than real fact and i dreaded every moment to find myself awake with all my hopes vanished but no the captain and his men went to horse and presently the order was given to march out farewell cried he to me as he rode forth be trusty and vigilant draw up the gate after we be gone for there be rogues in plenty about we shall meet again meanwhile when you see my angel tell her i left in tears breathing her name ha ha and he spurred off gaily i stood stockstill i know not how long till the sound of the hoofs had clattered away into silence and the voices were lost in the gentle moaning of the nightwind among the trees then i turned and glanced up at the house all was dark not a light flickered nor was there aught to show behind which of these windows slumbered my sweet jeannette or her fair mistress sleep on for tonight dear hearts said i tomorrow by this time ye shall be safe for ever from the talons of yon cursed hawk then bidding my men draw up the gate and dispose themselves for the night i took up my post by the door and waited patiently for the morning my men were soon snoring for we had travelled hard and long but sleep was never further from my eyes as i sat there listening to the rising wind in the trees and the rush of the river below with now and again the wail of a seabird crying out seaward i grew to hate the darkness despite the fair innocents who slumbered within and the sturdy rogues who slept without the loneliness of the place took hold upon me and made me uneasy and anxious once i thought i heard returning footsteps without and rushed to the gate but it was only a creaking of the trees another time i seemed to hear a calling from within and sprang wildly to the door but it was only a hootowl and when the leaves tapped on the window above i looked up expecting a face to appear there and when a horse in the stable whinnied i imagined it the mocking laughter of a troop of traitors left behind to rob me of my trust at length i grew so restless and weary of waiting that i determined to delay no longer but enter the house as i stood a moment at the door hesitating the wind suddenly dropped and there fell a silence on the place which made me shudder and tempted me after all to await the dawn but with a mighty effort i gathered up my courage and laughing at my qualms pushed the door it was not even shut to so that giving way unexpectedly under my hand i stumbled heavily into the hall as i did so i struck my face against something icy cold in the darkness i could see nothing but i felt the thing swing away from my touch and before i could step back or put out my hand it returned and struck me once more harder than before i clutched at it wildly then with a gasp of horror flung it from me and rushed shouting to my men into the open air for what had touched my face was the hand of a dead man it seemed an age before amongst us all we could strike light enough to kindle a torch then shuddering in every limb i returned to the house there just within the open door from a beam in the hall roof hung a corpse still swinging slowly to and fro and when i held up the torch to look at his face there leered down upon me the eyes of my old fellow prentice peter stoupe at the sight the torch fell from my hands and i reeled back into my comrades arms stark and cold wellnigh as the corpse itself then there came upon me with a rush an inkling of what all this meant i seized the light again and dashed past the hall and up the staircase every room was still and empty as death we searched every nook and corner and called aloud till the place rang with our shouts the only occupant of turlogh luinech oneills house was that lonely corpse swinging in the hall now all the truth dawned upon me as if i had read it in a book peter little as i dreamed it had both known me and guessed my errand he had overheard enough to know where the captain was and how he might revenge himself on me he had contrived to slip away at knockfergus and being better guided than we had reached castleroe in time to warn the villain of my coming whether he lent his hand to the carrying off of the two maids twas hard to say but it seemed plain that at the first warning they had been carried off and that the captain that night had ridden away not to leave them behind but to make good his possession of them elsewhere why peter should be left hanging thus twas not hard to guess he never played straight even in villainy and doubtless had given the captain reason to desire the shortest way to be rid of him as for me thanks to peter the villain had known me through my disguise and god knows he had had his revenge on me this night while i speculated thus i wandered to and fro in the house like a man distraught till presently my footsteps brought me back to a little chamber at the end of the long passage into which i had scarce dared peep before the dawn had already begun to chase the night away and was flooding the room with a flush of light that suited its sacredness better than my flaring torch so i left that without and entered in the twilight all was in the sweet confusion of a chamber whose owner expects to return to it anon the bed had not been disturbed since it was last settled raiment lay scattered here and there on the table lay a book open and beside it a jewel what moved me most was a little scarf which lay for a coverlet over the pillow on the bed for it was the selfsame scarf i had once seen ludar fasten round the maidens neck that night she took the helm beside him on board the misericorde i durst touch nothing i saw yet that single glance roused fires within me which if it be a sin to hate ones enemy will assuredly stand to my hurt in the day of reckoning yet how could mortal man stand thus and not be stirred i passed on softly into the tiny chamber beyond there the air was fragrant with the scent of a sprig of honeysuckle that lay yet unwithered in the window on the floor lay scattered a few papers written in a notable poetic hand and addressedas i could not but readto one who bade the poet give oer his singing or to the fair moon handmaiden to the glorious sun or in such wise on a chair was another paper half written and beside it a pen humphrey it said in jeannettes loved handhumphrey come over and help here the pen had hastily ceased its work this mute appeal lying thus to greet me roused the whole man in every pulse of my body i seized the dear paper in my hands and kissed it and then placing both it and the maidens scarf in my bosom i dashed from the room with drawn sword and called my men to horse to horse i cried and ride as you never rode before men for i vow to heaven i will not quit this saddle till i find the foul dog who has robbed me of my dearest jewel they obeyed quickly and cheerily for the horror of that night had given them enough and to spare of castleroe a mile through the forest road was a woodmans hut whose master looked out curiously to see us pass it seemed to me worth while being the first man we had met to question him so i ordered a halt you are an oneill said i who told you so growled he in irish and i guessed from the look of him that he was the man i wanted i signalled to two of my men to dismount and seize him now said i fumbling my pistol time presses tell me which way the oneill has gone how do i know said he i cocked my pistol and laid it across my saddle he went to dublin a month since said the fellow quickly and the english captain he growled a curse and said he passed here last night for tyrones country and the lady rose oneill and her maid who carried them off and when he paused and looked doggedly at me i raised my pistol and laid it at his head two days since they rode hence under escort of three of the captains men and whither went they the captain knows follow him and you shall find them look you here said i if what you say be true you shall have your life if not im no liar said he and i curse the english then said i help me and my men to save your chiefs daughter and slay yonder captain he pricked up his ears at that tis too late i doubt said he the villain works quickly twere better to find the maids dead it took him not many hours to rob this house of all its light tis not too late so long as a breath is in this body said i come take us to him as you are a loyal clansman i know no more than i have told you answered he he is gone to tyrones country and the maids have been carried thither before him i will guide you so far without more words he came springing at our sides over the heather and along the mountain paths at a pace that put our nags to shame twas easy to follow the tracks of the soldiers on the wet ground and once towards evening as we mounted a tall ridge i fancied i could descry on the crest opposite some figures that moved at our first haltingplace where we paused but to give our horses and ourselves a hasty meal we heard that about midday certain english soldiers had passed the place at full gallop and two days back as night fell some travellers amongst whom rode two women had likewise hurried by westward with news such as this we could scarce afford our weary horses the rest they needed before we set forth again our guide led us down a steep track into the valley and then striking straight across we toiled up the mountain path which ascended the high ridge opposite he checked our pace as we neared the top advising us to await daylight for the descent when at length at our backs rose the glorious sun over the eastern hills flashing his light past us into the valley below we saw stretched out a great plain like a map through which the windings of a river sparkled while beyond rose another ridge of hills higher still than that on which we stood our guide beckoned us to a place whence we could lookout without being exposed to the view of any one in the valley for awhile we searched the plain in vain only a few herds drove their cattle afield and now and then the sharp bark of a dog broke the stillness at length on the slope of the hill opposite we saw a flock of sheep break suddenly into panic flight and there appeared crawling up the ascent a body of horsemen who by the occasional glancing of the sun upon steel we knew to be soldiers whether they were the troops we sought and whether amongst them they carried the captive maidens twas too far to determine but at sight of them we plunged with new hope towards the valley halfway down in a wood we found a wounded trooper prone on the ground and gasping for breath while beside him grazed his horse he was bleeding from his side and too faint to turn his head as we came up our guide started as he saw him and whispered this is one of merrimans men i knelt beside him and tried in my clumsy way to bind his wound and help him back to life but twas plain we were all too late for that he lay gasping in my arms his eyes already glazed looking vacantly skyward and his arms feebly tossing in his battle for breath twas no time for questions i ventured but one where is oneills daughter i asked in his ear he turned his head and stopped his panting for a moment i could not save her he gasped merrim and here he fell back in my arms a dead man we covered him hastily with the fallen leaves and taking his horse for our guides use spurred grimly on there was no doubt now the villains plot had succeeded only too well and the fair innocents were already delivered over to his clutches at a little cluster of houses in the valley we halted a moment longer has a troop passed this way asked our guide of a cowherd surely said he they will scarce be over the hill by now carried they two women in their company he laughed and said no have not two women been carried this way lately ill be hanged if there was a sign of a woman said he we looked blank at one another the fellow seemed to speak true yet his story agreed not with that of the dying man there was naught but to spur on and by all means come level with the villain wherever he was as we commenced the steep ascent we could discern the moving figures of horsemen on the skyline aboveas it seemed to us in two bands one of which suddenly disappeared on the other side while the other numbering some halfdozen men made southward along the ridge as we came higher we saw these last still there moving hurriedly to and fro as though seeking what they found not it could hardly be us they looked for for their faces were set southward nor was it till we came within a mile of where they stood that they turned and suddenly perceived us then they too vanished below the skyline and we lost them by the time we reached the ridge top the first party was clattering far down the plain raising a cloud of dust at their heels and as it seemed pushing on with all speed to their journeys end of the other party for a while we saw nothing till presently our guide pointed to them as they stole from out a wood below us and suddenly broke into a canter in a southward direction it seemed to us their desire was by doubling on their track to regain once more the ridge on which we had first discovered them whereupon smelling mischief i called to my men and turning after them gave chase twas a fools errand for whatever their purpose had been they abandoned it and halfanhour later we spied them striking westward once more as in haste to overtake their fellows so near upon them were we by this time that not only could we count their number which was seven but could spy the feather on their leaders hat by which i knew for certain that this was indeed the man i sought for an hour and more we followed close on his heels sighting him now missing him now and neither nearer nor further for all our riding at last towards afternoon when after swimming a strong river and skirting a town we already stood as our guide told us in tyrones country we could see the party suddenly halt and hold a hurried parley the result was that while the leader rode on his six men stood and spreading themselves across the road waited for us twas a spot not ill chosen for standing at bay for on either side of the steep track the land fell away in desolate bog on which we scarce dare venture so that there was nought to do but either fall back ourselves or come face to face with those who stood in the way men said i for me there is but one goal and that is yonder flying villain i keep my sword for him look you well to the others they must not hinder me and before the lurkers had time to prepare for our coming we charged in upon them full tilt and i slashing right and left cut my way to the far side while those who followed me held them there in handtohand fight how that battle betwixt englishmen and englishmen sped i know not for before it was at an end i was a mile on the road with my prey little farther beyond yet to my woe i perceived him to be better mounted than i and better acquainted with the roads so that every hour the distance betwixt us widened till at last when night fell i could see him disappear with a defiant wave of his hand over a hill wellnigh a league ahead i know not how my wearied horse ever carried me that night but when at sunrise i staggered into the yard of a wayside farm he sunk deadbeat beneath me therefore my vaunted boast not to quit my saddle till i had met my man went the way of other boasts and came to the ground too the lad who came out of the barn to meet me told me that an hour since a soldier had gone through at a hands pace bound for the coast where already it was said the spaniard had landed and was devouring the land like locusts of women either today or for many a day he had seen or heard nothing my faithful beast was too feeble even after a halt to carry me farther and i had perforce to proceed on foot my one hope was that ere long the captain might find himself in a like plight but that was not to be for many an hour yet towards night the wind which had been blowing in gusts over the hill tops and along the valleys gathered into a gale and in it i could hear the distant boom of surf on an ironbound coast ever and again i met country folk hurrying inland with now and then a soldier in their company and once as i passed a lonely moor there slunk past me a fellow who by his swarthy face and black flashing eyes i knew to be a spaniard as hour passed hour through the night the storm raged fiercer till presently i could scarce make head against it and sank for an hour on the turf praying only that this weariness might befall mine enemy also when at dawn i struggled to the hilltop and looked out i dreaded to find him vanished but no my prayer must surely have been answered for he staggered on scarce a mile ahead of me down towards the valley twas a narrow valley with a swampy tract below and rising again sharply to the hill opposite halfway along that hill through a narrow gap i standing on higher ground could catch a glimpse of the grey ocean beyond sending its white horses in on the land and moaning with a cry that mingled dismally with the rush of the wind surely our long journey was near its end now looking again towards the gap i perceivedwhat my enemy below must have missedthe form of a man who stood there motionless clear cut against the sky with his back on us as he gazed seaward he was too far off for me to see if he were a soldier or only a peasant yet i remember marking that he was great of stature and as he stood there with his hair floating in the wind he seemed some image of a giant god set there to stand sentinel and brood over the wild landscape then as the sun broke out from behind the sweeping clouds it flashed on a sword in his hand and i concluded this must be an english soldier placed there to keep the road inland against the invading spaniard twas a fine post of defence verily for looking round i perceived that the hills on every hand seemed to close in and stand like the walls of a basin with no outlet save the crest on which i stood on the one hand and a gap where he stood on the other while betwixt us stretched the moist plain across which the captain was even now spurring so intent had i been on the solitary sentinel and the strange form of this wild hollow that i had forgot for a moment my quest but i remembered it as the sun suddenly fell on the form of my enemy labouring heavily through the swamp below a sudden fierceness seized me as i flung myself forward in pursuit i shouted to him with all my might to stand and face me where he stood i can remember seeing the form of the soldier in the gap turn quickly and look my way next moment there rose below me a yell and i stood where i was like a man petrified for the captain having spurred his jaded steed some way into the bog reined up suddenly and tried to turn back the horses legs were already sunk to the knees and in his struggle to get clear plunged yet a yard or two farther towards the middle then he sank miserably on his side throwing his rider to the ground the man with a wild effort managed to fling himself on the flank of the fast sinking beast but twas a shortlived support with a yell that rings in my ears as i write he struggled again to his feet and tried to run but the bog held him and pulled him down inch by inchso quickly that before i could understand what was passing he was struggling waistdeep like a man swimming for his life next moment i saw his hands cast wildly upwards after that the bog lay mirky and silent with no record of the dead man that lay in its grip before i could fling off the awful spell that held me and rush to the place the man on the other side of the valley had uttered a cry and dashed in the same direction and as we stood thus parted by the fathomless depth of the dead mans grave we looked up and knew one another for this was ludar chapter thirty how the sun went down behind malin i think it was the sudden shock of this great discovery and naught else that arrested our feet in time and saved us from madly rushing on the doom of our lost enemy at such a time how could we think even of him of all my long fierce journeyings no part seemed half so long as the few minutes it took me to skirt round the fatal bog and reach the hand of my longlost friend humphrey said he presently after we had stood silent awhile i scarce knew thee how rose you from the dead the god who parted us hath brought us together again said i thanks be to him amen said he therefore while i lead you to the don the don cried i is he here then why not since the rata came ashore weeks ago on these coasts and are the spaniards all here too said i with my hand feeling round my belt for my sword nay said he smiling that is my story tell me yours so i told him and he listened marvelling much his brow grew black as thunder when i came to speak of the lost maidens he wheeled round and laying his hand with a grip of iron on my arm pointed to the black bog below us is it certainly merriman who lies there as certain as this is you said i god forgive him said ludar and walked on then he told me how missing me after the battle and seeing the mast on which i had perched shot away he had mourned for me as dead and for my sake taken a gun with a goodwill against my queen how when after gravelines the south wind sprang up and the invincible armada began to run the rata sailed as rearguard and bore the brunt of the few english ships that dogged them how it was resolved by the spanish captains don alonzo himself not protesting that the shortest way back to spain now lay by way of the orkneys and the atlantic how thereupon that glorious fleet trailed in a long draggled line northward never looking behind them even when the englishmen one by one drew off and abandoned the chase how after a while when they looked out one morning they found the rata staggering through the stormy northern seas alone twas a sad sight said ludar you would not have known the queenly vessel we had met scarce a month before off ushant her mainmast clean gone her tackle dishevelled as a woodnymphs hair with flags and sails and pennons blown away guns rusted in their ports and the very helm refusing to turn the bells all save the dismal storm bell in the prows were silent the priests had crawled miserably to their holes no one read aloud the kings proclamation and even the gallants of spain sat limp and listless looking seaward never saying a word but to salute and cheer their beloved don or talk in whispers of the sunny hills of spain captain desmond the one man on board who after you was my friend had died in the fight off gravelines i had not the heart or the wish to seek new comrades and save when the brave don himself gave me a passing word of cheer i forgot what it was to speak or listen well when off cape wrath just as we sighted a few of our scattered consorts and hoped for food and comfort a new storm overtook us from the northeast and drove us headlong under bare poles southward again we none of us i think cared if the next gust sent us to the bottom many a weary young don did i see fling himself in despair overboard and but that we daily drew nearer to ireland i had been tempted to do the same how long we drove i forget or what wrecks we passed but one day we found ourselves flung into a great bay where for a while we held on to our anchors against the storm but the rata had lost her best thews and muscles at calais and after two days dragged towards the shore and fell miserably over a wreck we came to land in boats or on floating spars but only to meet worse hardships than on sea for the savages on the coast aided by your gallant englishmen fell on us defenceless as we were stripped us of all we had and drove us from the shore in an old crank of a galleon which if it carried us thus far did so only by the grace of god and his saints and where be we now i asked at killybegs said he and heaven grant we may get out of it for a while tyrone the oneill in these parts sheltered and fed us but since the english came he has left us to our fate and the men lie rotting here as in a dungeon why said i twas rumoured in england that the spaniards had descended on ireland to take it and so strike across it at the queen he laughed may your queen neer have sturdier foes humphrey come and see them as we turned the corner of the hill we came suddenly on three men standing with their faces seaward and engaged in earnest talk the oldest of them was whitehaired and slight of build but the nobleman shone through his ragged raiment and battered breastplate and i knew him in a moment to be don alonzo da leyva himself he greeted ludar kindly and looked enquiringly at me do the spirits of english printers walk on earth asked he no sir don not till their bodies be dead said i saluting i am here to warn your excellency that the english soldiers are drawing a cord around this place and will fall speedily upon you in force tis well they come only to slay and not to eat us said he with a grim smile and i perceived that both he and his companions were halfstarved yet they should not delay for if they haste not they will find us gone sir ludar the geronahere he pointed to a large galliass that lay at anchor in the bayis ready and sails tonight for the scotch coast i claim your services yet as you claim those of your squire ludar looked at me i knew what passed in his mind for twas in mine also how could we leave ireland thus on a desperate venture while those two fair maids but before we could even exchange our doubts there sprang out upon us from behind a rock halfadozen fellows with a horseman at their head who waved his sword and called loudly on us in the name of the queen to yield i groaned inwardly as i pulled out my sword once more i was about wickedly and grievously to wage war on her majesty and break my vows of allegiance yet how could i otherwise now the don deigned no reply but waited calmly for the attack we were but five to six and the two spaniards were so lean and illfed as scarce to count as a man betwixt them at the first onset one of them dropped dead and the other after scornfully running his adversary through fell back himself in a swoon of exhaustion meanwhile the don was struggling with the horseman i can remember occupied as i was with the sturdy rogue who flew at me how noble he looked as with head erect and visage calm he parried blow after blow stepping back slowly towards the rock twas a sharp fight while it lasted for though ludar made short work of his first man the other three were stubborn villains and being wellfed and wellarmed put us hard to it presently he on the horse enraged that for all his advantage he got no closer to his foe pulled out a pistol from his holster and levelled it full at the dons head with a shout like a lions ludar flung away his own assailant and rushed between the two dealing the horseman a blow which sent him headlong from his saddle and echoed among the rocks like a crack of thunder he was none too soon for the shot had flashed before ever the blow fell and only half diverted rattled on the dons breastplate hard enough to fell and draw blood though happily not hard enough to kill after that ludar and i had a merry time of it with our backs against the rock and four swords hacking at our two i know not how it was but as i found myself thus foot to foot again with my dearest friend listening to his short sharp battle snort and seeing ever and anon the flash of his trusty steel at my side i felt happy and could have wished the battle to last an hour i forgot all about my queen and but for sundry knocks and cuts had half forgotten my adversaries themselves nor were they any the better off for my daydream for the four swords against us presently became but two and these ere long were in the hands of flying men when we had leisure to look at one another and see how we stood we found we had been playing no childs play ludar was pale his sleeve was bloody and his sword broken in two as for me drops were trickling through my hair and down my cheek and i needed no astronomer to tell me the earth turned round but the don when we came to him was in a worse plight yet for he lay where he had fallen white as a marble statue his eyes closed his breath coming and going in quick short gasps as best we could we tore off his breastplate and looked to the wound beneath twas but a gash the ball having grazed the ribs and flattened itself on the steel beyond but the blood he had lost thereby and the feebleness of his illnourished body made it more dangerous a wound by far than our vulgar scratches we caught the englishmans riderless horse which grazed quietly near and laid the gallant gently on his back and so painfully and slowly brought him off even as we did so we could see on the crest of the far hills behind the figures of men on foot and horse moving our way and nearer at hand when we stood and halted a moment the sound of a trumpet broke the air there was no time to lose verily if these wornout dons were to leave the place alive and as for ludar and me wounded and weak as we were what chance was there for us to break through the lines and wander on foot in search of our lost ones humphrey said ludar guessing what was in my mind we sail with the don to scotland thence we will cross to the glynns and so be where we must be sooner than if we ventured by land so be it said i the sight of the wounded don completed the panic which had already set in among the spaniards at the report of the coming of the english to sea to sea they cried and followed us as we bore their beloved captain to the bay the gerona ludar told me had been found on the coast a half wreck some weeks since and by dint of great labour and patching had been made passably seaworthy she will carry but three out of every four of this company said he after the nobles are all on board there will be but place i hear for one hundred beside and these must work at the oars lots have already been drawn and unless i mistake twill be a hard parting betwixt those who go and those who stay so indeed it was no sooner had we the don safely on board and delivered him to the leech to whom he opened his eyes and showed signs of returning life than a strange turbulent scene ensued on shore the dons second in command fine gentleman as he was had little power to deal with a rabble that was fighting for dear life he drew up his men on the beach and bade no man stir for the boats till his name was called under penalty of death while the young nobles who of course were exempt from lot silently and anxiously took their places in the boats and were rowed out to the ship all stood gloomily by mute and obedient but when these being safely embarked the order was given for the hundred who had drawn the lot to follow a hubbub and tumult began which it was pitiful to witness men desperate with hunger and fear fought tooth and nail to reach the boats they that had the right and they that had none were mingled in a fray which strewed the waters edge with corpses some flung themselves into the sea after the boats yelling and cursing till the flash of a sword or the pitiless thud of an oar sent them back into silence some rather than others should go and not they tore the craft board from board and fought with the fragments some with muskets poured fire on the boats and some wreaked their vengeance on the haughty spanish gallant and hurled him from the rock on which he stood into the depths below twas a hideous scene and when after all was done sixty gasping souls scrambled on board glaring at one another like beasts of prey and hissing defiant taunts at the wretches on shore it boded illveryill for this voyage for a while neither ludar nor i was fit to take our seat on the thwarts or lend a hand with the oars much as help was needed for two days indeed the geronas sails were of little service owing to the perverse southwester which threatened to imprison us in the bay of killybegs and wellnigh defied every effort of the crew to bring the galley beyond the great headland of malinmore but once out in the open where the southwester would have favoured our course to scotland the wind veered to westward and drove us in perilously near the rocks so that we at the oars for by then ludar and i perforce had to take our share of the toil were kept hard at work and the roar of breakers on our starboard quarter never ceased day nor night the gerona moreover had been but indifferently patched and in the heavy sea across which she laboured answered her helm hardly and could by no means be counted upon to sail more than a point or two out of the wind so in this hard cross gale her canvas was all but useless and had it not been for the oars she would have been on the rocks about the bloody foreland before a week was out how we rounded that dreadful head i scarce know strong man as i was i was wellnigh dead with the endless toil of the rowing broken only by short snatches of repose when i laid my head down in the galleyslaves reeking hold ludar on the contrary grew mightier and bolder day by day he neither wearied nor lost heart but like a man who has recovered faith in his destiny he talked as if each stroke brought us nearer not to scotland but to the end of our hopes and the arms of those we loved courage humphrey said he i can row for you and me both save your heart brother for those who shall welcome you when all this tossing and toil shall be passed you talk of beyond the grave beyond the grave cried he i never talked less of it come are you too like these spanish gentles down in the mouth for a puff of wind and a pailful or two of salt water over the deck courage man if you be an englishman show these dons how an englishman can hold up his head and keep a stiff upper lip that brought up the courage in me and though for a day or so the weakness of my thews caused me to rest my hands idly on the oar while he lugged at it cheerily and mightily my heart came up from my boots and knocked louder and stronger within me day by day so after ten days out we came off the black headland called malin where as the wind still held westerly the welcome order was given to ship oars and spread all canvas for the scottish coast ludar alone looked grave when the order came and pointed to the furious livid swirl of purple clouds that crowded round the setting sun i have seen yon sky before said he often when i was a boy and they taught us when we saw it to pray the saints for those at sea may be there are saints ashore who see it and pray for us tonight said i there had need be said he solemnly chapter thirty one how we came into calm water after all ludars forecast was destined to a swift and sudden fulfilment the red glare was scarcely out of the west when the wind began to howl and whistle through our rigging with a presage of the tempest that was to come what was of worse omen still the long streamer on the mainmast which hitherto had spread due eastward now suddenly flapped to south east showing that the gale was coming upon us from the one quarter we had most cause to dread namely the northwest for as ludar well knew by this time unless we could keep the geronas head out so as to clear the far antrim headlands of bengore and benmore we ran the peril of being driven in on an ironbound shore which had short shrift and little mercy for such as fell upon it the danger soon became manifest to others beside ludar and once again the oars were ordered out and the ships head put across the wind ludar and i were among the party of cursing and mutinous rowers whose turn it was to be relieved and we were about to crawl below for a snatch of repose when a messenger came from don alonzo bidding ludar attend him come with me said ludar and we followed the man don alonzo who from the moment he could stand upright had resumed his post of command stood in his cabin pale and stern surrounded by his officers who by their uneasy study of the charts before them were plainly alive to the peril that threatened the ship sir ludar said he your presence on board is not without a fortunate meaning for us the account betwixt us runs high already i have no means to pay you but by demanding a further service at your hands you know this irish coast well i have sailed from malin head to cantire in an open galley many a time as a boy said ludar and you know specially the coast about your fathers castle and this great causeway of rocks near it said he pointing on the chart to dunluce and the jagged headlands beyond i know them every inch said ludar then said don alonzo i make a request of you sir ludar in the name of my master the king of spain tis more than enough said he ask me in your own name i owe you sir don more than i do the king of spain well then will you honour me and my company by taking the helm and if it be possible clearing us of the peril which this foul wind threatens i will do my best said he but i doubt the ships power to keep a course across the wind twill need more than one man at the tiller and by your leave i appoint my comrade here to assist me so be it said don alonzo and whatever befall we thank you sir ludar for this service thus honourably did ludar mcdonnell step where he deserved to a post of command on board this ship as for me twas glory enough to stand his second and so soon as i saw his hand on the helm all my doubts of our safe passage round the headlands and on to scotland were at an end not so his i have undertaken more than i can perform said he and the don knows it if this wind hold nothing can persuade this lobsided illtrimmed craft out of the bay away with sleep man and chain down the helm across the wind bid them put all their strength on the starboard oars an hour after that the gale broke in full fury from the northwest it must have caught us some two leagues north of malin head for as we drove down before it we could hear a thunder of breakers on our right which ludar pronounced to be the tor rocks off the island of instrahull tis a mercy to be past them anyhow said he but see for all our turning of the helm we are driving down the wind so indeed we were to our dismay the gerona sailed almost as far sideways as she did forward and had we not been well out to seaward to start with we might have been hard put to it even to clear the headlands of innishowen about midnight there was nothing for it but to order the sails to be let go and depend only on the oars for our course after that for a while we went better but the men wornout and dispirited pulled with but half a heart and hour by hour the vessel drifted in until it was clear that nothing but a shifting of the wind or standing to at anchor could keep us off the opposite rocks off innishowen as we crossed the mouth of the foyle river we fell on a shoal of terrible shallows which spun the gerona round like a top and washed her in raging foam from stem to stern go and tell the don he must either let go his anchors or double the men at the oars said ludar when presently we had staggered out again into blacker water word was given immediately to try the former and the only two anchors we had were let over for a moment or two as the ship swung round creaking in every joint it seemed as if she would ride out the gale thus but with a report like the crack of a gun first one then the other of her cables broke short at the gunwale and we knew we had only lost time and water in the attempt instantly the don called upon his nobles to volunteer for the oars gallantly they responded and occupied the after benches while all the slaves rowed forward then for an hour the gerona seemed to hold her own and reeled across the bay on an eastward course but presently even the lordlings of spain flagged and once again we drove in amid the thunder of surf on an ever nearing shore we should be near the bann mouth said i to think of the last time we heard that thunder together we are clear of that said ludar quietly tell the don his lordlings must work harder if we are to weather the next point i told the don as much hat in hand and once again the gentles gathered themselves together and made a course for the labouring ship ludar was breathing hard when i returned to his side that may put us past ramore said he in the bay beyond that lies dunluce if we be driven in there heaven help us indeed i would as soon perish there as anywhere else talk not of perishing fool while a hope remains bid the don cut away his poles forthwith they are worse than useless now so one after another the stately masts of the gerona went by the board and the ease their going gave us added to the fresh vigour of the rowers helped us as ludar foretold round the rough little head of ramore no sooner had we passed it than the wind and current together got hold of us again and swept us in betwixt the islands of the skerries and the mainland not even twice the number of rowers could have saved us then listen said ludar presently i listened and could hear ahead of me a thunder deeper and more awful than any we had yet passed what is it i asked my fathers castle said he we are going home with a vengeance now scarce a man remained at the oars we could hear shouts of praying and cursing intermingled as all hands crowded to the decks and gazed forward in the direction of that warning sound a lanthorn on the quarterdeck showed us the don standing there alone bareheaded in his steel breastplate and sword in hand quietly waiting the end beyond was a troubled crowd of doomed men counting the moments and straining their eyes into the darkness beside me on the poop ludar stood erect and noble with the half defiant halftriumphant gleam on his face as with hands still on the tiller he listened to the fatal music of his old home ahead in the darkness we could see nothing but the white waste of breakers on to which we were driving presently as we were almost upon them ludar grasped my arm and pointed high overhead there was a momentary gleam of light and with it a glimpse of a rugged battlement at the rocks edge dunluce dunluce he shouted and let swing the now useless tiller scarce a minute later the gerona was in her death agony among the lashing breakers for a moment or two she held up bravely then with a mighty swirl she reared upward and hung quivering an instant in suspense ludars hand and mine sought one another and as we waited thus we could see above us the noble form of don alonzo cool and impassive as a man on parade saluting his kings ensign for the last time then all i remember was a great yell from the slaves at the poop and the dull thunder of a broadside as the gerona fell crashing to her doom it was broad daylight when i opened my eyes and saw the sun struggling to break through the black clouds overhead the thunder of waves still dinned in my ear the salt wind was still on my lips while a sharp pain at my shoulder when i turned my head to look about me told me that i was at least alive the pain was so acute that i closed my eyes again and opened them not till i heard the sound of a harsh voice at my side what it said i know not but some one turned me over with his foot and brought from me a cry of agony which made him reel a pace or two back in consternation then just as i heard another voice in plain english say great god he lives all was dim again before my eyes once more the pain awaked me and i found myself lying i suppose on some stretcher being slowly borne on mens shoulders up a steep path i was too weak to do aught but groan and my groans my bearers heard not but at last the english voice said halt and set him down he may be dead already and so save us the pains of carrying him further twas a voice i knew but the agony of my setting down made me forget whose until once more bending over me and putting back the hair from my brow the fellow exclaimed why this ismercy on usif it be not him they called dexter what cried another voice doth neptunus yield us pearls and on these inhospitable shores doth arion indeed discover his lost prentice hath the hollander wings to carry a curse on thy tomfooling tongue said the other hath not the poor wretch had drenching enough that you must spout thus on the top of him say humphrey dexter how fare you is that you jack gedge sure enough and ludar the fellow gave a gasp but said nothing and in the horror of that silence i lost all care of life i must have been lying still in the same place when next with a strange thrill of wonder i lifted my eyes and saw bent over me the sweet face of my own jeannette humphrey whispered she as she kissed my wet brow is it indeed thou ay sweetheart said i and i forgot all else for a while presently they carried me up to the top of the path jeannette walking with her hand in mine and so till before us rose a grim portal which i knew well to be the gate of dunluce the sight of that familiar entry recalled to my mind the great burden on my heart jeannette said i as she bent beside me what of ludar we hope dear humphrey thine is not the only life saved from the wreck is he heard of and the maiden i asked i know not till you named him just now no one knew he was with you but now the soldier and the poet have gone to seek news and my dear mistress i think waits here she is here how come you both in dunluce i asked the old mcdonnell will not allow the maiden out of his sight so dearly he loves her said jeannette as soon as i was laid in a bed and my broken arm set by the castle leech i revived quickly and as i did so the load on my heart concerning ludar grew so heavy that not even the presence of jeannette could banish it i begged to see the maiden twas wonderful to see her as she came in stately and beautiful as ever betraying only in the pallor of her cheeks the terrible anguish that possessed her she came and kissed me like a sister and then laying her hand in jeannettes tears came to her eyes as she gave us joy of our happy meeting after so much peril maiden said i we know no happiness while you stand thus desolate but ludar lives as sure as i lie here you shall find him and we shall all thank heaven together her face brightened you have said as much before said she and it has come to pass yes i will hope still but her voice fell sadly with the words and her face turned to the window seaward then she bade me tell her what had passed since we parted in london and how ludar and i came on the gerona and hearing of all the chances that had befallen us i think she took a little hope that all this buffetting and peril was not assuredly to end in loss but she said nothing only she kept her hand in jeannettes and when i told her of the horrible scene on the bog by killybegs she shuddered and muttered what i fear was a prayer for the soul of a dead man but how come you in dunluce i asked again presently twas jeannette who answered me tis easily told dear humphrey after sir turlogh departed for dublin leaving us in charge of thishere she shiveredthis captain merriman my mistress and i kept our chambers and durst not so much as venture beyond the door our good protectorsheaven reward themhad been banished the place and but for a few of the oneills men who stood in the way we had not been safe where we were for a day at last one day there came suddenly a messenger purporting to be from the oneill bidding the captain send his daughter to him under an escort to dublin on this the captain rudely broke into our chambers and bade us there and then set out what could two weak maids do we could read treachery in his wicked eye yet naught we could say or pretend could put him off and there and then without time so much as to speak a word to one another we were marched forth like prisoners and mounted on our steeds just as we set forth he came up to the leader of our party and said in a whisper i could overhear rememberthe mistress to the house by the wood and the little one to dublinand handsoff then all the villainy of the thing flashed on me in a moment mistress cried i we are betrayed but before the words were out a rough hand was laid across my mouth and we were galloping nay humphrey said she laying her hand gently on mine if thou start and toss like this tis a sign my story doeth thee harm and i will cease would you have me lie still and hear all this cried i in a fever yes dear heart said she and that so sweetly that i was forced to obey we were galloping away from castleroe for a whole day we galloped till we were faint and ready to drop then as we came to a wood which i guessed to be the place where my mistress and i were to be parted our leader suddenly reined in and turned to give an order to the man who held me as he did so four men sprang out from among the trees and a horrible fight ensued in the midst of it one of the newcomers advanced to me and said you are safe and i knew it to be no other than the soldier gedge himself and he who came to my side put in the maiden smiling amid her heaviness said let diana shake off her clouds apollo himself hath come to lead her out into the empyrean god reward them both for this said i amen said jeannette two of the villains they slew and the other staggered away as i fear mortally wounded twas him you saw as for us our rescuers brought us here where the mcdonnell hath welcomed us and as you know loveth my mistress as his own daughter yet little thought we as we looked out from the turret window at the storm last night and prayed side by side for those at sea that you andand sir ludar were coming to us on the wild waves the day wore on and still neither soldier nor poet nor any news came to comfort us then i demanded to be taken to sorley boy mcdonnell and the maiden led my tottering steps to the great hall there sat the old man bare headed and motionless at the head of the empty table with his sword laid out before him is my son come demanded he as we entered not yet dear sire said the maiden going to him he is not far away sir said i of that i am sure i know that said the old chief half angrily the banshee has been dumb since alexander mcdonnell fell why comes not ludar i grow impatient even as he spoke there came a knocking on the door and a scot entered hastily he brought news that in a hut a mile eastward of the castle a man had been found who had been brought up from the shore dead and that further east still the bodies of here sorley boy smote his fist on the table and ordered the fellow to hold his peace i want no news of the dead said he wrathfully but of the living where is my son ludar the man slunk off chapfallen the maiden knelt beside the old mans chair and laid her white cheek on his rough sleeve jeannette drew me gently to a bench at the far corner of the hall and bade me rest there beside her thus while the afternoon slowly wore into evening and the storm without moaned itself to sleep we sat there in silence about sundown just asdespite the sweet presence at my sidei was growing drowsy with weariness and pain sorley boy suddenly uttered an exclamation and rose to his feet the maiden rose too and as she stood motionless but for the heaving of her bosom the slanting rays of the sun caught her and kindled her face into a wondrous glow jeannettes gentle hand restrained me as the old man taking a step or two down the room as far as the end of the table stood there facing the door then there fell on my ears a voice and the ring of a footstep in the courtyard without next moment the door swung open and ludar walked quietly in jeannette led me softly from the place and kept me cruelly pacing in the outer darkness for halfanhour before she said art thou not going in to welcome thy friend humphrey need i say what passed when at last we stood all four together in that great hall the old chief had taken his seat again at the table and sat there solemn and impassive as if all that had passed had been but the ordinary event of an afternoon but the fire in his eye betrayed him as now and again he half turned his head to the window where ludar and the maiden stood gazing out across the waves humphrey my brother said ludar when at last jeannette and i drew near tis worth a little storm to be thus in port at last and to find you there too ay indeed said i and as you see there are more than i here to greet you then he stepped up to jeannette and gazed in her face a moment and kissed her on the brow thou art welcome to dunluce sister jeannette said he jeannette told me afterwards that she never felt so proud in her life as when ludars lips touched her forehead and she heard him call her sister twas not in me to complain that it should be so for the ways of women are beyond my understanding presently the old man rose from his seat and without a word left us to ourselves ludar then narrated how when the gerona broke up he had fallen near a broken oar which held him up and enabled him to reach land almost without a bruise for a long while he lay in the darkness not knowing where he was but when day broke he found himself in the deep cave that goes under the castle a prisoner there by the rising tide and with no means of escape for to stem the waves at the mouth was hopeless and by no manner of shouting and calling could he make his presence known to anyone outside so all day faint with hunger he had perched on a ledge just beyond reach of the tide and not till evening when the wind and with it the water subsided was he able to swim out and come to land at the foot of the very path up which long months ago he had led the party who recovered dunluce for the mcdonnells his story was scarce ended when a cheering without called us to the courtyard where the news of the return of sir ludar had gathered the mcdonnells eager with shouts and music to welcome him but ludar would by no means go out till his father arrived to command it then it did us who loved him good to see him stand there with the maidens hand in his receiving the homage of his clansmen while thus we stood there was an uproar at the gate as two men fought their way through the throng and approached us jove and the muses grant their beloved son a soul to celebrate so notable a festival in the strains which it deserves cried the poet shaking all over with emotion and his eyes dim with tears achilles hath his briseis odysseus his lost penelope and all four have to their hand an orpheus woes me without his eurydice to chant their fortunes oh my noble son of a wolf and thou my hollander how i rejoice to see you and to hand to your arms the nymphs of whom one day perhaps it shall be accounted to their honour that they were nourished on the dews of parnassus by the muses most unworthy disciple a nice dry nurse you be said jack gedge tis a mercy the fair ladies have their eardrums sound after halfayear of your noisy buzzing in them sir ludar by your leave captain you hold in your hand what you gave me in charge to keep for you so i owe you nought but my farewell nay said ludar by heaven we are all debtors to you both and shall compel you to own it and since you both and my comrade here be englishmen let me tell you that for your sakes i shall salute your queens ensign when i next see it that night the poet related to me with much embellishment and flourish all that had passed since the maids left london most of which i already knew yet was not loth to hear again from his lips thank me no thanks my hollander said he when once more i blessed him for the service he had done the poets glory cometh not from earth i have while i waited here written an excellent and notable epic on the wars of the illustrious house of the mcdonnells the which i will even now rehearse thee for thy delectation and when once more thou art returned to thy press i reserve for thee the glory of imprinting three noble copies of the same on paper of vellum to be bound after the manner of the venetians in white with clasps of gold to be given one to my lord sorley boy one to sir ludar and one to thee for thy private and particular delectation again i thanked him and begged he would reserve the reading till to morrow when i should be more wakeful to which marvelling much at my patience he agreed as for me said he naught falleth ill to the favourites of the immortals i owe no grudge to the day i took thee into my protection as a printer count on me as thy patron as a man call me thy friend and if some day at thy frugal fireside for the which thou art already provided with the chiefest ornament thou shouldst have a spare chair and platter i will even deign to fill the one and empty the other now and again in memory of this our time of fellowship therefore count on me my hollander and so goodnight there is little more to be told of the crew of the doomed gerona the tide washed some hundreds before many weeks were past into a bay near the causeway headlands east of dunluce amongst them ludar and i discovered the body of don alonzo calm and gentle in death and buried him with what honour we could in holy ground near the tomb of the mcdonnells a few cannon and guns we helped haul up and set on the walls of dunluce where they are to this day much to the wrath of my lord deputy and his english councillors jack gedge remains body servant to sir ludar mcdonnell where if his trust be not so great as it was now that his master and mistress are one he is none the less faithful or joyous in his service as for the poet he was true to his promise of visiting jeannette and me at our frugal fireside but this was not for many years after the promise was given as soon as my arm was healed and i could persuade ludar to release me i returned to london to find the house without temple bar still empty and master walgraves name still a caution to evildoers despairing of seeing me and his type from rochelle he had sold himself to those firebrands masters udal and penry and by means of his secret press had given utterance to certain scandalous and seditious libels on the bishops and clergy of the church known by the name of marprelate his books a merry chase he gave the beadle and pursuivants all over the country dropping libels wherever he went till at last he suddenly vanished and left them to whistle for jeannettes sake as well as my own i wandered far for news of him and heard of him at last from mistress crane as having fled to rochelle with all his family thither i wrote him of my welfare and had a letter back bidding me if i was still minded to serve him meet him in edinburgh thither then i took sail and presently found him and should you meet with any books imprinted by robert walgrave printer to the kings most excellent majesty in edinburgh know that the hand that set them in type was the same which now writes this true history in due season mistress walgrave and the little ones came northward too and one glad day i wandered to the western coast and there met ludar and his fair bride and with them my own sweet jeannette from whom i never parted more ere this happy meeting took place sorley boy mcdonnell had ended his stormy days and was gathered to his fathers and sir james mcdonnell his son became lord of dunluce ludar dwelt quietly on his lands in cantire refusing allegiance to any crowned monarch but loyal to the end to his wife his clan his comrade and to the memory of those perils and chances which had made him and me brothers the end
