rose comes frontispiece page there were shrieks from the women and some of the men amongst them myself hurried towards the staircase dont be a fool i answered theres a submerged rock right across here there seemed to be an almost universal gasp of astonishment the seven conundrums introduction the compact the wind storming up from the sea beat against the frail little wooden building till every rafter creaked and groaned the canvas sides flapped and strained madly at the imprisoning ropes those hanging lamps which were not already extinguished swung in perilous arcs in the auditorium of the frail little temporary theatre only one man lingered near the entrance and he as we well knew with sinister purpose in the little makeup room behind the stage we three performers shorn of our mummers disguise presented perhaps the most melancholy spectacle of all the worst of it was that leonard and i were all broken up with trying to make the best of the situation for roses sake yet prevented by circumstances from altogether ignoring it seems to me were in rather a tightish corner leonard i ventured watching that grim figure in the doorway through a hole in the curtain first turn to the left off queer street leonard admitted gloomily rose said nothing she was seated in the one chair which went with the portable property and her head had fallen forward upon her arms which were stretched upon the deal table her hat a poor little woollen tamoshanter was pushed back from her head her jacket was unfastened the rain beat down upon the tin roof id sell my soul for a whisky and soda leonard our erstwhile humourist declared wistfully and i mine i echoed thinking of rose for a good supper a warm fire and a comfortable bed and i mine rose faltered looking up and dabbing at her eyes with a morsel of handkerchief for a cigarette there was a clap of thunder the flap of canvas which led to the back of the stage shook as though the whole place were coming down we looked up apprehensively and found that we were no longer alone a cleanshaven man of medium height dressed in a long mackintosh and carrying a tweed cap in his hand had succeeded in effecting a difficult entrance his appearance even at that time puzzled us his face was perfectly smooth he was inclined to be bald his eyes were unusually bright and there was a noticeable curve at the corners of his lips which might have meant either humour or malevolence we had no idea what to make of him one thing was certain howeverhe was not the man an interview with whom we were dreading mephistopheles himself could scarcely have made a more opportune entrance he remarked as the crash of thunder subsided into a distant mutter permit me he crossed towards us with a courteous little bow and extended a gold cigarette case amply filled rose took one without hesitation and lit it we also helped ourselves the newcomer replaced the case in his pocket i will take the liberty he continued of introducing myself my name is richard thomson a very excellent name leonard murmured a more than excellent cigarette i echoed you are the gentleman who sat in the threeshilling seats rose remarked looking at him curiously mr richard thomson bowed i was there last night and the night before he acknowledged on each occasion i found with regret that i was alone no one likes to be reminded of failure i answered a little hastily you have established your position sir as a patron of our illomened enterprise may i ask to what we are indebted for the honour of this visit in the first place to invite you all to supper was the brisk reply secondly to ask if i can be of any service in helping you to get rid of that bearded rascal drummond whom i see hanging about at the entrance and in the third placebut i think he added after a queer and oddly prolonged pause that we might leave that till afterwards i stared at him like a booby for i was never a believer in miracles the quiver on roses lips was almost pathetic for like all sweetnatured women she was an optimist to the last degree leonard i could see shared my incredulity the thing didnt seem possible for although he was obviously a man of means and although his manner was convincing and there was a smile upon his lips mr richard thomson did not look in the least like a philanthropist come come the latter continued mine is a serious offer are you afraid that i shall need payment for my help and hospitality what more could you have to give than the souls you proffered so freely as i came in you can have mine leonard assured him hastily mine also is at your service i told him the only trouble seems to be to reduce it to a negotiable medium we will make that a subject of discussion later on our new friend declared mr lister he added turning to me may i take it for granted that you are the business head of this enterprise how do you stand i choked down the pitiful remnants of my pride and answered him frankly we are in the worst plight three human beings could possibly find themselves in weve played here for six nights and we havent taken enough money to pay for the lighting we owe the bill at our lodgings we havent a scrap of food a scrap of drink a scrap of tobacco a scrap of credit weve nothing to pawn and drummond outside wants four pounds that settles it our visitor declared curtly follow me we obeyed him dumbly it is my belief that we should have obeyed any one helplessly at that moment whether they had ordered us to set fire to the place or to stand on our heads we saw drummond go off into the darkness gripping in his hand unexpected money and followed our guide across the windy space which led to the brilliantly lit front of the grand hotel whose luxurious portals we passed for the first time we had a tangled impression of bowing servants an amiable lift man a short walk along a carpeted corridor a door thrown open a comfortable sitting room and a blazing fire a round table laid for four a sideboard set out with food and goldfoiled bottles of champagne a waiter bustled in after us and set down a tureen of smoking hot soup you neednt wait our host ordered taking off his mackintosh and straightening his black evening bow in the glass miss mindel allow me to take your jacket sit on this side of the table near the fire you there cotton and you opposite me lister we will just start the proceedings so he went on cutting the wires of a bottle of champagne and pouring out its contents a little soup first eh and then ill carve miss mindelgentlemenyour very good health i drink to our better acquaintance roses hand shook and i could see that she was on the verge of tears it is my belief that nothing but our hosts matteroffact manner saved her at that moment from a breakdown leonard and i too made our poor little efforts at unsentimental cheerfulness if this is hell the former declared eyeing the chickens hungrily im through with earth drink your wine rose i advised raising my own glass and remember the mummers philosophy rose wiped away the tears emptied her glass of champagne and smiled nothing in the world she declared fervently ever smelt or tasted so good as this soup the psychological effect of food wine warmth and tobacco upon three gently nurtured but halfstarved human beings became even more evident at a later stage in the evening its immediate manifestations however were little short of remarkable for my part i forgot entirely the agony of the last few weeks and realised once more with complacent optimism the adventurous possibilities of our vagabond life leonard with flushed cheeks a many times refilled glass and a big cigar in the corner of his mouth had without the slightest doubt completely forgotten the misery of having to try and be funny on an empty stomach to an insufficient audience with a little colour in her cheeks a smile once more upon her lips and a sparkle in her grey eyes rose was once more herself the most desirable and attractive young woman in the world as alas both leonard and i had discovered the only person who remained unmoved either by the bounty he was dispensing or by the wine and food of which he also partook was the giver of the feast sphinxlike at times almost saturnine looking his eyes taking frequent and restless note of us his mouth with its queer upward curve a constant puzzle he remained as mysterious a benefactor when the meal was finished as when he had made his ominous appearance behind the stage at the framework theatre he was an attentive although a silent host it was never apparent that his thoughts were elsewhere and i watching him more closely perhaps than the other two realised that most of the time he was living in a world of his own in which we three guests were very small puppets indeed cigars were lit chairs were drawn around the fire rose was installed on a superlatively comfortable couch with a box of cigarettes at her elbow and her favourite liqueur untasted for many weeks at her side let me try your wits our host proposed a little abruptly tell me your life history in as few words as possible mr lister tabloid form if you please clergymans son without a shilling in the family i replied straight from the varsity where i had meant to work hard for a degree to the army where after three and a half years of it i lost thistouching my empty left coat sleeve tried six months for a job without success heard of a chap who had made a concert party pay realised that my only gifts were a decent voice and some idea of dancing so had a shot at it myself mr cotton idle and dissolute son of a wine merchant at barnstaple who failed during the war leonard expounded drifted into this sort of thing because id made some small successes locally and didnt want to be a clerk miss mindel the girl shook her head i am quite alone in the world she said my mother taught music at torquay and she died quite suddenly i put my name down for a concert party and in a way i was very fortunate she added glancing sweetly at leonard and at me these two men have been so dear to me and i dont think its any ones fault that were such a failure the weathers been bad and people stay in their hotels and dance all the time now she held out a hand to each of us she knew perfectly well how we both felt and she treated us always just like that as though she understood and realised the compact which leonard and i had made so we sat linked together as it were while our host studied us thoughtfully appreciating without a doubt our air of somewhat nervous expectancy a fine sense of psychology guided him to the conviction that we were in a properly receptive state of mind the smile which had first puzzled us played once more upon his lips and now he said about those souls conundrum number one the stolen minute book rose always insisted that she was psychic and i have some faith myself in presentiments at any rate we both declared on that monday night before the curtain went up that something was going to happen leonard had no convictions of the sort himself but he was favourably disposed towards our attitude he put the matter succinctly here we are he pointed out sold to the devil body and soul and if the old boy doesnt make some use of us i shall begin to be afraid the whole things coming to an end five pounds a week and a reserve fund for costumes and posters suits me very nicely thank you i dont think you need worry i told him it doesnt seem reasonable to imagine that weve been sent to the slums of liverpool for nothing then there are those posters rose put in offering prizes to amateurs im quite certain theres some method in that besides she hesitated we both pressed her to go on youll think this silly but for the last three nights ive had a queer sort of feeling that mr thomson was somewhere in the audience i cant explain it i looked everywhere for him i even tried looking at the people one by one all down the rows i never saw any one in the least like him all the same i expected to hear his voice at any moment granted the old boys satanic connections leonard observed he may appear to us in any form brimstone and horns are clean out of date hell probably send his disembodied voice with instructions i strolled to the wings and had a look at the house although it still wanted a quarter of an hour before the performance was due to commence the hall was almost packed with people the audience as was natural considering the locality was a pretty tough lot it seemed to consist chiefly of stewards and sailors from the great liners which lay in the river near by with a sprinkling of operatives and some of the smaller shopkeepers the study of faces has always interested me and there were two which i picked out from the crowd during that brief survey and remembered one was the face of a youngish man dressed in the clothes of a labourer and seated in a dark corner of the room he was very pale almost consumptivelooking with a black beard which looked as though it had been recently grown and coal black hair his features were utterly unlike the features of his presumed class and there was a certain furtiveness about his expression which puzzled me a quietly dressed girl sat by his side whose face was even more in the shadow than his but it struck me that she had been crying and that for some reason or other there was a disagreement between her and the young man the other person whom i noticed was a stout middleaged man with curly black hair a rather yellow complexion of distinctly semitic appearance his hands were folded upon his waistcoat he was smoking with much obvious enjoyment a large cigar and his eyes were halfclosed as though he were enjoying a brief rest i put him down as a small shopkeeper for choice a seller of readymade garments who had had a long days work and was giving himself a treat on the strength of it at halfpast seven the hall was crammed and the curtain rang up we went through the first part of our programme with a reasonable amount of success leonard in particular getting two encores for one of his humorous songs at the beginning of the second part i came out upon the stage and made the little speech which our mysterious patrons wishes rendered necessary ladies and gentlemen i said i have much pleasure in announcing according to our posters outside that if there are any amateurs here willing to try their luck upon the stage either with a song or a dance we shall be very happy to provide them with music and any slight change of costume a prize of one pound will be given to the performer whose song meets with the greatest approval and a second prize of five shillings for the next most successful item i gagged on for a few more minutes trying to encourage those whom i thought likely aspirants amidst the laughter and cheers of the audience presently a showily dressed young woman threw aside a cheap fur cloak displaying a lowcut blue satin gown jumped nimbly on to the stage ignoring my outstretched hand and held out a roll of music to rose who came smilingly from the background ill try the old folks down wapping way dear she announced and dont you hurry me when the sloppy stuff comes i like to give em time for a snivel or two sit you down at the piano im that nervous i cant stand fussing about here they bent over the music together and i turned back to the audience there were only two others who showed any disposition to follow the example of the lady in blue satin one was the young man whom i had previously noticed and who had now risen to his feet it was obvious that the girl by his side was doing all she could to dissuade him from his purpose i could almost hear the sob in her throat as she tried to drag him back to his place i myself felt curiously indisposed to interfere but leonard who was standing by my side and who saw them for the first time imagining that a word of encouragement was all that was necessary concluded the business come along sir he called out you look as though you had a good tenor voice and nothing fetches em like it you let him come my dear and hell buy you a new hat with the money the young man shook himself free and stepped on to the platform obviously ill at ease at the cheer which his enterprise evoked he was followed to my surprise by the middleaged man whom i had previously noticed here mister was his greeting as he stepped on to the platform ill have a go at em sheeny patter and a clog dance eh you must find me some sort of a change the young man insisted hurriedly and ill tidy up a bit myself his rival observed well let the gal have first go i conducted them behind and showed the young man into the mens dressing room youll find an old dress suit of mine there i pointed out change as quickly as you can i dont fancy the young lady will hold them for long he nodded and drew me a little on one side his manner was distinctly uneasy and his clothes were shabbier even than they had seemed at a distance but his voice was the voice of a person of education pleasant notwithstanding a queer rather musical accent which at the moment was unfamiliar to me shall i be able to lock my things up he asked in an undertone no offence he went on hastily only i happen to be carrying something rather valuable about with me i handed him the key of the dressing room for which he thanked me how long will that screeching woman be he asked impatiently you can go on directly shes finished murdering this one i promised him i dont think theyll stand any more he nodded and i turned back towards where the other aspirant was standing in the shadow of the wings now what can i do for you sir i asked i dont think you need to change do you there was no immediate reply suddenly i felt a little shiver and i had hard work to keep back the exclamation from my lips i knew now that rose had been right it was a very wonderful disguise but our master had at last appeared he drew a little nearer to me even then although i knew that it was richard thomson i could see nothing but the jew shopkeeper i shall pretend to make some slight change behind that screen he said in a low tone come back here when youve taken him on the stage i may want you he disappeared behind a screen a few feet away and i stood there like a dazed man from the stage i could still hear the lusty contralto of the young lady candidate i heard her finish her song amidst moderate applause chiefly contributed by a little group of her supporters there was a brief pause the young lady obliged with an encore then the door of the mens dressing room opened was closed and locked the young man looking a little haggard but remarkably handsome came towards me clenching the key in his hand i was a fool to take this on he confided nervously you are sure my things will be all right in there i pointed to the key in his hand you have every assurance of it i told him he fidgeted about listening with obvious suffering to the girls raucous voice ever been in the profession i enquired never was the hasty reply whats your line tonight tenor your pianist will be able to do what i want ive heard her if you win the prize do you want a job i asked more for the sake of making conversation than from any real curiosity he shook his head ive other work on down at the docks thats of no consequence is it was the somewhat curt replythere shes finished thank heavens let me get this over i escorted him to the wings the young lady amidst a little volley of goodnatured chaff jumped off the stage and returned to her friends her successor crossed quickly towards rose who was still seated at the piano i slipped back behind the scenes mr richard thomson was examining the lock of the mens dressing room hes got the key i told him there was no reply then i saw that our patron held something in his hand made of steel which glittered in the light of an electric torch which he had just turned towards the keyhole a moment later the door was opened and he disappeared out on the stage rose was playing the first chords of a wellknown irish ballad then the young man began to sing and notwithstanding my state of excitement i found myself listening with something like awe the silence in the hall was of itself an extraordinary tribute to the singer shuffling of feet whispering and coughing had ceased i felt myself holding my own breath listening to those long sweet notes with their curious underlying surge of passion then i heard mr thomsons voice in my ear curt and brisk youve a telephone somewhere where is it in the passage i pointed out he disappeared and returned just as a roar of applause greeted the conclusion of the song the young man hurried in from the stage the jew shopkeeper was seated in the same chair with his hands in his pockets and a disconsolate expression upon his face outside the audience was literally yelling for an encore youll have to sing again i told him i dont want to he declared passionately i was a fool to come nonsense i protested for the uproar outside was becoming unbearable listen theyll have the place down if you dont i shant go on his rival competitor grumbled sombrely thrusting a cigar into his mouth and feeling in his pockets for a match youve queered my pitch all right theyre all irish down in this quarter youve fairly got em by the throat the young man stood still for a moment listening to the strange cries which came from the excited audience suddenly inspiration seemed to come to him his eyes flashed he turned away and strode out on to the stage almost with the air of a man possessed by some holy purpose i followed him to the wings and from there i had a wonderful view of all that happened during the next few minutes the young man stood in the middle of the stage waved his hand towards rose to intimate that he needed no music waited for a few more moments with halfclosed eyes and a strange smile upon his face and commenced to sing i realised then what inspiration meant he sang against his will carried away by an allconquering emotion sang in gaelic a strange rhythmic chant full of deep sweet notes but having in it something almost oriental in its lack of compass and superficial monotony again the silence was amazing only this time as the song went on several of the women began to sob and a dozen or more men in the audience stood up afterwards i knew what that song meant it was the hymn of revolution and every line was a curse from my place in the wings i was able to follow better perhaps than any one else in the room the events of the next sixty seconds i saw two policemen push their way along the stone passage past the box office and into the back of the hall led by a man in plain clothes a stalwart determinedlooking man with a look of the hunter in his face almost at the same moment the singer saw them his song appeared somehow to become suspended in the air ceased so abruptly that there seemed something inhuman in the breaking off of so wonderful a strain he stood gazing at the slowly approaching figures like a man stricken sick and paralysed with fear then without a word he left the stage pushed past me sprang for the dressing room and turning the key in the lock disappeared inside i followed him for a few yards and then hesitated behind i could hear the heavy slowly moving footsteps of the police making their way with difficulty through the crowd a slight altercation the stern voice of the detective in charge then facing me the young man emerged from the dressing room ghastly pale shaking the coat in which he had arrived distraught furious like a man who looks upon madness mr richard thomson leaned back in his chair his mouth open his whole attitude indicative of mingled curiosity and surprise what you break off for like that young man he demanded have you forgotten the words youve won the quid all right anyway ive been robbed the singer called out something has been stolen from the pocket of this coat you locked it up yourself i reminded him with a sudden sinking of the heart i dont care was the wild reply it was there and it is gone he flung the coat to the ground with a gesture of despair the advancing footsteps and voices were louder now the man in the plain clothes pushed his way through the wings beckoned the police to follow and pointed to the young man the games up mountjoy he said curtly we dont want any shooting here he added as he saw the flash of a revolver in the others hand ive half a dozen men outside besides these two the trapped man seemed in some measure to recover himself he half faced me and the revolver in his hand was a wicked looking instrument some one has been at my clothes he muttered his great black eyes glaring at me if i thought that it was you i was incapable of reply but i imagine that my obviously dazed condition satisfied him he turned from me towards where mr richard thomson was seated watching the proceedings with stupefied interest breathing heavily with excitement his mouth still a little open or you the young man added menacingly thomson held out his hands in front of his face you put that up mister he enjoined earnestly if youre in a bit of trouble with the cops you go through with it dont you get brandishing those things about ive known em go off sometimes the singers suspicions if ever he had any died away he tossed the revolver to the officer who had halted a few yards away better take me out the back away he advised therell be trouble if the crowd in front gets to know who i am the officer clinked a pair of handcuffs on his captives wrists with a sigh of satisfaction they moved off down the passage all the time there had been a queer sort of rumble of voices in front which might well have been a presage of the gathering storm i moved back to the wings just in time to see the torch thrown the girl who had been seated with the young man suddenly leaped upon a bench she snatched off her hat and veil as though afraid that they might impede her voice a coil of black hair hung down her back her face was as white as marble but the strength of her voice was wonderful it rang through the hall so that there could not have been a person there who did not hear it you cowards she shouted you have let him be taken before your eyes that was mountjoy who sang to youour liberator rescue him is there any one here from donegal never in my life have i looked upon such a scene the men came streaming like animals across the benches and chairs which they dashed on one side and destroyed as though they had been paper i was just in time to seize rose and draw her back to the farthest corner when the sea of human forms broke across the stage nobody took any notice of us they went for the back way into the street shouting strange cries brandishing sticks and clenched fists fighting even one another in their eagerness to be first until they were gone the tumult was too great for speech rose clung to my arm what does it mean maurice she asked breathlessly who is he i have no idea i answered but i can tell you one thing tonight has been our dbut talk plain english leonard begged remember we had to be on the stage all the time it means i explained that weve begun our little job as spokes in the wheel which our friend mr richard thomson is turning you remember the other competitor a man who never sang at all who looked like a jew fishmonger in his best clothes what about him rose demanded he was mr richard thomson i told her you and i leonard are simply mugs at making up it was the most wonderful disguise i ever saw in my life that accounts for it she declared with a little shiver he has been here before watching i told you that i felt him around without ever recognising him where is he now leonard asked abruptly we searched the place there was no sign of our patron just as mysteriously as he had come he had disappeared the young lady in blue satin came up and claimed her sovereign we went down into the auditorium and inspected the damage finally as we were on the point of leaving a smartly dressed page came in through the back door and handed me a note it was dated from the adelphi hotel and consisted only of a few lines mr richard thomson presents his compliments and will be glad to see miss mindel mr lister and mr cotton to supper tonight at eleventhirty history repeated itself when we presented ourselves at the adelphi hotel and enquired for mr richard thomson doors seemed to fly open before us a reception clerk himself hurried out with smiles and bows and conducted us to the lift we were ushered into a luxurious sitting room on the first floor and welcomed by our host whose carefully donned dinner clothes and generally wellcaredfor appearance revealed gifts which filled me with amazement this is a very pleasant meeting mr thomson declared as he placed us at the table and gave orders that the wine should be opened we met last on the east coast i remember i trust that you are finding business better business is wonderfully good i acknowledged we turned away money last week leonard announced there was something a little unreal about the feast which was presently served excellent though it was and i am quite sure that we three guests breathed a sigh of relief when at last the table was cleared and the waiter dismissed our host lit a cigar and leaned back in his high chair with the passing of that smile of hospitality from his lips his face seemed to have grown hard and unpropitious i trust he said slowly that you are all satisfied with our arrangement so far we are more than satisfied i assured him trying to infuse as much gratitude as i could into my tone i am thankful to say that we are able to put by a little every week too towards the capital which you advanced the new costumes songs and posters are bringing something of their own back mr thomson waved his hand that is a matter of no concern he pronounced have you anything further to say i looked at leonard and at rose we all three looked at our host i should like to know i asked bluntly how much of my soul was scotched by tonights little adventure mr thomson stretched out his hand for the evening paper which the waiter has just placed by his side i do not wish to encourage curiosity he remarked coldly our bargain renders any explanation on my part unnecessary you had better read aloud that item in the stop press news however it may allay your qualms if you are foolish enough to have any the sheet was wet from the press i held it under the light and read arrest of mountjoy the castle dermoy murderer denis mountjoy was arrested tonight at a music hall in watergate street a determined attempt was made at a rescue and a free fight took place outside the watergate street police station all the windows of which were broken with the arrest of mountjoy who will be charged with no less than five murders it is hoped that the whole conspiracy of which he was the head will be broken up it is known that he has in his possession the famous minute book of the revolutionary secret society which bore his name and numerous other arrests may be expected at any moment the chief constable has received a telephone message of congratulation from scotland yard i laid down the paper for the life of me i could not keep back the question which rose to my lips there was five hundred pounds reward for the arrest of mountjoy are you claiming it blood money mr thomson confessed with a queer smile is not in my line it was you who put the police on to mountjoy i persisted he made no direct reply he was stonily thoughtful for a moment i knew he continued presently i believe even the police knew that mountjoy was lying hidden somewhere within a quarter of a mile of watergate street how to draw him out of his hiding place was the problem i remembered his two failingsvanity and love of hearing that beautiful voice of his i pandered to them you laid a trap on behalf of the police then mr thomson knocked the ash from his cigar that might be considered the truth he admitted and the minute book concerning the minute book he replied i have nothing to say rose drew her chair a little nearer towards him the roseshaded electric light shone upon her fair hair her wonderful eyes her piquant face with its alluring smile she leaned forward towards our host and it seemed to me that the soft entreaty in her tone and the pleading of her eyes were irresistible mr thomson she said i am a woman and i am desperately insatiably curious i must knowplease tell mewhat are weyou and we three your confederates i suppose we are are we on the side of the police or the criminal the informer or do we come somewhere between i must adapt my conscience to our position mr thomson was unshaken he looked at rose just as though she had been an ordinary human being that he said may be put in the category of questions which you will be at liberty to ask me when our agreement comes to an end shall we call it conundrum number by the bye if it is any convenience to you to know your movements in advance i may tell you that you will open at bath next week conundrum number two what happened at bath i the thing which surprised me most about the unseen hand which seemed to be always with us was the way in which it disposed of the ladies orchestra in the crown hotel at bath i met the pianiste in the street while i was waiting for instructions and it was she who made the matter plain to me i suppose you have heard that we have finished at the crown for the present she asked i had been genuinely surprised to hear that this was the case and i told her so after a moments hesitation she unburdened herself of a secret please dont tell a soul she begged except miss mindel and mr cotton if you want to the fact of it is the most extraordinary thing is taking us away we have been offered without a word of explanation a hundred pounds between the four of us to go away for a month nonsense i exclaimed it is perfectly true she repeated a lawyer in the city brought the notes and an agreement absolutely refusing a single word of explanation we didnt worry very much i can tell you twentyfive pounds isnt picked up every day but i dont mind confessing that when i think about it i get so curious it makes me positively ill miss browns theory is that its one of these old cranks in the hotel with more money than he knows what to do with who hates music on the other hand the management has received no complaints and theres nothing to prevent another orchestra taking our place next monday i made my way to the lounge of the hotel where leonard rose and i had arranged to meet for afternoon tea we were having rather a quiet time having already performed for a week at the local music hall with some success and were now obeying instructions by staying on at our rooms and waiting for orders there were too many people about for me to impart the news to them at that moment so we fell to criticising the passersby an uninteresting crowd with one or two exceptions there was a large but not unwieldly man carefully dressed with a walruslike beard and moustache heavy eyebrows and a surly manner who was generally muttering to himself his name was grant he was reputed to be over eighty to be without a friend in the hotel and to growl at every one who spoke to him every afternoon at halfpast four he came in from a turn in his bath chair and stumped past the orchestra with his finger to his ear then there was a frail oliveskinned man tall and gaunt with wonderful black eyes escorted every day to the baths and brought back again by a manservant who looked like a cossack his name was kinlosti and he was reported to have been an official at the court of the late tsar and even to have accompanied him to siberia the third person who interested us because we all detested her was an enormously fat old lady with false teeth false grey ringlets a profusion of jewellery and a voice which leonard said reminded him of the hissing of a rattlesnake her name was mrs cotesham she was stone deaf and between her and mr grant there was a deadly feud they never spoke but if glances could kill both would have been in their coffins many times a day they both wanted the same chair in front of the fire they both struggled for the times after lunch they ordered their coffee at the same moment and whichever was served last bullied the waiter they provided plenty of amusement for lookerson and to the guests generally but i think that the management and certainly the waiters were prepared to welcome the day they left the hotel when the people had thinned out a little and there was no one in our immediate vicinity i told my two companions of the strange thing which had happened to the ladies orchestra it must have been mr grant rose declared i put my money on the old lady leonard decided but i knew that it was neither for even while they were speaking the hall porter who knew me by sight had brought me a typewritten note which he said had been left by hand i tore it open and read there was no address nor any signature neither was needed apply at office of crown hotel for permission to give entertainments commencing soon as possible i passed the note on to the others we neednt speculate any more about that hundred pounds i remarked there were no difficulties at the office the next afternoon at halfpast four we took the place of the departed orchestra the change was pleasantly received by the majority of the guests mr grant however while rose was still in the middle of her introductory pianoforte solo stumped out of the room with his hand to his ear and mrs cotesham deliberately turned her chair round and sat with her back to us on the other hand mr kinlosti passing through the hall leaning on his servants arm on his way from his bath caught sight of rose at the piano and lingered he whispered in his servants ear found a chair and a table and seated himself in a dark corner presently the latter brought him from upstairs a pot of specially prepared tea and some cigarettes he remained there throughout the whole of our performance his eyes fixed upon rosestrange uncanny eyes they were the corner he had chosen was close to where we were playing and the flavour of his russian cigarettes and highly scented tea attracted roses attention so that more than once she turned and looked at him for the first time i saw a very faint smile part his thin lips a conquest i whispered to rose as i bent over her chair to move some music she made a little grimace all the same she said id love some of his cigarettes that evening just before the time fixed for the commencement of our performance another typewritten note was put into my hand again unsigned and undated this is what i read it is my wish that if a person of the name of kinlosti should seek acquaintance with any of you he should be encouraged particularly impress this upon miss mindel i took leonard on one side leonard i said our souls are trash and what happens to us doesnt matter a damn but read this leonard read it and swore can you get into touch with thomson he asked only through the bankers address in london i replied where these typewritten notes drop from not a soul seems to know rose came up and read the message over our shoulders her view of the matter was different what fun she exclaimed perhaps i shall get some cigarettes you dont suppose we are going to allow this i asked hotly not for one moment leonard echoed she laughed softly you idiots she exclaimed do you think i cant take care of myself or dont you trust me you know that it isnt that i rejoined but neither leonard nor i are willing to see you made a catspaw of russians dont know how to treat women leonard put in she became serious but she remained very determined anyhow she said i know how to treat russians so please leave me alone remember that i too am under contract to mr mephistopheles thomson and although i love you both youre not my guardians that was the end of the matter so far as we were concerned when we commenced our performance kinlosti was established in the dark corner his coffee and a whole box of his inevitable cigarettes before him his dinner clothes were severe and unadorned but three wonderful black pearls shone dully in his shirt front the lounge was more than ordinarily full for our previous weeks performance in bath had brought us some popularity mr grant however again stumped out of the place muttering rudely to himself as he passed us and the old lady turned her back and tried by means of an ear trumpet to enter into conversation with any one who was unfortunate enough to be near these two were the only exceptions however the rest of the audience was unmistakably friendly leonard and i were to learn something that night of the subtlety of a womans ways no one who had been watching could have said that she deliberately encouraged this mysterious admirer on the other hand she returned his bold glances with something which i had never seen in her eyes before something indefinably provocative certainly with no shadow of rebuke her acceptance of his overt admiration was in itself a more significant thing than the frank smiles of a more easily accessible siren by the time i started off round with the plate for the usual silver collection i was in such a temper that i found it difficult to pause even for a moment as i reached his corner he laid a tenshilling note upon the little pile of silver and also placed an envelope there i saw with gathering anger that it contained something heavy and that it was addressed to miss mindel i have ventured he said in a very low and extraordinarily pleasant voice to offer for the young ladys acceptance in return for her delightful music a little souvenir from the country in which i have lived all my life miss mindel does not accept presents from strangers sir i said returning him the envelope he shrugged his shoulders slightly stretched out his hand for his jadeheaded stick and leaning heavily upon it crossed the floor towards the spot where rose was seated at the piano playing soft music notwithstanding his lameness his bow as he approached her would have done credit to a courtier may i be allowed he said to congratulate you upon your very delightful singing and playing it has given so much pleasure to an invalid whose life just now is very monotonous that i am venturing to ask your acceptance of this little trifle a souvenir from a great country now alas stricken to the earth rose opened the envelope and held in her hand a quaint ring in which was a black stone i leaned over her it was engraved with the royal arms of the romanoffs and at the top was a small n i thank you very much indeed she replied smiling up at him but i could not possibly accept so valuable a gift will you believe me he persisted that the ring has little if any intrinsic value it is an offering which an artist in a small way might at any time be permitted to present to such gifts as yours he passed on towards the lift with a little bow which included all of us and somehow or other the ring was on roses finger and whether we liked it or not she had accepted it after that we saw a great deal of mr kinlosti he was never obtrusive and yet he was persistent on the day following the presentation of the ring we somehow found ourselves lunching with him on the day after that we used his car and on the following day although both leonard and i protested he took rose out for a drive alone she came home sooner than we had expected and was a little silent for the rest of that day at supper time she took us into her confidence mr kinlosti she said told me a very strange story this afternoon parts of it were so horrible that it made me shiver it seems he was one of the few members of the household who accompanied nicholas to siberia he got away just before the final tragedy what was his excuse for leaving his master i asked a little coldly we were all three in the parlour of our lodging house and quite alone nevertheless rose lowered her voice as she answered me the tsar entrusted him with the knowledge of where a portion of the crown jewels were secreted he was to find them raise money and try and bribe the siberian guards he found the jewels all right but not until nicholas and the whole of his family had been assassinated what did he do with the jewels leonard asked he has not told me so in so many words but i believe that he has them here she replied he told me they were still in his possession and he held them in trust for the romanoffs the terrible part of the business for him is that he has been tracked all over europe by bolshevist agents who claim that the jewels belong to the russian state why did he tell you all this i enquired with growing suspicion rose shook her head perhaps to account for the fact that he seemed so nervous all the time she suggested he started whenever another motor car passed us and as long as we were in bath itself he watched the faces on the pavements as though all the time he were looking for some one he told me that when first he arrived here he suspected even the masseurs at the baths i still dont see why he was so confidential with you leonard grumbled he likes me she acknowledged with a demure smile in fact if he tells the truth he likes me very much dont look so black please she went on with a glance at our faces remember i am only obeying orders that phrase cost us a good deal of uneasiness during the next few days whenever we performed kinlosti sat in his corner watching and listening in the intervals he came and made timid and courteous conversation without going so far as to say that he pursued rose he certainly took up a great deal of her time on the fourth afternoon i received another typewritten note handed to me again from the porters office without any intimation as to its source there was only a line or two miss mindel should show some curiosity as to the crown jewels mr kinlosti would probably like to show them to her within half an hour rose made her request both leonard and i were within a few yards and we saw the sudden terror in his face heard his almost hysterical refusal no one has ever seen them he told rose since they first came into my possession i do not dare even to look at them myself directly my rheumatism permits me to move without pain i shall acquit myself of the trust it weighs upon me night and day with that the matter would have been ended so far as leonard and myself were concerned rose however took it differently for the rest of that afternoon we were able to appreciate fully the guile of our little companion she received kinlostis refusal in silence presently she developed a headache and refused to talk she sat with her shoulder turned away from him while she played and never once glanced in his direction while she sang at the close of our performance he came up and whispered to her earnestly she shook her head at first and then turned to me mr kinlosti is going to show me something in his sitting room please come with us for the first time i saw the russian in this sallowfaced invalid his lips curved into a snarl and for a moment he glared at me the fit of anger was gone in a moment before rose had even observed it with a little courteous gesture towards her he turned and limped towards the lift we followed and he led us into his suite on the first floor do not be frightened of john he enjoined as he opened the door john is the guardian of my treasure and he is obsessed with the idea that there are thieves in this hotel from the appearance of john it seemed as though any adventurous thieves would have had a pretty poor time he was seated with folded arms upon a hard straightbacked chair on a table by his side only partially concealed by a large handkerchief was an obvious revolver there was also a glass of strong brandy and water he rose to his feet at our entrance but his bearing was grim and unfriendly his master talked to him for a few moments in his own language apparently trying to assure him of the harmlessness of our presence john however remained sulky kinlosti crossed to the farthest corner of the room took a key from his pocket a key which seemed to be attached to a band of snakelike silver which encircled his leg and unfastened an ordinary black tin dispatch box which stood on the floor from this he drew out a coffer of some almost blackcoloured wood with brass clamps he held it up towards rose even for you my dear young friend he said i may not raise the lid but i show you this much of your desire this is one of the coffers which for eleven hundred years has held the ceremonial jewels of the russian royal family there were at one time five of them this is the one that remains maynt i have just one little peep inside rose pleaded we heard johns heavy breathing and kinlosti scarcely waited even to answer her he thrust the coffer back into the box and locked it it is impossible he pronounced i do not bear this trust alone in the spirit i fear that i break it already you will rest here for a little while mademoiselle if this was meant as a hint to me it was of no avail i stood by roses side and she shook her head you will not let me make you some of our own russian tea he begged bring me some downstairs she suggested i should love the tea if it isnt too much trouble and i will come over and sit in your corner in the corridor on our way down we met the malevolent mrs cotesham who paused leaning on her stick and watched rose and her companion with the hungry glare of the professional scandalmonger kinlosti hurried past her with a little shiver and rose laughed gaily as she descended the stairs i believe that you have a penchant for mrs cotesham she declared she is the most horrible old lady i have ever seen anywhere he said fervently they tell me that she is over ninety and that she has but one joy in lifeto make where she can mischief and trouble and unhappiness she comes here every year and every servant hates her even the managers would keep her away if they could but she has bought shares in the hotel and has interest with the directors the old man mr grant is nearly as bad rose remarked him i know nothing of kinlosti replied save that he is one of those who have surely lived too long leonard and i left rose to her ttette and took a seat in the lounge a few yards from us the little daily comedy which never failed to amuse the onlookers was in progress mr grant was seated in the easy chair affected by mrs cotesham she came stumping along from the lift and stopped about a foot from the chair this man has taken my chair she exclaimed in a loud voice for the benefit of every one i left a book in it mr grant continued to read through his heavy spectacles unmoved she struck the side of his chair with her stick i want my chair she repeated mr grant half turned round what does the woman want he snarled this isnt her chair its an hotel chair i found it empty and i sat down i am going to stay wheres my book mrs cotesham demanded handing him the end of her ear trumpet i threw it on the lounge he shouted there it is now dont bother me any more he calls himself a gentleman the old lady declared shaking with fury never called myself anything of the sort in my life he snapped i rose and wheeled the easy chair in which i was sitting to the side of mr grants will you sit here madam i ventured it is as near your favourite position as possible she pushed her speaking trumpet almost into my face say that again young man she directed i repeated it at the top of my voice she nodded and subsided into the chair i dont like having to sit near such people she said but i prefer this side of the fireplace her neighbour looked out of the corner of his eye i wish the pestilential old woman would stay up in her room he growled i hate her next me she handed him her speaking trumpet say that again will you she invited i dont like people talking about me when i cant hear what they say mr grant shut his book with a snap rose to his feet and hobbled across to a distant part of the lounge that old woman ought to be locked up he declared at the top of his voice shes a damned nuisance to everybody he found another seat and recommenced his book mrs cotesham with a purr of content settled herself down in the chair which he had vacated stretched out her feet upon the footstool and looked around triumphantly ive been to a good many hotels in my life she confided to every one within hearing but i never met a man who called himself a gentleman with such disgusting manners leonard and i strolled away presently to find rose it was time for us to go back to our rooms and change for the evening performance we found her with kinlosti in his corner and the air above them overhung with a thin cloud of blue tobacco smoke kinlosti was smoking furiously and talking hard rose welcomed our approach i thought with something almost like eagerness it is time to go i am sure she declared springing to her feet her companion broke off in the middle of a sentence and frowned we speak together tonight then she shook her head at him smiling all the time though and with that little tantalising look in her eyes which leonard and i both knew so well i am not sure she replied the management will complain if i talk so much with one of the guests but i will play valse triste for you au revoir we had almost left the hotelwe were on the outside steps indeedwhen the hall porter caught me up i saw at once what he was carrying it was one of the now familiar typewritten letters this time i asked him a pointblank question look here i said with my hand in my trousers pocket this is the third note i have received from my friend in this fashion i want to know how they come into your possession who leaves them at the bureau the man saw the tenshilling note in my hand but he only shook his head i believe that he was perfectly honest i would tell you in a minute if i knew sir he declared but to tell you the truth i have never seen one delivered all three i have picked up from the desk in my office evidently left there when my back was turned for a moment you havent any idea who leaves them there then i persisted not the slightest sir the man assured me keep a good lookout i begged him and let me know if you do find out there may be another onei cant tellbut ill double this ten shillings if you succeed the man thanked me and withdrew we three crossed to the less frequented side of the road i walked in the middle with rose and leonard on either arm we read the note together if the box miss mindel saw in kinlostis room was of purple leather with gold clasps and corners let the first item in your repertoire tonight be the missouri waltz if it was a box of any other description play the selection from chuchinchow well im damned leonard exclaimed be careful i advised thomsons probably underneath these paving stones rose shivered a little do you think he wants to steal the jewels maurice she asked me oh no i answered he probably wants to borrow them to wear at the lord mayors show she made a grimace thats all very well mr lister she said with a great attempt at hauteur but will you kindly remember that you two are not in at this show it is i who seem to be chosen as principal accomplice i am not exactly infatuated with mr kinlosti but i dont want him to lose his jewels i bet you a fourpound box of chocolates he does lose them leonard observed rose sighed anyhow she murmured we shall have to play chuchinchow tonight leonard and rose played a selection from chuchinchow that evening as well as they could with an extemporised rendering rose played the piano leonard the violin and i pretended to be turning over the pages of the music although all the time i was engaged in a furtive search of the crowded lounge for some sign of our patron or a possible emissary there were the usual little groups about and a more harmless or obvious set of people i dont think i ever came across mrs cotesham was seated with her back to us with a shawl arranged around her head so as to still further deaden sound and ostentatiously reading a novel mr grant had stumped past us on his way to the billiard room muttering to himself before the first few bars of our little effort had been played the others were nearly all known to us by name or reputation there seemed something uncanny in the thought that somewhere or other were ears waiting for the message our selection conveyed we were halfway through the cobblers song when without the slightest warning rose who was facing the staircase broke off abruptly in her playing i caught sight of her face suddenly pale upturned towards the head of the staircase followed the direction of her gaze and was myself stricken dumb and nerveless at the top of the staircase john was standing holding out a terrified struggling figure almost at arms length the fingers of his right hand seemed to be clasped around the neck of his unfortunate victim while with his left hand he held him by the ankle this was all in full view of the lounge there were shrieks from the women and some of the men amongst them myself hurried towards the staircase we were too late however to be of any practical use john who seemed like a man beside himself with passion suddenly swung the prostrate form of his captive a little farther back and then dashed it from him down the stairs a little cry of horror rippled and sobbed through the tense air the man lay on the rug at the bottom of the stairs a crumpledup heap motionless and without speech illustration there were shrieks from the women and some of the men amongst them myself hurried towards the staircase page ii i was one of those who helped to carry the unfortunate victim of johns fury into the managers office he appeared to be a man of about medium height and build dressed in the severest clerical clothes i remembered having seen him arrive on the previous day we laid him upon a sofa and left him there while one of us telephoned for a doctor out in the lounge every one was grouped around the stairs where kinlosti was talking to john the veins of the latters temples were still standing out but he was rapidly calming down he spoke in a loud voice so that every one might hear that man is a thief in disguise he shouted you will find burglars tools in his pocket and a revolver he came into the room where i was guarding my masters property pretended to have mistaken the room and tried to slip in behind me i was too quick for him he has followed us from russia that man my master will tell you the manager who had been lingering in the background came down the stairs the mans story may be true he said two of the maids saw him hanging about they heard the altercation and there is a chloroformed handkerchief in the sitting room i have a valuable box there kinlosti explained which it is my servants duty to guard it contains property which belongs to the dead all the same one of the bystanders observed one does not treat even a thief like that the mans neck is probably broken kinlosti seemed to have lost his nervousness in this minute of crisis i beg he said to the manager that you will await the doctors verdict before you send for the police if the man is not seriously injured he got no more than his deserts it was johns duty to guard what he was guarding with his life here is the doctor the manager announced half a dozen of us followed the manager and the doctor back to the room where we had carried the injured man when we opened the door however we were faced with a great surprise there was a current of cold air the window was wide open the sofa was empty to all appearance a miracle had happened we examined the ground below the window and found traces of where a man had stepped out to those of us who had seen the fall the thing grew more wonderful the more we thought of it i think the doctor pronounced that this is more a case for the police kinlosti shook his head i do not think he said drily that the police of bath are likely to be of much service in this matter you have a suspicion perhaps the manager asked kinlosti smiled a little bitterly i know the people who have been following me he replied who would follow me around the world until i am quit of my trust they are jugoslav jews boneless and bloodless as the worm that you cut in two only to find of dual life no bath policeman will ever lay hands upon that seemingly reverend gentleman at the same time the manager said a little stiffly i shall give information it appears that he wrote for a room a week ago from a vicarage near london and signed himself the reverend edward cummings you will find that vicarage a myth kinlosti observed as much a myth as the reverend edward cummings himself the sensation died away we all drifted back to our places at the managers earnest request we recommenced our programme but i am quite sure that no one listened for the buzz of conversation almost drowned the sound of our instruments the manager carried on an earnest conversation with kinlosti in his corner greatly apparently to the latters distress after our first essay we attempted no more music leonard went off to speak to some friends in the lounge i was talking to rose and showing her a paragraph in the evening paper when kinlosti approached it is very distressing he said because of this unfortunate happening the manager has asked me to leave the hotel every place in bath is full and my cure is not complete i showed him the paragraph in the paper you may not be able to go i pointed out it seems that there is every possibility of a railway strike being declared tonight he glanced at the paragraph and returned the paper to me unmoved it would not affect me he said i travel everywhere by car i think after what has happened i shall go in london i can acquit myself of my trust i see that the person who is empowered to take over my responsibility is back in london a few days sooner than he was expected i looked at the paragraph underneath the one which i had indicated which announced that a royal personage had returned to london a few days earlier than intended owing to the threatened strike tomorrow kinlosti continued quietly i shall order my car and depart it will perhaps be better if things get worse they may commandeer the petrol i will rid myself of this responsibility and either return or try harrogate you three will come up and have a bottle of wine with me and some sandwiches rose to my joy was quite firm in her refusal she returned with him to his corner however and they sat there with their heads very close together whilst leonard and i fidgetted about in the lounge a period of quietude had followed the excitement of the last halfhour mr grant had apparently fallen asleep in his easy chair mrs cotesham watched him malevolently through her hornrimmed spectacles what a pity for a man to make such ugly noises when hes asleep she remarked to her neighbour i wish some one would wake him up hes disturbing the whole room mr grant opened one eye then the other finally he sat up madam he shouted as she raised her trumpet to her ear you forget that i am not like youdeaf i dont care whether you are or not she replied im glad i woke you up beds the place for you a coffins the place for you mr grant muttered under his breath how are you going to get away from here maam he continued raising his tone i hear your rooms are let from tomorrow i shant ask you for a place in your car she answered very likely i shant go they cant turn me out i dont think theyll miss the opportunity her interlocutor retorted with a sardonic smile she laid her speaking trumpet in her lap i shant listen to you any more she declared youre a rude old man if it interests any one else to know what will become of me i have relatives in bristol who will be only too glad for me to pay them a visit theyll be gladder to get rid of her mr grant observed looking around for sympathy at that moment the hall porter touched me on the shoulder the inevitable note was thrust into my hand i found this on my desk just now sir he announced in answer to my look of enquiry sorry i cant tell you how it got there i opened it and read you will terminate your engagement at the crown this evening proceed to london tomorrow where you will find rooms taken for you at the mayfair hotel accept any offer you may receive of a lift to london individually or collectively i showed leonard the note and hurried away to the managers office he made no difficulty about letting us go in fact i gathered that half the residents in the hotel were hurrying away by motor car fearing a general confiscation of petrol he detained me just as i was leaving the room queer affair that attempted robbery mr lister he remarked extraordinary i agreed i notice you people seem quite friendly with mr kinlosti he continued do you know if it is true that he is related to the late tsar i have no idea i answered all that he has told us is that he was a member of the household he may be a nobleman and i dare say he is the manager went on a little nervously but i dont care about people at my hotel with a savage manservant like his and half a million pounds worth of jewels bath isnt the place for that sort of thing my clients like a quiet life no doubt i answered anyhow hes leaving tomorrow prince or no prince i am glad to hear it was the heartfelt reply people ought to deposit valuables like that in a bank theyre simply asking for trouble when they cart them about the country its a thing ive very seldom done to a client but i told mr kinlosti this evening that i should be glad for him to leave as soon as convenient i went back to the corner where i had left rose my disquietude increased as i approached both she and her companion were quite unconscious of my coming kinlosti was leaning forward talking earnestly and rose was listening with a queer and unfamiliar look in her eyes leonard suddenly gripped me by the arm and led me a little distance away maurice he confided that fellow kinlosti is making love to her if i thought so i muttered clenching my fists but shes letting him leonard groaned what the mischief can we do weve no hold over her owing to that silly bargain we made she doesnt dream that either of us care a snap of the fingers about her except as a little pal and a partner its all clear sailing for that unwholesome brute my anger died away but a very solid determination was there in its place leonard i said we arent going to leave her and whatever happens well know more about that fellow before many days have passed i retraced my steps then and went up to them there was certainly a change in roses face kinlosti looked up at me a little impatiently is it late he asked i am leaving tomorrow and i am anxious to have a few minutes more conversation with miss mindel as it happens we are leaving ourselves i replied i thought perhaps that miss mindel would like to know what tomorrow she exclaimed i have received a message i told her she sprang up and drew me to one side with a little nod to kinlosti which seemed to promise a swift return i showed her the typewritten sheet maurice she whispered mr kinlosti has already been begging me to accept a seat in his car to london tomorrow indeed i answered coldly of course i never had any idea of leaving you two she went on but nowwell you see what our instructions are damn our instructions i muttered losing control of myself for a moment rose youre not falling in love with that fellow dont be foolish please she answered and dont call him a fellow ill call him a scoundrel if he behaves like one i retorted she looked at me queerly for a moment i thought that she was going to be angry but she answered me without any signs of illfeeling you and leonard are both very kind in looking after me she admitted but after all i am quite able when it is necessary to make up my mind for myself on things that concern me personally youre not going up to london alone with kinlosti i said doggedly she swung around and rejoined him before i could reply leonard and i went and fetched our coats and hats a little ostentatiously we laid her fur coat upon the top of the piano and waited in a moment or two she got up and came over towards us kinlosti by her side he turned courteously to me miss mindel reminds me that you also are leaving bath tomorrow i have two seats in my car one of which i have offered to miss mindel if the other is of any service to you i shall be delighted i thanked him a little perfunctorily we dont as a rule separate when we have a journey to make i said however in this case the circumstances are a little exceptional if you will take miss mindel and mr cotton i dare say i can manage to get up somehow we cant leave you maurice rose protested so far as i am concerned i am afraid it must be so kinlosti intervened in a tone full of courteous regret i have john outside with the chauffeur and there is only room for two comfortably in the inside we shall have to improvise a seat for mr cotton you dont anticipate any adventures on the way i suppose i asked nothing after the style of this evenings happenings i sincerely trust not was the earnest reply however both john and i are armed and i do not think any one will venture so far as to hold up the car in that case rose i said i think you and leonard had better accept mr kinlostis offer at the worst i hear there are some charbancs running i shall probably get a lift at what hour did you think of starting at nine oclock if miss mindel doesnt mind kinlosti answered hastily the sooner we get away the better my chauffeur tells me that they are asking two pounds a tin for petrol and a government order commandeering stocks is expected out tomorrow we were more silent than usual on our walk home perhaps because the events of the evening had left us all something to think about once rose pressed my arm i feel rather mean about you tomorrow maurice she ventured i reminded her of the mandate we had received no help for it two were invited and two have to go i cant tell what surprises may be in store for me i may get an invitation myself rose turned a troubled face towards me her lips quivered a little her eyes were full of distress maurice she confessed im afraid of tomorrow im afraid that we are being made use of to rob mr kinlosti cant be helped leonard put in as i remained for a moment silent we took this business on with our eyes open our consciences werent very active when we were starving and cold and in debt its no good finding them too sensitive now that were living on the fat of the land weve just got to see the thing through for a year at any rate leonard is right i assented weve got to grin and bear it this time i added it seems as though you two were going to have the show to yourself you can have my share rose sighed the hall of the crown hotel at a few minutes before nine on the following morning presented a scene of curious animation all trains had ceased to run and rumours as to the government commandeering of petrol were universal fully a score of cars were outside waiting besides one of the smaller charbancs and half a dozen luggage porters were working their hardest kinlosti looking curiously shrunken in a great fur coat pale and nervous greeted us on the steps his car laden with luggage stood at the entrance on the box seat sat john an immovable figure of fierce watchfulness we could start any time you liked kinlosti said addressing rose eagerly we have left room for your trunk behind and there will be a quite comfortable place for mr cotton you are ready miss mindel quite she answered he gripped leonards arm and commenced to descend the steps it was obvious that he was in great pain and i supported him on the other side outside a grey mist hung over the street and he shivered as we made our slow progress it is the damp which has brought this on again he confided only a few days ago i was better every one says the same thing it is when one leaves here that one reaps the benefit of the treatment i am ashamed to be so much trouble we had almost to lift him into the car and notwithstanding the chill of the morning there were beads of perspiration upon his forehead rose took her place by his side and leonard on a camp stool placed against the door i felt a little forlorn as i saw them start but i waved my hand encouragingly ill get up somehow i shouted see you tonight i turned back into the hotel to look for the driver of the charbanc and try to bargain with him for a seat to london mrs cotesham almost undistinguishable in rugs and wraps was seated on a chair watching the carrying out of her luggage all neatly wrapped after the continental fashion in brown holland covers she counted the articles one by one as they passed muttering to herself all the time never another shilling shall any railway porter have so long as i liveelevenone more and as to the management of this hotel i call it disgraceful flung out like cattle thats whats happening to us mr grant also attired for motoring came shuffling along he picked up mrs coteshams speaking trumpet got any one to take you in he asked she snatched it away from him of course i have she answered im not a miserable disagreeable old curmudgeon like you my friends are glad to have me pay them a visit mr grant chuckled gladder to get rid of you i know his eye fell upon me well young mr musician he went on how are you going to get away pad the hoof eh as your sort used to a few hundred years ago not at all i answered cheerfully im hoping some one will offer me a lift to london if not i shall have to buy a seat for myself in the charbanc the hall porter who was passing shook his head not a bit of use thinking about the charbanc sir he said weve a dozen guests in the hotel weve had to refuse already mr grant chuckled good walker eh young man he asked oh i could get there all right i assured him but it wont be necessary why wont you give me a lift sir i added putting a bold front on it i see your car out there empty yes why dont you give the poor young man a ride mrs cotesham chipped in lowering the speaking trumpet from her ear fancy wanting all that great car to yourself i hate selfishness mr grant smiled i couldnt persuade you my dear lady he began no you couldnt she interrupted vigorously i wouldnt step inside your old car if you paid me im not going your way either im going to clifton and i hope that as long as i live ill never set eyes upon your repulsive face again mr grant lifted his hat solemnly amen he said come on young fellow he added gruffly ill take you to london as long as you promise not to try and sing to me i spared my benefactor any exuberant show of gratitude but i felt that i was in lucks way as i stretched myself out in the luxuriously cushioned seat of mr grants limousine we swung off along the bristol road got to call at a house three miles out on this road mr grant explained thickly well be in london before the fastest of them though its quite immaterial to me so long as we get there by this evening i answered we drove on for between three and four miles then without any order from mr grant the car came to a standstill by the side of the road i looked at my companion for some explanation he was leaning a little forward with both hands clasped around the knob of his stick his attitude was one of listening is the house where you want to call near here i asked listen was the brusque reply i thrust my head out of the window of the car and held my breath climbing the hill behind us hidden by the mist was another car puffing and snorting as though in some difficulties it came into sight in a minute or twoa bath taxicab laden with luggage mr grant descended something wrong with that engine he remarked perhaps we had better enquire if we can help the car behind had come to a standstill and the chauffeur who had already jumped from his place and opened the bonnet was tinkering with his engine i fancied that a glance of intelligence passed between him and mr grant dear me the latter exclaimed turning around and finding me at his heels our amiable old friend on her way to bristol we must see whether we cannot be of some assistance what followedthe rapidity and the wonder of itkept me spellbound there was no stump about mr grant as he threw open the door of the taxicab his spring was the spring of a young man and before i could realise what was happening he had mrs cotesham by the throat with the other hand he passed out to me the box which she had been using as a footstool the games up kinlosti he said and the voice was the voice of thomson ill shake the life out of you if you reach for that pistol for a moment i stood in the middle of the road spellbound the pseudo mrs cotesham was a wonderful sight her false front and mass of grey curls had slipped over her ear disclosing the cleanshaven head of a young man the paint was cracking upon her face thomsons terrible grip seemed to be slowly strangling her and slowly from out of the wreck there seemed to creep another face the face of a man with kinlostis haunting eyes he seemed to wrench himself at that moment a little freer from the cruel grip upon his windpipe and a cry of terror rang out into the mist the thrilling horrible cry of a man in fear of his life the cry was stifled by something which thomson held in his hand he turned to me get back in the car and take that box with you he directed i obeyed him glad enough to be away from whatever else might happen in a minute or two mr thomson returned he gave a brief order to the chauffeur the car swung round and we headed once more for bath as we flashed past the taxicab i caught a momentary glimpse of its amazing occupant leaning forward his face buried in his hands the taxicab man had lit a cigarette and was waiting apparently for orders shant we be stopped i asked my companion he can telephone mr thomson shook his head the game isnt played that way he said shortly whereupon he put his feet on the opposite cushion and either slept or pretended to sleep until we reached hungerford then he yawned and looked at me can you hold out until we reach london he asked i dont want to stop for luncheon easily i replied i had a good breakfast and to tell you the truth i added boldly im too curious to be hungry mr thomson yawned and closed his eyes again you can keep your curiosity and your appetite too if you like he said until eight oclock this evening milan restaurantnot grill room all three of us i asked yes mr thomson closed his eyes and not another word was spoken until he set me down at the mayfair hotel it was evidently not only at hotels that mr thomson was persona grata the table to which he led us on our arrival at the milan was one of the best in the room the chief matre dhtel himself was in attendance to exchange amenities with an evidently wellknown and respected patron the menu of a specially prepared dinner was deferentially handed to him by one of the minor luminaries we seated ourselves with some faint return of that unreal feeling which had been evoked by the two previous feasts at which we had assisted this one especially was hard to realise nowhere could the appurtenances of luxury have been more elaborately displayed pink hothouse roses almost covered the tablecloth and gave a faint exotic odour to the restful atmosphere of the room outside the orchestra was playing with subdued and melodious cadence the music of louise we seemed in an oasis in a world far removed from the tragedies of the day i fear our host said as he watched the wine being poured into roses glass that your journey up today has fatigued you i beg that you will drink half a glass of that wine at once there is nothing so refreshing as champagne after a long motor ride it wasnt the distance rose replied as she followed his advice it was mr kinlostis extraordinary behaviour i have never seen a man so nervous in all my life he could not sit still he seemed to lose sometimes almost the power of speech always he seemed to be expecting something which never happened ah mr thomson murmured that is not to be wondered at when we neared london rose continued and i ventured to congratulate him upon the near fulfilment of his trust i certainly thought he would have hysterics we left him at hammersmith telephoning wildly after waiting half an hour we moved our things into a taxi things did not turn out mr thomson reflected exactly as mr kinlosti had anticipated it has been your custom sir i reminded him leaning forward in my place on the occasion of these little celebrations to vouchsafe us some slight inkling as to the meaning of our efforts i feel that we should do more justice to this wonderful dinner if you could give us some faint idea as to the nature of the tragedy or farce or whatever it may be at which we have been assisting mr thomson ruminated for a moment he seemed to be watching two unobtrusivelooking men still in morning dress who were making their way through the room towards the more retired tables set out on the balcony that is true he admitted i will tell you then a little history it may perhaps bring some part of the colour back to miss mindels cheeks it may also i observed stop me from thinking i can see two of everything a month ago mr thomson said there landed in england three of the greatest rascals who ever drew breath in any country one was andrea kinlosti at one time valet and barber to the tsar of russia the other was paul kinlosti his brother an actor of some small note in a stock company at st petersburg the third was a hardened criminal whom not to confuse you we will call john wanted even in his own country for something like thirteen murders andrea kinlosti was the gentleman miss rose who brought you to london today paul kinlosti the actor gave a very wonderful rendering of mrs cotesham and johnwell you know about him andrea kinlostis story then rose began a tissue of lies our host interrupted the true facts about his appearance in england are these a very valuable portion of the crown jewels was hidden by one of the monarchist party in st petersburg partly through andrea kinlostis intervention these jewels fell into the hands of the bolshevists the two kinlostis and john however managed to secure possession of them and escaped to england hard on their heels came four or five of their kidney and the attempt you saw at theft at the crown hotel was the third or fourth which has been made since they arrived in this country in the absence of any extradition treaty between the present government of russia and this country the trio thought that they would be safe here and could make their plans to realise the jewels they did not count however upon the little stream of fellow rascals who found their way over here after them the bath idea seems fantastic but on the whole it had its points andrea was really suffering horribly from rheumatism and an hotel of the class of the crown seemed as good a hiding place as any from the kind of person whom they desired to avoid the scheme was that kinlosti should be quite frank about his possession of the jewels but the box which was supposed to contain them was a dummy paul the actor impersonated an old lady and was really in possession of the jewels and the idea was that he should watch his opportunity and take steamer direct from bristol to some little port at which he could reship to new york we murmured comprehension miss mindel here thomson continued kept admirably in touch with andrea kinlosti the pseudonobleman she was able to give me the information i desired as to which of the two really possessed the jewels furthermore directly andrea sought her companionship for the journey to london i knew that it was paul who was to have the jewels upon the whole he concluded for two arch criminals of wonderful reputation i think their final attempt to get away with the booty was a little disappointing what has happened to them rose asked mr thomson picked up the evening paper which he had placed by the side of his plate this is just a telegram he observed turning to the stop press news just before the sailing of the s s avonmouth from bristol this afternoon the body of an elderly lady who had booked a passage to jamaica in the name of mrs cotesham was found in her cabin it is feared that the deceased lady was the victim of foul play as there were marks of strangulation upon her throat and her property had apparently been rifled later further extraordinary revelations concerning the murder on the avonmouth have just come to hand from which it appears that the deceased was a man in womans clothes what made him go on i asked mr thomson smiled a little information i whispered to him he said concerning the movements of some of his cutthroat friends from russia they were hard on his track as this paragraph proves and what aboutthe other one rose asked in a stifled breathless voicethe one i travelled up with andrea mr thomson replied i am afraid miss mindel that he is a very bad lot indeed if i had not been sure that your protection was adequate i should certainly have hesitated before i asked you to play delilah i am still wondering rose murmured what has become of him mr thomson had been watching the progress of three men through the crowded restaurant by a silent gesture he invited her attention to them the foremost figure was the man whom we had known as andrea kinlosti behind him the two unobtrusivelooking men who had passed through the restaurant a few minutes before kinlosti looked neither to the right nor to the left his cheeks were ashen pale his dark eyes more brilliant and sunken than ever the two men who followed watched his every movement with catlike intensity when they had passed into the lounge they drew one on either side of him he is in luck mr thomson said grimly scotland yard has a pretty black record against him since his last visit to england six or seven years ago but if it had been the othersi dont think they would have been so kind to him as they were to his brother and now thats the end of my story he went on in an altered tone miss mindel i am assured that this young turkey is as tender as the chestnut stuffing lister you ought to have an appetite for i did you out of your lunch cotton a glass of wine with you i think that a certain callousness born of our recent adventures was finding its way into our natures for each one of us responded cheerfully to our hosts invitation there was onethe great questionhowever which i could not refrain from asking about those jewels sirwhere are they i asked mr thomson scratched his chin young man he replied dont you think youd be better off without knowing where half a million pounds worth of jewels are that isnt what i meant i persisted you seem to have recovered them from the original thieves what are you going to do about it mr thomson smiled let me see he observed that will be conundrum number two conundrum number three the spiders parlour we threeleonard cotton rose mindel and i maurice lister who comprised the muchadvertised little troupe of english artistes recently arrived at brusselssipped the very excellent black coffee provided for our delectation by monsieur huber the proprietor of the quatres etoiles gazed around with interest at the motley crowd by which we were surrounded applauded the performance of a little french soubrette upon the stage with all the abandon required by fellow artistes and exchanged mutual smiles of wellbeing and content to tell the truth the caf des quatres etoiles its clientele and the character of the entertainment provided were nothing so very wonderful but it was our first glimpse of foreign life for some five or six years we were young and athirst for adventure and with our unseen patron behind us we were pretty certain that before long we should be brought into touch with interesting things so far we had spent a week in brussels and no word had followed the mandate which had sent us there we had been perfectly content however to wait our time and take our nightly part in the performances rose had made quite a hit with her topical songs and graceful dancing leonards droll stories were much appreciated by an audience which during the last four years had received a mighty english lesson my own baritone songs were well enough received and we thoroughly enjoyed the cosmopolitan habit established at the little music hall of coming down to one of the tables in the caf between our turns and taking our place amongst the audience rose was somewhat of a responsibility to us but since the affair kinlosti she had shunned all new acquaintances and was quite content that we should play the part of watchdogs even as we sat there that evening she received with the pleasant indifference of the true artiste many admiring many inviting glances prosperity had agreed with rose as i suppose it had also with leonard and me the slight thinness of her face the discontented curl of the lips had vanished her cheeks had filled out those wonderful blue eyes of hers seemed always soft and full of life she had a perpetual and distracting smile upon her lips she moved as one who walks on air the little lady monsieur huber had said to us on the evening of our first performance has the gaiety of paris it is incredible that she is of london she makes happiness wherever she goes and by the bye mr huber was not accustomed to overpraise any artiste to whom he was in the habit of paying a salary mauriceand you old solemnface rose said turning to leonard i like this place i am prepared to enjoy myself here i am more glad than ever that i sold my soul i am entirely with you leonard assented so long as the future does not present any such penalties as the incarceration of the body youre all right i reminded him im the person who nearly found trouble a few more paragraphs about that mysterious jewel robbery and the probability of immediate arrest would have sent me into a nervous decline rose laughed in my face her white teeth gleaming the little creases at the corners of her eyes deepened rubbish she scoffed you know perfectly well that you never turned a hair as a matter of fact i admitted i am beginning to have confidence in mr mephistopheles thomson whether he is of heaven or earth of the law or of the underworld he seems to have a remarkably good idea of how to take care of himself and his minions considering that he has three perfectly good consciences to look after besides his own rose agreed i must say that he does very well his interests appear to be somewhat cosmopolitan leonard observed leaning back in his chair and gazing around him so much the better rose declared it means plenty of change for us and i like change only this time i hope my affections are not going to be trifled with you shouldnt wear your heart on your sleeve for sentimental russians to nibble at i ventured she made a little grimace i fancy i should have been the recipient of a scathing remark but for the approach of monsieur huber the proprietor of the caf he bowed with great politeness to rose and handed me a typewritten envelope of familiar appearance i tore it open and glanced at its brief contents i beg that you will respond to any advances made to you by any regular patrons of the caf des quatres etoiles i held the note out so that the two others could read it then i thrust it into my pocket mademoiselle sang charmingly tonight monsieur huber declared rolling his eyes i didnt see you amongst the audience monsieur huber she replied demurely when you sing i am never far away mademoiselle was the impressive response i was standing at the back of the baroness spens box rose glanced upwards at the box which he indicated a large woman was seated there dressed in an elaborate evening gown with jewels sparkling from her bosom and hair she was dark with a strong masculine face a woman who had once beyond a doubt been handsome but whose countenance was now almost forbidding i recognised her as one of the regular patrons of the caf the baroness monsieur huber continued is one of my best clients she is very good to all my artistes sometimes she has them at her home she pays toopays very well but excuse meshe calls the baroness with a short rather thickset belgian girl and a fat elderly man who had almost fallen on to the stage applauding the little french soubrette occupied the stage box which was on a level with the promenade monsieur huber hurried over towards it exchanged a few words with his patroness and returned to us the baroness desires that you three will visit her box and take a glass of wine he announced with the air of one conveying a royal command franois a bottle of to the stage box at once apart from our desire to oblige little mr huber who was really a most goodnatured person our recently received mandate left us no alternative but to comply we were ushered therefore into the box where the baroness received us rather to my surprise with the air of a woman of breeding the girl without any special enthusiasm and the old man whose eyes were glued upon the soubrette with indifference we were offered chairs and suffered the martyrdom of sweet champagne the baroness said polite things about our performance enquired about our impressions of brussels and spoke calmly of her residence in the city during the period of german occupation her conversation was easy enough and gracious yet i could not get it out of my head that her interest in us did not arise solely from the fact of our being professional entertainers you find it pays she asked a little abruptly while living in brussels is so dear to perform at this caf for monsieur hubers salary financially i admitted our trip here is not particularly remunerative but we were all three very anxious to get over here and look around you find it very changedthe city only as regards the absence of germans i replied in the old days one met them everywhere they will return she observed but surely they will not be welcome guests i ventured not at first she answered indifferently brussels however is too cosmopolitan and too near the frontier to preserve her isolation the intermarrying alone would prevent any ostracism i hope i ventured to say that they will keep away until our stay here is over she glanced at my stiff left arm you lost that in the war that and better things i told hera brother two cousins and an uncle she nodded gravely yet with little pretence at sympathy you english were wonderful she said coldly the little fat man who had been leaning over the edge of the box suddenly turned around mopping his forehead he was not a pleasant sight to look upon there were wine stains upon his shirt front and cigar ash upon his waistcoat his cheeks were pale and puffy there were bags underneath his eyes his grey beard and moustache though carefully trimmed were scanty and unprepossessing but she is wonderful that little one he declared marvellous he poured out a glass of wine ignoring us in his ecstasy the baroness endeavoured to correct his manners you were unfortunate dear henri she said that you arrived too late to hear mademoiselle mindel sing and to watch her dance you would have thought less of your little french girls performance monsieur henri recovered himself sufficiently to bow to rose it will be my pleasure another evening he said meanwhile dear baroness if you will excuse me mademoiselle expects me we shall meet again he made us a comprehensive bow and departed the phlegmatic young woman who had been introduced to us as mademoiselle trudens muttered something in flemish as he left the box the baroness shook her head reprovingly monsieur henri destin she pronounced is a person of importance one must humour his whims leonard glanced at his watch and rose i fear that i must be excused baroness he regretted my turn to sing is close at hand we also rose the baroness eyed us reflectively i am having a few friends out to supper tonight at my chateau she said it will give me great pleasure if you will come after the performance my car will be at the stage door at halfpast eleven and i shall send you back to your hotel her thoughtful hesitation before extending the invitation had been so apparent that we should never have dreamed of accepting it but for our mandate as it was we had no alternative we professed ourselves delighted and were permitted to depart the automobile which awaited us at the stage door at the conclusion of the performance and which contained our prospective hostess only was the swiftest and most luxurious in which we had any of us ever ridden we passed over several miles of cobbled streets with incredible speed penetrated some distance into the country and finally turned in at an avenue which led through a dense wood and terminated in front of a chateau finely situated and of imposing proportions even as we descended however a curious fact concerning it occurred both to leonard and myself the baroness who must have been watching us more closely than i had imagined surprised me by referring to it you are wondering why half my chateau is illuminated and the remainder is in darkness is it not so she enquired well i will tell you the portion which you see in darkness was the headquarters of the most detested german who ever set foot in this country during the enemy occupation of the city since his departure i have not yet been able to accustom myself to the existence of apartments in which he and his suite lived and breathed she spoke with a little undernote of passion waited for no comment from us but led the way into the brightly lit hall where servants relieved us of our wraps and we were at once made conscious of an air of luxury and comfort the apartment into which we were presently shown was almost stately in its proportions and as a pleasure room almost unique at one end was a little raised stage for theatrical performances occupied now by a small orchestra and fitted into the wall was an electric organ there was a considerable space of polished floor for dancing and at the opposite end of the apartment a large round table laid for supper i fear the baroness confided that my apartment resembles too much a restaurant still what can one do my friends love dancing informally the men love their supper and this huge apartment which was built for a music room would be wasted if i used it in any other fashion we have a custom here which always prevails supper is served at as guests arrive they seat themselves we shall find no difficulty in accommodating ourselves to your delightful customs i assured her as we took the places she indicated one must dine at six while our present engagement is on and it seems a long time ago the precise character of that entertainment the status of the guests who presently arrived and the significance of the whole affair to us personally puzzled us all for a long time several beautiful ladies arrived of apparently satisfactory social position not possessed of a universal desire to attach themselves to something responsive amongst the male sex madame sara clry of the french opera company a cousin of our hostess was kind enough to show a marked interest in me and my presence in brussels tell me monsieur she begged in her very attractive undertone as we sat in a corner after a waltz why are you really in brussels you tell me that you perform at the caf des quatres etoiles but that is a joke is it not nothing of the sort indeed madame i assured her i am there on a short engagement with my two friends i am merely what we call in english a strolling mountebank you had no other reason then for coming to brussels she persisted unless i was subconsciously aware of the joy in store for me in meeting madame i answered there was no other reason or in coming to this house i shook my head the baroness was good enough to ask us all i explained and monsieur huber likes his artistes to accept the hospitality of his patrons she pouted a little you do not treat me with confidence monsieur she complained and i am your wellwisher madame i replied if you would search my heart which alas is in your possession you would realise that i dont understand a word of what you are talking about she laughed as though but half convinced we danced again drank wine together and talked a great deal of nonsense all the time i kept my eye on rose who found many partners and seemed to be enjoying the evening exceedingly as the night wore on i thought it was almost time for a counterattack tell me madame i begged as we sat enjoying a cigarette in a remote corner of the room what made you think that i might have other affairs in brussels she looked at me meditatively i could see that she had not as yet made up her mind about me there are so many she said who come to brussels for another purpose but what purpose we were resting in a deep window seat she drew aside the curtains for a moment before us stretched the black unlit wing of the chateau just that monsieur she whispered come we dance again this is the waltz we both love and after that madame would dance but she would not talk so we all went back to our rooms in the hotel de lunivers more than a little puzzled things began to shape themselves on the following day when monsieur huber handed me another typewritten communication my instructions were concise but a trifle embarrassing cultivate madame sara clry she is at home from five to seven at all hazards be there on thursday leave report of visit with monsieur huber addressed thomson rose made a little grimace as she read over my shoulder perhaps she exclaimed with her head in the air you wont have so much to say about poor mr kinlosti now this isnt of my seeking is it i protested nor was laffaire kinlosti mine she retorted there was a wonderful little belgian count with moustaches half an inch long the other night i shall let him call upon me i shall leave you in leonards charge i replied stiffly dear old len she mocked he wont have an earthly chance if i take it into my head to be frisky and im sure i shall it isnt natural for a girl to see no men except two ogres of guardians you be thankful youve got us to look after you leonard intervened from what ive seen of this city sodom and gomorrah werent in it for levity i can take care of myself rose declared tossing her head perhaps i replied in the meantime when i am away on dutyon duty mind youleonard is going to play watchdog she dropped a little curtsey to both of us one would think that i were a masquerading princess she observed youre our princess i answered quickly the peevishness passed from her face in a moment if only youd tell me so sometimes she murmured i was at no time quite able to make up my mind how sara clry really regarded my visits on the first day she received my present of roses and my compliments with unmistakable pleasure on the second day she was still amiable but a little puzzled on the third day she received me with greater intimacy than ever before and i was never so relieved as when the opportune arrival of one of her regular admirersthe tenor with whom she was singingenabled me to beat a graceful retreat on the fourth afternoon the specially indicated thursday i found her in a state of agitation it is my confident belief that on that occasion but for my douceur to her maid which ensured my prompt entry i should have been denied admission she welcomed me with mingled affectionsimulatedand suspicion there was no return of her previous days attitude you find me distracted she declared presently a terrible tragedy has happened i murmured a word or two of sympathy she looked at me earnestly as though anxious to probe my mind to assure herself of my sincerity if i dared to confide in you she murmured dear sara i venturedwe had progressed so farwhat is to prevent it you know that i am your slave she drew a dispatch from the bosom of her gown listen she said there is a secret in my life which has troubled me many timesmore than ever she murmured dropping her eyes since i have known you i did not hesitate to play her game because in my mind i knew that she was deceiving me tell me i begged i am impatient to hear there is one in my family she continued who is a criminal what does that matter i answered so long as it is not you you feel like that maurice she exclaimed earnestly indeed i do i assured her you are english she went on you fought in the war for belgiums deliverance the halo of heroism still rests around your head you can do what others dared not listen this telegram is from my brother he has escaped from prison in antwerp never mind the charge the police search for him everywhere but he promises that he will reach my flat at ten oclock tonight in disguise he comes as the victim of a motor accident in an ambulance car his face bandaged but herehow can i keep him here the chief of the police is amongst my intimates there are people coming and going all day you have a suggestion i ventured yes she answered i was at the caf des quatres etoiles when you did your imitations the other night you have a wonderful gift of making up my cousin has undertaken to hide albert at the chateau if we can get him there good you must come here make up my brother say to imitate your friend monsieur cotton whom he is not unlike then you drive out to the chateau quite openly to one of my cousins supper parties albert will disappear and all will be well and when is this to be i asked tonight she answered you consent she leaned towards me i hesitated merely out of policy her lips almost touched my cheek you have perhaps a price a reward to ask she murmured i knew then that i was in love with rose if i had ever doubted it i have always flattered myself that i displayed great presence of mind sara i said giving a very excellent extempore performance of british stupidity and magnanimity combined i ask for no reward beforehand i wait till the task is done i was vain enough to think that she was almost disappointed she brushed my cheek with her lips and murmured in my ear you shall not be the loser maurice at eleven oclock tonight you will come i am not singing and you must finish early at eleven oclock i promised that evening i wrote my report and left it with monsieur huber and at eleven oclock with my makeup outfit i presented myself at madame clrys flat she herself opened the door and detained me for a moment in the hall all is well so far she murmured albert arrived in a motor ambulance all bandaged up we are alone in the flat if he is a little nervous you will forgive him she led me into the sitting room a man of medium height thin and with a hard square face rose from an easychair and turned a halfenquiring halfsuspicious gaze upon me i was thankful then for the obscurity of the room no longer ashamed of my deceit a willing coadjutor in this scheme whatever it might be i knew too why my services were so earnestly required the photographers art had made the face before me infamous this is monsieur lister sara said he has promised to disguise you albert let him be quick about it then was the harsh reply i never had a more distasteful task but in the end i succeeded i concealed the cruel mouth and softened the brutal jaw until at last a very passable imitation of leonard appeared sara was loud in her praises and exuberant in her gratitude her pseudobrother did nothing save make my task more difficult by his irritation and impatience in the end when all was finished i handed him an overcoat of leonards which i had brought and we three started out in a large motor car which was waiting below for the chateau we arrived there a little before the accustomed hour for madames reception and the whole place seemed dark and deserted a strange manservant let us in and disappeared almost immediately the baroness came out of the shadows she too seemed affected by the tragedy of the moment her cheeks were unusually pale her almost flemish stolidity had disappeared the passages are unlocked she whispered let us go quickly in half an hour there may be people who arrive she led the way up the broad staircase i hesitated but sara thrust her arm through mine we trust you she said you must come with us arrived on the first floor we traversed what seemed to be an interminable corridor until we came at last to a green baize door which on being swung open revealed an inner one which the baroness unlocked immediately i was conscious that we were in the uninhabited part of the chateau the baroness who was in front came to a stop and we all paused we make a mistake she said in a low tone there is no place here for strangers she inclined her head towards me the man laughed a little brutally stranger or not he replied do you think i am going to let him go until this little affair is finished and after then what about us the baroness demanded safety with you is a matter of an hour or so but we remain bah was the contemptuous reply he will not inform against women sara will see to that i felt that it was time i had a word to say on my own account on the whole i decided i have seen as much as i care to of these proceedings i will find my way back again and await your return baroness the man laughed scornfully no art of mine could conceal the scowl which disfigured his face too late mr englishman he said you know too much remain where you are i looked down the muzzle of a particularly unpleasantlooking revolver which instinct told me the man at the other end would not hesitate to use at the same time i heard the sharp click of the door being closed behind me quite unnecessary i declared waving my hand towards the revolver if you wish me to stay i am entirely at your service in fact to tell you the truth i went on i am beginning to feel a certain amount of curiosity about this enterprise saras reputed brother laughed harshly youll have time to get over that he said warned by his tone sara stepped out of the shadows of the room he is not to be hurt she exclaimed that was a promise there was silence the room in which we were was unlit save by the little points of fire from the electric torches carried by the baroness and her companion there was something sinister in the sound of their soft breathing against the background of deep and solemn stillness suddenly a tongue of light flashed from saras own torch i saw then that the others were too much engrossed to be even considering my fate with a tape measure in his hand the man was tapping certain places upon the wall presently he made a mark with a pencil and turned around his face was livid with excitement nothing seems to have been touched here he muttered nothing has been touched the baroness assented calmly other rooms as you know have been ransacked the grounds have been dug up and the tower almost pulled to pieces but here where you sat in state and pulled the legs out of the spiders bodies and the souls out of your poor human victims well no one has thought of looking here the man chuckled but there was a certain malevolent uneasiness in his expression as he stared at the speaker my victims were not all unwilling eh he demanded the baroness had been feeling along the wall she touched a switch and a dull glow of light shone through a dustencrusted globe set in the ceiling there is still a connection she said it is better so you need have no fear the shutters are tightly closed no one will know that human beings have dared to penetrate into the spiders parlour i had my first comprehensive view of the rooma bare officiallooking apartment with a huge writing table near the window a heap of empty champagne bottles and cigar boxes in one corner there was dust everywhere it seemed indeed as though the room might not have been opened for many months you need have no fear the baroness repeated the shutters are fast closed you can look around on the scene of your former triumphs the telephone wires have been cut nothing else has been altered they stood facing one another the man and the woman from my point of vantage in the background i was conscious of a subtle change in the baroness the cold stolidity almost woodenness of her deportment had gone her lips were parted a little and there was something menacing in the gleam of her white teeth her eyes held expression expression which i could not analyse she seemed to bristle with sensation the man who faced her had become uneasy we talk too much he muttered it is enough for me that you have obeyed my orders and left all here untouched it is true she acknowledged searchers have almost wrecked this wing of the chateau and destroyed my grounds in search of your spoil but this bare little roomno it seemed so harmless so empty and besides there were many who shuddered to come near it he busied himself once more with the wall suddenly he took a knife from his pocket and cut down a great strip of the wall paper a little cry of triumph broke from his lips his fingers seemed to feel a crack he pushed and tugged till the sweat ran down his face finally with a rumble a sliding door opened to the extent of about a foot he paused to gain breath and turned back to the baroness with a leer of triumph your treasure hunters were but simpletons he scoffed they saw as far as the end of their noses he seemed to become suddenly conscious that no one was looking at him we were all staring at that gradually widening aperture in the wall staring at the menacing figure which had unexpectedly appeared there the man on whose behalf we had embarked upon this expedition swung abruptly around his lips opened but no sound came he stood shaking and choking mr thomson wiping the dust from his clothes stepped into the room excellently timed he said nodding pleasantly at me count the trapped mans recovery was amazing i doubt whether mr thomson quick though he was would have escaped the bullet from that suddenly upraised revolver but for the baroness i have never before nor since looked upon anything so marvellous as her swift action she struck his arm such a blow that we heard the cracking of the bone caught him by the shoulders as though he had been a boy flung him on to the floor and was there with her hand upon his throat and all the devils ever born of a womans hatred glaring out of her face as she leaned over him it took the three of us to drag her away while there was still a spark of life in the man when at last we succeeded he was unconscious and the marks of her fingers were there as though photographed on his throat mr thomson raised a whistle to his lips and blew it i think perhaps he remarked the police will be kinder the little supper party which we had grown accustomed to expect after each period of utility to our chief took place on the following night under somewhat unusual circumstancesin the saloon of the steamship zeebrugge one of the new dover and ostend fleet we were pitching pretty heavily and facing a northwest gale but it happened that we were all pretty good sailors and though the high seas came thundering against the closed portholes and the electric lights swung above our heads we were quite able to do justice to a very excellent repast there were so few passengers that the chief steward winked at our smoking in a corner of the saloon and over our last glass of wine our host threw a little cautious light upon the meaning of our latest adventure the particularly unpleasant gentleman he observed upon whom you inflicted a likenessa very excellent likenessto mr leonard cotton was as you have doubtless surmised at one time known as the count von hantzauel whose notorious deeds in brussels during the german occupation are infamous throughout the world i wouldnt have insulted leonard to such an extent if id had the least idea beforehand who he was going to turn out to be i declared i shall hate my own face more than ever leonard groaned mr thomson smiled amiably von hantzauel certainly seemed to have the gift he observed of making his name hated even amongst those who were personally strangers to him the baroness spens as you may have surmised was one of those who unfortunately for her had been forced into a certain degree of association with him he made his headquarters in her house and sowed the seeds of a hatred of which last night he reaped the harvest forgive my somewhat confused metaphor you follow me i dare say why was he such an idiot as to come back rose enquired because mr thomson explained it was the baroness wish the baroness spens is a very clever and unforgiving woman and she has been several years laying her plans for getting von hantzauel back into brussels but the inducement rose persisted von hantzauel thomson explained followed in the footsteps of his illustrious chief he was a collector of such trifles as jewellery money and all manner of objets darts of a small and portable character with the aid of a german smith whom he sent for when in residence at brussels he constructed a very ingenious hiding place in the chateau for his loot when the reversal of fortunes came he was one of those pigheaded obstinate asses who refused to believe in what was coming and he only escaped from brussels by a miracle since then he has used every argument to persuade the baroness to bring his little collection over the frontier to holland the baroness played with him as a cat might with a mouse she declared that his hiding place was so ingenious that even with the plan he had sent her she had failed to discover it then she reminded him of the past and declared that the treasure should not leave her house without a visit from him finally as you know she succeeded the visit was arranged for the whole affair called for a certain amount of diplomacy the direct intervention of the belgian police would have meant the arrest of von hantzauel on the frontier the affair had to be managed differently the baroness is an old friend of mine and she sought my aid in what capacity i asked quickly and what has become of the treasure mr thomson smiled vaguely he listened for a moment to the bump of the sea against the portholes then he filled our glasses an answer to those questions just now is scarcely possible he replied we will call them if you please conundrum number three conundrum number four the courtship of naida rose leonard and i first saw naida modeschka dance from the wings of the great london music hall where she was the star performer and where we very much to our surprise had been offered a brief engagement i think that from our point of vantage she was even more wonderful than from the vast and densely packed auditorium none of us had ever before seen movement like it the wooden boards her feet touched seemed at the moment of contact to become a sea of quicksilver she had her own arrangement of lights and she floated in and out of them her pale face and limbs glittering at one moment like polished marble the next only a shadow a skulking floating shadow with a pair of great black eyes shining from a terrified face she never told us or any one else whence came the music to which she danced notes as full of arcadian and mysterious poetry as grieg and sometimes breathing the riotous passion of dvork she seemed to delight in unexpected interludes in sudden changes and there was something even a little cynical in the outburst of savage passion with which her dance concluded there was not the slightest doubt however as to her complete success the audience at this particular music hall the parthenon is seldom jadedthey are drawn from too wholesome a class of peoplebut they are as quick to appreciate a new thing as any audience in the world there were qualities in naidas dancing which even the russian ballet had failed to disclosepride of the body cynical contempt of passion for its own sake and underneath the soft alluring call to love she stood by us panting after her fifth recall the faintest of perfumes something between green tea and russian violets seemed to be exuded of her breathlessness from the trembling exquisitely shaped body concealed for the sake of ancient prejudices under a flowing veil of black net more subtly appealing to modern perceptions than even the naked eve reaching up to the branches of the apple tree we were a little spellbound but her eyes caught mine and i spoke mademoiselle i said you dance as no other on earth why not include heaven monsieur she answered quickly for i fear there will be no dancing like mine there she made her final bow and came back to where a gaunt and stolid maid pushed past us and wrapped her in a long black satin coat trimmed and lined with black sable fur the maid would have hurried her off but she lingered it is your turn monsieur she asked me you three who appear now i assented the piano was already being drawn into position rose stood a few yards away looking at her hair in a glass she had already thrown aside her coat in the auditorium i fancied that i could still hear that faint emotional quiver lingering like the echo of feeling it is our turn i replied but how an audience could be expected to listen to our banalities after the atmosphere you have created i cant imagine she made no acknowledgment of my compliment she was looking at me as though engrossed in her own thoughts so that in those few seconds i found myself studying her no breathing person could have called her beautiful even goodlooking she was dark with dark hair eyes and eyebrows her cheek bones were almost prominent her chin narrow her mouth large but so sensitive that it seemed never at rest there was not an atom of makeup on her face and her pallor in the light in which she stood was almost ghastly her arms and hands were as lovely as the rest of her body i could have imagined her severely dressed in the classical shades of a great library one of the leaders of womens thought i shall stay here for your performance she announced please do your best sanda fetch me a chair at the risk of seeming egotistical i am here going to announce that we three had very much improved in our work during these days of our prosperity roses perfectly chosen gowns her renewed health of body and mind seemed to have given to her voice a richer and sweeter note and to her feet all the fascinating lightness of modern dancing leonards sense of humour had broadened and his capacity for finding new stories amounted positively to genius i myself in better health certainly found myself a more adequate partner for rose both in singing and dancing whatever influence our patron had had to use in the earlier days to secure us engagements was unneeded now we were at the parthenon according to instructions but the engagement had been given to us on our own application and without any outside intervention perhaps because our unambitious performance soothed the jangled nerves of our audience we were extraordinarily well received that night when it was all over i found naida still waiting in her chair she rose at once and took my arm you will escort me to my dressing room she said with the greatest pleasure i assented you see she went on i am making the way easy for you you are a myrmidon of the great mr thomson are you not i was startled i know a mr thomson i admitted but it is some time since i have heard from him her eyes mocked me the cleverest of all conspirators she said as she came to a standstill outside her dressing room and waved her hand to rose and leonard are those who do not fear to tell the truth lies lead far on the road to failure but we each have our own methods believe me i assured her earnestly i have never heard of you in my life except from the newspapers and you have never seen me before never she looked at me steadfastly her dark heavily lidded eyes seemed a little contracted her lips smiled as though they had a joke to themselves she was a strangelooking creature well she conceded granted that this is our first meetingwhat of it monsieur i pray that it may not be our last i answered with ready sincerity her fingers strayed to the knob of the door you will receive your belated instructions before very long she said then i shall make it easy for you you may visit me when you like i live at milan court and so monsieur she held her fingers to my lips i am bound to admit that i hurried back to leonard a little shaken a conquest my son he observed looking up from a bowl of cold water and rubbing his head vigorously rose is furious with you she has asked me to take her out to supper capital i replied spitefully i will join you our conversation that evening finally turned upon a subject which we had once or twice lately skirted somewhat apprehensively we supped at an inconspicuous but desirable table in the milan grill room and in a style which would have seemed to us only a few months ago wildly extravagant there was no jazz band to affront our ears and disturb our digestion we were in touch with the more epicurean type of deliberate pleasureseekers the more select crowd who had studied or imbibed the philosophy of pleasure everywhere was an air of warmth and luxury the men and women mostly in couples by whom we were surrounded were chiefly those who had eschewed the hysterical quest of promiscuous pleasure for the more settled but not less fascinating ways of bohemian domesticity an actormanager close at hand was giving a digest of a play he had read that afternoon to his leading ladyalso his inseparable companion a celebrated producer and wellknown actor was enjoying a brief period of rest with the only woman in his life who had learnt to soothe as well as to fascinate a widely known and hardworked barrister the tragedy of whose domestic life was known to all his friends was revelling in one hour of peace during the day in the company of a sympathetic and very human little lady from an adjoining theatre the atmosphere to us who had only lately found our way into the paths of prosperity was almost intoxicating it was leonard who started things by raising his glass to our benefactor we drank the toast gratefully enough then rose for the first time put into words what was so often in the minds of all of us maurice she asked me how long does our bargain with mr thomson actually last there was no time limit i answered not perhaps in words she persisted but how long in your mind do you consider we are morally bound metaphysical history would suggest the period of our lifetime i replied there is no precedent for a soul once disposed of being returned to its owner she sighed it seems a pity we really havent anything more to gain one would like to settle down and enjoy now with a clear conscience why one of you could marry me we hadnt thought of that leonard said drily the fact of it is i groaned we are both in love with you she leaned back in her chair and looked at us for a moment i think she realised that i had spoken the truth then all i can say she murmured is that you are better actors than i thought you wereand greater dears we are wandering from the subject i said firmly i propose that we apply to mr mephistopheles thomson for a time limit i should think that is just as far as i got in my daring proposal i sat with my mouth unbecomingly open and a fatuous look of astonishment upon my face my two companions also were stricken dumb arrived apparently from nowhere neat inconspicuous and unobtrusive mr thomson paused before our table and greeted us with pleasing cordiality congratulations to all of you he said as he drew up a chair and seated himself i was at the parthenon tonight if naida modeschkas performance was the most wonderful yours was certainly the most pleasing item upon the programme we have improved i think rose admitted modestly nice frocks do make so much difference and good food leonard murmured and no anxieties i ventured apropos of which the newcomer enquired how goes our bargain do you want your souls back again if youve quite finished with them rose confessed we should hate to seem ungrateful but so far as we are concerned all our ambitions are satisfied we are earning twice as much as we spend leonard pointed out and we could book up for two years i put in mr thomson who upon his arrival had made mystic signs to a waiter watched the champagne being poured into our glasses we were not overcareful in the matter of our expenditure but champagne was the one luxury we denied ourselves except on special occasions you disappoint me our patron confessed rose leaned forward across the table she spoke quickly almost tumultuously dont think us ungrateful she begged we are not we often think of that wretched night at cromer when you became our good angel many and many a time since we have blessed your name mr thomson bowed ours was a bargain he said and you have fulfilled your share of it my disappointment springs from another cause i have pictured you in my mind as children of the land of adventure we have lifted the curtain i ventured to remind him you have done more he admitted you have all three shown capacity and courage why withdraw believe me the end and aim of life is not prosperity the moment the love of adventure ceases the slumber of middle age commences there isnt anything more fatal to genius or to the fuller life than a contented conscience a swelling bank account and an amble along the easy ways i give you back what you are pleased to call your souls if you will in five years time the three of you will be prematurely middleaged the limits of your ambitions will be fixed one day will be as another with the passing of all mystery from your lives will come the adipose somnolence which breeds mental and moral indigestion i think that we were all hypnotised the calmness of his speech his precise and unemotional handling of words seemed to lend to them an even greater significance before we had realised what was happening mr thomson was on his feet again we will make that time limit one year dating from the night at cromer he pronounced yes we all three assented tomorrow afternoon at four oclock he added turning to me you will call upon naida modeschka the dancer who is now performing at the parthenon i have already made her acquaintance i told him she spoke to me this evening she referred to you mr thomson smiled benevolently naida is wonderful he said nevertheless you will call ask her what has become of felix worth afterwards place yourself in her hands she will explain exactly what is required of you as unobtrusively as he had come he departed he attracted no attention and looked neither to the right nor to the left as he vanished through the revolving door we all looked at one another mr mephistopheles thomson rose murmured with an accent on the christian name leonard remarked naida received me very graciously on the following afternoon i was a little surprised that she had made no attempt whatever to alter her surroundings or in any way to create an atmosphere the ordinary hotel furniture and hangings were lightened only by a profusion of flowers mostly deep red roses in place of the flowing robes one might have expected the great dancer wore a severe tailormade costume of grey tweed her hair was brushed plainly back from her forehead and tied with ribbon behind there was no other caller present when i arrived it would be charming of you to come so soon she murmured as she held out her hand if it were your own will which brought you my own will would have brought me here in any case i assured her but as it happens i have another mission i am to ask you what has become of felix worth i looked into the eyes of another woman for a moment and i was afraid her momentary fit of fury however passed she motioned me to a chair how much do you know of this matter she asked nothing at all i answered promptly that is the way with him she ruminated his agents never know anything that does not i trust prevent my finding great pleasure in making your acquaintance mademoiselle i ventured she looked at me curiously sixty seconds ago i should have described her as being off the stage disappointedly plain i realised my mistake it does not prevent your paying me any compliments you choose she replied there is no reason why we should not be friendseven comrades the only cloud between us appears to be that it will fall to your lot to kill the only man i have ever really cared for i started in my chair i can assure you i told her i am not out for that sort of thing at all but it will come she persisted it will not i contradicted her firmly i have done all the killing i want to in fair fighting i have a weakness for adventures but nothing would induce me to become an assassin she looked at me contemplatively leaning across from her chair with her chin balanced upon her hands then she got up and brought me a queer round wooden box of fragrant russian cigarettes she herself lit one and i followed her example are you afraid dear earnest englishman she asked that i should hate you let me tell you the truth for this man i have no love any more and he must die he may live or he may die i answered but i am no mans executioner we shall see she remarked indifferently you are a just man beyond a doubt but i like you you are different from all others in what respect i enquired i admit you here she replied to the intimacy of a private visit yet you have not yet suggested that you should become my lover it intrigues me this diffidence i felt a sudden desire to get out of the room she laughed at me laughed with simple unaffected mirth laughed till she came over and laid her hands upon my shoulders go away dear man she begged before i make myself foolish about you you shall sit at my side tonight and perhaps then when you see what others think of me you may whisper different things and where do i sit by your side tonight i asked you and your two friends she said sup with me in the restaurant downstairs at midnight convey my compliments and this invitation to your charming lady companion i shall see her at the theatre and will confirm it she gave me her fingers and held them for a moment against my lips then i went out a little dazed i began to fear that naida was going to make trouble for me at the theatre that evening she demanded my constant attendance twice she sent notes to my dressing room and in the midst of the tumultuous applause which followed her wonderful dancing when she stood in the wings with us after her seventh recall she tore one of the red roses which had been thrown on to the stage from its cluster and thrust it in my buttonhole so she whispered they will know from whom that rose comes your fingers will caress it when you sing they will applaud you the more for my sake this was all very pretty and soothing to my vanity and i frankly admit in its way pleasant but i had all the time the feeling that it was likely to bring trouble upon me when in her most charming manner naida had issued her invitation to rose her enthusiastic acceptance was entirely marred for me by the manner of it a supper party will be perfectly delightful rose declared smiling with dangerous sweetness i have a little headache tonight but that will pass in any case you will not mind if leonardif mr cotton should bring me away early so long as you do not rob me of my dear cavalier naida replied to my dismay squeezing my arm i marched leonard on one side taking advantage of the insistent roars of recall which drew naida back on to the stage look here len i said i dont know what this game is but im playing it for the three of us i am obeying orders so far as mademoiselle naida is concerned if rose wont see it i shall rely upon you ill do my best old chap he promised with a gloom which i fancied was not altogether natural its a jolly hard situation though rose had asked me to take her out to supper tonight and to dinner on sunday night you can count that dinner off i said firmly we three have dined together every sunday night since we started out sometimes its been a scrag of mutton and a glass of beer once or twicethat week at cromer lennot even that on sunday night its going to be caviare and a maryland chicken and im in it thats all right leonard assured me of course rose thought that youd be in attendance on naida you and i wont have any misunderstanding at any rate len i insisted naida means just as much to me as that bit of fluff on your coat when our year is up i shall ask rose to marry me and though youre the dearest fellow in the world i hope shell have me and not you i shant take advantage old chap leonard promised with a sigh but its getting filthily difficult she pretended she wanted me to kiss her last night ill punch your head if you do i answered savagely our call the supper party did not improve matters we found quite a distinguished little gathering in the foyer of the milan including the managing director of the parthenon some of the best known dramatic critics a famous actor and his wife another and a lady who might have been a foreign ambassador and two other wellknown and distinguished men about town naida did her duty by placing a very distinguished nobleman with cosmopolitan tastes upon her right but to my secret dismay and the wonder of the rest of the company she insisted upon my occupying the seat on the other side of her now she whispered looking at me from under her eyelashes with that slow curious smile upon her lips i have made the little lady jealous is it not so and also the great managing director who pays me my salary and perhaps others but what does it matter you are content the lie came uneasily from my lips naida however seemed satisfied it was borne in upon me now that it was her deliberate purpose part of the game in fact not only to exploit me as a victim of her charms but to practically advertise her simulated infatuation i watched rose flirting desperately with a very attractive man who was seated upon her left and for a moment i felt that the situation was impossiblethat i should do best to mutter a few plain words to my hostess and deliberately dissociate myself from the rle into which i had drifted then i remembered our chiefs confidencenaida spoke to me with unexpected kindness i caught the echo of roses unnecessarily joyous laughter and i changed my mind thenceforth i played my part i lent myself to the gaiety of the moment we were all young together the wine was good life was good the very music seemed playing us down the avenues of pleasure from a gay party we became almost an uproarious one we moved outside into the lounge for our coffee naida never letting me for an instant leave her side relegating to me the duties of host thrusting her pocketbook into my hand insisting that i should order the cigars and liqueurs fee the waiters and even sign the bill on her behalf there were many smiles amongst the little company shrugs of the shoulders and whispered enquiries as to my identity my fictitious position seemed to make me an object of envy but i never altogether lost my head i waited for my opportunity and when it came i rose quickly to my feet and walked over to roses side her companion of the moment had been summoned away to speak to some acquaintances in another part of the lounge rose i began sternly she looked at me with a bright but artificial smile i leaned down and continued under my breath i play the buffoon to order i reminded her you too have your part in this indeed she murmured yes your part is not to make mine more difficult your part is to remember then i stopped short it was a difficult position there was my contract with leonard to be borne in mind to remember what she asked looking at me more naturally the things of which your heart assures you i answered i am only human if i fail tonight the fault will not be wholly mine after that there was a change in roses demeanour and once when our eyes met she smiled naida however still played her part of sorceress she seemed impatient of every word she was forced to speak to others she whispered often in my ear even her fingers sought mine it was just at this stage that for the first time i noticed the somewhat singular appearance of a man who was watching us from the few seats upstairs reserved for guests of the hotel who were not in evening dress as though he sought concealment he had found a chair in the most remote corner and was half hidden by a slight projection of the wall he had a mass of black hair a heavy sallow face from which one formed the idea that he had recently removed a beard and dark staring eyes he was untidily dressed for his surroundings amongst which he seemed curiously out of place an impulse prompted me to point him out to naida she glanced in the direction i indicated but merely shrugged her shoulders dear friend she whispered you forget that i am a famous person more so abroad than in your little island there are many who watch me with thoughts in their heart which they will never dare to utter there are many who would give a share of their possessions to be seated where you are seated to be treated as i am treating you the man is a foreigner without a doubt i remarked and foreigners she answered with a stabbing little glance are quicker to feel and understand than englishmen we kept the party going until long past closing time and then an adjournment of our diminished numbers was made to naidas suite here she distributed signed photographs to her remaining guests accompanied by a wave of the hand which meant dismissal rose and leonard were amongst the first to leave rose with a look in her eyes which might have meant anything i stepped quickly forward naida looked at me warningly now that we had left the lounge it seemed to me that her demeanour had to some extent changed for your impatience monsieur maurice she said you will be the last offer the cigarettes if you please and your friend mr cotton will he not take a whisky and soda before he goes one by one they drifted away rose and leonard were driven home by one of the formers new admirers the time came when we were alone naida listened to the closing of the door and to the clanging of the lift gate then with her back to the table against which she was leaning she looked across at me with an odd little smile upon her lips so we are alone my friend it has that appearance i admitted taking one of her cigarettes and lighting it i await your further instructions she nodded her head slowly she seemed to be considering my attitude my further instructions she mimicked oh monsieur maurice what a strange person ring the bell on your left please i obeyed a maid presented herself at once from the inner room naida spoke to her for a moment in some weird language then she turned towards me yawned and stretched herself prepare for a shock she said for ten minutes i leave you you seat yourself in that easy chair you take a whisky and soda and the evening paper you make yourself at home you understand perfectly i answered not at all sorry for a few minutes solitude then au revoir but have no fear she added looking back with a mocking smile i shall return a quarter of an hour or so passed i heard naida telephoning from her bedroom and heard her voice in conversation with her maid then she reappeared she was wearing a yellow creation tied around her with a girdle chinese sandals tied with broad yellow ribbon and her unloosed hair was gathered together with ribbon of the same colour she displayed herself for my admiration you admire monsieur maurice you like the colour you look charming i replied and now she held up her finger you are not to stir she directed waving her finger at me she moved towards the door which led into the corridor opened it softly and peered outside then as though not satisfied she disappeared altogether when she returned she closed the door with a little slam and threw herself into a chair opposite to me and now i repeated patiently it is the hardest part of your task this monsieur maurice she said with a demure little droop of the eyes you see the time it is exactly two oclock for one hour you remain where you are at the end of that hour you are free you may then leave and if you wish it so your courtship of naida is over and for that hour i asked a little unsteadily she came and sat on the arm of my chair her face was upturned to mine shall i keep you company she whispered i leaned down and took the kiss she offered me i held her for a moment in my arms then i gripped her wrists naida i said and my own voice sounded to me unfamiliar of course i know this is a game but i dont understand the rules we make them she murmured i am in love with rose mindel i continued i should be married to her at the present moment but for a stupid agreement between leonard cotton and myself made when we three started out together i am in love with her but im no joseph you know what you are and your power im not any different from other men but you do not care then she asked quickly there isnt any ordinary young man of my type i answered who has drunk your wine and sat by your side all the evening and received your kindness and finds himself here alone with you who wouldnt carein a waythe wrong way i care like that if its any good and now you understand she slipped from her place kissed me on both eyes and ran across to the door of the inner room she looked back at me only for a moment opened her lips said nothing and disappeared closing the door softly behind her i mixed myself the stiffest whisky and soda i had ever concocted in my life lit a cigar from a box i found on the sideboard and sat down to watch the clock at five minutes to three i was walking up and down the room with my overcoat on at a minute to the hour as i stood with my eyes glued to the clock the inner door softly opened naida stood framed upon the threshold there was a look of distress upon her face monsieur maurice she said i had made up my mind to say nothing but that was wrong you are a very honourable young man and i have not met many it has been promised to me that no harm shall come to you but yetgo warily to the lift she disappeared and closed the door for the first time she locked it somehow i felt as i stepped out into the corridor that the dangers which might be waiting for me were small things i stood for several seconds looking up and down to reach the lift i had to traverse the whole of the corridor turn to the left and pass along another shorter one i stepped out carelessly enough and thenthe scantily lit passage seemed suddenly filled with whispering voices with eyes peering at me from mysterious corners the soft carpets behind me were reverberant with muffled and stealthy footsteps i was acutely conscious of the presence of danger as i neared the corner of the corridor every nerve of my body was bristling with apprehension before i turned i paused for a moment and looked behind there was only a single electric lamp burning but i could see dimly along the empty space to the end there was no sign of any moving figure nor any sound then i turned the corner to find myself suddenly seized in a pair of giant arms the dull flicker of upraised steel before my eyes the sallow brutelike face the black flaming eyes of the man who had watched me from the lounge within an inch or two of me i had no chance to call out my assailants left hand was upon my throat i could see him gathering strength to drive that knife down into my heart my brain was perfectly active i waited with tense muscles for the terrible moment meaning to fling myself on one side in the hope that i might escape mortal injury from that first blow at any rate and then i saw something loom up behind i saw an arm raised even higher than my captors and i heard the wickedest sound in lifethe crash of dull metal into a mans skull the grasp upon my throat was instantly relaxed doors were thrown open along the corridor and i sank back into a momentary fit of unconsciousness if our customary supper party with mr thomson lacked some of those qualities which in the earlier days of our adventures had made it so wonderful a thing the change of venue and our hosts curious genius in devising new dishes still contrived to make the occasion a memorable one we met this time in a private room at the hotel albion at brighton whither a telephone message had summoned us earlier in the day mr thomson spick and span as ever looking in the pink of condition commended to us the best oysters in the world and sipped almost reverently the contents of a dustcovered bottle of chablis i am not sure he told us with the air of one imparting grave knowledge that in these days it is not possible to find better vintages out of london than one comes across even in the restaurants de luxe this wine for instance the wine is wonderful rose agreed these oysters are wonderful too and i never saw such a lobster mayonnaise as that upon the sideboard but dear mr thomson if you expect us to enjoy our supper do be merciful there will be no waiter in the room for at least five minutes give us some idea as to the meaning of this last adventure mr thomson smiled benevolently why not he said here is the story in a very few words there was in london ten days ago the most dangerous anarchist and political disturber of the peace in europe his name is a household word to all of you he passed here as paul kansky naidas lover i ventured as a matter of fact her husband mr thomson explained his removal was absolutely necessary for the internal peace of this country there were a hundred charges on which he could have been arrested but not one for which he could have been safely put out of the way being at times open to accept a contract of this nature i undertook to dispose of him i shivered a little as i listened mr thomson continued very much as though he were referring to some ordinary commercial undertaking kanskys one weakness was naida modeschka his one passion jealousy with the aid of our young friend here i succeeded in fanning that passion into a redhot flame i succeeded too in engineering such an attempt at wilful murder on the part of kansky that his own demise owing to the apparently accidental intervention of a casual rescuer seemed to occur quite naturally you behold the result of an exceedingly welllaid scheme this mischievous person is dead and buried under the name he bore at the milan hotel and which the great world of his followers does not recognise then my rescuer i exclaimed john p martin the american oil trust man precisely mr thomson interrupted mr martin was my agent a man of iron and a professional fighter planted in room number eightyfour with instructions to intervene on your behalf in such a way that kansky could give no more trouble and those other two men who gave evidencethe witnesses also arranged for mr thomson acknowledged it was really a very wellplanned affair the man kanskys passion for naida was proved by the letters produced in court his attack upon our young friend here provided ample excuse for mr martins vigorous action the witnesses of course were able to declare that kansky was in the act of committing a probable murder and that martins contra attack with its unfortunate results saved your life and naida rose enquired mr thomson smiled how should we be able to deal with these little affairs he observed but for the vagaries my dear miss mindel of your wonderful sex naida was a very willing accomplice in our little scheme for seven years in a brutalised russia she had lived under that mans dominance when she was fortunate enough to escape over here it was certainly not with the idea of again submitting to it i hear the waiter any more questions for whom were you acting i asked eagerly how did this affair come into your hands mr thomson seemed to be listening to the roar of the sea which came to us pleasantly through the open window ah he murmured that again is a question the answer to which i fear must be postponed shall we call it conundrum number four conundrum number five the tragedy at greymarshes spring leonard declared fanning himself with his straw hat and breathing in the ozone from the waves which rippled up to within a few yards of our chairs is upon us i must get some new frocks rose murmured absently tomorrow i reflected i must go through my tennis flannels jolly goodlooking girl that was with the party from the grange at the show last night leonard continued reminiscently i liked the way her eyelashes curled jolly fine figure too the tutor man is quite handsome rose ruminated he ties his black evening bow just the way i like handsome i scoffed why hes got a cast in his eye he reminds me more than anything of the plaster villains in the chamber of horrors at madame tussauds i didnt notice any cast rose sighed her eyes turned dreamily seawards he looked at me hard enough too when i was dancing theyre a strange crew at the grange i observed lighting a cigarette from the case which leonard had thrown me i cant altogether size them up rose turned towards me reproachfully you are becoming obsessed maurice with your love of adventures she complained gently you think of nothing else surely in this dear oldworld place we can have a little rest we can drop the tenseness of the last few months and become just simple natural human beings again the chief didnt send us down here for nothing i ventured dont forget she reminded me that at our last supper at brighton i begged for a little rest only a few weeks afterwards he sent us here i am quite certain that nothing ever happened at greymarshes if we get into any trouble here it will simply be because the spring is so disturbing she looked at me lazily almost affectionately then she looked at leonard his hat was tilted over his eyes and his hands were clasped around his knees there was very little of his goodnatured pudgy face to be seen i wonder she continued with a little sigh why neither of you ever make love to me im very attractive the situation leonard began taking his hat off and sitting up oh hang the situation rose interrupted irritably if you cant make up your minds which of you it is to be you might toss up or something heres spring coming on im twentytwo years old and i havent got a young man you will drive me to answer some of the desperate notes which are showered upon me by lovesick youths from the front row i had another last night from arthur i believe that he really loves me im afraid arthur will have to be spanked i said rose made a little grimace there is such a thing mr maurice lister she declared as playing the watchdog just a little too zealouslyespecially in the springtime see whos coming i think i shall turn round and smile we both looked along the sands in the direction which she had indicated by her parasol a tall weedy young man dressed with the utmost care in a grey flannel suit brown shoes and linen spats a panama hat and a quaintly impossible tie came slowly towards us swinging a stick in his hand as he drew near he diffused multitudinous odours his pimply face was suffused with a deep flow of colour we realised at once what was going to happen the young man whom we knew by repute only as mr arthur dompers established at the grange with a tutor and a small company of satellites had evidently made up his mind to speak to us he came to a standstill sidled round to the front of us and raised his hat good morning i say youll forgive my saying sowhat awfully jolly show of yours ripping now i cannot say that any of us took to this young man and considering our bohemian manner of life we none of us had a fancy for chance acquaintances the gentle rebuke which we had meditated however died away first on roses lips and then on mine it became apparent to us that the boy was horribly nervous glad you like it i rejoined so nice of you rose murmured quite a crowd from your place last night wasnt there leonard observed thats right the young man acquiesced we all weighed inhad dinner early on purpose jolly place youve got here wont you sit down rose invited the boy squatted promptly at her feet he wore pink socks and he reeked of scent yet there was something a little pathetic in his obvious desire to be friendly are you cramming for anything in particular i asked him i was supposed to go in for the army was the dubious reply but the exams are so jolly difficult i failed for sandhurst twice now theyre trying to get me in at cambridge so that i can join a cadet corps the exams are so much stiffer since the war rose remarked consolingly are any of your people down here with you i enquired the boy shook his head i havent any people to speak of he confided except an uncle i have scarcely ever seen another unclemy fathers brotherleft me all my money sometimes the young man added with a queer flash of seriousness which made one forget his socks and his tie and his pimples i wish he hadnt it must be awfully nice though to feel that youve plenty of time in life for games and all that sort of thing rose remarked with a mild attempt at consolation im not very good at games the young man confessed mr duncombe and his friends are so much better than i am and they always laugh at me that is a very untutorlike thing to do rose declared indignantly the young man looked frightened mr duncombe is very good to mevery kind indeed he repeated in parrotlike fashion is he rose queried drily he has no end of people down so that we shouldnt be dull the young man went on theres his sistershes very kind to me too i think i shall have to marry her why rose asked in bewilderment i think mr duncombe would like me to was the resigned reply i am very fond of ella she sings and dances beautifully how old are you rose enquired the boy seemed on the point of making another parrotlike reply then he chanced to meet the kindly expression in roses face as she leaned towards him he hesitated theres a sort of secret about my age he confided mr duncombe likes me to tell every one that i am twenty and arent you i asked curiously he shook his head i shall be twentyone on saturday he said i shall be able to sign cheques of my own thenand make my will what do you want to make your will for rose asked youre strong enough arent you it is the duty of every one with a great deal of money to make their will directly they are twentyone the boy declared as though repeating a lesson if i had my own way he added looking up at rose i should leave a great deal of money to you but i dont suppose i shall be allowed to good gracious mr dompers rose exclaimed why i scarcely know you i like your face the young man continued earnestly if you saw the faces of the people who are staying at the grange you would know what i mean they all look as though they wanted something they remind me sometimes of a pack of hounds and they pretend not to but they are always watching me we had been so engrossed in the selfdisclosures of this halfwitted young man that we had not noticed the approach of another promenader along the sands it was a very different person who now accosted us hat in hand and a courteous smile upon his lips there was not a single criticism in which the most fastidious might indulge against hilary duncombes address his manners or his clothes good morning i am glad to see that my young ward has been finding friends the young man scrambled at once to his feet and stood awkward and speechless a little apart his tutor the very prototype of kindly and aristocratic ease addressed a few kindly remarks to us i am so thankful he went on when arthur finds courage to speak to any one he is a good boy but he finds conversation with strangers as a rule difficult we havent found him at all shy rose assured him with a smile at the subject of these remarks on the contrary he has been entertaining us quite nicely mr duncombe appeared to find roses favourable judgment a matter for personal gratification you are very kind he said i am sure that arthur has already told you how charmed we were with your performance last night my guests are agitating for a permanent change in our dinner hour that we may be more frequent attendants how nice rose murmured it does make quite a difference to see some civilised people in the reserved seats my sister duncombe continued would be delighted to make your acquaintance we may perhaps persuade you to pay us a little visit at the grange after the performance one evening arthur he went on we must get back now ella is waiting for a set of tennis they moved off together the impression they left behind was an unpleasant one a second ardalmont case leonard suggested in which case i reflected gloomily the mystery of our presence here is solved we were a little depressed as we returned to the hotela long greystone building once a farmhouse and still entirely unpretentious our worst prognostications were promptly verified the maidservant who waited upon us in the coffee room brought me a note with a typewritten address this was left here by a motorcyclist soon after you went out sir she announced i tore open the envelope and we pored over it accept any hospitality proffered from the grange encourage the young man arthur dompers to talk watch duncombe and report on the situation dull as ditchwater i exclaimed as i tore up the communication in disgust an unprepossessing cub of a boy whom his tutor permits to be fleeced at billiards and whom he is probably going to marry to his sister sordid as it can be not a thrill in it for us this may be my show rose mused her blue eyes very wide open and innocent i may be able to guide the young man from the matrimonial noose i wonder if he is really very rich perhaps ill marry him myself i suppose i could keep him on a chain i sipped my apritif gloomily the taste of true adventures was still upon my palate and the obviousness of this one repelled our ideas as to the menacing nature of arthur dompers surroundings were to some extent modified by our first visit to the grange which took place that night after the performance ella duncombe was a rather slangy somewhat unpleasantlooking young woman of apparently twentysix or twentyseven years of age she had a bad temper which she scarcely troubled to conceal and conducted herself generally towards her brothers charge with more contempt than toleration she scarcely fulfilled ones idea of an adventuress major lethwaite a guest in the house whom we had fixed upon as the person accustomed to play arthur dompers for a hundred pounds at billiards whenever finances ran low was to all appearance a perfectly harmless person who played sixpenny points at bridge and thought sixpenny pool excessive laura richardson a friend of ellas was just an ordinary fairly wellbred goodlooking but rather boisterous young person mrs scatterwell whose place apparently was that of chaperon was a handsome and rather silent woman whose sole interest seemed to be centred in duncombe himself the mnage was perhaps a curious one but scarcely suspicious our host himself appeared to have no reserves except on the subject of his young charge after the war was a bit of a knock for most of us he remarked meditatively as we men sat in the smoking room of the grange after a very excellent supper here are you lister with a game arm going round the country entertaining more or less i take it for your living i tried every job that was offered me and did very little good at any of them last of all i took this bearleading on and between you and me i sometimes wish to god i hadnt why i asked the boy seems amiable enough he seems so duncombe assented drily but the fact of it is that he is innately clumsy and innately deceitful there is no sport for which he shows the least aptitude ive tried them all with the same result the only thing he can do is swim and even then its hard work to get him into the sea unless the sun shines he hasnt the slightest taste i am bound by the trustees deed to allow him pocket money at the rate of a hundred pounds a month and half of it he spends in buying most outrageous clothes you know who he is i suppose not an idea i replied duncombes eyebrows were slightly raised he looked at me keenly dear me he exclaimed i took it for granted that you knew the story he is the welsh miners orphan who inherited two and a quarter million from jacob dompers of new york a nice little windfall for a cub like this isnt it i remembered reading the story in the newspapers some years ago so did leonard what about his relatives the latter asked the only one with whom i have had any communication duncombe replied was a welsh baptist minister who declined to have anything to say to the young man and who wrote me on half a sheet of brown grocery paper pointing out by means of many biblical texts that no person with a banking account could hope to escape the flames of the bottomless pit who placed the boy in your charge then i enquired the london agents for the new york solicitors i answered an advertisement i think they realise he went on that i have done my best i have tried to fit him for one or two professions in vain how long have you had him leonard asked duncombes long fingers played for a moment with his small black moustache there was a quick light in his eyes as he glanced towards leonard three years this june he answered then he was sixteen when he came to you duncombe assented with a little motion of his head you probably think that he is backward now for nineteen he said you should have seen him when he came to me i suppose he is backward i admitted and yet to tell you the truth i should have thought him older his twentieth birthday is this week duncombe told us i am getting a thousand a year and my expenses for looking after him and i havent any prospects of a job when he is out of my hands but i wish to heavens it was his twentyfirsti suppose we ought to see what the others are doing we made our way out into the hall which was the main living room of the grange arthur was playing billiards with lethwaite playing sullenly and without interest and turning around after every stroke to listen to the conversation between rose and the other two girls who were seated upon a lounge watching lethwaite just as we appeared went out with a stroke which was an obvious fluke arthur flung half a crown across the table and put up his cue illhumoredly beastly fluke he grumbled no one can play against such luck he strode over with his hands in his pockets to where rose was seated miss duncombe watched him approach with a sombre light in her dark eyes badtempered again arthur she observed hes a rotten fluker the young man rejoined surlily he wins all my pocket money for a single moment the whole situation seemed to be commonplace almost absurd here was a sulky illconditioned boy pitchforked into the charge of a very ordinary little company of gentlepeople who were doing their best to make him one of themselves duncombes rebuke was free from all severity and it was certainly merited arthur he said you should never accuse your opponent of fluking at any game take your defeat in silence if you cannot be pleasant about it mr lister or mr cotton would tell you that i am giving you good advice it was rather hard lines rose remarked smiling up at him the change in the boys face was almost amazing you see i was ninetyeight he explained and thats the seventh halfcrown ive lost following just on the last strokemiss mindeli saywould you sing something rose got up and made her way to the piano followed by the young man for a moment i saw precisely the look in miss duncombes dark eyes as had flashed in her brothers a few minutes before a look i fancied of patient but subdued malevolence almost as i realised it however it passed she motioned me to sit by her side mr lister she said i envy you your profession i think that anything in the world must be better than being bearleader to a boy like arthur your brother seems to have quite a great deal of influence over him i observed as much as any one could have perhaps she agreed after all what can one expect you cant make bricks without straw and its hard to give even the appearance of a gentleman to the son of a welsh miner look at him now arthur was standing by the piano listening to rose who had commenced to sing he was awkward selfconscious and ill at ease he kept on thrusting his hands into his pockets and taking them out again there was an expression in his eyes which angered me i suppose hes rather a handful i said duncombe who had been strolling about the room joined us just in time to hear the last remark he is that he admitted and yet after all i suppose i ought not to grumble im well enough paid for looking after him a word with you lister he drew me away to the farther end of the room we stepped out of the open window on to the broad gravel path it was a soft dark night with jagged masses of black cloud stretched across the sky below us was the sandy beach and away westwards we could hear the waves crashing amongst the rocks of the greymarshes bay its like this you see lister duncombe began speaking a little jerkily and watching me closely ive an agreement to look after this cub for five yearsa thousand a year and every mortal expense i must say the lawyers are generous about expenses i dont mind admitting that they cover the whole cost of my housekeeping and im able to save practically the lot im going in for fruit farming when the job comes to an end but the boys health is uncertain i cant help wondering what would happen to me if he were to die i suppose i ventured that your job would come to an end i couldnt afford that duncombe declared i want to secure against it if i can youre a stranger you can look at this matter with an open mind what do you think about insuring his life for say five or ten thousand pounds i wouldnt think of it i told him bluntly while the boy is under your charge he seemed disappointed but he nodded understandingly strikes you like that does it he sighed well i was afraid it might i expect youre right too reminiscent of the ardalmont mystery and all that sort of thing eh as you say i assented a little grimly the three of us were inclined to be gloomy during our walk home i dont know why rose said but i detest that household theyre all right in their way leonard observed dubiously but they seem all of them to hate their job so if theyre paid for looking after that young cub they ought to stomach their prejudices and do it i dont like him rose pronounced abruptly i thought he was just simple and foolish at first but ive come to the conclusion that i dont like him there isnt a single member of the household i do like theyre just sordid and peevish i think the chief might have found us something better to do perhaps he looks upon this in the light of a holiday task i suggested rose had a flash of inspiration just then she passed her arm through mine and notwithstanding the warm wind she shivered a little there is just one person in that household she said of whom i am terrified who is it leonard asked she shook her head wait she begged a few days later we were invited to a picnic party at greymarshes bay to celebrate arthurs supposed twentieth birthday duncombe had hired a little petrol launch and we took our lunch and bathing clothes along the coast it was a hot almost breathless day and we entered the water eagerly for our preluncheon bathe every one except mrs scatterwell bathed and she busied herself with one of the servants preparing luncheon in a shady spot somehow or other perhaps because of the brilliancy of the weather every one was in better spirits even duncombe and his pupil seemed to be on quite good terms they vied with one another in diving feats and arthur exulting in his one accomplishment clambered up the rocks more than once to a considerable height before he made his plunge presently however we all tired a little of the sport rose was already dressing in a convenient cave i was lying at full length enjoying a sun bath on the shingle when i heard duncombes voice from behind a great rocky promontory jutting out from the sea a little to my left one more arthur ive found a new place its the best of the lot i watched the young man climb obediently up the jagged boulder of rock the topmost ledge must have been at least twenty or thirty feet high and he was well on his way to it with his back turned to me when i became conscious of a queer feeling of apprehension the space of water into which arthur was to plunge was out of my sight but there was a little foam at the corner and i remembered how once on a stormy day i had stood and seen the broken waves thunder along this opening i rose to my feet waded in as far as i could and swam on my side towards the promontory arthur by now had reached the summit and was cautiously scrambling to his feet there was no sign anywhere of duncombe i swam on a few more strokes until i was suddenly conscious of a current i swam round it until i was directly facing arthur now standing upright and commencing to poise wait a moment arthur i called out get out of the way then he replied im coming over wheres duncombe i looked around but there was no sign of him yet i knew very well that he could not be more than a few yards away one moment arthur i shouted back he dropped his arms and stood there impatiently the water beneath me was a green colour full and sullen but there were little eddies which i could not understand considering the width of the channel then with a shock which notwithstanding the hot sun brought a shiver of fear through my body i discovered the truth scarcely three feet under water was a long line of jagged rock i turned over on my back and held up my hand arthur get out of the way will you he shouted im coming his hands were already upraised there was no time for anything but the truth illustration dont be a fool i answered theres a submerged rock right across here page dont be a fool i answered theres a submerged rock right across here you couldnt miss it climb down do you hear his arms fell to his sides for a single moment he stood there immovable not even his youth his bathing costume and the clear background of blue sky and sunlit air could lend him any grace of form or outline he seemed indeed from his short neck and hunched shoulders as he turned away almost deformed i looked all around there was no sign anywhere of duncombe i raised my voice and shouted hello duncombe i heard a splash as though he had slipped off the ledge of the rock behind me presently he came swimming round the corner whats the matter he shouted and wheres arthur hes climbing down from that rock i answered as duncombe came alongside ive just stopped his diving into this pool why he was by my side now and i pointed downwards to the dark line of cruelly jagged rock he looked for a moment concerned jove ive never noticed those he muttered theyre barely three feet i answered i can reach them duncombe turned over on his back we were in the shadow almost surrounded by rocks the voices of the others preparing the lunch sounded a long way away i suddenly felt as though i were cut off as though i could read the thoughts at the back of this mans brain as though i myself were in danger all the time he was drawing a little closer to me leonard and ella duncombe suddenly appeared upon the summit of one of the lower ranges of rocks come along to lunch the former shouted the moment had passed duncombe began to swim vigorously for the shore he was quite himself when he stepped out on to the sand i wouldnt make a fuss about that if i were you lister he suggested it looks as though i werent careful enough as a matter of fact i dont think the boy would have come to any harm arthur was seated by himself on the sands his arms clenched around his knees his face turned away from all of us he seemed to have ignored the summons to prepare for lunch probably not i answered trying to speak in as unconcerned a tone as possible boys and drunken men have a wonderful knack of avoiding accidents we strolled up the beach together duncombe paused and spoke to arthur come along he said theyre waiting luncheon for us arthur turned and looked at him i could not say that there was anything either malicious or reproachful in that look and yet it worried me he made no answer in words a few moments later however he scrambled to his feet and went to the rock behind which his clothes were lying duncombe seemed determined that nothing which had happened should interfere with the success of the picnic he abandoned all his reserve related anecdotes chaffed everybody in turn opened wine and absolutely created an atmosphere of pleasure leonard told stories and rose sang to us and danced upon the sands arthur after a preliminary fit of gloom drank far too much champagne for his age and became in his rather clumsy way as lighthearted as the rest he and ella sat for some time apart from the others his arm drawn through hers until presently they wandered off together to look for venetian shells the spoils of some longforgotten shipwreck on the whole the excursion which i had seen foredoomed to failure turned out a great success duncombe only once during the rest of the afternoon referred to the disturbing subject you dont suppose he suggested that arthur is thinking any more about that little affair eh why should he i answered coolly he must know that you made a mistake naturally duncombe assented i still dont think hed have come to any harm unless he bungled his dive but im glad all the same that you noticed the rocks that marked the end of the incidents worthy of note connected with the picnic except that arthur and ella stayed away for over an hour and that when they returned she was clinging to his arm with an almost protective air that night for the first time not a single member from the grange turned up at our performance somehow or other when i started for my customary early morning walk on the following day i knew that there was tragedy in the air a strange mist presage of storm and heat hung like an oppressive curtain over the land and stretched out seawards i almost regretted as i stood at the end of the little jetty that i had not departed from my usual custom and bathed the thought made me look back towards the shore duncombe in his dressing gown had just left the gardens of the grange and was descending the shingle to the sands i watched him throw off his gown and wade into the water presently he turned on his side and began swimming slowly out watching him i felt more than ever inclined to go and fetch my own bathing clothes then as i hesitated i noticed arthur following through the grange gardens scramble down the shingle throw off his dressing gown and also plunge into the sea something a little furtive about the manner in which he made his way across the lawn keeping always to the side of the hedge as though to escape observation and his subsequent almost crawling progress along the shingle puzzled me i had been down here many mornings but i had never seen arthur bathing before he was in the water now and swimming out with long powerful strokes towards duncombe whilst arthur was still almost undistinguishable in the sea and duncombe was lying lazily on his back as yet unconscious of his pupils approach i began to feel my first misgivings there was something unnatural in the very atmosphere that morning the sulphurous gloom the entire absence of sunshine the still oily water i found myself straining my eyes to catch a nearer glimpse of the boys face asking myself all the time why he had chosen this particular morning to bathe for the first time before breakfast nearer and nearer he came he passed me within a matter of fifty yards but he took no notice of my shout of greeting then as he rolled from side to side i caught a glimpse of his face he seemed to be swimming in entire unconsciousness of any physical effort his chin was a little protruded his eyes were fixed in an unnatural stare upon the spot where duncombe lay floating for a moment or two i felt a queer sensation of helplessness i called out again and i knew this time although i would not acknowledge it to myself that my cry was meant to be a warning to duncombe he heard me turned over on his side and to my horror began to swim away from the approaching form to swim away like a man in fear i really did all that a man could do attached by a rope to the end of the jetty were several rowing boats i unfastened one clambered down some steps and jumped into it as i swung it round i was just in time to see the boy alter his pace a little as though to intercept duncombe who had made for the jetty duncombe seeing himself cut off hesitated i held up my hand and shouted hullo there i bawled hullo duncombe im coming to take you in arthur took not the slightest notice of me he was now within a yard or so of duncombe and he suddenly seemed to raise himself from the water i had no doubt whatever then but that this was tragedy his mouth was opened and his rather prominent teeth showed in a wholly animal fashion his eyes seemed like specks of fire he was by the side of duncombe now and from where i was i can only say that it seemed to me as though he sprang at him just as a sea cat might have done if such a creature had ever existed his arms went round the other mans neck his legs around his loins then for the first time duncombe cried out a horrible cry the cry of a man face to face with a hideous death a cry which died away only as the water filled his mouth very slowly duncombe struggling in the others pitiless clasp like a weakling in the grip of an octopus the two bodies disappeared i rowed about for more than half an hour without seeing a sign of either they were washed up two days later the supper at a midland hotel where our chief bade us meet him a few evenings later was one of the least festive of all our meetings our depression was so noticeable that he presently commented upon it for whom this sorrow he enquired coldly for the tutor or his charge for the boy rose declared after all he was very young im sorry for duncombe leonard admitted frankly whatever hed been up to it was the most horrible death any one could die im sorry for both i insisted i think that somehow we ought to have prevented it mr thomson looked at us one by one out of his bright piercing eyes it was obvious that he was out of sympathy with us i continually forget he said coldly that i have to deal with sentimentalists no person who looked upon life from a sane point of view and who possessed full knowledge of all the facts could possibly regret the departure of either of them was duncombes story really true rose asked this one is at any rate our host replied arthur dompers was the orphan son of a welsh miner when he was fourteen years of age a relative in america died intestate and this boy was discovered to be the heir some lawyers in london were entrusted with the charge of him he was sent to four private schools from each one of which he was expelled three tutors one by one relinquished the task of training him up in the way he should go duncombe was the fourth tell us about mr duncombe please rose begged duncombe was one of those criminals who are too clever to come under the ban of the law thomson continued he was also a person against whom i had a very strong grievance when i heard that the boy arthur dompers had been committed to his charge i felt that if carefully watched duncombes time had come at last by some irony of fate the fortune left to arthur dompers became trebled and quadrupled in the hands of his trustees duncombes appetite for plunder already insatiable must have become a fever he was clever though he bided his time for three years he had charge of arthur dompers and during that three years he improved him immensely it was perfectly clear what he was waiting forfor the only period when the boy could be of real service to himnamely after his twentyfirst birthday he made his plans a long way ahead with great cunning he kept secret the day of the boys majority you attended a picnic i thinka birthday party it was supposed to be his twentieth birthday leonard observed in reality his twentyfirst thomson went on on the morning of that day the boy made his will leaving the bulk of his estate to ella duncombe and large legacies to the rest of the family he also left a letter addressed to ella duncombe in which he made clear the relations between them and spoke of their impending marriage with those documents in his possession duncombe had no more use for the boy there is no doubt from your report lister that he deliberately made his first attempt upon his life on that very morning there is no doubt also that the boy halfwitted though he was in his sullen way saw through the whole thing his hate for duncombe became a slowburning passionand there i think is the story of the tragedy and the will i asked it was committed to the flames on the morning of the tragedy by duncombes sisteralso the letter the estate goes to the crown rose sighed all that money and no one any better off mr thomson shrugged his shoulders the lawyers to the estate he told us have made over ten thousand pounds to the duncombe family i took my courage into my hands i know your attitude towards questions sir i said but i feel bound to ask you one concerning this episode what on earth did you expect to gain by bringing us in touch with it our host sipped his wine thoughtfully i do not welcome questions he admitted but bearing in mind the fact that this affair has been without any features of interest for you i will reply i knew perfectly well that duncombe would make some attempt upon the life of arthur dompers you were there to watch for it you succeeded your report would have released the boy from duncombes control events however marched too quickly on whose behalf then were we acting leonard asked you and all of us were we philanthropists or detectives our host shrugged his shoulders and helped himself to a cigar that he replied will be conundrum number five conundrum number six the dukes dilemma how does one address a duke rose asked looking up from the depth of her easychair no idea i replied i dont suppose we shall see anything of him i only knew one leonard murmured reminiscently he was at harrow and we used to call him tubby i dont see that thats going to help us rose remarked however then the door of our sitting room opened and to our surprise our host entered he bowed to rose and nodded to us in friendly fashion very good of you to come down here and help us along he said pleasantly ignoring the fact that we were being paid fifty pounds a week and our expenses to help provide his guests with entertainment i hope youre quite comfortable we all three murmured an unqualified affirmative the arrangements made for our comfort were indeed beyond criticism youre not any relation to the cotton who started bowling googlies for harrow in his last term i suppose the duke queried addressing leonard leonard modestly pleaded guilty and our host showed his first signs of real interest youll play for the castle this afternoon he begged were playing the rest of the county and theyre bringing a pretty hot side our battings all right but our bowlings rotten i havent played for two years leonard said a little doubtfully at three oclock the duke announced ignoring leonards hesitation youll find a couple of pros down at the nets if you want a knock first dont give your bowling away too much as some of the enemy are prowling around our host took gracious leave of us rose watched him curiously maurice she observed as the door closed theres something queer about this place i suppose there must be i admitted or we shouldnt be here exactly what are our instructions leonard enquired vague i replied the only letter i received from our chief told me to accept the offer through keith prowse to come here to sit tight and study conditions what did he mean by conditions rose asked just get in touch with our environment i suppose for instance here we are with half a dozen others brought up to westmoreland to amuse the dukes house party we are being treated royally the house party seems to comprise some of the bestknown names in england and the whole thing seems to be marvellously done but so far no glimmering as to how or where we may come in leonard persisted not the slightest i admitted of course this place is a perfect treasure house they say that the jewels alone are insured for more than two millions there may be some robbery scheme on perhaps rose suggested we are to be the thieves in that case ill keep one of the famous pink pearls if i have to swallow it i looked out across the park and a certain feeling of depression stole over me we were alone in a little sitting room which had been made over to our exclusive use i cant help wishing i confessed that we knew a little more where we stood weve been working for mr thomson now for the best part of a year and there isnt one of us three can tell whether weve been helping the greatest crook the world has ever known or a master detective im not sure that i care rose said sweetly leonard helped himself to a cigarette when i think of that night at cromer he reflectedyou remember how wet it was how the wind howled and we hadnt enough fire in our lodgings or enough money to buy foodwhen i think of those days and realise how life has changed since our mysterious god came out of the machine i feel very much like rose i feel like a pagan maurice were back again in our old lives wearing the right sort of clothes eating and drinking like civilised beings travelling in comfort and with a bank account growing all the time its good enough for me and for me rose echoed i fell in with their mood after all the sun was shining and a long summers day lay before us begone dull care i invoked at any rate until our next letter of instructions arrives into flannels leonard and then to the nets i suppose theyll let me have a knock i shall come and watch rose decided graciously our entertainment at lorringham castle was in its way princely we had a suite of rooms to ourselves and a dining room which we shared with charles jacoty the leader of the dukes private orchestra david faraday the famous illusionist a mrs middleham widow of the dukes private chaplain who arranged the dance programmes and painted the menus and a young mangerald formbythe son of sir james formby the agent to the estate who presided at the dinner table and from whom we heard most of the gossip of the place it was on the evening after the cricket match that we received from him the first inkling as to what the nature of our mission might be have you seen the lorringham treasures yet he asked rose she shook her head i dont even know what they are the young man appeared incredulous you mean to say that you havent heard of the lorringham pearls and the seven tiaras ive heard of them vaguely she replied i didnt even know that they were on view jacoty leaned a little forward in his chair faraday also appeared to be interested the young man lowered his voice a little there was inherited awe in its inflexion the lorringham pink pearls he said are the most famous in history although they are very seldom seen they were last worn in fact by eleanor duchess of lorringham at queen victorias wedding the seven tiaras are famous throughout the world the earliest dates from the time of charles the first and they are really on view rose asked not to the public whenever there is a house party here they are generally shown to the guests they are immensely valuable these jewels faraday enquired they are insured for two millions was the young mans portentous reply there was a little silence i chanced to glance at faraday and i was almost startled by the gleam in his sunken eyes he sat like a man in a brown study tapping the tablecloth with his fingers has any attempt at robbery ever been made leonard asked gerald formby shook his head they are too well guarded he said it is interesting this faraday remarked quietly are the jewels kept in safes the young man smiled the room in which they are is in itself a safe there are steel shutters to the windows and steel safes let into the wall there is a man on guard outside day and night and the only key in existence which could unlock the safes is in the possession of the duke himself my eyes met leonards for the first time i understood the only three words of admonition which we had received watch the duke faraday spoke what was in my own mind that fact may do away with some risk he observed but isnt it rather a danger to his grace fancy being in constant possession of a key which secures a treasure like that and you mean to say that no one has ever made any attempt to steal them rose asked once only twentytwo years ago in the late dukes time formby admitted a gang of burglarsthey say that charles peace was one of thembroke into the castle but they never got anywhere near the room soon after that these shutters were built and the safes let into the wall and quite recently an american expert came over who designed the lock robbery is now an impossibility we gave our first performance later on that evening the duke himself came up and congratulated us afterwards he invited us to join the rest of the guests a courteous offer of which however we did not avail ourselves you will at least join my personally conducted party he suggested turning to rose and have a look at the lorringham treasures i am taking a few of my guests there at eleven oclock i shall expect you three we accepted that invitation willingly enough and the duke returned to his guests afterwards faraday gave one of the most astonishing performances of sleight of hand i have ever seen with scarcely any appliances he succeeded in puzzling everybody one of the guests selected at random was made to disappear in such a fashion that he himself when questioned afterwards was utterly confused about his experience later on he brought a lockedup mastiff from his kennel and a singing bird down from the top of the great hall the duke with several of his companions came up to congratulate the illusionist faraday received their compliments with the grave pleasure of one who recognises his supremacy as the duke was leaving he addressed him i heard your grace inviting miss mindel and her companions to inspect the treasure chamber tonight he said may i be permitted to accompany them the duke seemed on the point of giving a ready consent then suddenly he hesitated he looked at faraday with a dubious smile after that performance of yours mr faraday he confessed i really dont know what to say i seem to have a horrible vision of watching my tiaras come out through the steel doors and my pink pearls drop out from the ceiling into your waistcoat pocket faraday did not smile it seemed to me that he was very much in earnest i will undertake to refrain from any extempore performance he said as a matter of fact your grace there are limitations to my magic the duke turned away he seemed rather to resent the others persistence another time perhaps he promised a little coldly my party tonight is made up faraday was standing a little in the shadows and i watched him eagerly from that moment our mission to lorringham castle seemed to become clearer to me an hour or so later our host led a small company of us to the treasure chamber we paused outside a green baize door leading into one of the galleries which was guarded by a servant in the livery of the house the duke with a word of apology took off his coat and rolled up his shirt sleeves disclosing a plain platinum band around his arm this is an american idea he explained he touched a spring in the band one side opened and disclosed a key attached to a thin chain of platinum wire with this he unlocked the door of a small chamber brilliantly lit one side of the room seemed to be composed up to the height of about six feet of solid steel shutters the duke fitted the other end of the key into a concealed crevice there was a little click and the whole of the shutters rolled back from behind windows of solid plateglass on a background of black velvet were displayed the famous tiaras rows of marvellous pearls some of them as large as marbles and pink as sea coral and a further collection of magnificent jewellery there seemed to be an almost universal gasp of astonishment the women of the party especially were speechless illustration there seemed to be an almost universal gasp of astonishment page we keep them like this instead of in coffers the duke explained so that they can be shown without being handled supposing you wanted to get at them some one asked there is a secret spring he replied which releases these windows you should look at the diamonds in that queen anne tiara lady mordaunt he added turning to one of his guests the greatest diamond expert in the world who was here last year declared that he had never seen stones to match those in his life we gazed we admired we marvelled in a few minutes the show was over the doors locked the key back in its wonderful hiding place and the dukes coat once more hanging from his shapely shoulders i dont wear this platinum affair except when i am down here he told us the rest of the time i leave it at my bankers tell me what you are thinking about miss mindel he asked turning to her with a smile rose answered him frankly i was wondering why you wouldnt let mr faraday come with us the duke frowned slightly well he admitted i suppose it was foolish of me all the same the mans performance took away my breath of course he went on i know that it was all illusion and yet it doesnt seem to me any more wonderful to think of his thrusting his hand through my plateglass windows and helping himself to my pearls than to perform some of the feats he achieved this evening the guardianship of several million pounds worth of family treasures he concluded with an apologetic smile sometimes tends to make one unreasonable leonard and i turned into the little smoking room assigned to our use after we had said good night to rose faraday was seated there alone with a block and pencil in his hand apparently making idle sketches he laid the block by his side face downwards at our entrance well he said a little illnaturedly i suppose youve seen the treasures we have i admitted helping myself to a whisky and soda are they as wonderful as report says he enquired im no judge i told him a little shortly by the bye theres a note for you on the table i recognised at once the familiar typewritten envelopea message from the chief leonard looked over my shoulder as i tore open the envelope watch faraday suspect edwards one of the custodians registered post tomorrow brings you key of door leading to balcony end of north gallery i tore the note into small pieces faraday sat watching me with gloomy curiosity nothing annoying i hope he queried i watched the pieces filter through my fingers into the wastepaper basket nothing of any importance i assured him the next day several things happened in the first place the key of the door leading to the little gallery facing the jewel chamber arrived wrapped in tissue paper and with an obliterated postmark secondly i took five wickets for fifteen against the team brought over from a neighbouring country house and leonard by indefensible slogging managed to knock up fiftyfive before he was caught on the boundary these last two episodes seemed to obliterate all memory of the professional character of our stay the duke who had played a very useful innings himself and whose joy at winning the match was almost like a schoolboys treated us as honoured guests and insisted upon all three of us accepting his invitation to dine in the great hall that evening the third event of the day was the coming of the princess anne of chantilly the last representative of a famous french family a great heiress related to royalty and one of the beauties of the world the three of us chanced to witness her arrival and our hosts secret was manifest in the first few minutes in her presence he seemed rejuvenated he watched her every movement the slight austerity of his tone and deportment vanished as though by magic a new and more genial side of him appeared he paid his court almost openly it did not need the gossip of the place to tell us that he was her suitor i was ready for dinner early that evening and strolled up and down the north gallery waiting for rose who was naturally taking some pains with her toilette i made my way as though by accident to the notice board containing the names of the watchmen selected from the menservants of the establishment there were eleven altogether and the watch for the next twentyfour hours had just been put in for the first time i saw there the name of edwards he was on duty it seemed from three to six on the following morning i felt a little shiver of excitement as i strolled away after a surreptitious glance at the little gallery the beginning of my task was close at hand dinner that night was a pageant rather than a meal sixtyfour of us sat down at a long table the decoration of which with hothouse flowers had taken two gardeners the greater part of the day we were served from gold plate and we drank strange wines from venetian glasses the duke sat at one end of the table with the princess at his right hand and his sister the marchioness of leicestershire sat at the other end the princess of whom i had a good view was one of the most beautiful women i had ever seen she was fair and slim with a perfect complexion dark rather tired eyes a fascinating mouth and corncoloured hair whose seemingly simple arrangement was an artistic triumph the one remarkable thing about her though was that she wore not a single article of jewellery her neck and bosom were bare her fingers were ringless i ventured to remark upon this fact to my neighbour whose acquaintance i had made on the cricket field she glanced down the table and nodded the princess has strange fancies she remarked i have seen her wearing the chantilly emeralds at a small dinner party and afterwards go to a court function wearing the jewels of an ingnue i looked back at her with a very genuine admiration she ought to marry the duke i whispered if only for the sake of wearing the wonderful pink pearls my companion smiled she would look better in them than any woman in the world she agreed the pity of it is that she would only be able to wear them up here and for a woman of her cosmopolitan tastes westmoreland would seem a little confining but if she were duchess of lorringham my companion shook her head the jewels are a very solemn family trust she told me i believe i am right in saying that they cannot be taken out of the united kingdom one of the famous tiaras was stolen about a hundred years ago in london and the deed of trust was amended then i suppose it is quite all right she went on meditatively but in a way it seems a cruel thing to keep jewels of such value practically hidden we gave our little entertainment that evening after which a great pianist who had travelled down from london gave a recital faraday made more magic and a girl who was one of the house party danced all the time our host never left the princesss side there was no doubt at all but that he was deeply in love with her she for her part won all hearts she was gracious and charming to every one she seemed indeed to the dukes delight to almost assume at times the position of gracious chatelaine a thought came to me during the evening and i sought out young formby with whom leonard and i had become quite intimate i found him with some of the younger spirits in the billiard room i drew him on one side whilst he was waiting to play his shot at pool formby i said i dont want to seem impertinent but i should like to ask you a question go ahead the young man invited is the duke a rich man i asked formby looked at me in astonishment what on earth makes you ask a question like that he demanded curiously well i really havent any reason i hastened to assure him i just wondered thats all the duke he told me impressively is one of the richest men in england he spends money in a princely fashion but he has never yet succeeded in spending half his income what about a game of snookeryou and cotton too if he likes we are breaking up after this sir charles wants to dance i left cotton there and went in search of rose i found her on the balcony in our own sitting room looking down at the guestsstrange picturesque figures as they strolled about the moondappled lawn listening to the music maurice she asked me as i sank into a chair by her side have you found out yet what we are here for i havent the faintest idea i replied the chief has been even less communicative than usual it seems to have something to do with the jewels and that is all i know you dont think she went on nervously that by any chance we are sent here to aid in any attempt to steal them no i dont think that i assured her where the chief stands sometimes i cant quite make up my mind but i dont think a jewel robbery even on such a scale as this is quite in his line if our presence here has anything to do with jewels at all and i think it has i added dropping my voice i should say that we were here indirectly to aid their guardians then why doesnt the duke mention it to us she asked curiously its beyond me i confessed she laid her hand upon my arm and drew me very near indeed maurice she whispered theres something wrong about faraday go on i begged her well for one thing then what does he want with a ninety horsepower car concerning which he hasnt said a word to any of us i saw him driving it in the lower stretches of the park this morning well that might be any mans hobby i replied what else i found him poring over a map this afternoon she continued i looked over his shoulder it was a road map of westmoreland and i am perfectly certain that he was tracing out the road from here to the sea it is only twenty miles i nodded well i said let us assume then that faraday means to make an attempt to steal the jewels that he has a highpowered car in readiness and a boat of some sort waiting by the sea i dare say that part of it might be managed all right its a desolate coast the road to it lies over a mountain range and he could easily start from a place where there is no telephone or telegraph butits the robbery itself that seems to me so impossible i cant conceive how any one could get at the dukes key and having got it how they could pass the man on duty at the door to say nothing of leaving the castle afterwards most robberies seem like that until afterwards rose answered a little drily besides i argued faraday is in his way a famous man he must earn several thousands a year why should he run such appalling risks go and look at the era which i left on the sittingroom table she enjoined look at the paragraph at the bottom of the sixth page i obeyed her and read with a little start of surprise of the great deception accorded to faraday at melbourne the previous week what does it mean i asked rose when i returned it means that this man isnt faraday at all she declared i was doubtful of him from the first i saw faraday at the coliseum about two years ago and i am sure that he was a much older man in that case i said thoughtfully i suppose it is our duty to warn the duke you must do as you think best rose decided i made my way reluctantly downstairs and turned into the gardens where i was told the duke was i found him at the end of a rose pergola the princess was seated by his side and at the sound of their voices i hesitated and would have turned back the duke however recognised me and called out in the bright moonlight which was flooding the gardens he seemed unnaturally pale his tone too when he addressed me had lost its smooth pleasant intonation he was like a man who has been undergoing torture the slight smile upon the princesss lips chilled and depressed me i felt that it was not a pleasant interview which i had disturbed were you looking for me lister the duke asked in a sense i was your grace i admitted ierthere was a little matter i thought i ought to mention to you well i felt suddenly that my mission was ridiculous and my suspicions intolerable since i was there however i had to go through with it the man faraday the illusionist i began well what about him the duke interrupted sharply some one who saw faraday perform at the coliseum two years ago i continued is of opinion that this man is not faraday at all the suspicion is confirmed by the fact that according to this weeks era faraday is performing in melbourne i have no doubt that your information is correct the duke replied coldly now i come to think of it i believe the agents told me that they were sending a faraday man but not faraday himself you surely had some reason for bringing me thisinformation the wild absurdity of the whole thing made me feel like a fool then i remembered however that we had been deliberately sent here by our machiavellian chief and we had never been sent anywhere in vain it must sound idiotic your grace i confessed but we were all very much impressed by the precautions against robbery connected with your jewel chamber the fact that there was a man staying here to whom you yourself preferred not to show the jewelsstaying here under a false name with a ninety horsepower motor car in the garage the duke interrupted me with a slight exclamation and a little wave of the hand i never dreamed that you were such an old woman lister he said i am much obliged to you for your warning he added with some return of his old courtesy as it happens however i was already aware that this man was not faraday himself and i fancy that my precautions for guarding the lorringham treasures are adequate the princess leaned a little forward i sympathised with the duke in this faint enchanting light she was ravishingly beautiful do not be too confident dear host she murmured if women were only made of sterner stuff a lock has never been fashioned which could keep a pearl lover from your jewel chamber the duke smiled nevertheless he added turning to me with a friendly gesture of dismissal you may sleep soundly tonight and as many nights as you remain under my roof the spells are not yet woven which could charm those jewels from their cases i made my way back to the castle a little confused there seemed to be in the dukes last words a subtle behest to me a warning not to concern myself further in his affairs and from three to six on this coming morning edwards was guard of the chamber and my rle of watcher was already established it must have been within a few seconds of the chiming of a quarter past three that the intense silence of the gallery into which i had found my way without difficulty was broken in even the slightest degree opposite where i crouched in a highbacked chair with a glass of cold water by his side sat the custodian of the jewel chamber a little to the right was the narrow passage leading to the dukes apartments two electric lights were burning and through one of the windows came pale splashes of faint moonlight the effect was a weird and confusing illumination which made it hard to recognise even the simplest objects the armoured figures cast fantastic shadows across the floor the outline of the watching man seemed distorted and unreal and the whole setting of the little scene was unnatural a stimulus to nervous imagination for this very reason i covered my eyes and looked again for a moment at the apparition which at first presented every semblance of the impossible the second time i knew that i had not been deceivedi knew that something was happening the end of that little passage leading from the dukes apartments to the watching figure was wrapped in gloom the faint creaking which had first attracted my attention might have come from an unseen door there or it might have been the not unnatural creaking of timbers in an old house the sound however was followed by a strange vision i saw an arm stretched out from the shadows linger for a moment over the tumbler and then disappear i rubbed my eyes was this faraday and his toy magic or reality i waited it might have been ten minutes before the next happening the watcher in the chair stretched out his arm lifted the tumbler to his lips and drank after that there was silence again then from the spot where the arm had come a figure dressed in black stole out the figure of a man of medium height without betraying collar or shirt front black as a bat save for the pale blur of an indistinguishable face and noiseless he stooped over the custodian now evidently either asleep or unconscious in a moment or two he stood upright paused before the door of the jewel chamber and with a curious apparently effortless movement passed through it then it seemed to me that my time had come for action i stole quietly down the few stairs unfastened the door of the gallery and crept up the corridor the door of the jewel chamber was ajar and through it i could see the shining of the electric light inside a glimmer of which fell upon the face of the drugged custodian suddenly upon the very threshold of the jewel chamber i stopped short all my wariness was gone lost in a shock of surprise a little exclamation broke from my lips the next second i found myself struggling for my life the walls swam round i raised my voice and gave a great cry after that there was silence at twelve oclock the next morning with a bandage around my head and feeling still the effects of an almost delirious night i stepped into the car which was waiting to take us to the station the duke who was practising at the cricket nets came hurrying across to us his bat still in his hand i had no idea that you were going by this early train he exclaimed so glad that i did not miss you altogether rose murmured something polite and leonard said a word or two about the pleasure of our stay i remained silent i am afraid our host continued smiling at me that i was a little unsympathetic in the small hours of the morning i am never at my best when i am roused from sleep however you must let me express my regrets to you now mr lister for your little accident at the same time he went on i am sure you will agree with me that the neighbourhood of the jewel chamber is rather a dangerous place for a man addicted to nightmares to be wandering about at three oclock in the morning i looked the duke in the face what i saw was no nightmare i said i saw some sort of powder dropped into edwards glass and i saw a man pass into the jewel chamber the duke smiled tolerantly my dear mr lister he protested if the man edwards had been drugged as you suggest could he have attacked you in the way he did and got the better of you in a scrap further how was it possible for any one to open the door of the jewel chamber without a key he rolled up the sleeve of his flannel shirt a little higher touched the spring of his platinum bracelet showed us the key and replaced it i said nothing i continued to watch the dukes face perhaps the most satisfactory part of your hallucination he went on is the fact that the jewels have neither been disturbed nor removed i beg mr lister he concluded indulgently that you will not let this unfortunate incident disturb any agreeable impressions you may have had of your stay here it has been a great pleasure to me to entertain you if you will allow me to refer for a moment to a business matter my steward has sent a cheque this morning to your agent and if you will allow me to offer you a slight memento of your stay here i will ask you to accept this bat from me it is one of wisdens and i think the best i have ever handled he held it out to me and there passed between us one of those long and silent glances which convey more than words i held out my hand and accepted the bat thank you duke i said he stood away and lifted his cap then we drove off mr thomson had his own methods of surprising us three nights after our return to town we found ourselves for instance under the great plane tree at ranelagh drinking wonderful yellow chartreuse with our coffee listening to the music and to the little murmur of pleasant afterdinner conversation the moment for which i had waited so eagerly had come at last on this occasion our host remarked tolerantly i feel that i must be a little more lenient than usual as regards questions you came away from lorringham a little puzzled i have no doubt we did indeed i replied we want to know why the duke was engaged in a conspiracy to steal his own jewels and why our mission there seemed to be to prevent it quite a little romance our host observed the duke as you may have noticed is very much in love with the princess of chantilly the princess is one of those women in whom the love of jewels amounts to a passion the lorringham pink pearls are as you may know priceless more than anything in the world the princess desires to wear those pearls then why doesnt she acquire them by marrying the duke i asked because mr thomson explained in the trust deed relating to the jewels they can none of them be moved outside the united kingdom the princess would never live in england for more than a month or so in the year which means that she would be separated from the jewels she loves for the greater part of the time the duke has taken every sort of legal opinion and there is no doubt that if they were stolen from the castle and returned to him in some foreign country there is no law which could compel him to bring them back here that is why the duke connived at the theft which you prevented the elucidation was simple enough but scarcely satisfactory if i had known this i confessed im afraid my sympathies would have been with the duke mr thomson smiled indulgently that proves then he said how wise i am to explain these little affairs with which you chance to become associated afterwards instead of before you were acting for the insurance companies who would have to pay a very large sum to the vested estate if the jewels were stolen from lorringham on their behalf he added handing me an oblong strip of paper i am asked to hand you this cheque for five hundred pounds i passed it over to leonard who usually kept our accounts all the same i observed i dont wonder the duke thought i was a meddlesome idiot his grace has probably forgiven you mr thomson remarked for the princess has relented at last if you buy an evening paper on your way home you will see that they were married by special license this afternoon we found plenty to think and talk about for the next few minutes then mr thomson who had been leaning back in his chair watching the stars and listening to the music electrified us in one month he said the year for which you pledged your services to me will be up at the end of that time we shall say goodby you will not want us again rose asked mr thomson shook his head please do not consider that any reflection upon your efforts he begged during the last ten years i have had assistants in every walk of life no one has served me more intelligently or on the whole more successfully than you three the fact of the matter is that i am going to retire retire from what i asked him impetuously who are you what are you i have never been able to make up my mind whether we have been on the side of the sheep or the goats how did you become interested for instance in this last affair did the insurance companies give you a brief and if so did they give it to a master criminal to police headquarters or to a private detective shall we call that conundrum number six mr thomson suggested watching the ash on his cigar you understand of course that we are going to have a grand finale you have a week in which to rest and i think a study of your banking account will prove that you are justified in taking a holiday if you wish to on next thursday evening at six oclock i desire that all three of you will be at the rooms which you are now occupying in clarges street you will there receive a message from me i shall ask your help once more before i retire into private lifeand safety the music surged in our ears and the froth of light conversation filled the air of all the little groups of people seated about we alone seemed to have our faces set towards the serious things perhaps our host noticed it for he rose to his feet and drew leonard on one side if i were your age lister he said turning to me i should ask miss mindel to drift about with me in one of those shadowy boats so rose and i strolled down towards the lake to think she murmured a little tremulously that very soon we shall come to the end of our adventures i drew her arm through mine the sound of the music was growing fainter in the distance and the ripple of the water was in our ears or to the beginning i whispered conundrum number seven the greatest argument the clock had scarcely finished striking six when a twoseated car throaty but sonorous came to a standstill in front of the house in clarges street where rose leonard and i had our temporary abode an elegantly dressed but weary young man was shown into our sitting room he bowed to rose and addressed me youre maurice lister what and mr leonard cotton he began no use telling you my name because you wouldnt know it ive brought you a message i indicated a chair but our visitor shook his head got to be tooting off in a moment he continued i have just come from the old man hes in a nursing home round the corner what mr thomson i exclaimed the young man assented although at the mention of the name he winced they nearly laid him out last night in lansdowne passage he announced fortunately i wasnt far away number john street hed like you there in a quarter of an hour mr lister but who laid him out i asked is he seriously hurt leonard intervened holding out a newspaper theres an account here he exclaimed murderous assault in lansdowne passage they say the victim name unknown is in a precarious condition was that really mr thomson rose demanded in a shocked tone less said less trouble the young man replied embracing us all in a common farewell salute so long he took his leave lit a cigarette on the kerb assumed an almost horizontal position in the car and shot like a rocket into the heart of the piccadilly traffic in rather less than five minutes i was ringing the bell at number john street and after a very brief delay was taken upstairs to a cool and pleasantly furnished bedroom mr thomson almost undistinguishable for bandages motioned to a chair by his bedside and the nurse departed they pretty nearly got me this time lister he remarked curiosity mastered sympathy who did i asked breathlessly mr thomson lay quite still with his eyes fixed upon the ceiling a little company of men he said who are dangerous fellows to deal withvery dangerous he repeated pensively are you badly hurt he shook his head i am scarcely hurt at all the newspapers i began inspired you are on the side of the law this time then i exclaimed triumphantly he smiled i confess it the newspapers which speak of my perilous condition exaggerate nevertheless he went on i have decided to spend a week here the surroundings are pleasant and the rest is good during that week you will take my place the devil i shall i murmured gazing at his head swathed with bandages one reason mr thomson condescended to explain for my retirement from an active pursuit ofshall we call it my hobbyis that notwithstanding my repeated efforts to keep it in the background my personality has become too well known amongst the inner circle of those against whom our energies are directed in this present instance the scene for a very stirring little drama in the history of today is laid in a comparatively small manufacturing town in the heart of yorkshire whatever form of disguise i might select my presence in that place would certainly be detected besides the task before us is one in which direct action is impossible we can only bait the trap and wait and if the quarry refuses to enter we must choose another trap and another bait a good deal will rest with you lister if you are completely successful in the undertaking which i shall presently disclose to you you will receive a parting gift of ten thousand pounds for division amongst the three of you it is princely i acknowledged enthusiastically if you succeed mr thomson continued it is a flea bite now leave me tomorrow you will depart for the grand hotel at blackham before midnight tonight you will receive from me a written report which will contain all the information you require read it commit it to memory and destroy it if you need further advice or help do not hesitate to apply to me there is a telephone here at my elbow and i shall never be so ill as the papers may lead you to believe good fortune to you i left our chief and returned to clarges street impressed with a conviction that we were about to enter upon the most important enterprise which had yet come our way we found blackham hideous uninspiring yet not without a certain impressiveness it was situated in the midst of a district black with coal shafts and forges which squatted upon the ground festering sores in the daytime like drops from a spilt hell at night when the roar of their flames was like a fiery wind and the red vomit of their furnaces stained the very clouds there were neverending electric cars linking up a whole series of townvillages more public houses than i had ever seen before a plethora of libraries and a perfect plague of cinema palaces day and night the streets were thronged food and living were inordinately dear but money was plentiful although everywhere there seemed brooding over the place the shadow of that sullen storm of industrial unrest with which in those days the whole country was agitated the shops the cinema palaces the theatre itself and the smaller music halls were packed every night we only obtained a hall for our own performance with the utmost difficulty and for our rooms and sitting room at the socalled grand hotel which was little more than a glorified public house we had to pay as much as though we were at a west end hotel we advanced the price of the seats however at the building in which our performance was given and were rewarded by finding the place packed on the first night the only empty places were in the cheaper seats late that night leonard and i came across a very valuable acquaintance arthur rastall a journalist on a london paper a man whom i had known for years and who hailed from leonards part of the world he visited our sitting room for a final whisky and soda and he helped us to understand the somewhat tense atmosphere of the place what on earth are you doing here was almost the first question i asked him he filled his pipe and lit it i am here he replied because during the course of the next few days history will be made in this most unattractive town i am not alone either fisher is here from the times simpson from the post and i passed the express man in the town this afternoon a labour conference i asked something even more than that these devils have got something up their sleeves they have some reason for meeting in a small place like this and meeting privately theres something brewing what sort of a something i asked is it a secret from two harmless strolling players no secret at all that i know of our friend replied gruffly except from the government who wont believe it and scotland yard who dont know how to act they say that creslin is coming and two representatives from america i suppose i still looked a little puzzled although what rastall was telling us was not altogether news he went on after a moments pause every country he explained has been able to deal with its own labour question more or less successfully except russia the greatest danger the world might have to face would be an internationalisation of socalled labour creslin is the apostle of internationalisation do you mean creslin the bolshevist leonard demandedthe man whom the prime minister referred to as the horror of the world the same was the grim admission but how is it that that man is free to walk the streets of any english town leonard persisted i should have thought such a criminal could have been shot anywhere i dont think there is any offence against the english law under which he could be charged rastall declared every port was watched and they did try to keep him out of the country they hadnt a chance though he was far too clever for them the story of creslins coming was already known to me but i asked rastall a question which had been in my mind all the time tell me what there is against the government putting a bold front on the matter arresting creslin and deporting him as an undesirable alien just this the whole country just now is in a dangerously inflammatory state the committees for settling labour disputes worked well enough at first but so much of this false socialistic literature anarchistic stuff has made its way into the country during the last few years that labour fat and wellfed and surfeited with pleasure is more dangerous today than it was in the old days of starvation wages today are an enormous tax upon capital but you know what the screaming bolshevist is he wants all the time to kill the goose that lays the golden egg he wants to pull down the capitalist and reign in his stead if ever he succeeded as he did in russia england would be industrially and commercially ruined yet even with that certainty before us you mean to tell me that the government is going to let creslin meet the heads of all the trades unions here and pour his filth down their throats seems like it was rastalls laconic reply there was a knock at the door the manager of the hotel presented himself behind him stood another and a slighter figure the former glanced around the apartment and with a little bow drew me on one side can i have a word with you mr lister get right on with it i invited i wondered if by any chance you could be induced to give up your sitting room it happens to be the only one i have in the house and we have a very distinguished visitor from abroad just arrived who objects to the public rooms sorry i said firmly but i took the rooms for a week as you know and a sitting room is an absolute necessity to us the manager glanced at his companion the latter came a little forward he was a fair quietlooking man cleanshaven moody with lightcoloured hair brushed back from his forehead he was at first glance almost prepossessing he had the nervous mouth and quick smile of an artist it was only his rather lightcoloured eyes which left one a little doubtful about him it is on my behalf that the manager is speaking he said i have the good or evil fortune to bear a name which in an industrial neighbourhood like this is somewhat too well known i am paul creslin somehow or other i had already surmised the fact and i was able to control my countenance rose had dropped her newspaper and was studying the newcomer with interest he seemed to observe her for the first time and a look crept into his eyes which stamped him at once in my mind there is a certain type of profligacy which is selfrevealing i felt myself in a quandary my hatred of the man was already born and the words of dismissal were quivering upon my lips then i remembered my mission i remembered thomsons wordssuccess is born of the brain and wrecked by impulse i choked back the impulse i am not a politician i said but your name is of course known to me i cannot offer you our sitting room for the simple reason that there is no other place in the hotel for the young lady but any time you would care to take refuge here we should be very pleased and if you happen to be a late person it will be at your disposal after twelve oclock the manager glanced anxiously at his guest again the latters eyes rested for a moment upon rose and he seemed satisfied you are most courteous he acknowledged i am going to my room for a few minutes afterwards i shall venture to intrude the two men left the room followed a few minutes later by rastall in hot haste for the telegraph office leonards expression as he looked at me was almost of horror rose too seemed troubled what on earth do you mean maurice she exclaimed by asking us even to breathe the same air as that hateful person i thrust leonard into a chair by roses side and stood on the shabby little bit of hearth rug close to them the time has come i said addressing myself particularly to rose for me to pass on to you the chiefs instructions in the days that followed we seemed to have caught up into our own apparently uneventful lives something of that spirit of waiting drama which pervaded the teeming town and the smokestained countryside the people all seemed to be waiting for something we too waited and in the meantime creslin made free use of our sitting room drove out with us in the car which i had hired for a week and never failed to attend our performances our sitting room was almost a bower of roses and orchids flowers which arrived in mysterious parcels from london and which must have cost a small fortune i ventured to protest on the grounds of political economy but creslin only smiled every man is allowed one extravagance in life he said you and your friend for instance drink wine and whisky and soda and smoke cigars i do neither my weakness lies elsewhere he glanced across at rose as he spoke and at the expression in his eyes the slow amorous calculating expression i had to grip the sides of my chair and look down at the carpet towards some spilt tobacco ash to hide my fury creslin who had been strolling uneasily around the room seated himself on the sofa by roses side you love flowers miss mindel he asked softly following the direction of her eyes which were resting upon a bowl of red roses i adore them she acknowledged for their own sakeand sometimes too she went on meeting his gaze with a coquetry for which i could never have given her credit sometimes too for the sake of those from whom they come he glanced almost imperceptibly towards leonard and myself one of those slow inimical glances which seemed yet to betray some evil purpose bearing in mind the stories which one had been told of this mans coldblooded and indiscriminate cruelty it was easy to believe that if a word from him could have wiped us off the face of the earth at that moment it would certainly have been spoken making the best of our presence however he continued his conversation in a low tone once i saw rose flinch and glance up as though in distress i came across the room making a pretence at filling my pipe from a jar which stood upon a table near them creslin looked at me through his halfclosed eyes miss mindel does not approve of the coming emancipation of her sex he observed i suppose the doctrines of the new world must sound strange at first to those who have counted the hard and fast chastity of the puritan amongst the virtues what are the doctrines of the new world i enquired they include at any rate he replied in his quiet sibilant voice a complete reconstruction of the relations between man and woman that sounds like bolshevism pure and simple leonard remarked bluntly the actual principles of bolshevism creslin asserted contain more than a germ of the truth i should be sorry i declared for the man who made a serious attempt to wipe out the marriage laws of this country he looked at me with a cynical turn of his thin lips there was never a race of people in the world he pronounced who hugged their chains like the british in their hearts they love the lash of authority think for generations their leaders their prophets and their preachers have been drawn from one class only the class which they are accustomed to obey the people have never found their rienzi in politics in literature or in sociology that is because of the agelong snobbishness of the englishman during the last ten years for the first time the people have kicked over the traces so far as regards their material prosperity they are being fed with doles and pittances but they are moving forward soon they will begin to think then just as they have asserted themselves in material ways they will begin to demand an active voice in the reconstruction of society what is your substitute for the marriage laws rose asked him bluntly to do him justice i must say that he spoke with the conviction of one who enunciates the most obvious truths truths which did not even admit of argument union between man and woman he explained is intended for the production of children the only sane restraint which common sense should place upon this connection is the presence of human affection that is the only restraint there should be i see leonard murmured and what would become of the children they are for the statechildren of the state was the almost wondering reply every household should have its nursery for every child born a state grant should be given is there any literature i enquired setting out these altruistic views there is creslin replied after a moments pause the time is scarcely ripe however for its dissemination if you would care to possess a text book drawn up by myself and embodying the principles which i desire sooner or later to be accepted by the whole world i will present you with one before we went to bed that night the precious pamphlet was in our possession the presence of creslin in the country was now universally admitted by the press although his exact whereabouts did not once appear in print the day fixed for the congress of labour leaders to be held at blackham drew near meanwhile creslin was watched by detectives and press men alike it occurred to us more than once that he almost expected and certainly hoped for arrest i spoke on this matter to rastall there is nothing creslin desires so much he pointed out as to pose as a martyr over here until he begins to preach his abominable doctrines or disseminate his literature he is on the side of the law the sociology he preaches apart from its sexual side is reasonable and even finely conceived supposing he were to be arrested i asked the police would never get him out of town rastall replied there are a million of his followers within a radius of twenty miles from here i think we should see a riot that would approach almost to a revolution the man is as cunning as a fox he will preach his idealistic sociology first the rest will creep in by degrees meanwhile creslin spent the greater part of his spare time in our sitting room he scarcely now made a pretence of taking any particular interest in either leonard or myself his whole attention was directed towards rose to do him justice he was a man of considerable culture and fine perceptions on many subjects there were times when roses face seemed to light up when she seemed to find a genuine pleasure in his conversation there were others when i saw her cold and wooden parrying the unspoken pleadings of his meretricious philosophy with a skill for which i should never have given her credit it was evident that creslin was very much in earnest indeed he was continually inviting her to lunch to motor to leave the hotel alone with him all of which invitations she contrived to evade in the end he even had the effrontery to appeal to me i gather he said one morning that miss rose mindel is nothing to either of you who are her companions she is nothing to us i replied except a very dear sister who has a claim upon our joint protection i will not conceal from you he continued that i have the greatest admiration for miss mindeli might even venture to say affection i received the confession in silence he seemed much less at his ease than usual i have met with no woman he went on in whose companionship i could find more joy then why dont you ask her to marry you i demanded he looked at me with his narrow eyes almost wide open you are a little ignorant of the way things are moving in the world he said quietly you are wrapped up perhapsin your art i am creslin tomorrow if i chose i could be dictator of russia or germany hungary or austria it pleases me instead to be the spokesman of my class in every country of the world i do not understand the word marriage i had never harder work in controlling my temper but i knew that the time had not yet come i answered him a little abruptly i am afraid you will find some of us a little insular miss mindel is of course free to make her own decisions in life but it is as well perhaps to impress upon you the fact that whilst she is travelling with us we consider ourselves mr cotton and i her guardians we should resent forcibly any offer to her which was not in accordance with the established conventions he smiled in maddening fashion you speak like the hero of one of those melodramas in which i used to revel when i was a youthful student in london what i choose to say to miss mindel i shall say it will be a strange thing to me if she refuses to listen be sensible my young friend and remember remember what i demanded who i am he answered with cool and splendid assurance i carry the burden of the new world upon my shoulders i am the future dictator of all human society that finished my scruples i went off with leonard and discussed our plans creslin with all the priceless imperturbability of his sublime conceit remained in our sitting room waiting for rose on the day before the great conference creslin was a busy man all the time he was back and forth between the temporary offices arranged for the reception of the delegates and the hotel when we returned to the sitting room after our evening performance he was still absent the three of us held a little consultation we were all of one mind on general principles rose agreed i think that creslin is a detestable person and i should like to see him publicly disgraced for ever on the other hand i dont think she went on with a little grimace that i was cut out for a delilah so far my conscience is clear enough i have never given him a word of encouragement and if he were to insult me he would deserve any punishment my guardians might choose to inflict but what does make me unhappy is the idea that i might have to deceive him even by my silence if but listen leonard interrupted eagerly i heard him distinctly whispering to you that tomorrow was to be his great day all that he needed was inspiration that he must carry with him on to the platform memories and hopesand a lot of slush of that sort rose nodded quite right she assented i promised that i would not go to bed tonight until i had seen him i am sure he will be here presently very well then i decided he shall have his chance if he is just ordinarily offensive he shall get the hiding he deserves as publicly as possible and the chief must be satisfied with that if he attempts anything elsewell we are prepared leonard was out of the room for a few minutes and rose held out a hand to me a little tremulously maurice she said and there was a look of trouble in her dear eyes i dont like this i hate that man near me i hate the idea that i may have to listen to horrible things from him and i hate the thought of your doing it i answered firmly say the word rose and well finish here the pamphlets enough any reasonable englishman would be justified in giving him a thrashing for that she shook her head regretfully the other is better of course only swear that you will not leave me alone for five seconds i can promise that i told her grimly after all we need not have troubled ourselves with scruples creslin had made his own plans and made them with devilish cunning at midnight as we had seen nothing of him i sent down an enquiry and was told that he had come in quite exhausted and gone at once to his room to leonard and me the news sounded natural enough roses instinct however was not to be denied i know that he meant what he said about tonight she assured us uneasily swear that you will be near maurice we promised and soon afterwards she retired her bedroom adjoined the sitting room and after she had passed through the connecting door we heard the click of the turning key on the other side the outside door opening upon the corridor was secured by a bolt it certainly seemed as though she could have no cause for fear leonard and i however took up our vigil behind a black lacquer screen at the farther end of the room we heard the slow dying away of the footsteps upon the pavement below the lessening scream of the electric cars and finally silence one oclock struck and halfpast we had both of us given up the idea that anything was likely to happen when the door of the sitting room was quietly opened and creslin in his dressing gown and slippers entered he stood listening for a moment as though to make sure that he had not been followed then he turned on the electric light drew a key from his pocketa new shining keyrubbed it with a little oil and stole across the room towards the door which led into roses apartment he essayed no knock no whispered invitation he fitted the key noiselessly into the lock turned it softly and disappeared in five seconds we heard the sound of her muffled cry in ten we had dragged him out into the sitting room he lay on the carpet looking at us with frightened eyes and that expression upon his face which had so often puzzled me now made clear the man was a coward what are you going to do he whimpered horsewhip you first i told him and afterwards punish you i shouldnt call out if i were you i added as he opened his lips theres the skeleton key still in the door there and the hotel is full of journalists better make up your mind to go through with it if you do me an injury he cried the people tomorrow will tear you limb from limb get up i ordered roughly were taking our chance about that mr thomson presided over our usual banquet a few evenings later in the dining room of a suite at the ritz he was a little gaunt and pale but otherwise showed few signs of his indisposition by the side of the plate of each one of us was an envelope which he begged us not to open until the end of the festivities you three he said musingly especially you lister have put your finger upon one of the quaintest features of the psychology of these days reason and argument common sense statesmanlike appeal may all fail it is ridicule alone which kills you three my trusted confederates have probably prevented a revolution you have brought to an end in ridicule and disgust a great social upheaval helped by the press i reminded him helped by the press without a doubt he assented their tone was in every respect admirable the daily hour cartoon of creslin the pureminded idealist staggering to his feet from the bench in the town hall square tarred and feathered a disgraced debauchee with fragments of his pamphlet sticking in pieces to his body and another copy of it hung around his neck was the most wonderful thing in educational journalism all the same lister you had a narrow escape it was the women who saved you the women and again the press i reminded him just as the people themselves were hesitating the morning papers came out with a humourous recital of the true story and a digest of the pamphlet creslin could never again present a heroic picture to any one the only earthly chance he ever had of posing successfully as a prophet of the new social law would have been the possession of a personal character of unblemished purity at the same time mr thomson observed a little gravely i want you to remember this creslin has many friends of his own ilk friends who knew his real character and who were indifferent i think a short sea voyage would be good for you and miss mindel at any rate i will speak of that again presently i met roses eyes and with the knowledge that our compact ended that evening i attempted no more concealment she looked for a moment startledand then i knew as this is our last official reunion our host continued i am reminded that there are a good many questions which you have asked me at various times during our association the answers to which i have postponed until this evening question me now as much as you will let me start rose begged i asked the first question remember when you arrested mountjoy for whom were you acting were you for the police or just an ordinary informer for neither was the calm reply i have been for ten years the head of the home secret service an institution i believe he added which is never mentioned and which not one person in a thousand knows anything about the secret service still possesses the minute book i found on mountjoy if it had come into the hands of the police they would have been compelled to have taken indiscriminate action and the results would have been disastrous the jewels which you took from kinlosti i asked they were sold and the amount stands to the credit of the secret service funds what became of the treasure which was found in the spens chateau it was all returned to its various owners the baroness sought my aid because she too is a member of our secret service and naida there was one of our complete successes mr thomson replied no court could have tried kansky there was no possible way in which he could have been brought to book for his crimes the secret service undertook to dispose of him and it did and what about the boy arthur dompers and his tutor duncombe rose asked a little outside our ordinary course of business mr thomson admitted some one or other however managed to convince scotland yard that duncombe meant mischief and i took the matter up to oblige them what about the duke and the lorringham jewels leonard enquired that affair was passed over to my supervision our chief explained because the lorringham jewels are looked upon as a sort of national asset in the country and their retention here is considered advisable for diplomatic reasons tell us rose begged exactly the meaning of the attack upon you in the landsdowne passage mr thomson made a little grimace it simply means he admitted that the agents of the black peril have a secret service almost equal to our own they flattered me so far as to believe that i was the only man likely to render abortive the great stroke which creslin intended to deliver here hence their endeavour to anticipate my activities you seem to have unlimited powers leonard said thoughtfully doesnt it ever occur to you sir to make wider use of them for instance every englishman knows creslin was a terrible danger to the country he stood for revolution disorganisation and anarchy why didnt you have him secretly put out of the way because the men who share with me the responsibilities of my position mr thomson replied my lieutenants and coadjutors are men of imagination we try to see a little beyond the actual circumstances with which we are confronted it would have been the easiest matter in the world for us to have wiped creslin from the face of the earth but if we had done so his principles would have lived after him everything except the mans corporal frame would have survived today a certain amount of the fascination of his doctrines has perished in the morass of ridicule which has sucked the man under his doctrines never had a moments chance in this country unless they were preached by a man of personal purity we did better than slay creslin we made him ridiculous what made you first approach us at cromer rose asked with a touch of feminine curiosity what was there about us i mean which made you think we might be useful the fact perhaps that you looked so innocuous was the smiling reply i have agents in many walks of life and the one thing i aim at as much as possible is to select recruits who not only appear simpleminded and innocent but who actually are you are none of you intriguers by disposition you are simple english gentlepeople you have escaped suspicion many times for this reason and have therefore been able to succeed when any ordinary agent would have been suspected from the first i see rose murmured you will gratify me mr thomson suggested if you open your envelopes we obeyed then i saw what i had never dreamed of seeing in my lifenot one but five thousandpound bank of england notes i have treated you all the same our benefactor said i hope that you will never regret this year out of your lives i have answered all your conundrums i will now ask you one what are you going to do with your money i dont know rose gasped i am going to buy a share in my fathers business and go back to the wine trade leonard decided half this money will make a new man of him i am going to marry rose i declared but you havent asked me she protested indignantly i glanced at leonard the years up i suppose old fellow he said with a sigh we both ask you to marry us rose bolshevists she exclaimed i mean we ask you to choose he corrected she gave me her hand leonard drank a glass of champagne in gloomy silence and afterwards shook hands with both of us rose and he exchanged a few earnest sentences mr thomson spoke a valedictory word my friends he said tonight we part i have helped i hope to bring colour into your lives i ask but one thing of you in return and that issilence for twelve months we promised and we kept our word the end transcribers note punctuation errors have been corrected the following suspected printers errors have been addressed page insufficent changed to insufficient an insufficient
