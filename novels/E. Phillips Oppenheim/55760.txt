indiscreet travellers chapter viii the undeniable force chapter ix an interrupted review chapter x the sentence of the court chapter i the man who could have ended the war it was a few minutes after one oclockthe busiest hour of the day at the most popular bar in london the usual little throng of americans journalists men of business and loiterers were occupying their accustomed chairs in one corner of the long greencarpeted room around the bar wouldbe customers were crowded three or four deepmany of them stalwart canadians in khaki making the most of their three days leave and a thin sprinkling of men about town on their way to lunch in the grillroom adjoining on the outskirts of the group was a somewhat incongruous figure a rather undersized illdressed bespectacled little man neither young nor old colourless with a stoop which was almost a deformity his fingers were stained to the tip of his nails as though by chemicals or tobacco juice he held the glass of vermouth which he had just succeeded in obtaining from the bar halfway suspended to his lips he was listening to the conversation around him the most blackguardly trick that has ever been known in civilized warfare a canadian officer declared indignantly its put the lid on all pretence of conducting this war decently another assented what about the hague convention the hague convention a young journalist from the other side repeated sarcastically i should like to know when germany has ever shown the slightest regard for the hague convention or any other agreement which didnt happen to suit her the little man on the outskirts of the group who had been listening eagerly to the conversation ventured upon a question his accent at once betrayed his transatlantic origin say is there anything fresh this morning he inquired i havent seen the papers yet the canadian glanced down at the speaker we were talking he said about the use of poisonous gases by the germans they started pumping them at us yesterday and pretty nearly cleared us out of ypres the effect of this statement upon the little man was in its way extraordinary for a moment he stood with his mouth open the glass shaking between his fingers a queer set expression in his pale face then his lips parted and he began to laugh it was a mirth so obviously illtimed so absolutely unaccountable that they all turned and stared at him there was no doubt whatever that for some reason or other the news which he had just heard had excited this strange little person almost hysterically his lips grew further apart the whole of his face was puckered up in little creases then just as suddenly as his extraordinary impulse towards mirth had come it seemed to pass away he drained his glass set it down on the edge of the counter and turning around walked slowly out of the place the remarks that followed him were not altogether inaudible and they were distinctly uncomplimentary all i could do to keep my toe off the little devil the canadian exclaimed angrily id like to take him back with me out into the trenches for a few days a young man who had been talking to an english officer on the outskirts of the group turned around he was a tall wellsetup young man with a face rather grave for his years and a mouth a little overfirm he too had watched the exit of the stranger half in indignation half in contempt who was that extraordinary little man he inquired no one seemed to know the waiter paused with a tray full of glasses hes staying in the hotelarrived yesterday from america sir he announced i dont know his name but i think hes a little queer in his head the young man set down his glass upon the counter a person he remarked who can laugh at such a ghastly thing must be either very queer in his head indeed or or what ambrose his companion asked i dont know the other replied thoughtfully well au revoir you fellows im going in to lunch sure you wont come with me reggie sorry i have to be back in ten minutes the other replied see you tomorrow ambrose lavendale strolled out of the room crossed the smokeroom and descended into the restaurant at a table in a remote corner seated by himself the little man who had been guilty of such a breach of goodfeeling was studying the menu with a waiter by his side lavendale watched him for a moment curiously then he turned to speak to one of the matres dhtel a short dark man with a closelycropped black moustache i shant want my usual table this morning jules he announced i am going to sit in that corner he indicated a vacant table close to the little man whom he had been watching the matres dhtel bowed and ushered him towards it just as you like mr lavendale he said it isnt often you care about this side of the room though lavendale seated himself at the table he had selected gave a brief order and leaning back glanced around him the little man had sent for a newspaper and was reading it eagerly but for a moment lavendales interest was attracted elsewhere at the very next table also alone also reading a newspaper was the most strikinglooking young woman he had ever seen in his life lavendale was neither susceptible nor imaginative he considered himself a practical hardheaded person notwithstanding the fact that he had embraced what was for his country practically a new profession nevertheless he was conscious of what almost amounted to a new interest in life as he studied a little too eagerly perhaps the girls features she was dark with hair brushed plainly back from a somewhat high and beautifully shaped forehead her complexion was pale her eyes a deep shade of soft brown her eyebrows were almost japanese fine and silky yet intensely dark her mouth even in repose seemed full of curves she appeared to be of medium height and she was undoubtedly graceful and what made her more interesting still to lavendale was the fact that although her manner of doing so was stealthy she too was watching the little man who was now commencing his luncheon lavendale after a few moments reflection adopted the obvious course he summoned jules and inquired the young ladys name the man was able at once to give him the desired information miss de freyne sir he whispered discreetly she is a writer i believe i am not quite sure the man added whether she is not the agent over here of some french dramatists i have seen her sometimes with theatrical parties lavendale nodded and settled down rather ineffectively to his lunch before he had finished he had arrived at two conclusions the first was that miss de freyne although obviously not for the same reason was as much interested in the stranger as he was and the second that his first impressions concerning her personality were if anything too weak he ransacked his memory for the names of all the theatrical people whom he knew and made mental notes of them it was his firm intention to make her acquaintance before the day was over once their eyes met and notwithstanding a reasonable amount of savoir faire for the moment he was almost embarrassed he found it impossible to glance away and she returned a regard which he felt in a way was semicommittal with a queer sort of nonchalant interest in a sense provocative although it contained nothing of invitation at the end of the meal lavendale had come to a decision he signed his bill rose from his place and approached the table at which the little man was seated sir he said i am a stranger to you but i should like if i may to ask you a question even in that moments pause when the little man laid down his newspaper and was staring up at his questioner in manifest surprise lavendale felt that his proceeding had attracted the strongest interest from the young woman seated only a few feet away she had leaned ever so slightly forward a coffee cup with which she had been toying had been noiselessly returned to its saucer it was genuine interest this not curiosity say hows that the little man exclaimed ask me a question why i dont know as thered be any harm in that im not promising that ill answer it i was in the bar a moment ago lavendale continued when they were talking of these poisonous gases which the germans are using i heard you ask a question and i heard the answer you were apparently for the first time informed of this new practice of theirs will you tell me why when you heard of it you laughed the little man nodded his head slowly as though in response to some thought sit down young fellow he invited are you an american i am lavendale admitted my name is ambrose lavendale and i was attached to the embassy here until last august that so the other replied with some interest well mines hurn i dont know a soul in london and you may be useful to me so if you like ill answer your question you thought my laugh abominable i guess i did lavendale assentedwe all did i dare say you heard some of the comments that followed you out it was a selfish laugh perhaps the little man continued thoughtfully but it was not an inhuman one now sir i will answer your question i will tell you what that piece of information which i heard at the bar and which i find in the paper here means to me and means to the world hold tight young man i am going to make a statement which if you are sensible enough to believe it will take your breath away if you dont youll think im a lunatic are you ready go ahead lavendale invited i guess my nerves are in pretty good order mr hurn laid the flat of his hand upon the table and looked upwards at his companion he spoke very slowly and very distinctly i can stop the war he declared lavendale smiled at him incredulouslythe man was mad really he exclaimed well youll be the greatest benefactor the world has ever known if you can the little man who had arrived at the final stage of his luncheon helped himself to another pat of butter you dont believe me of course he said yet it happens that i am speaking the truth you are thinking i guess that i am a pitifully insignificant little unit in this great city in this raging world yet i have spoken the solid truth i can stop the war and if you like you can help me lavendale withdrew his eyes from his new acquaintances face for a moment and glanced towards the girl something that was almost a smile of mutual understanding flashed between them doubtless she had overheard some part of their conversation lavendale raised his voice a little in order that she might hear more he felt a thrill of pleasure at the thought that they were establishing a mutual confidence ill help of course he promised in what direction are your efforts to be made the little man paused in the act of drinking a glass of water squinted at his questioner and set the tumbler down empty wondering what sort of a crank youve got hold of eh lavendale began to be impressed the little man did not look in the least like a lunatic well its rather a sweeping proposition yours lavendale remarked everything in the world the other reminded him didactically was impossible before it was done your help neednt be very strenuous i guess theres some sort of headquarters in london from which this war is run eh theres the war office lavendale explained know any one there yes i know a good many soldiers who have jobs there just now then i guess you can help by saving me time do you happen to be acquainted with any one in the ordnance department lavendale reflected for a moment yes i know a man there he admitted its just as well to warn you though that theyre absolutely fed up with trying new shells and powder the little man smileda queer reflective smile filled with some quality of selfappreciation which seemed at once to lift him above the whole world of crazy inventors your friend there now he asked or will he be taking his british two hours for lunch he never leaves the building after he gets there in the morning lavendale replied mr daniel h hurn signed his bill and laid down an insignificant tip you through with your luncheon he inquired right then what about taking me along and letting me have a word with your friend i dont mind lavendale agreed a little doubtfully but he hasnt very much influence again the other smiled and again lavendale was impressed by that mysterious contortion he glanced towards the adjoining table the girl was still watching them closely jules whom she had apparently just summoned was standing by her side and lavendale was convinced that the questions which she was obviously asking referred to him he left the room with reluctance and followed his companion through the hall and into a taxi not sure whether i told you the latter remarked as he seated himself that my name is hurndaniel h hurnand i come from way out west glad to meet you mr hurn lavendale murmured mechanically you are not taking anything with you to show the people at the war office then mr hurn shook his head not necessary he answered bring me face to face with a live manthats all i need thats all you need to end the war i am an american lavendale reminded him mr hurn glanced at his companion curiously lavendale dressed by an english tailor and at home in most of the capitals of europe was an unfamiliar type shouldnt have thought it he admitted this the place lavendale nodded and paid for the taxi without any protest from his companion whom he piloted down many corridors until they reached a room in the rear of the building a boy scout guarded the door he stood on one side to let lavendale pass but glanced at his companion questioningly would you mind waiting here just for a moment lavendale suggested my friend is in this room working with several other men it would be better for me to have a word with him first sure the other agreed you run the show ill wait lavendale entered the apartment and approached the desk before which his friend was sitting hullo reggie he exclaimed the young man who was hard at work looked up from a sheaf of papers and held out his left hand how are you ambrose sit down by the side of me if you want to talk were up to the eyes here lavendale leaned over the desk look here old chap he went on ive come on a sort of fools errand perhaps ive got a little american outside hes a most unholylooking object but he wants a word with some one in the ordnance department merrill shook his head reproachfully is this quite fair he protested weve had our morning dose of cranks already im sorry lavendale said but youve got to deal with one more know anything about him not a thing lavendale admitted ive talked to him for five minutes and i have just an idea that you ought to hear what he has to say merrill laid down a paperweight upon his documents look here old fellow he said ill take your little pal round to bembridge if you say the word but i warn you he is as fed up as i am and hell be pretty short with him i shouldnt think my man was sensitive lavendale observed anyhow my troubles over if youll do that merrill sighed and closed his desk this way then they passed out of the room to where mr daniel h hurn was waiting merrill seemed a little taken aback as lavendale briefly introduced them and his glance towards his friend was significant however he led them both down the corridor and knocked at a door at the further end is the general disengaged he asked the orderly who opened it they were immediately ushered in two clerks were seated at a great round table apparently copying plans there were models in the room of every form of modern warfare a tall thin man in the uniform of a general was examining some new pattern of hand grenade as they entered sir merrill began addressing him apologetically my friend here mr ambrose lavendale who was in the american embassy for some time has brought mr daniel hurn of chicago to have a word with you the general dropped his eyeglass and sighed an invention he asked patiently something of the sort mr hurn admitted briskly do i understand that you are a general in the british army i am sir general bembridge admitted very well then mr hurn proceeded i am here to tell you thisi can end your war when youre through with smiling at me youll probably say prove it i will prove it theres a row of taxicabs down below take me outside this city of yours to where theres a garden and a field beyond afterwards well talk business youll want to right enough itll take about an hour of your timeand i can end the war there was a moments silence the two clerks who had been writing at the table had turned around general bembridge was looking a little curiously at his unusual visitor mr hurn he said i will be frank with you the average number of visitors who present themselves here during the day with devices which will end the war is twenty today that average has been exceeded i have already spoken to twentyfour you make you see the twentyfifth if we were to go out in taxicabs and watch experiments with every one of them pshaw im not one of those cranks mr hurn interrupted read this he handed a half sheet of notepaper across to the general who adjusted his eyeglass and read the heading at the top of the notepaper was the chicago school of chemical research and its contents were brief mr daniel h hurn is a distinguished member of this society we recommend the attention of the british war office to any suggestion he may make heres another mr hurn went on this is from the greatest firm of steel producers in the worldkind of personal general bembridge glanced at the historic name which recommended mr hurn to the consideration of the government then he sighed i am going tomorrow morning at ten oclock he said to inspect a battery at hatton park three miles from hatfield on the road to baldock you can meet me at the lodge gate at a quarter to ten and i will give you a quarter of an hour this afternoon would have been better mr hurn observed buttoning up the letters in his coat but tomorrow morning it shall be the general waved them away merrill glanced curiously at the american as the three men walked down the corridor those letters did the trick he remarked forgive me if i hurry lavendale dont let your friend be a minute late tomorrow morning or hell lose his chance ill see to that mr hurn promised guess i can hire some sort of an automobile to take me out there good morning captain merrill he added by way of parting salute holding out his curiously stained hand i am much obliged to you for your help and you can sleep tonight feeling youve done more than any man in this great building to save your country merrill winked at lavendale as he disappeared within his room the latter with the inventor by his side stepped out into the street about going down there tomorrow morning he began young man mr hurn interrupted impressively youve done your best for me and its only right you should have your reward you may accompany me to this place wherever it is lavendale laughed softly a laugh which his companion absolutely failed to understand all right he agreed ill take you down in my car ill be at the hotel at nine oclock at five minutes to ten if the general is punctual mr hurn promised you shall see the most wonderful sight you have ever witnessed in your life ii punctually at nine oclock on the following morning lavendale brought his car to a standstill before the front door of the milan hotel mr hurn looking if possible shabbier and more insignificant than ever was waiting under the portico he clambered at once to the seat by lavendales side havent you any apparatus to bring or anything the latter inquired mr hurn smiled not a darned thing lavendale was puzzled you mean youre ready to start with your experiment just as you are like this sure the little man answered and youd better get her going they started off in silence once more lavendale as he glanced at the shabby little object by his side began to lose confidence as they swung round into golders green he spoke again what sort of a show are you going to give us he asked mr hurn glanced at his watch youll know inside of an hour he replied lavendale frowned his protgs appearance that morning was certainly not prepossessing his collar showed distinct traces of its vicissitudes upon the previous day his ugly discoloured hands were ungloved his boots were of some dull indescribable material which seemed to have escaped the attentions of the valet his flannel shirt was of the style and pattern displayed in strand establishments which cater for the unsthetic he had discarded his hat for a black cloth cap and he had developed a habit of muttering to himself lavendale pressed the accelerator of his car and increased its pace i suppose ive made a fool of myself he muttered they reached the open country and drew up in due time before the lodge gates of what seemed to be a very large estate there was no sign as yet of the general mr hurn descended briskly and at once embarked upon a survey of the neighbourhood lavendale lit a cigarette and paused to watch the approach of a great limousine car rushing up the hill it passed them in a cloud of dusthe stood staring after it notwithstanding the closed windows he had caught a glimpse of a face of eyes gazing with strained intentness out on to his side of the roadthe face of a woman convulsed with urgencythe woman who had played such queer havoc with his thoughts almost at the same moment there was a rasping voice in his ear say mr lavendale theres just one thing i ought to have warned you people about you dont want any spectators to this show there aint no one on this earth has seen what you are going to see lavendale was conscious of a queer flash of premonition they threethe girl the crazy little american and he himselfat this critical moment seemed to have come once more together what was the girl doing out here could her appearance really be fortuitous the little mans warning became automatically associated with this unexpected glimpse of her then with a returning impulse of sanity lavendale brushed his suspicions on one side therell only be farm labourers within sight anyway he remarked you see no one could have known that we were coming here that may be so or it maynt mr hurn replied dryly anyway i guess this is the boss coming along an open touring car driven by a man in khaki drew up at the lodge gate general bembridge descended briskly and came towards them followed by captain merrill glad to see you are punctual mr hurn he said now if you please i am at your disposal for a quarter of an hour what is it that you have brought to show me thats all right general mr hurn replied affably you dont need to worry ive been taking my fixings round here just step this way he shambled along across the turf the others followed him the general walking by lavendales side hasnt your friend brought any apparatus to show us he inquired irritably whats he going to do heaven knows sir lavendale replied he has told me nothing if it werent for those letters he showed you i should have thought he was a lunatic mr hurn assembled the little party about twentyfive yards ahead of a fringe of trees which bordered the roadside and terminated after a slight break in a compact little spinney he turned to captain merrill say young man he suggested you just hop round the other side and make sure theres no one about merrill in obedience to a glance from the general hurried off the latter turned towards mr hurn you are leaving us very much in the dark sir he remarked what is it that you propose to attempt i propose to accomplish on a small scale mr hurn said grandiloquently a work of destruction which you can repeat upon any scale you choose see here with the utmost solemnity he drew from his pocket a schoolboys ordinary catapult and a pillbox from the latter he selected a pellet a little smaller than a marble he fitted it carefully into the back of the catapult captain merrill who had completed his tour of the spinney returned there is no one about sir he announced mr hurn had suddenly the air of a man who attempts great deeds his attitude as he stepped forward was almost theatrical the general had become very stern and was obviously annoyed lavendales heart was sinking fast he was already trying to think out some form of apology for his share in what he felt had developed into a ridiculous fiasco nevertheless their eyes were all riveted upon the strange little figure a few feet in front of them slowly he drew back the elastic of the catapult and discharged the pellet it struck a tree inside the spinney and there was immediately a curious report which sounded more like a slow muttering of human pain than an ordinary detonation mr hurn pointed towards the spinney there were great things in his attitude and in his gesture a queer very faint grey smoke seemed to be stealing through the place there was a sound like the splitting of branches amongst the trees the shrill death cries of terrified animals the general would have moved forward but mr hurn caught him by the belt stay where you are all of you he ordered the place aint safe yet the wonder began to grow upon them the various shades of green in the spinney seemed suddenly before their eyes to change into a universal smokecoloured ashengrey without any cause that they could see the bark began to fall away from many of the trees as though unseen hands were engaged in some gruesome task of devastation the little party stood there spellbound watching this mysterious cataclysm mr hurn glanced at his watch you can follow me now he directed with this strong westerly wind you wont need respirators but breathe as quietly as you can they followed him to the edge of the spinney there was not one of them who was not absolutely dumbfounded every shred of colour had passed from the foliage the undergrowth and the hedges flowers and weeds every living thing were the same ashen colour the ground on which their footsteps fell broke away as though the life had been sapped from it there were two rabbits a dead cock pheasant the glory of his plumage turned into a sickly grey and a dozen smaller birds all of the same ashen shade lavendale kicked one of them it crumbled into pieces as though it were the fossil of some creature a thousand years old the pellet which i discharged from the catapult mr hurn announced in his queer squeaky voice contained two grains of my preparation shells can be made to contain a thousand grains i reckon that this spinney is eighty yards in area i will guarantee to you that within that eighty yards there is not alive at the present moment any bird or insect or animal of any kind or description just as they have died so would have any human being who had been within this area have passed away the rest is a matter of the multiplication table but will your invention bear the shock of being fired from a gun the general asked eagerly that is all arranged for mr hurn replied i have some trial shells here the powder which is my invention is of two sorts separated in the shell by a partition they are absolutely harmless until concussion breaks down that division this little matter he added waving his hand upon that scene of hideous desolation is like the bite of a flea a dozen boys with catapults could destroy a division with two batteries of guns general you could destroy ten miles of trenches and a hundred thousand men they walked around the spinney still a little dazed with the wonder of it suddenly lavendale gave a little cry out in the field on the other side lay the motionless body of a woman they all hurried towards it i thought you came round here merrill the general exclaimed i did sir the young officer replied there wasnt a soul in sight lavendale was the first to reach the prostrate figure almost before he stooped to gaze into her face he recognized her there were little flecks of grey upon her dress and she was ghastly pale her eyes however were open and she was struggling helplessly to move i am all right she assured them feebly has any oneany brandy she tried to sit up but she was obviously on the point of collapse mr hurn pushed his way to her side from another pillbox which he had withdrawn from his pocket he took out a small pellet and forced it unceremoniously through her teeth i invented an antidote whilst i was about it he explained had to keep on taking it myself when i was experimenting shes only got a touch of it shell be all right in five minutes what i should like to know is he concluded suspiciously what the devil she was doing here any way the recovery of the young lady was almost magical she first sat up then with the help of lavendales hand she rose easily to her feet she pointed to the spinney what on earth is this awful thing she faltered no one spoke for a minute what were you doing round here young lady mr hurn asked bluntly she looked at him with her big innocent eyes as though surprised i was motoring along the road she explained when i saw you stop she went on turning towards the general i remembered that i had heard there was to be a review here i thought i might see something of it there was a silence perhaps merrill suggested the young lady will give us her name and address she raised her eyebrows slightly but willingly she answered i am miss suzanne de freyne and my address is at the milan court i havent done anything wrong have i nothing at all lavendale assured her hastily its we who feel guilty but what does it all mean she demanded a little pathetically i was just walking across the field when suddenly that happened i felt as though all the strength were going out of my body i didnt exactly suffocate but it was just as though i was swallowing something which stopped in my throat capital mr hurn exclaimed his face beaming most interesting perhaps after all he went on complacently if we may take it for granted that the young ladys presence is entirely accidental her experience is not without some interest to us but will no one tell me what it means she persisted there was a silence lavendale was suddenly oppressed by a queer foreboding the general took miss de freyne courteously by the arm and led her on one side he pointed with his riding whip to the gate where the limousine was standing young lady he said captain merrill here will take you back to your car you will confer a great obligation upon every one here and upon your country if you allow this little incident to pass from your mind she laughed softly her eyes seemed to be seeking for something in lavendales face which she failed to find then she turned away with a shrug of the shoulders and glanced up at captain merrill i am not a prisoner am i she asked let me assure you all she declared with a little wave of farewell that i never want to think of this hateful spot again they watched her pass through the gate and enter the car which was standing in the road does any one know her the general inquired she was at the next table to mr hurn here when i spoke to him at the milan lavendale observed thoughtfully she was listening to our conversation it may be a coincidence but it seems strange that she should have been on our heels just at this particular moment the general passed his arm through mr hurns the intelligence department shall make a few inquiries he promised as for you my dear sir our positions are now reversed my time is yours i will find another opportunity to inspect these troops will you return with me to the war office at once right away mr hurn assented and general he went on swaggering a little as he shambled along by the side of the tall alert military figurequeerest contrast in the worldgive me a factoryone of your ordinary factories will do all your ordinary appliances will do but give me control of it for one month and you can invite me to berlin to the peace signing at about halfpast eight that evening after having waited about for some time in the hall of the milan grillroom lavendale handed his coat and hat to the vestiaire and passed into the crowded restaurant a young man of excellent poise and balance he was almost bewildered at his own sensations as he elbowed his way through the throng of waiters and passersby at the corner of the glass screen he paused the girl was there seated at the same table with a newspaper propped up in front of her her black hair seemed glossier than ever her face unshadowed by any hat a little more pallid and forceful a fur coat had fallen back from her white shoulders she seemed to be wholly absorbed in the paper in front of her a table monsieur a soft voice murmured at his elbow lavendale shook off his abstraction and glanced reluctantly away i am dining with mr hurn jules he replied he said eight oclock but i cant see anything of him jules pointed to a table close at hand evidently reserved for two people there were hors doeuvres waiting and a bottle of wine upon the ice mr hurn ordered dinner for eight oclock punctually sir he announced i have been expecting him in for some time the girl as though attracted by their voices had raised her eyes she looked towards the unoccupied table by the side of which jules was standing the three of them for a moment seemed to have concentrated their regard upon the same spot and lavendale was conscious of a queer little emotion an unanalyzable foreboding the gentleman ordered a very excellent dinner jules observed i have already sent back the cocktails twice lavendale glanced at the clock almost at the same time his eyes met the girls there was a quiver of recognition in her face he took instant advantage of it and moved towards her you are quite recovered i trust miss de freyne she raised her eyes to his again he felt that sense of baffling impenetrability it was impossible even to know whether she appreciated or resented his question i am quite recovered thank you she said you have seen nothing more of our queer little friend nothing at all she told him he invited me to dine with him lavendale explained at eight oclock punctually i have been waiting outside for nearly half an hour she glanced at the clock and lavendale with a little bow passed on perhaps he meant me to go up to his room he remarked addressing jules do you know his number eightynine in the court sir the man replied shall i send up ill go myself lavendale decided jules bowed and although lavendale did not glance around he felt that the girls eyes as well as the mans followed him to the door he rang for the lift and ascended to the fourth floor made his way down the corridor and paused before number eightynine he knocked at the doorthere was no reply then he tried the handle which yielded at once to his touch inside all was darkness he turned on the electric light and pushed open the door of the sittingroom just in front mr hurn he exclaimed raising his voice there was still no replya strange brooding silence which seemed to possess subtle qualities of mystery and apprehension lavendale had all the courage and unshaken nerves of youth and yet at that moment he was afraid his groped along the wall for the switch and found it with an impulse of relief the room was flooded with soft lightlavendales hand seemed glued to the little brass knob he stood there with his back to the wall his face set speechless mr daniel h hurn was seated in an easychair in what appeared at first to be a natural attitude his head however had fallen back and from his neck drooped the long end of a silken cord lavendale took one step forward and then paused again the mans face was visible nowwhite ghastly with wideopen sightless eyes the valet who was passing down the corridor paused and looked in at the door is there anything wrong sir he asked lavendale seemed to come back with a rush into the world of real things he withdrew the key from the door stepped outside and locked it you had better take that to the manager he said i will wait outside here tell him to come at once anything wrong sir the valet repeated lavendale nodded the man there in the chair is dead he whispered chapter ii the lost formula the two young men stood side by side before the window of the milan smokeroomambrose lavendale the american and his friend captain merrill from the war office directly opposite to them was a narrow street running down to the embankment at the foot of which they could catch a glimpse of the river a little to the left was a dark and melancholy building with a number of sightless windows wonder what sort of people live in that place merrill asked curiously milan mansions they call it dont they the other nodded gloomy sort of barracks he remarked ive never seen even a face at the window theres a new experience for you then merrill observed pointing a little forwarda girls face too lavendale was stonily silent yet when the momentarily raised curtain had fallen he gave a little gasp it could have been no hallucination the face transfigured though it was in a sense by its air of furtiveness was without a doubt the face of the girl who had been constantly in his thoughts for the last three weeks he counted the windows carefully from the ground noted the exact position of the room and passed his arm through his friends come along reggie he said where to dont ask any questions lavendale begged just wait they left the hotel by an unfrequented way lavendale half a dozen paces ahead merrill ventured upon a mild protest look here old chap he complained you might tell me where we are off to lavendale slackened his speed for a moment to explain to that room he declared didnt you recognize the girls face merrill shook his head i scarcely noticed it it was the girl whom we found unconscious half poisoned by that fellow hurns diabolical invention lavendale explained she wasnt there by accident either i caught her listening in the milan grillroom when hurn was talking to me and the day after the inquest she disappeared merrill laid a hand upon his friends arm even if this is so lavendale he expostulated she probably doesnt want us bothering over here what are you going to say to her pretty sort of asses we shall look if we blunder in upon her like this lavendale continued to climb the stairs by this time they had reached the second landing if you feel that way about it merrill he said you can wait for meor clear out altogether if you like i want to have a few words with this young lady and i am going to have them merrill sighed ill see you through it ambrose he grumbled all the same im not at all sure that we are not making fools of ourselves they mounted yet another flight a crazy lift went lumbering past them up to the top of the building lavendale paused outside a door near the end of the passage this should be the one he announced he rang a bell they could hear it pealing inside but there was no response once more he pressed the button this time it seemed to them both that its shrill summons was ringing through empty spaces there was no sound of any movement within the door of the next flat however opened a tall rather stout man very untidily dressed with pale unwholesome face and a mass of illarranged hair looked out sir he said it is no use ringing that bell the only purpose you serve is to disturb me at my labours the flat is empty are you quite sure about that lavendale asked absolutely how was it then that i saw a face at one of the windows a quarter of an hour ago lavendale demanded you are mistaken sir was the grim reply the thing is impossible the porter who has the letting of the flat is only on duty in the afternoon and as a special favour to the proprietors i have the keys here then with your permission i will borrow them lavendale observed i am looking for rooms in this neighbourhood the man bowed and threw open the door come in sir he invited pompously i will fetch the keys for you my secretary he added with a little wave of his hand pointing to a florid overbuxom and untidylooking woman who was struggling with an ancient typewriter you find me hard at work trying to finish a play i have been commissioned to write for my friend tree you are aware perhaps of myeridentity i am sorry lavendale replied you see i am an american not a londoner that the other declared accounts for it my name is somerskeynehamilton somerskeyne my work i trust is more familiar to you than my personality naturally lavendale assented a little vaguely the dramatist who had been searching upon a mantelpiece which seemed littered with cigarette ends scraps of letters and an empty tumbler or so suddenly turned around with the key in his hand it is here he pronounced examine the rooms for yourself mr lavendale mr lavendale they are furnished i believe but as regards the rent i know nothing except that the myrmidon who collects it is unpleasantly persistent in his attentions if you will return the key to me sir when you have finished i shall be obliged certainly lavendale promised the two young men opened the door and explored a dusty barelyfurnished gloomy conventional little suite consisting of a single bedroom a boxlike sittingroom and a bathroom in the last stages of dilapidation the rooms were undoubtedly empty nor was there anywhere any sign of recent habitation lavendale stood at the window leaned over and counted when he drew back his face was more than ever puzzled he looked once more searchingly around the unprepossessing rooms this was the window reggie he insisted merrill had lost interest in the affair and did not hesitate to show it seems to me you must have counted wrongly he declared in any case theres no one here now and its quite certain that no one has been in during the last hour or so lavendale said nothing for a moment he examined the flat once more carefully locked it up and took the key back to mr somerskeynes room the dramatist opened the door himself you were favourably impressed i trust with the rooms he inquired holding out his hand for the key i am not sure lavendale replied tell me how long is it since any one occupied them they are dusted and swept once a week mr somerskeyne told him looking closely at his questioner from underneath his puffy eyelids and they may have been shown occasionally to a prospective tenant otherwise no one has been in them for nearly a month no one could have been in them this morning then absolutely impossible was the confident answer the keys have not been off my shelf we must not interrupt you further lavendale declared i shall apply for a first night seat when your production is presented mr somerskeyne you are very good sir the other acknowledged your face i may say is familiar to me as a patron of the theatre what are the chances may i inquire of your taking up your residence in this building i have not made up my mind lavendale replied there are some other particulars i must have i shall call and interview the hallporter this afternoon if a welcome sir from your nearest neighbour is any inducement mr somerskeyne pronounced let me offer it to you my secretary too miss browni think i mentioned miss browns nameis often nervous with an empty flat next door i am out a great deal in the evening mr lavendale my work demands a constant study of the most modern methods of dramatic production you follow me i am sure absolutely lavendale assured him by the by sir we are returning for a moment or two to the bar at the milan if you will accompany us mr somerskeyne was already reaching out for his hat with the utmost pleasure my dear young friends he consented the milan bar was at one time a hallowed spot to me misfortunes of various sortsbut i will not weary you with a relation of my troubles if tree rings up flora say that i shall have finished the second act tonight you can tell him that it is wonderful now gentlemen they left the building together and a few moments later were ensconced in a corner of the bar with a bottle of whisky and some tumblers before them lavendale helped his guest bountifully he had hard work however to keep the trend of the conversation away from the subject of mr somerskeynes early triumphs upon the stage which it appeared were numerous and remarkable with every tumblerful of whisky and soda indeed he seemed to grow more forgetful of his home across the way as he expanded he grew more untidy his tie slipped his collar had flown open his waistcoat was spotted with the liquid which had fallen from the glass in his unsteady efforts to lift it to his lips his pasty face had become mottled lavendale who had been watching his guest closely fired a sudden question at him you dont happen to know a miss de freyne do you he inquired innocently the change in the man was wonderful from a state of maudlin amiability he seemed to be stricken with an emotion of either fear or anger his eyes narrowed he set his glass down almost steadily although he was obliged to breathe heavily several times before he spoke miss de freyne he repeated what about her lavendale pointed towards the window behind them nothing except that when i was in here an hour ago i saw miss de freynes face at the window of that empty suite next to yours he said mr somerskeyne rose to his feet a splendid dignity guided his footsteps and kept his voice steady sir he pronounced i am able to surmise now the reason for your excessive hospitality i wish you good morning he turned towards the door mr somerskeyne lavendale began rising hastily to his feet the dramatist waved him away his gesture if a little theatrical was final the honours remained with him lavendale a few minutes later on his way to his luncheontable in the grillroom threw his accustomed glance across the room towards the corner which was still possessed of a peculiar interest for him he paused in the act of taking his place at her same table with a little pile of manuscript propped up in front of her miss de freyne was seated studying the luncheon menu for a moment he hesitated then he rose to his feet and crossing the room addressed her miss de freyne she glanced up in some surprise she seemed indeed scarcely to recognize him you have not forgotten me i hope he continued my name is lavendale of course she assented slowly you were the friend of that strange little creature with the marvellous invention werent you i was scarcely his friend lavendale corrected but i did my best to help him she made a pencil mark in the margin of the manuscript and laid it face downwards upon the table then she leaned back in her chair and looked at him tell me what happened she begged i was obliged to leave london the next day and i have only just returned was it suicide or murder the man was murdered without a doubt lavendale replied is that so really she asked gravely tell me had he given over his formula to the war office lavendale sighed unfortunately no he was to have handed it over at eleven oclock the next morning was it found amongst his effects not a written line of any sort is any one suspected she inquired dropping her voice a little lavendale hesitated and glanced cautiously around scarcely that he answered but you remember the man jules the matres dhtel here she nodded a swiss wasnt he i was just wondering what had become of him during the investigations the next day lavendale continued it was discovered that his papers were forged and that he was in reality an austrian he was interned at once of course and i believe there was a certain amount of secrecy about his movements on that night so far as i know though nothing has been discovered she raised her eyebrows deprecatingly the detective system over here she remarked is sometimes hopeless isnt it yet in one respect lavendale pointed out they certainly were prompt on that night i understand that jules was interned within an hour of the discovery of the murder miss de freyne drew her manuscript towards her with a little shrug of the shoulders they failed to find the formula though she reminded him lavendale accepting his dismissal returned to his place finished his lunch and made his way round to the milan mansions a caretaker was established now in his office in the hall he was a small and rather melancholylooking man who hastily concealed a blackened pipe as lavendale entered i understand that you have a suite to let the latter began upon the third floor the man pulled out a list we have several suites to let sir he replied nothing upon the third floor though what about number thirtytwo the caretaker shook his head number thirtytwo is let sir are you sure lavendale persisted i called this morning and was allowed to look over it by mr somerskeyne who had the keys it was taken by a young lady just before one oclock at our head office the man told him with regard to the other suites sir could you tell me the young ladys name lavendale interrupted i havent heard it yet the man answered shortly with regard to the other suites lavendale slipped a coin into his hand thank you he said there is no other suite in which i am interested for the moment he stepped out almost on the threshold he met miss de freyne face to face are you coming he asked raising his hat to take possession of your new abode she was entirely at her ease she looked at him however a little curiously it was as though she were trying to make an appreciative estimate of him in her mind i suppose she observed with a little sigh that we are playing at crosspurposes you are an american are you not mr lavendale i am he answered germanamerican no englishamerican no what then american tell me exactly what that means she insisted it means that my sympathies are concentrated upon my own country he answered those prefixesgermanamerican or englishamericanare misnomers wherever my personal sympathies may be my patriotism overshadows them now you know the truth about me i am an american for america she sighed yes she murmured i had an idea that was your point of view i am a frenchwoman you see for france our interests he remarked should not be far apart if i were sure of that she declared the rest would be easy i am for france and for france only you are for america and i am afraid for america only chance in this instance he ventured has at any rate made us allies i should like to feel quite sure about that she said if you are not busy will you walk with me on to the embankment they strolled down the narrow street and found a seat in the gardens between thieves she continued looking him in the face there is sometimes honour why not amongst those who are engaged upon affairs which if not nefarious are at least secret let us see whether we can be allies and if not where our interests clash you know perfectly well as i do that jules murdered that little chemist from chicago and stole the formula you know very well that the suite in which you take so much interest in the milan mansions belongs to jules you know very well that he was arrested there a quarter of an hour after he left the hotel and that he had had no time to dispose of the formula you know that the place has been searched inch by inch but that the formula has not been found i have just arrived exactly as far as that myself lavendale assented mendaciously you are some time behind me but it is true that we have arrived at the same point she continued now the question is can we work together what should you do with the formula if ever it came into your possession his lips tightened i cannot tell you that he said firmly i believe that i know she went on well let me put you to the test she opened a black silk bag which she was carrying a little trifle with white velvet lining and turquoise clasp from a very dainty pocketbook in the interior she drew out a crumpled sheet of paper covered with strange cabalistic signs she smoothed it out upon her knee and handed it to him well she exclaimed there it is now you shall tell me what you are going to do with it his hand had closed over the piece of paper he gripped it firmly before she could stop him he had transferred it to his own pocket she shrugged her shoulders you had better return it to me she advised i shall not he replied forgive me i did not ask you for the formulai did not know you had discovered itbut since i have it i want you to remember that it was the discovery of an american and i shall keep it for my country but your country is not in need of anything of the sort she protested i will be so far frank with you as to explain my motive he said a few months ago i was attached to the american embassy here i have been attached to the embassy in paris and for two months i was in berlin i have come to certain conclusions about america in which i differ entirely from the popular opinion and the popular politics of my country england has been living for many years in great peril but there have been many who have recognized that the peril of america is at least as great and has remained almost altogether unrecognized we have no army a small navy an immense seaboard wealth sufficient to excite the cupidity of any nation and we have no allies we make the grave and serious mistake of ignoring world politics of believing ourselves outside them and yet imagining ourselves capable of protecting the interests of american citizens in foreign countries that is where i know we are wrong i have resigned from the diplomatic service of america but i remain her one secret agent i intend to keep this formula for her she will need it suzanne de freyne shook her head you will not be able to leave the gardens alive with it she assured him he glanced at her incredulously her smooth face was unwrinkled she had the air of looking at him as though he were a child you are in the kindergarten stage of your profession she observed now watch you see those two men seated on the bench a little way further down well she rose from her seat shook out her skirt and sat down again the two men also had risen and were advancing towards them she held up her handthey seemed somehow to drift away i repeat she went on that you would not leave this garden alive but my friend we will not quarrel over a worthless scrap of paper for that is precisely what you have carefully buttoned up in your pocketbook i have failed to find the formula that is a dummy keep it if you will there isnt a single intelligible sign upon it he drew it from his pocket and glanced at it even with his slight knowledge of chemistry he was compelled to admit that her words were truth keep it or give it me back as you like she continued it has no value the fact remains that in his brief journey from the service room at the milan grillroom to his rooms in the milan mansions jules managed to conceal somewhere or other the paper which he has taken from hurn if he passed it on to some one else it is by this time in germany but we have reason to know that he did not the paper is still in concealment it is still to be found and the means he asked she shrugged her shoulders lightly alas she exclaimed how can i tell you now how can i even engage your help you have disclosed your hand he sat gazing gloomily out at the river very well he decided at last let me help and i will be content with a copy of the formula she smiled that is rather sensible of you she said to tell you the truth i require your help for reasons which i need not explain we do not wish this matter to be dealt with in any way officially i am in perfect accord with the english secret service but we do not wish to have their men seen about the milan mansions tonight jules reenters into possession of his rooms i offer you an adventure it is what you wish but i thought jules was interned he was and is she told him but the greater powers are working this afternoon he will be permitted to escapehe thinks through the agency of friends he will come to london in a motorcar he will come at once to his rooms and although every inch of them has been searched i am perfectly convinced that somewhere in them or between them and the milan he will lay his hands upon the formula you care about this adventure his eyes flashed care about it he repeated enthusiastically she smiled and rose to her feet leave me now she begged i want to speak to one of those men for a minute you can dine with me in the grillroom at the milan at seven oclock in morning clothes till then au revoir the spirit of adventure warmed lavendales blood that night he ordered his dinner with unusual care and he was delighted to find his guest sufficiently human to appreciate the delicacies he had chosen and the vintage of the champagne which he had selected their conversation was entirely general almost formal they had both lived for some time in paris and found mutual acquaintances there as they neared the conclusion of the meal she was summoned to the telephone she was absent only for a short time but when she returned she began to collect her few trifles the car passed through slough she said a quarter of an hour ago i think perhaps we had better be moving lavendale signed his bill and they left the hotel together nothing else you think you ought to tell me i suppose he remarked as they crossed the narrow street i am rather in the dark you know the idea is isnt it that jules is coming up to get the formula from some hidingplace in his room where shall we be wait she begged they climbed the stairs in silencethe girl had purposely avoided the lift arrived on the third floor she passed the door of number thirtytwo and knocked softly at the adjoining one there was for a moment no answer at the second summons however the door was cautiously opened the untidy secretary admitted them in her soiled black dress shapeless and crumpled with her fat peevish face and dishevelled peroxidized hair she was by no means an attractive object she pointed half indignantly to where mr somerskeyne was lying upon the couch gazing towards them in incapable silence with a fatuous smile upon his lips if its from you he gets the money for this sort of thing she said sharply why i wish youd keep it and thats straight how are we to get on with our work or anything with him in that condition sconditionsh all right mr somerskeyne insisted making a weak effort to rise miss de freyne frowned for a moment as she appreciated the situation then she waved him back dont try to get up mr somerskeyne she begged we can manage without you lie down and rest for a little time mr somerskeyne sank back with a sigh of content very shorry he murmured treesh awfully annoyed with me promished go down and shee him shevening is this fellow one of your helpers lavendale asked she nodded in a small way never mind we dont need him tonight come here she led him to the side of the wall nearest the adjoining apartment her fingers felt about the pattern of the paper presently she found a crack pushed for a moment and a sliding door rolled back she stretched out her hand through the darkness and turned a small knob a wardrobe door swung outwards they looked into the shadowy obscurity of the adjoining room lavendale whistled softly this is all very well he said but how can we watch jules whilst the door is closed she pointed to two or three little ventilation holes near the top of the wardrobe lavendale applied his eye to one of them and nodded thats all right he admitted theres just enough light listen they could both of them hear the quick eager footsteps of a man lightly shod stealthy ascending the last flight of stairs her fingers gripped his arm for a moment an excitement more poignant than any begotten by their hazardous adventure suddenly thrilled him the greatest adventure of all was at hand the footsteps paused the door slowly opened it was jules who entered he stood looking around for a moment then unexpectedly fingered the switch which stood upon the wall the apartment was flooded with light jules stood in the centre of it distinctly visible he was paler even than usual and his eyes were a little sunken but he had lost somehow or other that bearing of graceful servility which had distinguished him in his former avocation an expression of subdued cunning had taken its place he looked around the apartment searchingly his eyes rested for a moment upon a small print at the further end of the room which was hanging upon the wall in a crooked position as his eyes fell upon it he frowned he seemed suddenly to stiffen into a new attention he glanced once more around him as though in fear and picked up his overcoat from the bed before they could realize what his intentions were he had left the room closing the door behind him what does that mean lavendale whispered she pushed open the wardrobe door a little breath of fresher air was grateful to both of them then she turned and pointed towards the opposite wall it was that print she murmured it must have been a signal to him that he was being watched you see it is on one side i am perfectly certain that when i was here this morning it was straight a signal from whom she had no time to answer him they could hear the door of the next room open their eyes met mr somerskeyne he exclaimed they stepped back into the wardrobe her fingers felt for the spring suddenly they both heard within a few inches of them on the other side of the wall the sound of a click she pressed the spring in vain then she stepped back and turned on the electric light in the room try the door she whispered lavendale tried it as they both expected it was locked she drew a masterkey from her pocket and opened it swiftly they were out in the corridor now empty and silent they could not even hear the sound of any one moving about in mr somerskeynes room lavendale stood before the latters door and listened there was a mumbling as though of smothered voices then suddenly an angry exclamation sick of the lot of you thats what i am heres the old man dictates his rubbish for about an hour a day and talks drivelling drunken piffle for the rest of it wheres my salary coming from thats what i want to know they heard jules apparently trying to soothe her my dear miss brown in a few days if you will only be patient patient whos going to be patient with that old drunkard blithering around all the time ive had enough they heard the sound of stamping footsteps and mr somerskeynes sonorous voice flora my dear mosht unreasonable im sure shimply asked you go out for a few minutes while mr jules and i dishcuss important matter and im going out for a minute miss brown shouted suddenly opening the door and you may thank your stars when you see me again she appeared upon the threshold holding a slatternly hat upon her head with one hand and sticking hatpins in with the other she stared insolently at lavendale and his companion and brushed her way past them heres visitors for you she called out over her shoulder youll have to get rid of them now before you start on your precious business she flopped down the stairs the newcomers stepped across the threshold jules stared at them in surprise mr somerskeyne nodded his head ponderously his mind seemed to be still running upon miss browns departure a mosht ungrateful young woman he declared misherde freyne your shervant thish gentleman is the tenant of the roomsh you looked over other day mr lavendale dont like you dont want you here ashked me questions about you mish de freyne not a nice young man at all you lishen to me a moment he staggered to his feet jules stood in the background there was something of the old obsequiousness about his manner mr somerskeyne swayed for a moment upon his feet then lavendale felt a sudden inspiration he turned on his heel excuse me for one moment he whispered to the girl by his side he turned away with no show of haste though the eyes of both men seemed to follow him then he ran down the stairs on tiptoe taking them three at a time as he neared the ground floor the motorcar was drawn up outside there was no sign of any one else in the street he sprang to the other side of the way and saw at once the object of his pursuit hurrying down towards the embankment he followed her as stealthily as possible without looking around she increased her own pace crossed the embankment and leaned for a moment over the wall a few yards further on were the steps and a little pier and close by a small tug was waiting lavendale who was within reach of her now stretched out his hand and seized her shoulder i want you miss brown he exclaimed she turned and confronted him her face mottled and flushed with the unusual exercise a strand of her unwholesomelooking hair hanging down to her shoulder now whats wrong with you she shouted cant you leave me alone im not coming back where are you going he asked thats none of your business she snapped let me pass he glanced at the tug and his hand closed upon her wrist he was a strong man but she almost succeeded in wrenching herself free look here miss brown he said the games up i want that paper youre keeping for jules she suddenly showed her teeth her face was like the face of a wild animal she struggled so violently that they swayed towards the parapet her left hand slipped into the bosom of her gown before he could stop her her fingers were making pulp of the paper which she had drawn up in crushed fragments she threw it over the parapet into the black water then she ceased to struggle she laughed hysterically and leaned back against the wall the water near where the fragments of paper had fallen was all churned upthe little tug had hurried off clever aint you she mocked any need to hold on to me any more he released her wrist the car had come thundering down the little street it suddenly pulled up with a grinding of brakes suzanne sprang lightly out the formula she cried he pointed downwards to the water destroyed her sigh was almost one of relief was there a tug here she asked eagerly he nodded it made off when they saw us struggling he told the truth then she exclaimed jules shot himself as soon as he realized that the game was upthere in the room before me a few minutes ago he told me with his last breath that the formula was on its way down the river to germany lavendale smiled grimly its on its way down the river right enough he assented but i dont think it will reach germany chapter iii a deal with niko lavendale paused in the act of struggling with his tie and looked steadfastly into the mirror in front of him he had heard no definite sound yet some queer intuition seemed to have suddenly awakened within his subconscious mind a sense of the mysterious something close at hand unaccountable minatory his flat was empty and the catch of the front door secure yet he knew very well that he was being watched he turned slowly around what the mischief he broke off in his sentence a small man dressed in black clothes imperturbable yellowskinned and with oriental type of features was standing to attention a clothesbrush in his hand his dark oval eyes rested for a moment upon the crumpled failure of lavendales tie without a word he took another from an open drawer came softly across the room and reached upwards before lavendale knew what was happening the bow which had been worrying him for the last five minutes was faultlessly tied he glanced into the mirror and was compelled to give vent to a little exclamation of satisfaction thats all very well you know he said turning once more around the ties all right but who the devil are you and what are you doing in my rooms the man bowed again the oriental seemed to assert itself in the subtle ease with which he almost prostrated himself sir he explained i am the friend of your servant perkins then perhaps you can tell me where on earth perkins is lavendale demanded he is in the hospital sir the man answered he met with a slight accident while he and i were together i am his messenger i undertook to bring you news of him and to do what i could in my poor way to fill his place for this evening he lent me his key it was in that manner i was able to gain entrance here an accident lavendale repeated what sort of an accident i chose an idle word perhaps the other confessed it was indeed more a matter of sudden illness perkins and i lunched together at the chinese restaurant in piccadilly circus as we left the place he faltered he fainted in the passage i called a taxicab and took him to the hospital it was not a great affair they said but it was better that he should rest there so i came to you and who the dickens may you be my name is niko i came from japan with general kinish military attach to the japanese embassy he has gone to the italian front and left me without a situation youre all right at ties any way lavendale admitted glancing once more into the mirror all the same i think i can get along without a man until perkins comes back his hands sought his trousers pockets but niko shook his head gravely it is impossible he protested perkins may be away for a week i shall wait upon you until he returns it is best well have it your own way lavendale remarked better answer that bell then if it is a lady show her into the sittingroom niko glided away and returned in a moment the lady he announced is in the sittingroom he held up lavendales coat and the latter hastened from the room suzanne de freyne was standing facing the door as he entered her theatre cloak thrown back he took her hands you are adorably punctual he exclaimed tell me she asked a little abruptly how long have you had your valet about five minutes i believe he answered he is a substitute my own man was taken ill at luncheontime why do you ask because he is the first person she explained who has succeeded in puzzling me in one particular way since i can remember he looked at her as though for an explanation and in a moment she continued i flatter myself that i never forget a face your valet is perfectly wellknown to me and yet i cannot tell you who he is lavendale glanced uneasily towards the door i shant keep him he said i hate prejudices but i am full of them the fellows a jap of course suzanne did not reply for a moment her attention seemed to have suddenly wandered then she turned around with a little laugh i am hungry my friend she exclaimed let us go and yet remember this temporary servants are bad things for people who follow our profession they left the room niko was standing with the front door wide open his masters hat and gloves in his hand i will be here at seven oclock in the morning sir he promised and bring news of perkins lavendale nodded the door was closed softly behind them at the bottom of the stairs he glanced up wish i could get rid of the ridiculous idea i have about that fellow he remarked is there anything in your rooms of particulari will not say value i will say interest she inquired i suppose i have the usual amount of valuables he admitted but perkins is a very careful servant and i am sure he would never have sent any one who wasnt reliable as regards my papers and that sort of thing they are all locked up in a safe with a combination lock she did not pursue the subject and it faded quickly from lavendales mind they dined in a quiet corner at the milan and they talked of many things chiefly the war do you realize he asked her towards the end of their meal that you are still a complete mystery to me she nodded affably yes you know what i mean of course he went on three weeks ago we joined hands for a moment we weremay i not use the wordassociates we were not perhaps completely successful in our enterprise but at least we prevented that marvellous secret from ever reaching an enemys hands then you disappeared i heard nothing from you until your voice startled me down the telephone tonightyou want to dine with me well i am your slave and here i am but tell me where have you been all this time in france she answered and what have you been doing attending to my own business and what is that he asked coolly she raised her eyebrows but her air of offence was obviously assumed she lit a cigarette and watched the smoke for a minute he was absorbed in the study of her handsher unusually firm yet delicate fingers ringless save for one large quaintlycut emerald in my life she said i have no confidants that seems a pity he replied we might be useful to one another i am not so sure she answered thoughtfully for instance although we speak together in english my soul is french i am for france and france only england is our very dear ally england is a splendid and an honourable nation but it is frances future welfare in which i am concerned and not englands you on the other hand are saxon england and america after all are very close together greatest mistake of your life he assured her i have a great respect for england and a great liking for english people and i believe that she was dragged into this war without wanting it but on the other hand as i told you once before i am for america and america only england has asked for what she is getting for a good many years if even she gets a good hiding it wont do her any harm but america is so far outside she observed dont you make any mistake he answered promptly the world grows smaller year by year the america of fifty years ago has become impossible today we have our political interests in every country and however slow and unwilling we may be to take up our responsibilities weve got to come into line with the other great powers and use the same methods you may be right she confessed very well then you are for america and i am for france now tell me as between germany and england how are your sympathies with england without a doubt he pronounced mind i am not a rabid antigerman i am not in the least sure that a nation with the great genius for progress that germany has shown is not to some extent justified by taking up the sword to hew a larger place in the world for her own people but that does not affect my answer to your question my sympathies are with england she flicked the ash from her cigarette she was looking a little languidly across the room towards a table set against the wall if your sympathy were a little stronger she remarked quietly i could show you how to render england an incalculable service tell me how first of all she continued look at those three men and tell me what you think of them he turned a little in his place and glanced towards the table which she had indicated one of the three men who were seated at it was obviously a foreigner his hair was grey towards the temples although his moustache was almost jetblack his cheekbones were high his teeth a little prominent he wore evening clothes of the most correct cut his shirt and links were unexceptionable his two companions were men of a different stamp the one who seemed to dominate the party was a huge man cleanshaven with puffy face and small eyes he wore a dark flannel suit of transatlantic cut he was drinking a large whisky and soda and smoking a cigar and had apparently eaten nothing his companion was of smaller build with flaxen moustache and hair and dressed in light grey clothes and yellow boots on the face of it the trio were illassorted well i should say lavendale remarked that the dark man in the corner chair was a foreignera russian for choice the other two are of course american business men the face of the big man seems familiar to me youve probably seen his picture in the illustrated papers she told him that is jacob p weald he was once called i believe the powder king lavendale nodded his manner had become more interested of course he murmured and thats jenkins the secretary to the weald company i wonder who the third man is his name is ossendorfthe baron cyril ossendorf he is a persona grata at the russian embassy and he owns great estates in poland stop lavendale exclaimed this is getting interesting he is buying munitions of course marvellous she murmured dont chaff meits really interesting yes she admitted it is interesting even from its external point of view you are right the baron is probably giving or has given an enormous order for ammunition yet there is something behind that little conference if only we could probe it more interesting than you would believe my friend she paused he waited eagerly but she was silent for an unusually long time you were suggesting he ventured to remind her a few minutes ago that there was some way in which intervention she leaned a little towards him her hand rested for a second upon his i have come to the conclusion she said speaking very softly that one of us either you or i must kill ossendorf he began to laugh and then stopped suddenly a little shiver ran through him for a single second her face was almost the face of a tigress he felt that his laugh was a mistake you are in earnest he muttered she rose from the table gathered up her belongings and allowed him to arrange her cloak about her shoulders except that i retract that possible alternative she said calmly i shall deal with ossendorf myself but i dont understand he persisted how should you she answered smiling by the by where are we going we spoke of a music hall didnt we i have a box at the empire he told her she was stepping by him into the taxi when she suddenly paused her frame seemed to become rigid the empire he told the driver she turned suddenly around your rooms she directed tell him to drive at once to your rooms he was startled but he obeyed her without hesitation a moment later he took his place by her side that valet of yours she exclaimed what about him i told you that i knew his face i have just remembered well a year ago he was an attach at the japanese embassy his name is baron komashi lavendale was mystified are you sure he asked incredulously perfectly certain she insisted but why on earth should he be a friend of perkins and willing to act as my valet its the eternal game she declared and they are clever at it too the japs tell me have you any papers of special value about just now yes in my safe he admitted but no one else has an idea of the combination combination she scoffed niko komashi too tell me are these papers political which you have inside that safe in a measure yes he assented they had reached the street in which his rooms were situated there is no light in my room he said as they ascended the stairs niko must have done his work and gone home yes she murmured he has done his work without a doubt he has a knack of doing that lavendale produced his latchkey the rooms appeared to be empty and in darkness in the sittingroom he unlocked his safe and peered in one by one he examined his papers everything was in perfect order he turned back to his companion nothing has been disturbed he announced confidently she came over towards him put her head for a moment inside the safe and immediately withdrew it niko has been through these papers during your absence she declared if everything is there it is because he had no need to steal he has examined or made copies of what he chose how do you know this he asked incredulously it is quite simple she explained even the cleverest man in the world seems always to forget one thing niko forgot that his clothes and fingers even his breath have always that peculiar oriental perfume what is it likehalf almondblossom half sandalwood i remember i noticed it when he came in lavendale agreed quickly put your head inside that safe again she directed he obeyed at once when he emerged his face was troubled he locked the door mechanically you are right he said they were silent for a moment lavendale was contemplating the lock in a dazed manner he turned to suzanne she had seated herself in his easychair and had thrown back her cloak you were going to tell me he reminded her about this fellow niko you had an idea about him mine is no idea she replied it is a certainty the man who posed this evening as your temporary valet the man who in your absence has opened your safe why it is baron niko komashi he belongs to one of the most aristocratic families of japan but he is a member of the servants club lavendale expostulated he was a friend of perkinsmy servant ostensibly she said dryly he came over here as first secretary to the embassy then he disappeared no one quite knew what had become of him i once had a suspicion now i know you and i my friend are bunglers at the game he plays once more lavendale was looking at the lockunscratched bearing so signs of having been tampered with the thing is a miracle he muttered tell meunless you would rather not she asked leaning a little forward was there any document in that safe likely to be of particular interest to the japanese secret service lavendales face was dark with mingled shame and humiliation there was just the one document that should have been kept from them at all costs he declared bitterly two years ago i wrote a series of articles for an american sunday paper upon our military unpreparedness i dont know that they did any particular good but anyway its a subject i have studied closely that paper i had my fingers on just now contains every possible scrap of information as to our standing army our volunteer forces our artillery our possible scheme of defence on the west and the east our stock of munitions and our expenditure of same per thousand men there was also an air and naval report and a scheme for mining san francisco harbour she leaned back in her chair and laughed most interesting i can quite understand how nikos eyes would gleam whats that she turned her head suddenly lavendale too had started and with a swift movement forward had touched the switch and plunged the room into darkness they heard the soft click of the latch and the opening and closing of the front door they heard the soft footsteps of the intruder across the hall the door of the room in which they were was quietly opened and closed still with that same amazing stealthiness a small dark figure crossed the room and stood before the safe then there was a pause several breathless moments of silence nikos instinct was telling him that he was not alone once more lavendales finger touched the switch and the lights blazed out niko was standing the knob of the safe in his hand his head turned towards them the sudden light had a common effect upon all of them suzanne for a moment held her hand in front of her eyes niko blinked slightly then he drew himself up to his full height of five feet four he stood in front of the safe with his eyes fixed upon lavendale something about his face and attitude bearing a curious resemblance to a statue carved in wax lavendale coughed you remind me baron komashi he said of an old english proverbthe pitcher that goes once too often to the well you know was it something you had forgotten that brought you back no stay where you are please niko remained motionless lavendale moved to a long open cupboard which stood against the wall opened it and groped about amongst its contents for a moment then he swung the door to and slipped some cartridges into the little revolver which he had taken from the top shelf nikos muscles suddenly seemed to relax ever so slightly he shrugged his shoulders it was the gesture of a supreme philosophy theres no need for a row lavendale went on the game you and i are playing at baron komashi requires finesse rather than muscle by a stroke of genius you have read a certain document in that safe that document is naturally of interest to the representative of the one country with whom america might possibly quarrel niko bowed his sleek head i have read the document he confessed it was my business here to read it and now there you have me lavendale admitted it is a document without a doubt of great interest to you and your government will highly appreciate a rsum of its contents at the same time the only way to stop your making use of your information is to kill you the mans face was like the face of a sphinx suzanne leaned a little further back in her chair and crossed her legs it is a fortunate century in which you pursue your career baron she observed and perhaps a fortunate country these little qualms about human life which i can clearly see are influencing mr lavendale scarcely exist even now amongst your people do they we are as yet niko replied suavely free i am thankful to say from the cowardice of the west if i asked you for your word of honour lavendale continued that you would not use that information i might give it you niko acknowledged but my countrys service is a higher thing than my personal honour therefore it would do you no good i shall be frank with you there is no way you can prevent my report being duly made except by killing me i am here a selfconfessed robber if i were in your place i should shoot the cowardice of the west you see lavendale remarked throwing his revolver upon the table you had better get out of the room i might change my mind for a moment niko made no movement suzanne rose to her feet and lit a cigarette as a matter of curiosity she asked tell us why you returned baron he bowed the empire performance is not over until halfpast eleven he explained and it is barely ten oclock i had some faint misgivings as to the resetting of the lock i came back to examine it that is my answer you speak now of curiosity i too have curiosity will you tell me how you knew that i had opened the safe she smiled and lifted her handkerchief for a moment to her lips nikos head was bent as though in humiliation it is so hard to outgrow ones errors he sighed he looked towards lavendale and lavendale pointed impatiently towards the door he took a step or two in that direction then he paused sir he said looking back because your methods are not mine believe me that i still can appreciate their mistaken chivalry the information i have gained i shall use no promise of mine to the contrary would avail you but there is perhaps some return which i might offer more valuable perhaps to mademoiselle yet of some import to you also suzanne leaned a little forward her cigarette burnt idly between her fingers in this great conflict niko continued whose reverberations shake the earth japan watches from afar off there are few who know the reason but there is a reason let that pass my country lays no seal upon my lips what i know i pass on to you a hundred million cartridges and five thousand tons of heavier ammunition which might otherwise have reached russia are lying now at the bottom of the ocean this is the doing of one man a man in the pay of germany a man who is the greatest traitor the world has ever known ossendorf suzanne cried niko bowed and moved towards the door mademoiselle has suspected perhaps he concluded it is i who can assure her that her suspicions are just the greatest plant in america is kept producing munitions by day and night bought with russian gold but never meant to reach their destination it is well he looked at lavendale his hand upon the door lavendale nodded curtly it is well he said mr jacob p weald smoothed out the document which he had been examining and drew a deep sigh of satisfaction say ed he remarked turning to his secretary who was smoking a cigar at the other end of the room thats worth a cool million apiece for us that contract hope theres no hitch the other replied anxiously whats this young fellow from the embassy want nothing to hurt us weald assured him were all right with the authorities all round im glad ed we did the square thing weve had it straight from the british war office to go right along ahead and give russia everything we can turn out well russias going to have it and by gum theres enough ammunition provided for in that contract to make mincemeat of the whole german army there was a knock at the door of the sittingroom and a servant announced mr ambrose lavendale lavendale following closely behind shook hands at once with the two men ive heard of your plant mr weald he said pleasantly wonderful things youve been doing in the way of producing ammunition they tell me been unlucky some with your shipments though havent you thats so the other admitted but thats not our fault we dont come in there our friends have their own steamships eleven of them bought for the job lost two out of three already havent they lavendale remarked say you seem some wise young man mr weald said pleasantly however i got the note from the boss what can we do for you a very small thing lavendale replied i understand that baron ossendorf is coming here to sign that contract at twelve oclock youre dead right sir mr weald admitted and theres a magnum of the best standing there in the ice waiting for the psychological moment mind my being present and asking him one questionjust one lavendale inquired we aint likely to object to anything you want to do young fellow mr weald assured him ed jenkins therehes secretary of the companyand i have got no crooked ideas about this business we are going to bring a few million dollars into our own pockets but we are going to do it on the straight what our ambassador over here says goes and his note asks us to take you into this there was a knock at the door ossendorf was announced and promptly entered he held out a hand each to weald and jenkins then he glanced inquiringly at lavendale this is a young friend of ours from the american embassy mr weald explained mr ambrose lavendalebaron ossendorf hes a kind of witness that alls right and aboveboard baron ossendorf bowed and held out his long elegantlyshaped hand i am delighted mr lavendale he said delighted that you should be a participator in our little business this morning between russia and america there have always been the most cordial sentiments of friendship it is a pleasure to us to think that we are able at these terrible times to be of service to one another you have the contract mr weald ah he added glancing at it through his eyeglass i see that this is the draft which i have already perused nothing remains then but for me to sign it he dipped his pen in the ink stooped down and there was a moments silence whilst his pen spluttered across the paper mr weald began to cut the strings of the magnum of champagne just one moment lavendale interposed there is a little condition baron which it is not proposed to put officially into the agreement a very small matter but may i suggest it to you ossendorf turned his head his eyes had narrowed a little by all means sir the contract lavendale continued slowly is for the whole production of the weald plant for six months with option of continuance until the end of the war shipments are to be made weekly by steamers whose names are given there steamers practically acquired by the russian government you are well informed my young friend ossendorf admitted quietly it has been suggested lavendale said speaking slowly and looking ossendorf in the face that you should change the wireless operator on all those vessels for a person approved by the british government there was a moments deep silence mr weald had paused with his knife already pressed against the last string of the bottle jenkins was standing with his mouth open a little dazed ossendorf shrank back as though he had received a blow it was obvious that he retained his composure with an effort what do you mean he demanded simply this lavendale replied firmly already the iris and the southern star with enough ammunition on board to have supplied an army have gone to the bottom i mean sir that every one of those remaining nine boats on which is to be packed the whole production of the greatest ammunition plant in america is doomed to go to the bottom two great drops of sweat had broken out on ossendorfs forehead his face seemed suddenly to have grown thinner his mouth was open he glared at lavendale but he was utterly incapable of speech the latter turned to weald mr weald he said this contract for your entire output can be signed within twentyfour hours either by a representative of russia other than baron ossendorf or by the secretary of the british munition board this man ossendorf is a paid traitorthe judas of the war mr weald was incapable of coherent speech you mean jenkins faltered that he is in the pay of germany ask him lavendale suggested scornfully ossendorf seemed to wither up he staggered to his feet and groped to the door suddenly something flashed in his hands clasped tightly between them there was a loud report the room seemed filled with smoke they all three looked in a dazed manner at the figure stretched upon the carpet face downwards the shoulders still twitching slightly lavendale stood with his finger upon the bell sorry to have interfered mr weald he said but your stuffs wanted somewhere elsenot at the bottom of the sea ossendorfs body was carried away it was very well understood that the matter was to be hushed up lavendale lingered with mr weald who was walking restlessly about the room still scarcely able to realize what had happened poor devil he kept on muttering poor devil lavendale laid his hand firmly upon his compatriots shoulder look here mr weald he said there are good and bad of every nationgermans americans english or french this man was outside the pale he was a black and dastardly traitor the pariah of humanity he trafficked with the lives of human beings he was a murderer for gold if anything his end was too merciful mr weald nodded reflectively lavendales words were convincing his eyes wandered towards the champagne bottle upon the sideboard he was feeling the strain in that case he murmured perhaps chapter iv general matravers repays mademoiselle suzanne de freyne was travelling back to england in hot haste on the french train she received courtesies rarely extended in these days to any solitary passenger and at boulogne she was hurried from the gangway of the steamer back on to the dock and into an evillooking fourfunnelled british destroyer almost as she set foot on board they moved away from the landingstage an officer came forward to meet her and saluted the captains cabin is at your disposal miss de freyne he announced we have an invalided general on board but weve tucked him up in a bunk afraid we shall give you a bit of a shaking up i am a very good sailor suzanne assured him it is delightful that i am able to come across with you time counts for so much these days we havent any stewardess the young officer remarked as he threw open the door of the cabin youll ring the bell for anything you want though parsons is an awfully good fellow and youll excuse me wont you im on duty he hurried up on deck and in a few moments the destroyer was clear of the harbour and tearing across the channel into the sombre blackness of the night huge waves with a thunderous roar swept her decks the spray leapt high above the tops of her squat funnels from which flashed little jets of flame suzanne driven from the cabin by the craving for air stood halfway up the companionway looking into the blackness here and there a star seemed to reel across the face of the sky and more than once a cloud of spray swept over her head unhesitatingly as though driven by some superhuman hand they ploughed their way through the black wall of space to their destination after the turmoil of the channel their slow gliding up to the side of the dock seemed almost ghostlike suzanne felt almost as though she herself were breathless as she stood at last upon the soaking deck there were a couple of dim lights and a few shadowy figures upon the quay the young officer who had spoken to her at boulogne stood by her side we are throwing a gangway across for you miss de freyne im afraid we gave you rather a rough crossing i do not mind it she declared i was only anxious to come quickly do you know if i shall be able to get on to london at once there will be a special for the general he told her theyll probably take you too the gangway was thrown across the young man saluted and suzanne stepped on to the rainsodden dock an official stepped up to her at once miss de freyne he inquired yes there is a special waiting here for general matravers i have had instructions to attach a coach for you that is very delightful she exclaimed shall i follow you the man piloted her across the track and handed her into an ordinary firstclass compartment attached to the waiting train sorry weve had to give the saloon to general matravers he explained will you have any tea or coffee or anything to eat she gave an order to the refreshment boy whom he summoned and threw herself down with a sigh of content into the corner seat presently a tall man in khaki with his arm in a sling and leaning upon a stick came up the platform followed by two junior officers he was shown at once into the saloon and a little murmur of animated conversation arose five minutes later the train glided away leaving the two junior officers disconsolate upon the long wooden platform passed through the two stations and gathering speed at every moment rushed away northwards suzanne had more than once boasted that she had no nerves she finished her coffee and sandwiches lit a cigarette and curled herself up in her corner for a few moments she looked out into the darkness watching the scanty lights then her eyes turned entirely by chance towards the door which connected her carriage with the saloon they had no sooner rested upon it than a queer inexplicable sense of uneasiness crept over her she tried to look away from it to look out of the opposite window to interest herself in the evening paper she read a line or two then found herself slowly lowering the sheet found herself peering over the top towards that closed door of dark red mahogany with its brass handle she threw the paper down walked to the end of the carriage and back again she must be going mad she told herself the only occupant of that saloon was a wounded soldier of great distinction a general whose deeds in the earlier stages of the war had made history he was alone there without even an adc and in any case the door was probably locked what cause of uneasiness for her could there be in his proximity she fought against her fit of nerves valiantly but she found herself tearing the paper into small pieces crumbling the remains of her roll between her fingers sipping desperately the remnants of her cold coffee and all the time her eyes seemed glued upon that brass doorknob if it should move she set her teeth to keep from screaming when the thing really happened it seemed to bring to a certain extent release from her hysterical fears yet for the first few seconds it paralyzed her the handle turned slowly and deliberately the door was pushed open towards her a man looked in stooping by reason of his height a lean gaunt man clad in the uniform of a general he looked at her for a moment without speech then he came into the compartment and closed the door behind him what do you want she asked hoarsely he saluted mechanically i am general matravers he announced may i sit down she glanced at the communication cordit was on the distant side of the carriage why she should have been afraid of him she could not tell yet she felt as though she had never been in such danger in her life as when he took the seat opposite to her i am general matravers he repeated you have heard of me perhaps but naturally she assented we have all read of your wonderful exploits at mons he moistened his lips with his tongue his face seemed curiously dried up his eyes were hard his features grim and bony he presented somehow a queer impression of lifelessness mons he muttered ruminatingly youve never been to hell have you young lady not yet she answered watching him closely that was the beginning of it he went on we need a dante young lady to sing to us of those days when the winds were driven from the face of the earth by the screeching of the shells and the roar and the clash of the guns and they seemed to be always nearer every foot of ground was red with blood the blood of our dear soldiers and one thought of the people at home i know men who lost their reason at mons it must have been terrible she faltered he sat opposite to her nervously opening and closing the interlocked fingers of his hands you know why i am coming home he asked abruptly medals enough here you see for a fieldmarshal and i am sent home in disgrace she murmured something to which he paid no attention whatever i left my two adcs at folkestone he went on forbade them to enter the train they are worried about me perhaps they are right you see it was atbut we dont mention namesmy headquarters last week it was the night before our advance you read about that i wont mention the name of the place we called it a partial success but for the thing i am going to tell you it might have been the turning point of the war the attack failedmy fault i read that your division did splendidly she remarked again he moistened his dry lips his hands were shaking now by his side he seemed like a man on the verge of paralysis this is what happened he continued i was at headquarters my own headquarters my orderly reported a staff officer from the french headquarters he came in a typicallooking young french soldier wearing the uniform of one of their best regiments one of those which i knew were in the division which was to join up with ours in the morning he was tall and dark with a thin black moustache long narrow eyes a scar on his right cheek sallow and with a queer habit of swinging his left arm he brought me some intelligible perfectly coherent verbal instructions asked a few questions as to my plans for the next day gave me a personal message from the french general commanding the division saluted got back into his motorcar and drove off and i thought no more about it until we found out that our whole scheme of attack was known to the enemy and that they were prepared for us at every point he was a german we were sold thousands of my men were lost through that my fault he was a german are you a german young lady ah but no she exclaimed shrinking a little back you are not wholly english i am half french and half english she told him the french are good people he went on relapsing into his former faraway tone very fine people they can fight too and they can tell germans when they see them that is why i am going homebecause i couldnt ive sworn that the next german i see ill kill youre not a german are you i told you just now she reminded him quietly that i am half french and half englishmostly french i am in the service of the french government at the present moment trying to help you general good girl he said absently i thought there might have been a german in here when i heard some one moving if i cant find one i suppose i must shoot myself he took out a little revolver and examined it he opened the breech and she saw that it was fully loaded may i look she asked he handed it to her at once the window by which they sat was half down she calmly threw it out he looked at her in a mildlyvexed manner you should not have done that young lady he expostulated i was very fond of that revolver besides how am i to kill myself now i should wait she advised him when you get to london you will easily find germanstoo many of them he shook his head but ive nothing to kill them with and ive left my army behind i am sent home he added with a sudden hoarse pathos her sense of personal fear had passed she knew that the dangerous moment if indeed there had been one lay behind there is so much work to be done in england she said he seemed to be looking through the carriage windows his hands were twitching horribly those nights he muttered when we thought that an hours rest had come and the red fires came spitting from our flanks just when we thought ourselves safe when we thought them far and away behind his words became unintelligible he sat quite quiet presently to her joy she saw a carpet of lights on either side and knew that they were running into london you had better get back to your saloon she said we shall be at charing cross in a few minutes and there will probably be some one to meet you he rose obediently to his feet the tears were in her eyes as he turned away with a stiff little salute and stooping low disappeared through the doorway then she leaned back with a longdrawn sigh of relief it was a strange little episode another of the little adventures which gave colour to her life she leaned out of the window and saw the last of him as they drew up he was met by an officer and an elderly lady she saw him pass out and take his place in a waiting motorcar then she stepped out herself handed her bag to a porter and was conducted to a taxicab suzanne sat the next afternoon under the trees at ranelagh with lavendale she leaned back in her chair and breathed a little sigh of contentment and you my friend she asked what have you been doing nothing he answered i am waiting for a man to arrive from america his coming i fancy will provide me with work but until then there is nothing for me to pass the time while you were in france i went over to holland last week she nodded the one country left which may provide us with a sensation she remarked i suppose that is why you went i made a few inquiries he replied my own impression of the people was that they wanted peace very badly and schnapps more than anything else in the world she laughed softly it was significant of his attitude towards her that he asked no questions of her own doings i had a curious adventure on my way back from paris yesterday she told him i travelled up from boulogne in a special with general matravers matravers he repeated isnt he one of the british generals who have been sent home i believe so she assented in fact i am sure of it he told me the whole story on the way up afterwards he brought out a revolver and swore that he was going to shoot himself what on earth did you do he exclaimed i took it away from him she replied he wasnt in the least dangerous really look here lavendale declared earnestly i think its quite time you left off this travelling about alone she laughed gaily but my friend she protested what would you have can a trusted agentshe glanced around for a moment and lowered her voiceof the french and english secret service engage a chaperon i dont care he answered a little doggedly its all very well for us men to take a risk or two but its no sort of life for a girl she checked him at once you dont understand she interrupted i am a daughter of france every drop of blood in my body every part of myself my soul even belongs to my country the work i am doing i shall go on with whatever it might cost me he did not attempt to argue with her the finality of her tone was too absolute i suppose it is because of this spirit he said that france is invincible tell me he broke off in his sentence her fingers had suddenly gripped his arm she had leaned forward in her place coming down the steps on to the terrace was a little group of soldiers in staff uniform one of them in the centre of the group was obviously a foreigner and from the respect with which they all treated him a person of distinction who are they she asked i expect they are members of the military mission from france he explained they are being entertained down here to dinner tonight by some officials from the war office the headwaiter told me about it i tackled him about a table in case you cared to stay down but only one of them is a foreigner she observed he shrugged his shoulders i really dont know anything more about it he said i dont suppose any one does why are you so interested she said nothing for a moment the frenchman was standing chatting amiably in the centre of the terrace and suzanne watched him with curious intensity he was tall he had a slight black moustache his eyes were long and narrow there was a scar on his right cheek he was the very prototype of the man who had arisen in her mind a few hours ago called into being by those hoarse brokenhearted words of the ruined general i must know his name she insisted he looked at her wonderingly but my dear i must know his name she repeated please help me dont ask me why he rose at once ill do my best he promised her he disappeared into the house the little party of men strolled backwards and forwards along the terrace in about five minutes lavendale reappeared he smiled as he approached i got hold of the dinner cards he announced in triumph his name is lieutenantcolonel leychelles the little company of soldiers at that moment began to descend the steps suzanne rose to her feet and standing under the shadow of the trees she leaned forward the man whom she had been watching with so much interest was distinctly swinging his left arm she gripped lavendale by the elbow come with me she insisted come with me at once take me up to town he obeyed promptly they passed through the house and lavendale ordered up his car where to he asked as he took his place at the driving wheel i must find general matravers she declared drive up towards london i must think as we go they glided down the drive over hammersmith bridge and up to the park dont you belong to a club somewhere she asked we must get a whos who why of course he answered we can manage that easily enough he pulled up presently outside the door of the bath club in dover street if youll wait here for half a moment he suggested she nodded and he sprang down and ran lightly up the steps he was back again almost at once the first name i came across he announced belgrave square is the town address shall i drive there its quite close she assented in a few moments they arrived at their destination suzanne stood under the stone portico and rang the bell in due course a butler appeared general matravers is not seeing anybody madam was his prompt reply to suzannes inquiry the doctor has ordered him complete rest my business suzanne explained is very urgent so every reporter who has been here today has told me the man replied a little wearily no one has been allowed to see him is lady matravers in suzanne persisted lady matravers is not receiving perhaps you would like to leave your name and a message madam the man suggested a tall darkhaired woman who had been crossing the hall paused she came a few steps towards suzanne i am lady matravers she announced can i do anything for you suzanne pressed forward and the butler stood on one side lady matravers the former said earnestly i have the most important business with your husband i know he is illi came up from folkestone with him yesterdayand yet i must see him you were his companion in the special train lady matravers asked he spoke of a young lady who travelled up with him i am the young lady suzanne assented i am in the secret service of france she went on dropping her voice a little your husband told me some curious things last night it is in connection with one of them that i wish to see him it isnt for my own sake lady matravers it is for the sake of the country the door was thrown open general matravers leaning upon his stick came into the hall he was looking very white and shaken but he seemed to recognize suzanne he looked at her doubtfully it is the young lady whom i found last night in the carriage attached to my saloon he remarked the young lady my dear he added turning to his wife who threw my revolver out of the window lady matravers glanced towards the servant who was lingering in the background and led suzanne back into the room from which she herself had issued the general followed her a quietfaced woman in nurses uniform rose from a chair as they entered if you are really the young lady who travelled with my husband from folkestone last night lady matravers said kindly i am very glad indeed to meet you he has told me such very nice things about you the doctors orders are that he is not to be disturbed on any account but if you wish to speak to him for a few minutes here he is i was just trying to persuade him to go to bed when you came perhaps what i have come to say may do your husband more good than harm suzanne assured her general she added turning towards him do you mind describing to me once more the man who came to your headquarters masquerading as a french officer an envoy from the french brigadiergeneral the generals face darkened describe him he exclaimed why i cant get him out of my thoughts for a minute he was tall soldierly dark sallow black moustache narrow eyes black hair cut short a scar on his right cheek and he had a habit swinging his left arm when he walked i need not ask you whether you would know him again suzanne said because i am sure you would i may be very foolish and i may be making a very silly mistake but there is a man over here now attached to the french military mission he is being entertained tonight at ranelagh by officials from the war office he leaves tomorrow ostensibly for french headquarters and he answers your description exactly all the nervousness had left the generals manner he was perfectly calm a little eager he picked up his cap and cane from a table where is he to be found he asked if you will come with me suzanne promised i will take you to him the nurse hastened towards them the general pushed her aside his tone had acquired a new firmness please understand both of you he said that no nurse or doctors injunctions will keep me from doing my duty my dear he added turning to his wife and kissing her upon the forehead this is not a matter in which you must interfere if the young lady is mistaken i shall come back at once if by any chance she is right it is imperative that i should go i am at your service madam i will take care of him suzanne whispered to lady matravers they let him go doubtfully but of compulsion he took his place in the car and acknowledged his introduction to lavendale with a stiff salute they started off at once for the first time suzanne began to be a little nervous about the outcome of their journey this man she explained is being entertained at dinner at ranelagh at the present moment we can go down there and you can see from the open doorway of the diningroom whether there is any truth in my suspicions if we are wrong you need have no fear young lady the general assured her calmly i am a member of ranelagh and wellknown there it will be quite in order that i stroll round the place and glance in at the diningroom if your suspicions are as you suggest illfounded no harm will be done if they are true he added his voice shaking for a moment if really it is vouchsafed to me in this life to find myself face to face once more with that man he broke off abruptly and muttered something under his breath not another word was spoken until they had turned in at the avenue and pulled up in front of the clubhouse the general had become preternaturally calm he waited however for suzanne to precede him if you will lead the way young lady he suggested they crossed through the two rooms out on to the terrace the other side and turned towards the diningroom the gardens were bright with flowers and the glow of the sunset seemed still to linger about the place one or two visitors who had dined early were already having their coffee under the trees from a hidden spot the musicians were tuning their instruments suzanne felt her heart beat rapidly as they drew near the diningroom the general apparently unmoved walked with measured tread a commanding and dignified figure a couple of young soldiers stood up as he passed and he accepted their salute genially then he passed into the diningroom almost immediately in front of him at the table usually reserved for the golfers luncheon the dinnerparty was proceeding and on the righthand side of the host sat the distinguished frenchman he was facing the door and he glanced up at the entrance of the little party suzanne asked no questions she felt her breath almost stop a little sob choked her the faces of almost every one in the room the laughter the murmur of conversation seemed suddenly in her mind to have become arrested more than anything else in the world she was conscious of this one thingthe man who sat there knew that his hour had come knew that fate was marching towards him in the shape of that grim military figure the general walked towards the party very much with the air of one who had come to make some casual inquiry it was only when he was recognized that a little interested murmur stole around the room he walked to within a few feet of the frenchman and his right hand seemed to have disappeared for a moment gentlemen he said without unduly raising his voice but with curious distinctness the man whom you are entertaining here as an emissary from our french allies is an impostor a german and a spy he cost me a few weeks ago the lives of two thousand of my men a far smaller thing he is responsible for the ruin of my reputation this is less than he deserves with hand as steady as a rock the general held his revolver out before him and deliberately fired three times at the man whom he had accused and who had fallen forward now his outstretched hands sweeping the wineglasses from in front of himstone dead the general watched his victim without emotion he even leaned forward to make sure that the wounds were mortal then he walked deliberately out into the garden heedless of the shrieking of the women the crowd of diners who had sprung to their feet the passing of the paralysis which had seemed to keep every one in the room seated and silent they found the proofs upon his body that nighthorrifying stupefying proofsand the censors hand came down no word of that tragedy ever appeared under any sensational headline in any newspaper in the face of that grim silence even many of those who had been present found themselves wondering whether that lightning tragedy had not been a nightmare of the brain to suzanne de freyne however it remained always one of the tense moments of her life the general with the revolver still in his hand turned towards her with a polite gesture and a happy smile as he led the way into the garden he tossed the weapon into a bed of geraniums and seemed utterly indifferent to the turmoil around you were right young lady he said that was the man chapter v susceptible mr kessner there was a vigour in her walk a determination in her face which made lavendale pause for an instant before he crossed the street to accost suzanne de freyne it was perfectly clear to him that she was bound upon a serious errand she was dressed with her usual subdued elegance but with more even than her usual simplicity in her black tailormade costume her small hat and neat patent shoes she looked like the rue de la paix at four oclock in the afternoon during its halcyon days he was forced to quicken his pace to intercept her good morning miss de freyne she turned quickly around and held out her left hand her greeting was cordial enough but her air of abstraction did not altogether disappear where have you been hiding for the last few days she asked i came back from holland last night he replied i have been in germany again any news she asked quickly nothing very wonderful i neednt ask how things are with you i can tell that you have something on hand can i help she laughed you are right in a way but i dont think you can help she told him this is quite an important morningit is celias sale he was a little staggered her manner was convincing you mean that you are going to a millinery sale dont be silly she answered the first morning of celias sale is the most important event of the season we have printed cards of invitation and policemen outside the door to keep away intruders this isnt any ordinary bargain hunting you know this is our one chance to provide ourselves with the elegancies of life at a reasonable cost for the moment i gather he went on falling into step with her the affairs of the nation are in the background naturally she assented at what hour he inquired will this function be over she glanced at him suspiciously if i thought you were making fun never entered into my head he assured her then you can give me some lunch at one oclock she promised thats exactly what i was hoping for and miss de freyne well would you mind very much if i brought an acquaintance she glanced at him in some surprise of course not she answered only it must be a grillroom luncheon please i am dressed for a scrimmage at one oclock at the milan grill he told her raising his hat he strolled slowly away southwards crossed pall mall and let himself in by a side entrance to the american embassy here he spent a few minutes in the outer offices and passed on a little later into a more private apartment an elderly man with a cleanshaven face grey hair brushed back from his forehead and tortoiseshellrimmed spectacles looked up from his rolltopped desk and waved his visitor to a seat hullo ambrose anything fresh lavendale drew up a chair and grasped the hand which the other offered him there is plenty going on if one could get to understand it mr washburn he said berlin had me puzzled when did you get back last night see anything of our friend he crossed with me get acquainted with him oh i knew him before in washington and in new york lavendale replied i took care to remind him of it too yes he was quite friendly all the same he was secretive he didnt tell me the one thing i discovered of the greatest interest in connection with his trip and that was that the kaiser sent his private car three hundred miles and met him at the western headquarters they spent the best part of the day together has he been in here mr washburn shook his head he neither reported before he left nor has he been in since he got back kind of giving us the cold shoulder isnt it he hasnt had much time yet lavendale remarked thoughtfully but it certainly doesnt look exactly like the behaviour of a loyal american mr washburn turned in his place removed his spectacles from his eyes and rubbed them carefully with his handkerchief a slight weariness was apparent in his face and tone thats our great trouble ambrose he said germanys a mighty country she holds her sons in a closer grip than any other nation in the world a germanamerican is a german first and an american afterwards and dont you forget it thats what makes us such a polyglot indiscriminate race are you going to make a report not at present lavendale replied i havent yet pieced together the scraps i was able to pick up let it be for a day or two what i am anxious to find out is whether kessner reports here or not and what account he gives if any of his journey to germany ill send you word directly he shows up if he comes at all mr washburn promised i hear there are halfadozen more of his gang in london lavendale nodded theyve some sort of a show on kessner as good as admitted it to me where do you stand with him mr washburn asked curiously im all right up to the present lavendale asserted he believes i went over on a mission about the british prisoners and hes inclined to fancy i may be useful to him anyway he is lunching with me today mr washburn smiled if you think youll get much out of him young fellow he said i fancy youre looking for disappointment the brains that made twenty million in wall street and control an organization so secret that we cant even put a finger upon it yes i know lavendale interrupted rising but you know theres always chance to be reckoned with and ive one card up my sleeve anyway i know all about him and he doesnt suspect me yet exactly why am i asked to this festive lunch suzanne de freyne inquired as she leaned back upon a settee in the small lounge which led into the milan grillroom at a few minutes before one oclock that morning because i am up against a culdesac lavendale confessed and i want your womans wit to show me the way out you seem to be taking it for granted that we are allies she remarked we are to a certain extent he pleaded you must admit that a germanized united states would be bad for you and that is what we have to fight against a waiter set down two cocktails upon a small table in front of them she sipped hers deliberately tell me what is the trouble with this man kessner she asked of what is it that you really suspect him i wish i knew lavendale groaned these are the bald facts washington and new york during the last six months have been the scene of the most desperate efforts of german diplomacy and political manoeuvring with one sole aimthat of preventing the export of munitions of war to england or france money has been spent like water but the progress has been too slow germany has gained adherents to her point of view but not enough america is in a position to be of immense use to the allies and none whatever to germany or austria and up to the present she shows no signs of ceasing to supply england and france and russia with all the munitions she can turn out the german party in america have taken stock of these things they have measured their weakness and tasted defeat everything up to this point has been aboveboard we understood perfectly well what they were fighting for and to a certain extent admitted their grievance they had no grievance miss de freyne interposed perhaps not a logical one lavendale admitted but you see it is perfectly true that while they are supplying munitions on an immense scale to the allies they are supplying none at all to germany and austria that is of course owing to englands control of the sea but it is galling to germany and austria to know that a neutral country is providing her enemies with the means of waging warfare against her from their point of view it is not ideal neutrality is it america is perfectly ready to supply germany and austria as well she reminded him besides germany and austria both supplied england during the boer war that of course is what makes americas position logical he went on but listen kessner and his friends have obviously come to an end of their intriguing in the direction of stopping supplies they have dropped their newspaper campaign they have shrugged their shoulders and apparently accepted the inevitable no one who knows them would believe them capable of anything of the sort kessner has been over here for a month he was in germany when i was he spent a week with the chancellor and a long time with the kaiser himself heyl and both the hindemanns are over here too they have also been in germany you see they are all entitled to call themselves americans although they are germans at heart you think that there is some fresh scheme on she asked i am perfectly certain there is he said firmly not only that but i have an idea as to its bearing this is our friend if you dont know him by sight prepare for a shock a small man dressed in plain black clothes with broadtoed shoes and a tie almost clerical in its simplicity had entered the place and was handing his bowler hat to an attendant his complexion was sallow his general air one of complete insignificance suzanne watched the greeting between the two with intense interest it was hard to realize that this was ludwig kessner twenty times a millionaire the little mans speech and manners wholly belied his appearance his assurance was unlimited he talked easily and with confidence well young fellow he exclaimed so we are back in london eh not late am i not a moment lavendale assured him i want to present you if i may to miss de freyne who is lunching with us miss de freyne he added this is mr kessner she rose with a charming little smile and shook hands with him mr kessner seemed to see no reason why he should conceal his admiration he walked close to her side as they entered the luncheonroom our young friend and i he remarked were hanging over the side of a steamer looking out for submarines this time yesterday not particularly good for the appetite that sort of thing i think it is very brave of you to have really crossed the north sea suzanne declared i should have been terrified to death business is business mr kessner observed and i am something of a fatalist myself i go about what i have to do and take my chances same with mr lavendale i expect only these diplomatists are used to it troublous times miss de freyne times such as i never dreamed we should see in our days by the by are you french or english french english and austrian she told him smiling as they took their places at the table so you see i represent neutrality in my own person my grandmother was austrian and i have never been so happy as when i lived in vienna he nodded approvingly do you know he said i am glad you are not altogether english i dont know which way your sympathies may be in this trouble and i dont know as it matters we each of us have a right to our feelings whatever they may be i am an american first and foremost like our friend here only he has british blood in his veins behind it and i have german we can keep good friends for all that though i think she sighed that i am in a most trying position i adore austria and i have many relations there i am very fond of france and i have some good friends in england i am torn every way after all though she went on reflectively it cannot be as hard for me as for you you really are german are you not and yet you have to sit still and see america doing an enormous lot to help the allies he glanced at her keenly her sincerity was undoubted before he replied he looked also at the occupants of the next two tables young people from the land of musical comedy with their khakiclad escorts intellectually negligible nevertheless he lowered his voice a little as he answered you are quite right miss de freyne it is one of the hardest nuts we have to crack we germanamericans we are honest and aboveboard about it you see we have worked like slaves to direct the policy of america our own way and weve failed is there nothing more you can do she asked earnestly there was a moments silence mr kessner with his napkin tucked in underneath his chin was settling down to his luncheon like a man nevertheless he again glanced searchingly at his neighbour it is hard to see what can be done he said calmly i have been in germany to visit some of my relatives it is very wonderful to hear them all talk there there is no pessimism no doubt whatever no shadow of misgiving germany must winthat is in their hearts they have not a single doubt and here in london whether the people deceive themselves or not they say the same thing they go about their business with even more assurance and they indulge in pleasures far more freely which is going to win she asked neither he replied neither has the preponderance of strength to smash the other it will be a drawn fight there will be a period of peace nominal peace germany knows now what she has to facea world in arms against her when the next time comes she will be ready there will be a next time then germany is not yet at the end of her resources he assured her there are other ways in which she can make herself felt but let us leave for a little time these serious subjects this champagne i know my friend lavendale is a compliment to me you englishamericans do not drink champagne in the middle of the day believe me you are wrong i drink your very good health miss de freyne and yours lavendale and i drink also he added his eyes lightening a little as he looked across the room the unspoken toast he set his glass down empty there is an unspoken toast close to the heart of all of us miss de freyne he remarked one little secret we keep at the back of our thoughts now tell me i sail on saturday on friday night you and our friend lavendale will give me the honour of your company at dinner eh it is arranged at the ritz at eight oclock you are very kind they both murmured he selected a cigar from a box which had been passed him and rose a little abruptly i go to speak with a friend he saida matter of business for your excellent luncheon i thank you very much and for the privilege of having met miss de freyne he added with a little bow i thank you even more till friday then he shuffled across the room an illdressed undignified figure yet with a confidence which surpassed conceit they saw him greet a compatriot and seat himself at the latters table that man lavendale said as he toyed with his coffee spoon has at the back of his head some new scheme it may not be directed against your people i have an idea that it is more likely to be directed against mine but he is an american himself she protested he is a germanamerican lavendale replied which means that he is very much a german and very little an american whatever his new scheme may be she sighed i do not think that he is disposed to talk about it whatever it may be lavendale replied it is my business to find it out one thing is absolutely certain no american would receive the attentions of the kaiserin war time tooand come back here without a word to say about it unless there was something in the background something he meant to keep secret they strolled out into the entrance hall and lavendale departed in search of his hat a waiter came hurriedly out to suzannes side for madame he whispered slipping a little note into her hand her fingers closed upon it quickly she glanced around lavendale was still talking to some acquaintances she opened it and read the few hastily pencilled lines it would give me a great deal of pleasure to see you again before friday i am in flat in the court here shall be alone all this afternoon she crumpled up the note in her hand lavendale was coming towards her can i take you anywhere he asked the car will be outside she shook her head dont bother about me she said i am going up to my room to write some letters come in suzanne turned the handle of number seventyfour closed the door behind her and entered the sittingroom mr kessner turned around in his chair from before a mass of papers he looked at suzanne for an instant in surprise an expression which as he recognized her changed quickly into one of satisfaction he rose to his feet and came towards her this is a great pleasure my dear young lady he said i scarcely dared to hope he took her hands but she evaded him with a little smile you see we are neighbours almost she explained i have an apartment here when i am in london i thought i would call in and see you on the way to my room but pleasedo you mind she pushed him gently away from her for a moment his face darkened then with a shrug of the shoulders he threw himself into the easychair opposite a shapeless illdressed little morsel of humanity with a queer intelligence shining out of his narrowed eyes suggested too in the square forehead and puckered brows listen young lady he said do you know why i asked you to come and see me she raised her eyebrows and laughed at him because you like me i hope she replied for myself i love making fresh acquaintances amongst clever men acquaintances he repeated slowly she nodded several times i am not one of those she said who can gather the whole world in without a pause i like to make acquaintances sometimes an acquaintance may become a friend sometimesbut that takes time she felt the steely light of his eyes upon her and looked modestly down upon the carpet well he went on there were two reasons why i sent for you one i think you have surmised and you keep it there at the back of your pretty little head the otherwell you are a young person of intelligence and mixed nationality i thought it possible that you might be of use to me but in what manner she demanded i was frank with you at luncheontime he said you know where my sympathies lie yours i gathered are divided would it be possible i wonder to induce you to look my way but you yourself admitted she reminded him that the cause of germany in america is lost what more is there to be done young lady he replied the cause of germany in america may be lost for the moment so far as regards our efforts to induce the present administration to carry into effect an ethical neutrality but the great source of germanys greatness is her capacity for looking ahead if one cause is lost then in that day a new one is born if germany had not foreseen and prepared for this war for forty years she would have been crushed today now we who are her sons in foreign countries our eyes too are fixed upon the future then you have a new scheme she said quietly we have a new scheme he admitted but what that may be it is not my intention to tell you at present she pouted at once of course if you are not going to trust me you must not be a foolish child he interrupted you would think little of me if i did and besides he added rising to his feet i am not sure yet that i do trust you wait he touched the bell almost immediately the door of the sittingroom was opened she gave a little start an immense coloured man in dark clothes stood respectfully in the doorway george his master directed if any one rings i am engaged see that i am not disturbed on any pretext very good mr kessner the man closed the door with wonderful softness even his footsteps as he retreated into the bedroom were inaudible kessners elbow was propped against the mantelpiece his head supported in his thin yellowstained fingers he looked down at her if you do not trust me she persisted how can i be of help to you i might put you to the test he said slowly there was nothing distinctly threatening in his tone and yet all at once she was afraid the thought of that black hercules loitering outside something in the downward droop of the eyes of this man all the time edging a little nearer to her seemed suddenly to become terrifying nevertheless she refused to flinch i do not like riddles she declared perhaps you had better think over more definitely what you want to say to me before friday night or send a note up to my room there is no necessity he replied what i have to say to you is already quite clear in my mind he moved still nearer stood over the couch by her side then the outside bell rang he paused to listen her heart gave a little jump as a familiar voice asked for mr kessner it is mr lavendale she exclaimed under her breath dont let him find me here his features relaxed he laughed and patted her hand she could have said nothing to inspire him with more confidence of course not he replied indulgently dont be afraid george would tell him that i was engaged he had my orders to let no one in but i heard him say that he would wait she persisted anxiously cannot i hide somewhere for a moment while you see him and send him away george made a discreet appearance a gentleman inquiring for you sir he said he is waiting outside in the corridor i told him that you would be a long time mr kessner considered for a moment would you mind stepping into my sleeping apartment he asked suzanne she sprang up at once you will get rid of him quickly she begged he pressed her hand affectionately she endured his touch without flinching he handed her over to george and pointed to the door of his room give the young lady a chair inside he ordered i will see mr lavendale she was ushered into a bedroom and a moment or two later she heard lavendale announced then george returned handed her some american papers and disappeared into the bathroom beyond she rose to her feet as he closed the door the sound of lavendales voice was muffled and inaudible she glanced around the room it was tastefully but very plainly furnished there was nothing about on the mantelpiece or bureau likely to be of the slightest interest suddenly her heart gave a little jump george came out of the bathroom with a coat upon his arm threw open the bureau and searched there for something as he stood there a thin black silk pocketbook slipped from the breastpocket of the coat and fell unnoticed on to the carpet a moment later he closed the bureau laid the coat carefully out upon the bed and withdrew into the bathroom closing the door suzanne held her breath for a single moment then she stole across the floor seized the pocketbook opened the bedroom door stealthily and with a little gulp of relief passed out into the corridor she ran up the stairs to her own room gripping the pocketbook in her hand arrived there she locked the door took up the telephone and spoke to the hallporter please dont let mr lavendale go out she directed when he comes downstairs send him up to my roomsay that i wish to see him at once she slipped the pocketbook into the bosom of her dress and waited in a few minutes there was a ring at the bell lavendale stood outside come in at once she begged he hesitated but she dragged him in do not be foolish she exclaimed shut the door you have just left mr kessner yes he admitted why did you go there to see if you were getting yourself into any trouble he answered grimly you knew he nodded yes i knew she drew the pocketbook from the bosom of her gown listen she said i am terrified i picked this up from the bedroom it slipped out of the pocket of his dinnercoat i havent even dared to look inside he moved to the door and locked it came back and shook the contents out on to the table there was a great roll of notes some visiting cards some notes copied from a german timetable a long list of names and a single letter on thick cream paper suzanne stole to the door on tiptoe and stood there listening there was no sound in the corridor no sound in the apartment at all except a smothered exclamation or two from lavendale presently he called to her he was holding the papers in his hand miss de freyne he whispered listen she caught him by the sleeve there was a ponderous knocking at the door the shrill summons of the bell rang through the room lavendale hesitated for a moment then he slipped the book into his inside pocket and threw open the door mr kessners black servant was standing outside the master has sent his compliments he said and would be glad to know he glanced at suzanne it was obvious that lavendales presence in the room embarrassed him then he was suddenly pushed on one side and back into the corridor mr kessner himself came quietly in and closed the door behind him there was a queer little gleam in his eyes but his manner was unruffled he tried the handle of the door to be sure that it was closed then he turned towards suzanne will a million dollars he asked buy me back my pocketbook lavendale drew it from his pocket and promptly handed it across my dear mr kessner he remonstrated you are surely not serious miss de freyne was just explaining her little escapade to me and i was coming in search of you mr kessner took no notice of either of them for several moments he ran through the contents of the pocketbook then he slowly thrust it into his pocket i shall have the pleasure he said on friday night you will not forgetthe ritz at eight oclock charmed lavendale murmured delighted suzanne faltered he made a little bowan ugly awkward bowand left the room there was nothing in his manner to indicate what his sensations were lavendale and suzanne looked at one another was there anything very important there she asked he laughed nothing from your point of view but everything from mine he told her there was a list of fortytwo names of germanamericans each giving a million dollars towards a specific purpose there was a plan of a few remaining estates in a certain part of brazil still to be purchased to establish what at some seasonable juncture should be declared to be a german colony some slight trouble with the government of brazil a german gunboat and beholdgerman south america and to hell with the monroe doctrine a very admirable scheme only only what i dont fancy that thanks to you those estates will ever come into the market he remarked dryly not for a german purchaser at any rate she glanced uneasily towards the door mr lavendale she said earnestly i am terrified why i am afraid of mr kessner she confessed he took it much too quietly lavendale shrugged his shoulders a man of his temperament he said seldom wastes his time or his emotions he was playing for a great stake which he knows now that he will lose at the same time he has lost purely through accident she suddenly smiled i wonder she exclaimed whether he really expects us to dine with him at the ritz on friday night well go and see at any rate lavendale declared chapter vi the machinations of mr courlander lavendale glanced at his thin gold watch and replaced it in his waistcoat pocket three minutes past eight he remarked half a dozen pairs of gloves for me i think shall i go in and see about a table or would you rather dine somewhere else suzanne made a little grimace they were in the foyer of the ritz hotel and she was wearing a wonderful new gown it is most disappointing she declared i had made up my mind to conquest i am very impressionable lavendale assured her she shook her head petulantly it is not you whom i wish to subjugate i am too easy a victim i suppose lavendale sighed i am afraid that tonight however you will have to be content with me her face suddenly changed a brilliant smile parted her lips she glanced at him triumphantly lavendale looked over his shoulder mr kessner was crossing the lounge towards them with outstretched hand youve lost your gloves suzanne murmured under her breath mr kessner greeted his two guests in the most matteroffact fashion i must apologize for being a few moments late he said it is rather crowded here tonight and i thought it best to go and see that no mistake had been made about my table i should like if i may to introduce to you mr courlander a friend of mine from new york mr courlander is dining with us the two young people murmured something suitable mr courlander turned out to be a dark heavybrowed man cleanshaven and of a taciturn disposition the little party made their way in to dinner they were ushered to a small round table in the best quarter of the room a table lavishly arranged with flowers and flanked with a couple of icepails from which goldfoiled bottles were protruding suzanne gave a little sigh of content as she sank into her chair and looked around her appreciatively i have always observed she said softly that the men of your country mr kessner know so well how to entertain and also mr kessner remarked blinking slightly how to select their guests the service of dinner proceeded mr kessner in his dresssuit which seemed several sizes too large for him appeared somehow to have become a more insignificant person than ever in this ultrafashionable restaurant full of wellsetup men and soldiers in uniform he seemed almost like some byproduct something not altogether human his very insignificance compelled a certain amount of notice conferred upon him perhaps an air of distinctiveness if not of distinction he was kessner the multimillionaire probably over to secure contracts from the government the aroma of wealth hovered around his table the term germanamerican was unusedto few people there did it convey any significance the little party talked of every subject under the sun except the war mr courlander notwithstanding his heavy appearance was an excellent raconteur dinner was more than halfway through before their host changed his attitude you two young people did not by any chance expect me to break my appointment for this evening did you he asked we had a bet about it suzanne admitted tell me who wagered in my favour and i will tell you which is the cleverer of the two he offered suzanne laughed it was i who thought that you would come she declared he bowed after all he argued why not listen he went on leaning across the table courlander here does not count he is in my confidence he was indeed at one time my private secretary to the world i am an american to our young friend here he went on indicating lavendale who appears to have partly discarded his diplomatic career for an excursion into the secret service of his country i am a germanamerican he follows me to germany he knows that i have a conference with the kaiser he is all agog with the importance of it he comes back he consults with you my dear young lady and with marvellous subtlety he asks me to lunch and exposes me most unfairly to the trial of your charms i succumbwhat more natural he leaned back in his chair while a portly matres dhtel superintended the filling of their glasses with champagne and explained to him the mysteries of the course which was being served neither suzanne nor lavendale found it easy to continue their meal unmoved their eyes were fixed upon this insignificant little man who spoke with such deliberation such a queer little curl of the lips such obvious enjoyment of his own thoughts your deeplaid scheme he went on was crowned with complete success the poor little american was robbed of his secret by this time it is probably known in washington there is only one little fly in the ointment a private intimation has already been given through our ambassador in washington to the american government that unless america at once abandons her position of favouring the allies at the expense of germany and austria germany will refuse now and for always henceforth to respect and accept the monroe doctrine there was a moments breathless silence then lavendale drained his glass you mean that that pronouncement has already been made he murmured it has already been made mr kessner assented further you can understand quite easily i am sure that the exact locality in which this break should take place although interesting is not of vital importance i do not wish to dispirit you yours was without doubt an excellent stroke of work and i the poor victim am compelled to droop a diminished head yet i offer you this explanation so that you can see the reason why i am able to accept my defeat gracefully to welcome you both here as my guests to raise my glass to your beautiful eyes mademoiselle and to wish you mr lavendale the further success in your profession which such subtlety and finesse demand say hes eloquent tonight isnt he mr courlander remarked quite an epic little meeting this i can assure you all that i consider it an immense privilege to have been asked to join your little party this evening my subtle friend mr kessner continued setting his glass down empty is now wondering why you were asked to join it not at all lavendale replied the fame of mr courlander is well known to me their host for a single moment seemed disturbed he recovered himself however almost immediately mr courlander he went on as i have told you was once my secretary since then for a brief space of time he became a criminologist disgusted with the coarse tendencies of crime as practised in more modern cities he abandoned that profession to become what i might call a diplomatic detective he is the terror of our looseliving public men and our ambitious but dishonest politicians our friends career in america lavendale remarked dryly must of necessity be a strenuous one mr kessner for a moment smiled there was no effort of humour about the gesture it was simply a slow sideways parting of the lips an index of thoughts travelling backwards along a road lined with grotesque memories he drew a heavy gold pencil from his pocket and signed the bill then he rose to his feet we will take our coffee outside he suggested afterwards if it meets with your approval i have a box at one of the music hallsi am not sure which they lingered only a few minutes over their coffee while they sat there however mr kessners secretary a middleaged man with gold spectacles and abstracted manner brought in a note mr kessner opened it read it carefully and tore it into small pieces he rose a few minutes later joined his secretary who was waiting on the outskirts of the little group and walked with him twice down the entrance hall then he returned the car is waiting he announced if you are ready wont you my machiavellian young friend he added glancing at the scraps of paper which he had left upon the coffee table try and put those fragments together i promise that you would find them interestingmore intrigue and a very interesting one i can assure you lavendale found it hard to forgive himself later for the impulse which prompted his answer the temptation however was irresistible i have no need to put them together to know the source of your message he replied no mr kessner remarked politely as he lingered for a moment over adjusting suzannes coat there are a good many millions of people in london are there not shall i give you a hundred thousand to one against naming the writer in dollars if you like lavendale replied carelessly i wont take your money but ill start then with baron niko komashi mr kessner who had half turned away watching the result of his attentions to suzanne became suddenly motionless his lips were a little parted he seemed almost paralysed when he turned slowly around there was a new look in his eyes courlander on the other hand did not attempt to restrain an exclamation of wonder baron niko komashi kessner repeated who is he lavendale laughed easily he was already bitterly regretting his momentary lapse heaven knows he exclaimed the odds dazzled me they walked out to the car almost in silence a new spirit seemed to have come to kessner he looked and talked differently throughout the rest of the evenings entertainment he seemed somehow to have lost his air of half bantering confidence when the time came for farewells he looked long and earnestly into lavendales face we must know one another better young man was all he said on their way back to her rooms suzanne gripped lavendale by the arm and asked him a question what does it all mean she demanded why did you guess niko why were they both so thunderstruck because he replied niko happened to be the writer of that little epistle her large eyes gleamed at him through the semidarkness filled with wonder but how could you possibly know that he smiled it is your responsibility he explained i noticed the perfume directly he drew the note from the envelope she laughed softlysoftly at first and then heartily why it is most amusing she exclaimed he thinks you a necromancer he is i believe a little afraid of you and that other man all through the performance he scarcely took his eyes off you at any rate lavendale observed it has given me something to think about ii lavendale found his way to the american embassy early on the following morning and interviewed his friend mr washburn anything from washington he inquired i have only had a formal acknowledgment mr washburn replied except that they added a code word they dont often make use of and which i take to indicate a pat on the back for you is it true lavendale continued dragging a chair up to the side of mr washburns desk that berlin has given washington to understand that unless she changes her attitude toward the allies and withdraws her objection to submarine warfare she will no longer respect the monroe doctrine pourparlers to that effect mr washburn confessed have passed how did you come to hear of them lavendale smiled a little grimly yet with some selfsatisfaction i am getting on the track of something else which promises to be even more interesting he went on tell me how do we stand with japan just now mr washburn knitted his brows still frictionalways friction he admitted the whole thing is too ridiculous personally i consider our western states are very much to blame we have never before raised the cry america for the americans only and its too late to do it now and the fact of it is you see the western states simply decline to fall in with washington policy then the trouble comes any particular reason for asking i dont know yet lavendale replied theres a japanese fellow named komashi in my line of business seems to be very busy just lately i only caught on to it last night though chief well we are all overworked washburn replied we have had to send barclay over to berlin to get a personal report about the prisoners camps there then we get enough questions from germany ourselves about their prisoners here to swamp the place lavendale took up his hat ill see you later he promised he walked down the steps from spring gardens into st jamess park and sat for a time upon a seat exactly in front of him the upper floors of one of the big houses in carlton terrace had been turned into a hospital and he could see the soldiers lying about in long chairs a few of them entertaining guests behind him was the long row of huts built by the admiralty a troop of soldiers swung along the broad road a loudly playing band heralded the approach of a little company of recruits save for these things london seemed as usual from where he sat the hum and the roar of the great city came as insistently as ever to his ears his thoughts had travelled back to new york how long he wondered it was one of the chances of a lifetime which brought lavendale face to face that afternoon with baron niko komashi in a quiet street near st jamess square niko would have passed on without even a sign of recognition but lavendale stopped him good afternoon he said good afternoon the other replied gravely i should like a few minutes conversation with you lavendale proceeded niko was perplexed but acquiescent if it pleases he answered a little vaguely lavendale marched him along the street there is a little bridge club to which i belong close at hand he said come into the sittingroom there for a few moments we shall be quite alone at this hour of the afternoon niko suffered himself to be passively led in the direction which his companion indicated in a few moments they were seated in the comfortable parlour of a wellknown bridge club they were quite alone and lavendale closed the door well he asked how goes it with your new ally nikos face betrayed nothing but mild wonder lavendale smiled listen he said i may be making a mistake about you i do not think that i am i think that you represent for your country what i do for mine you are intensely patriotic so am i you realize the need for a certain amount of diplomatic insight into the workings of her constitution and her future so do i the only trouble is that you are for japan and i am for america niko assented very gravely his soft brown eyes were watching lavendales lips as though they would read upon them even the unuttered words his fingertips soft and pliant as velvet were pressed together you are not to be bought my friend lavendale went on neither am i when we walk together you hedge yourself around with restraint because you believe that i am one of those who could bear your country illwill that is where you are wrong that is where there is a cloud between us which ought to be driven away japan and america naturally industrially and geographically should be friends not enemies the causes of illfeeling which lie between us niko observed suavely are not of our making nor of oursnot of the true american lavendale answered promptly it is the desire of washington official washington that the sons of your country who come to us should be treated as our own sons what we have to contend with and you is local feeling the only sentiment that exists against japan in my country is that local feeling and the people who have shown themselves most virulently possessed of it are the compatriots of the man who only within the last few weeks has sought to pave the way for a disgraceful compact with your country nikos face was a little whiter his eyes were filled with wonder slowly he nodded his head you surprise me with your knowledge of things which i had imagined secret he said secret they have remained so far as i am concerned such information as you have gained can have come but from one source so i will speak thus far the sword of japan shall be drawn in defence of her honour and for no other cause the alliance which you suggest would be hateful and dishonouring to my country nor he concluded would japan at any time commence a war with a treasonable ally what answer have you made to kessner lavendale asked bluntly his companion gently raised his eyebrows who is that gentlemanmr kessner he inquired lavendale shrugged his shoulders ah i forgot he said those would not be your methods yet we know quite well that the person whose name i have mentioned has made overtures to you which could not under present circumstances emanate from berlin japan from the west and germany on the east might well embarrass a country so criminally unprepared for war as mine i take it however that that combination is not to be feared niko rose from his place he had a habit of ending a discussion exactly at the period he chose not in your time or mine he answered simply lavendale notwithstanding a nervous system almost unexampled was possessed of curiously sensitive instincts before he reached pall mall he was obsessed with an idea that he was being followed he turned rather abruptly around a tall broadshouldered man in dark clothes wearing a homburg hat and with a cigar in the corner of his mouth waved his stick in friendly greeting this is mr lavendale isnt it he remarked kind of forgotten me perhaps my names courlander met you with mr kessner the other night i remember you perfectly lavendale acknowledged very pleasant dinner we had mr courlander fell into step with his companion who had turned eastwards there are few things in the world that ludwig kessner doesnt understand he continued from the placing of a loan to the ordering of a dinner he isnt much use at eating it poor fellow but thats the fault of his digestion too much icewater i tell him lavendale nodded affably he had no objection whatever to discussing mr kessner kind of misunderstood over here the boss courlander went on people think because hes of german extraction that his sympathies are altogether that way as a matter of fact i can tell you mr lavendale that people are dead wrong at the present momenti wouldnt have every one know this but youre an american toomr kessner is making proposals for a very large purchase of british war loan is he indeed lavendale observed in a tone as colourless as he could make it courlander glanced at him curiously they were passing the carlton and he drew his arm through lavendales just one cocktail he suggested lavendale hesitated for a moment inspired by an instinctive dislike of his companion policy however intervened he accepted the invitation and followed courlander into the smokeroom they found two easychairs and the latter gave the order i was talking about the boss he went on there are others besides you who have misunderstood him some but theyll learn the truth before the wars over when is mr kessner returning to america lavendale asked as soon as he can find a safe steamer courlander replied he is a trifle nervous about the atlantic say that tastes good mr courlander leaned back and sipped his cocktail lavendale with a word of excuse rose to his feet and strolled across the room to speak to an acquaintance he returned in less than a minute mr courlander was leaning back in his chair american from tip to toe he wore a dark grey suit of some smooth material his squaretoed boots the little flag in his buttonhole his prim tie his air of genial confidence were all eloquently and convincingly typical of his nationality lavendale was followed by a waiter bearing two more glasses upon a tray try my sort he invited mr courlander glanced at lavendales glass which was still threequarters full you havent finished your first one yet he remarked a little too dry for me lavendale replied placing it upon the tray and taking the full glass heres luck the two men looked at one another in courlanders hard brown eyes a little narrowed by his drooping eyebrows there was an air of fierce though latent questioning then with an abrupt gesture he took the glass from the tray and drank off its contents youll forgive me if i hurry away lavendale went on we shall meet again i dare say before mr kessner leaves sure mr courlander murmured as he picked up his hat i am generally to be found round about the milan like to have you come and dine with me one night the two men parted at the hotel entrance lavendale got into a taxi and drove to his rooms as he changed his clothes he glanced through his correspondence there was a note from suzanne which he read over twice dear friend i want to see you at once i shall be in from seven till eight please call lavendale glanced at the clock hurried with his toilet and found himself ringing the bell at the entrance door of suzannes suite at halfpast seven she admitted him herself and ushered him into the little sittingroom which had been transformed almost into a bower of deep red roses mr kessner she exclaimed pointing around with a carte de visite you see what he saysfrom a forgiving enemy lavendale glanced at them with a frown upon his forehead id like to throw them out of the window he declared frankly do not be foolish she laughed listen you are dining somewhere at our own shop he replied they ask me about once in every two months to fill up i wanted to speak to you about that man courlander she went on well lawrence dowellthe american newspapers woman you knowwas in here yesterday and stayed to lunch we saw mr courlander in the distance and she told me about him do you know that he was convicted of murderthat it was only through mr kessners influence that he was taken out of singsing he was a policesergeant and his name was drayton they say that there were several cases against him of having men put out of the way who had made themselves obnoxious to tammany hall the sentence against him was quite clear yet mr kessner not only managed to have him released but made him his private secretary lavendale stood for a moment looking out of the window with his hands in his pockets then he turned slowly around about an hour ago he said this fellow courlander tried to doctor a cocktail i was drinking in the carlton smokingroom what she exclaimed i met him at the corner of st jamess street he went on i had been in the club with niko komashi and i am perfectly certain that he had been dogging me we walked along pall mall and he pressed me to go in and have a cocktail i happened to cross the room to speak to willoughby and on the way glanced into the mirror i saw courlanders hand suddenly flash over my glass it was so quick that even though i saw it myself i could scarcely believe it and im certain that no one else in the room could have noticed it when i got back i made some excuse and ordered another cocktail she seemed suddenly to lose some part of that serenity which as yet he had never seen even ruffled she was distinctly paler you must be carefulplease promise that you will be careful she begged this isnt new york he reminded her but that man is a perfect devil she persisted earnestly he is a professional murderer he has no feeling no mercy and he is so cunning and behind him there is kessner and all his millions lavendale shrugged his shoulders all the millions that were ever owned he said wouldnt help a man over here against the law i am not afraid of courlander there is nothing he could try which i am not prepared for and if it comes to a handtohand struggle i dont think i have anything to fear from him i dont like it she told him frankly you will be on your guard wont you his voice softened of course i will but miss de freynesuzannewhy dont you like it why do you worry about me at all she was silent for a moment she had turned a little towards the window her eyes had lost their usual directness he took a step forward it isnt because you care a little about me by any chance is it he asked she gave him her hand then she turned around and he saw that her eyes were soft with tears suzanne he faltered she turned towards him there was something very sweet about her little gesture something yielding and yet restraining wont you please forget all this for just a little time she pleaded to tell you the truth i feel almost like a traitress when i even let myself think of such things now that my country is in such agony when everything that is dear to me in life seems imperilled you have your work too and i have mine perhaps the end may be happy he raised her fingers to his lips and kissed them i will obey he promised turning towards the door and you will be carefulplease be careful she begged as she let him out and squeezed his arm for a moment there now you must go to your dinner you look very nice and i am sure you will sit next some one altogether charming and perhaps you will forget but i shall like to think of this evening practical hardheaded and with a sound hold upon the everyday episodes of life lavendale nevertheless passed through the remainder of that evening with his head in the clouds he was vaguely conscious of the other twentythree guests who shared with him the hospitality of the ambassadora few diplomats a professor from harvard university and his wife two other distinguished americans with a sprinkling of their english connections he sat next a distant relative of his own an american girl who had married an englishman and his abstraction was perhaps ministered to by the fact that conversation from him was entirely unlooked for in the reception rooms afterwards he found himself able to speak for a moment with washburn have you seen anything of mr kessner he asked the other made a little grimace very little he replied the chief and he dont exactly hit it off i heard a rumour the other day that he might be going back to germany lavendale played a couple of rubbers of bridge and was invited to take a cigar in the library before he left it was shortly after one oclock before he stepped into the taxicab which a servant had summoned for him sackville street lavendale directed he threw himself back in the corner of the vehicle and they glided off a drizzling rain was falling and the streets were almost empty he leaned forward in his place to light a cigarette that fact and his habits of observation probably saved his life he realized suddenly that this was no ordinary taxicab in which he was travelling it conformed to none of the usual types the cushions were more luxurious the appointments unusual he sat for a moment thinking the chauffeur was driving at a fair pace but he had taken a somewhat circuitous route lavendale tried the doors first on one side then on the other they were both fast secured with some sort of spring lock suddenly alert he rose softly to his feet crouched for a moment upon the back seat and thrust his head and shoulders through the window it was easy enough to wriggle out to descend and allow the vehicle to proceed to its destination wherever that might be without its passenger but the love of adventure was upon him he set his teeth sank back once more in his corner half closed his eyes to all appearance he might have been a tired dinerout prematurely asleep as a matter of fact every nerve and sense was keenly on the alert and his right fingers were locked around the butt of a small revolver without protest or comment he saw himself conducted by a roundabout way into a maze of quiet streets then with a little thrill of anticipation he saw a man who had been loitering near an entry turn and follow the vehicle which at his coming had slackened speed the man was wearing some sort of rubbersoled shoes and his footsteps upon the street were noiseless through his halfclosed eyes lavendale was nevertheless conscious of his approach realized his soft spring on to the footboard of the car was more than prepared for the sudden flick in his face of a sodden towel reeking with chloroform his right fist shot out the figure on the footboard went reeling back into the street even then prepared though he had been lavendale for a moment gasped for breath the car with a sudden grinding of the brakes came to a standstill they were at the top of a darklylit street and not a soul was in sight lavendale thrust his foot through the glass in front of him shattering it all around the driver the man half sprang to his feet but lavendales swift speech arrested him sit where you are he ordered never mind about that other fellow drive me to the milan hotel you know the way so do i if you go a yard out of it feel this he suddenly dug the muzzle of his revolver into the mans neck the man with an oath crouched forward do as i tell you lavendale thundered or ill shoot you where you sit remember youre not in new york do as i tell you once more the car glided off they turned almost immediately into piccadilly across leicester square passed up the strand and drew up at the milan lavendale put his head through the window as the porter came out from the court entrance i cant open this door he said ask the fellow in front how to do it the porter stared with surprise at the shattered glass the driver slipped down touched a spring on the outside and the door flew open he had pulled his cap deeper over his face lavendale looked at him for a moment steadfastly wait for me he ordered he walked into the court rang for the lift and ascended to the fourth floor he stepped out and rang the bell at number seventyfour for a moment there was no answer he rang it again then a light suddenly flashed up in the room and mr kessner fully dressed stood upon the threshold he gazed speechless at lavendale who pushed forward across the threshold holding the door open with one hand mr kessner he said your thug with the chloroform is lying on his back somewhere near sackville street i shouldnt wonder if his spine wasnt broken your sham chauffeur is downstairs with his sham taxicab i made him bring me here you understand the tip of mr kessners tongue had moistened his lips his lined yellow face seemed more than ever like the face of some noxious animal you are drunk young man he said lavendale raised his arm and mr kessner stepped back dont be afraid lavendale went on scornfully i am not going to shoot you when the day of reckoning comes between you and me if ever it does i shall take you by the throat and wring the life out of your body but i am here now to tell you this before i sleep a full account of this nights adventure instigated by you and your assassin courlander will be written down and deposited in a safe place if anything happens to me if i disappear even for a dozen hours that paper will be opened you may get me even now you and courlander between you only youll have to pay the price see in england its a damned ugly price mr kessner sucked the breath in between his teeth then as though with some superhuman effort he recovered himself say young fellow wont you come in and talk this out he invited lavendale laughed dryly wont you walk into my parlour he quoted mockingly no thank you mr kessner you know where we stand now let me give you a word of warning london isnt new york a very little of this sort of thing and youll find the hand of a law that cant be bought or bribed or evaded in any way tapping upon your shoulders you understand mr kessner yawned you are a foolish young man he said and youve been reading a little too much modern fiction he slammed the door and lavendale descended to the street the courtyard was empty the car didnt wait for me i suppose he inquired of the porter the fellow drove off directly you went upstairs sir i shouted after him but he took no notice shall i get you a taxi sir lavendale fumbled in his pocket found a cigarette and lit it thank you he replied i think ill walk chapter vii the indiscreet traveller lavendale walked slowly down the sunny side of pall mall it was early in august and for the first time he seemed to notice some reflection in the faces of the passersby of the burden under which the country was groaning the usual fashionable little throng about the entrance to the carlton was represented by a few sombrelydressed women and one or two wounded warriors the glances of the passersby towards the contents bill of the evening papers had in them a certain furtive eagerness the fear of evil news triumphing now over the sanguine optimism of earlier days it was just at that tragical epoch when russia to the amazement of the whole world was being swept back from her frontier cities when there were murmurs of an investment of petrograd lavendale in his light grey suit and straw hat sunburnt over six feet tall broad and athletic seemed somehow a strange figure as he passed along through streets which appeared destitute of a single man under middleage who was not in khaki the recruiting sergeant at the corner of trafalgar square where lavendale paused for a moment to cross the road caught his eye and smiled insinuatingly fine figure for a uniform sir he ventured i am an alien lavendale replied watching a troop of recruits pass by american sir thats so lavendale admitted the sergeant looked him up and down and sighed americas a country begging your pardon sir that dont seem to have much stomach for fighting he remarked as the young man passed on lavendale crossed the street with a slight frown upon his forehead he made his way to the war office and found captain merrill in his room alone the two men exchanged the greetings of intimate friends say reggie lavendale began you folks are getting kind of nervy arent you a recruiting sergeant in trafalgar square has just gently intimated to me that i belong to a country which has no stomach for fighting merrill grinned as he tossed his cigarette case over well he remarked you dont seem to be exactly spoiling for the fray do you lavendale lit a cigarette look here he said its all very well for you fellows to talk youve got the war fever in your blood youre in it deep yourselves and theres a sort of gloomy satisfaction in seeing every one else in the same box the chap who goes out to provoke a fight is worse of course but the one who springs up and reaches for his gun at the first chance of joining in is playing his game isnt he perhaps you are right merrill admitted im not telling you or any one else exactly what my opinion is about americas policy lavendale continued ill only remind you that even when those truculent forefathers of ours went out to fight they stopped to put on their armour is there anything fresh i dont know was the somewhat doubtful reply there is a queer sort of feeling of apprehension everywhere this morning the chiefs been round to see the prime minister and on to the admiralty theres a rumour that he went round to buckingham palace too looks as though there were something up you know all about it i suppose lavendale remarked quietly not a thing the young american knocked the ash from his cigarette the history of this war he went on will make mighty interesting reading but theres another history a history that will never be written the history of the unrecorded things gee that would make people gossip if they could get hold of only a few chapters of it you know theres something strange afoot reggie so do i though we sit here lying to one another i doubt whether the man in the street will ever know merrill selected another cigarette i dont see where you come in here ambrose neither do i the other agreed still the truth comes to light in strange ways sometimes last night i had a cable from a friend in petrograd advising me to buy all russian securities well if there is to be any change for the better in the valuations of russian stock lavendale continued slowly that is to say any immediate change it can only mean one thing merrill struggled hard to preserve his expression of polite vacuity there are very few people he murmured who really understand russia lavendale shrugged his shoulders it isnt exactly my show you know it ought to be merrill retorted curtly why just commonsense if we dont win in this war it will be your turn next japan and germany youll have to faceyou can take my word for thatand i hope youll like it if we lose our fleet its goodbye to american independence plain and simple words young fellow not so plain or so simple as they are true lavendale threw away his cigarette and stretched out his hand for his hat well he said i used to flatter myself that i was an outandout neutral but im beginning to fancy that my sympathies are leaning a little towards your side of the show anyhow ive no reason to keep secret the little i know about this affairin fact i came down here to tell you new york was talking openly last night of peace being proclaimed between germany and russia within a week weve tried her sorely merrill confessed doggedly but i dont believe it lavendale rose to his feet i tell you merrill he said if youd been about town as much as i have for the last twentyfour hours youd begin to wonder yourself whether something wasnt amiss these rumours and feelings of depression are one of the strangest features of the war but there it is at the present moment in the streets and the clubs and the restaurantswherever you turn ive noticed nothing like it since the beginning of the war the optimists are still cackling away but its there all the samea grim disheartening fear one man told me last night that he knew for a fact that russia was on the point of suing for peace merrill shook his head as he resumed his place at his desk its just a phase he declared look in and see me again ambrose when youre feeling a little more cheerful lavendale made a call in the strand and passed along that crowded illuminative thoroughfare towards the milan everywhere the faces of the passersby seemed indicative of some new apprehension he bought an early paper but there was no word in it of any change in the situation on any printed presentation of the rumours which were on every ones tongue the censor had set his foot lavendale called in at the bar at the milan for a few minutes the same feeling was there even more in evidence whats it all mean he asked an american pressman whom he knew slightly the newspaper man nodded sagely guess the cats out of the bag now he opined russia has asked for peace and she is going to have it on generous terms they say that negotiations are going on right here under the britishers very nose thingsll be pretty lively here soon lavendale took his place in the luncheonroom a few minutes later as usual he glanced expectantly towards the corner which suzanne de freyne frequently occupied there were no signs of her today however he gave his order and leaned back in his place then some fancy impelled him to glance towards the glass entrance doors on his left he sprang at once to his feet suzanne her face whiter than ever a queer furtive gleam in her dark eyes was looking eagerly into the room she saw him almost at the same moment and hurried in suzanne he exclaimed what luck you are going to lunch with me of course a matre dhtel was holding the vacant chair at his table with a little sigh she relapsed into it she was plainly dressed and had the appearance of having newly arrived from a journey i suppose i had better have something to eat she sighed order somethinganything she added brushing the carte away it was you i came to see he recognized at once the fact that she was in no humour for trivialities he gave a brief order to the waiters waved them away and leaned towards her you can command me he assured her my time is yours she drew a little sigh of relief for a moment her little white fingers rested upon his strong brown hand the tenseness passed from her manner it was as though she found something composing in his strength i have been travelling for fortyeight hours she said speaking under her breath and i had an escape a very narrow escape in belgium you do not want to understand everything do you nothing more than you choose he replied i am your man friday listen then your carit is in order perfect i came up from bath the day before yesterdaysixty miles on the level and never changed speeds how long would it take you to get me down to the east coast she asked eagerly what part she hesitated a small place called blakeney between sheringham and wells he figured it out let me see he saidtwo hours to newmarket two more to fakenham saving a little on both runs if we escaped a puncturesay four hours and a half suzanne and your car in the garage five minutes away in a taxicab she breathed another sigh of relief now i shall eat some luncheon she declared you will not mind if we commit ourselves to rather a wildgoose adventure i shall enjoy it immensely he assured her if one can use such a word at all these days he ordered some wine and watched the colour come back to her cheeks towards the end of the meal however she glanced often at the clock he read her thoughts signed his bill and stood up i am going upstairs to my room for a moment she said briskly will you have a taxicab waiting of course she was gone barely ten minutes when she came down she carried a small travelling case and wore a thick veil he hurried her into the taxi drove to the garage and in less than halfanhour london lay behind them and the car was gathering speed at every moment they passed through finchley and potters bar slowed up through st albans and settled down at racing speed northwards suzanne opened her eyes i am having a delicious rest she murmured where would you like some tea he inquired not yet push on as far as you can she begged what time shall we reach fakenham he glanced at the clock on the splashboard if you really like to run right through he said you shall be there by six oclock she patted the hand which gripped the steering wheel you dear person she exclaimed softly now i close my eyes again i think i will sleep a little until i reached my rooms at twelve oclock today i had not had my clothes off for two days this air and the rest are wonderful she settled back in her place and he touched the accelerator with his foot through stevenage and baldock across the great open spaces to royston at sixty miles an hour to newmarket up the hill along the norwich road then round to the left to brandon across the miles of heath with the stunted pine trees and miles of heather into the more luxurious pastoral country of eastern norfolk it was halfpast five when they crossed fakenham common and crept through the narrow streets of the oldfashioned town he turned to look at her she was still sleeping she woke however as the car slackened speed where are we she asked fakenham he told her with halfanhour to spare its just halfpast five you wonderful person she sighed shaking herself free from the rugs they drew up in the archway the hotel and made their way up the outside stairs into the oldfashioned coffeeroom she drank tea and toyed with her bread and butter absently she looked continually out of the window seawards it is a wonderful day she said thoughtfully there is no wind at all they might come even before the time he made her light a cigarette followed her example and in a few minutes they were again in the car halfanhour later they looked down upon the quaint oldworld village of blakeney set amidst the marshlands and beyond the open sea suzanne was all alertness now and sat up by his side gazing eagerly towards the line of white breakers suddenly with a warning hoot a long grey car which had come up noiselessly behind them swept past at a great speed suzanne gave a little exclamation it is the car i am sure she declared it has come to meet him all that i was told is true its some car all right lavendale remarked but i wouldnt have taken his dust as quietly as this if id heard him coming she laughed at him that car she said is bound on the same errand that we are it is on its way to blakeney to meet the same passenger well were in time anyway was his only comment they slackened speed as they turned into the long narrow street about halfway down the car in front of them was stopped by a soldier with drawn bayonet a noncommissioned officer by the side was talking to the driver close at hand a man in civilian clothes was lounging in front of what seemed to be the guardroom suzanne clutched her companions arm in excitement ambrose she exclaimed thats major elwellthe man in mufti i mean he is one of the chiefs of the english secret service i shall have to know a little more about this before i can catch on lavendale confessed he brought his car slowly up behind the other one the driver had raised his goggles and was seated in an impassive attitude whilst his license was being examined presently the little green book was returned to him and he moved slowly down the village street lavendales license was inspected in the same fashion after which they too followed down the village street which terminated abruptly in a small dock reached by an arm of the sea lavendale turned his car into the gateway of the inn and together a few moments later they strolled down to the harbour only a thin stream of water covered the bottom of the estuary scarcely enough to float a rowing boat and one or two sailing barques were lying high and dry upon the mud the stranger who had drawn up his car by the side of the wall was standing looking out seaward through a pair of fieldglasses lavendale gazed across the marshes in the same direction doubtfully say you dont expect any ship that could cross the north sea to come into dock here do you he asked she nodded quite a large ship could come up at high tide she explained but tonight they will not wait for the deep water they will anchor outside and sail up in a smaller boat come for a walk a little way that man is watching us they strolled along a sandy lane through a gate on the left opening on to the marshes it was a grey and sombre evening strangely still colourless alike on sea and land and sky a thin handful of cattle was stretched across the dykeriven plain a crowd of seagulls flapped their wings wearily overhead everywhere else an intense and almost mournful silence prevailed suzanne climbed to the top of one of the dykes and looked intently seaward you see she exclaimed pointing a small boat was anchored at the opening of the estuary beyond almost on the horizon was a thin line of smoke they will not wait for the tide she told him not the full tide that is they will come up as soon as that sailing boat can make the passage and who lavendale inquired will be the passenger her eyes flashed for a moment he will be the man she said solemnly who seeks to destroy france they wandered a little way further out into the marshland the air seemed to possess a peculiar saltinesseven in that slightly moving breeze they could feel the brackish taste upon their lips they watched the tidal way grow deeper every minute on either side of them the narrow dykes and curving waterways grew fuller and fuller with the tendrils of the sea about a mile from the distant coastline the steamer seemed to have come to an anchor and the whitesailed boat was fluttering about her suzanne took lavendales arm he could feel that she was trembling look here he begged tell me a little more of what is going to happen somebody will be landed from that steamer she said they will come up here get into the motorcar and start for london that some one will be empowered to put certain propositions before the russian ambassador here which he in his turn can convey to the tsar in code those propositions will be for a peace which will exclude my country and yours which will give russia temporarily defeated the terms of a conquering nation he laughed a little contemptuously you dont need to worry child he assured her russia isnt going to cave in yet awhile not in any ordinary fashion she replied but one lives in dread of some terrible disaster and then these terms they say are to be left over for a month think of the temptationall the fruits of victory offered in the very blackest moment of despair look she pointed to the mouth of the river the whitesailed boat was already commencing the passage of the estuary come she exclaimed we must get back they hurried across the marsh finding their way with more difficulty now owing to the inward sweep of the tide filling the narrow places with the soft swirl of saltwater when they reached the raised path by the side of the estuary the sailing boat was almost by their side a man was seated in the stern muffled up in an overcoat and wearing a tweed cap there he is she murmured lavendale glanced at the man in a puzzled fashion just at that moment the latter turned his head he was dark cleanshaven and slightly built something rather familiar about him lavendale muttered you dont know his name she shook her head wait she begged they reached the dock just as the boat was drawing up to the quayside get out the car please suzanne directed and drive slowly up the street just past the guardroom wait there as though we had been stopped again lavendale obeyed this time as they drew up major elwell leaned over the front of the car he is here i understand miss de freyne he said softly are you going to stay there may be a little trouble she laughed derisively this is mr lavendale she whispered he will take care of me major elwell the latter looked keenly at lavendale and nodded its a queer piece of business this he observed maybe our information is all wrong after all the other car came gliding up the village street and was brought to a standstill only a foot behind them the driver addressed the sergeant almost angrily i showed you my license a few minutes ago he protested whats that other car doing ahead blocking up the way lavendale drew slightly on one side a soldier with fixed bayonet slipped into the little space between the two cars major elwell turned towards the passenger sorry to trouble you sir he said but i must ask you to step inside the guardroom for a moment what do you want with me was the quick reply youve landed from a steamer here rather an exceptional thing to do anyway major elwell explained there are just a few questions we should like to ask im an american citizen the other declared i have my passport here i can land where i choose in ordinary times without a doubt the major replied smoothly just now i am sorry to be troublesome but there are some new enactments which have to be considered we shall have to ask you to give up anything you may have in the way of correspondence for instance to be censored there was a moments silence the face of the man in the car had suddenly become tense lavendale who had been looking around gave a little start why its johnson he exclaimedleonard johnson you remember me dont youlavendale the man in the car nodded eagerly of course he assented look here if youve any pull in these parts i wish youd persuade this officious gentleman to let me go on quickly im in a hurry to reach london im afraid i cant lavendale regretted im hung up myself for some piffling reason where have you come from holland was the brief reply if you are really in a hurry sir major elwell intervened politely you are only wasting time by this discussion with your friend before you proceed you will have to come into the guardroom with me im damned if i do mr johnson replied if you lay hands on me ill report the whole affair at the embassy directly i arrive in london im well enough known there and theyll tell you that i am in the american embassy at berlin lavendale shook his head gently not at the present moment i think johnson he remarked ill answer for it though that you are a reputable american citizen my instructions are entirely independent of your nationality major elwell said firmly i must trouble you to descend at once there was scarcely a whisper scarcely even a glance between the two men in the hindmost car action seemed to be entirely spontaneous their car which had moved perhaps a foot or so back while they were talking as though the brakes had failed to hold was suddenly swung to the right the front wing caught the soldier who was standing on guard and the car plunging forward with one wheel upon the pavement threw him off his balance he reeled back against the wall and almost before they could realize what had happened the car was tearing up the hill the sergeant snatched a rifle from one of the men but major elwell stretched out his hand we dont want that he exclaimed telephone at once to all the places en route to london car number lc can you make any sort of speed mr lavendale jump in was the grim reply youll soon see they dashed up the hill travelling almost at the same speed as the other car as they passed the church they saw it a speck in the distance climbing the next hill lavendale slipped in his fourth speed thank god for the dust he muttered we shall see which way they go hold on suzanne well have to take risks the air rushed past them the finger of the spedometer crept up from thirty to fifty and sixty miles an hour they swung round the corner and through a tiny village a cloud of dust rising behind heedless of the curses shouted after them by the irate foot passengers hes gone to the right lavendale announced thats letheringsett hell leave the london road though if he can hell try to give you the slip major elwell remarked and take the train from somewhere lavendale smiled the finger in front of them was still creeping upwards they missed a hay wagon by a few inches the pillar of dust in front of them grew nearer well shepherd him into fakenham lavendale muttered i could catch him now if i wanted theyll have had the message there though they skirted letheringsett up the hill round corner after corner through thursford with barely a hundred yards dividing them once at some crossroads the car in front seemed to hesitate and they shot up to within fifty yards the light now was becoming bad there were little patches of shadow where the trees overhung the road theyre giving it up lavendale exclaimed by jove weve got them he pointed forward the road running into fakenham narrowed a line of three soldiers stood across the thoroughfare with a grinding of brakes and ponderous swaying of the foremost car the chase was over mr leonard johnson descended shaking the dust from his coat following me he asked lavendale sarcastically major elwells hand fell upon his shoulder were not meaning to lose sight of you again just yet sir he said you know what risk you run in interfering with an american citizen the other demanded perfectly major elwell replied you dont thats certain or you wouldnt attempt it johnson snapped however we cant talk in the street ill get into your car and go on to the inn with you they drove on to the crown inn mounted the outside staircase lavendale in front and major elwell bringing up the rear the coffeeroom was empty they rang for refreshments and dismissed the waiter johnson threw back his overcoat now lets have this out he began truculently addressing major elwell who the mischief are you and what do you mean by following me like this i am censor for the neighbourhood in which you landed from holland mr johnson was the quiet reply your present position is entirely the result of your own injudicious behaviour what exactly do you want johnson demanded after your attempts to escape major elwell announced i shall be compelled to search you johnson drew a revolver from his pocket his manner remained bellicose look here he said if youre looking for trouble you can have it i dont recognize the right of anybody to interfere with my movements major elwell strolled slowly across the room to where johnson was standing looking all the time down the muzzle of the outstretched revolver one moment mr johnson he said do you mind glancing out of this window no you can keep your weaponive no designs on that just look down into the street johnson did as he was bidden half a dozen soldiers were lined up outside the entrance then out of the door if you please the major further suggested he held it open at the bottom of the stairs a sentry was standing with drawn bayonet johnson stared at him for a moment then he turned abruptly away look here he said hoarsely this censor business dont go with me youre lying perhaps so major elwell admitted smoothly and so are you you mentioned i think that you had been in the american embassy at berlin you omitted to mention however that you have since joined the german secret service as that fact is wellknown to us you can understand i dare say why we regard this landing of yours upon a lonely part of the coast with someshall i say suspicion johnson stood very still for a moment he seemed to be thinking deeply this censorship of yours is a bluff i suppose he muttered amongst many other positions major elwell admitted i also hold a somewhat important place in the english secret service you have i trust one of the first qualifications for useful service in your professionyou are able to recognize the inevitable you are face to face with it now there was a brief silence johnson was standing at the window with his hands behind him presently he turned around very well he pronounced curtly youve got me fairly enough go ahead you see major elwell explained you might under the present laws be treated as an ordinary indiscreet travelleror as a spy better hand over everything you are carrying johnson opened his coat pocket and threw a few letters and a pocketbook upon the table major elwell glanced them through and sighed then he turned towards suzanne if you would give us a couple of minutes please he begged lavendale led her out into the yard in a few minutes the door behind them was thrown open the major was standing at the top of the steps wheres the car he shoutedthe car they came in lavendale looked down the yard and dashed into the street wheres the other car he asked one of the soldiers on guard no instructions to detain it sir the man replied the chauffeur drove it to the garage to fill up with petrol they ran across the street in a little procession the man in charge of the place stared at them a little dazed car came in about ten minutes agoa great delauneybelleville he informed them she filled up and started off for london major elwell turned towards lavendale and laughed hardly that fellows first job he muttered and hes done us in the documents he was carrying are in that car major elwell spent the next hour in the telegraph office whilst lavendale and suzanne raced southwards more than once they had news of the car of which they were in pursuit at brandon it was only twenty minutes ahead and at newmarket they learnt that the driver had called at the station found there was no train for an hour and continued his journey from newmarket through sixmilebottom and onwards they touched seventy miles an hour and even suzanne shivered a little in her seat at the royston turn the sparks flew upwards through the grey light as lavendales brakes bit their way home two ways to london here he muttered wait he took a little electric torch from his pocket and stooped down in the road in less than a dozen seconds he was back in the driving seat by royston he whispered i fancy somehow we are gaining on him they tore onwards along the narrow but lonelier road once on a distant hillside far in front they caught the flash of a light lavendale gave a little whoop of triumph we shall get him he cried fiercely weve twenty miles of road like this to royston the excitement of the chase began to tell on both of them suzanne sitting close to the side of the car leaned a little forward her eyes bright her hair windtossed her cheeks flushed breathless all the time with the lashing of their speedmade wind lavendale sat like a figure of wood leaning a little over his wheel his hands rigid his whole frame tense with the strain once more they saw the light this time a little nearer then they skidded crossing an unexpected railway track took a few seconds to right themselves and the light shot ahead they passed through royston and shot up the hill scarcely slackening speed it was a little before moonlight now and the heath stretching away on their left seemed like some silent and frozen sea on which the mists rested lightly suddenly a little cry broke from lavendales lips his foot crushed down upon the brakes in front of them by the side of the road was the other car disabled its left wheel missing the driving seat empty they came to a standstill within a few feet of it and lavendale leapt lightly out lying with his head upon the grass was the driver lavendale bent rapidly over him the front wheel must have shot off and pitched him forward he explained to suzanne im afraid he is hurt youd better go and sit in the car then the woman he had seen nothing of blazed out from the girl by his side do not be foolish she cried fiercely he is alive is he not quick search him lavendale for a moment was staggered he was feeling for the mans heart what is the life or death of such as he she continued almost savagely search him i say lavendale obeyed her a little dazed there was a license a newspaper of that mornings date a few garage receipts for petrol a handkerchief a penknife and a large cigarette casenot another thing she pushed him on one side while she felt his body carefully the man opened his eyes groaning my leg he muttered lavendale stood up i think thats all thats the matter with him he pronouncedfracture of the leg wed better take him back to the hospital leave him alone she ordered come here with me at once lavendale obeyed mutely she sprang up into the dismantled car and began feeling the cushions look in the pockets she directed lavendale turned them inside out there were maps a contour book an automobile handbook more garage receipts an odd glovenothing of interest suddenly suzanne gave a little cry she bent closer over the driving cushion pulled at a little hidden tab opened it there reposed a letter in a thick white envelope the letter of their quest lavendale flashed his electric torch upon it it was addressed in plain characters to his excellency he thrust it into his pocket look here he insisted weve found what we want we must see about that man now they lifted him into their car and drove him back to the hospital lavendale left money called at the policestation and gave information about the accident then they ran up to the hotel and stood side by side for a moment in the dimlylit stuffy coffeeroom he drew the letter from his pocket well he asked she glanced at the sealhuge and resplendent it is only the first part of our task that is done she sighed yet everything is ready for the second that letter will be delivered it is the answer we want she took the letter and placed it in the small bag she was carrying some sandwiches please she begged and then london twentyfour hours later they sat in her little sittingroom suzanne was restless and kept glancing at the clock lighting cigarettes and throwing them away often she glanced at lavendale imperturbable a little troubled why do you frown she demanded i dont know he answered simply this business has its dark side you know i was thinking of it from your point of view you are going to open a friends letterthats what it comes to youre on fire to see whether your friend whom you should trust is as honourable as you think him it leaves an unpleasant flavour you know she came to a standstill before him my friend she said you have something yet to learn in our profession it is thishonour and joy conduct itself idealism all those things that make up the mesh of life lose their significance to the man or woman who works for his country as i have done as you have commenced to do i am for france alone and for frances sake i have no character for frances sake i have sent a dummy messenger to the prince for frances sake i shall open the reply it may tell me everything it may tell me nothing but one must be warned there was a ring at the bell a young man entered closing the door behind him suzanne almost sprang towards him you have the answer she cried the messenger bowed suzanne was suddenly calm she tore open the long thick envelope with trembling fingers she peered inside for a moment doubtfully then her whole face relaxed her eyes flashed with joy she held the envelope up over the table a little stream of torn pieces of paper fell from it her eyes were moist as she watched them it is the offer of our enemy she cried and the answer of our ally some scraps of paper chapter viii the undeniable force lavendale drew a deep sigh of content as he withdrew his eyes reluctantly from the glittering phantasmagoria of the city stretching away below like a firespangled carpet he leaned back in his chair and raised his glass to his lips no doubt about my being an american born moreton he observed the first night in new york is always a real homecoming to me and this is new york isnt it he went on musingly city of steel and iron typical indescribable jim moreton an erstwhile college friend and now a prosperous lawyer nodded sympathetically we are right in the heart of things here he assented nothing like a roof garden round about broadway to see us at home i wonder whether you noticed any change he went on they tell us that we get more european every year in our love of pleasure and luxury lavendale glanced around at the many little groups dining on the twentyeighth storey of a famous hotel under the light of the big yellow moon the table illuminations and the row of electric lights which ran along the parapet seemed strangely insignificant everywhere was a loud murmur of conversation punctuated by much feminine laughter the incessant popping of corks the music of the not too insistent band i tell you jimmy he confided leaning forward towards his friend to look into the faces of these people is the greatest relief i have known for twelve months just at first when war broke out one didnt notice much change in england especially but latterly there has been no mistaking it wherever you went in the streets or the restaurants you could see the writing in the faces of the people a sort of dumb repression of feeling just as though they were trying to get through the task of everyday life because they had to eating and drinking because they had to talking amusing themselves even with an absent feverishness all the timeunnatural i tell you its like being in some sort of a dream to be in london or paris today its only tonight ive felt myself back amongst real men and women again and its good moreton nodded understandingly a fellow was writing something of the sort in one of the sunday papers last week he remarked over here of course the whole thing to us is simply pictorial we dont realize or appreciate what is happening we cant and yet some day lavendale sighed we shall have to go through it ourselves one of your harvard theories cropping up again its more than a theory nowits a certainty lavendale insisted one doesnt need to brood though theres plenty of real life buzzing around us all the time do you know why i sent you that wireless jim not an idea on earth the other admitted i guess i was conceited enough to hope that you wanted to see me again thats so anyway lavendale assured him and you know it but apart from that i want you to do something for me i want to meet your uncle ill do what i can moreton promised a little dubiously he isnt the easiest person to get at as you know where is he now lavendale inquired i havent had a line from him or my aunt for months moreton replied but the papers say he is coming to new york tonight is there anything in these sensational reports about his new discovery lavendale asked eagerly i shouldnt be surprised the other confessed there is no doubt that he is giving up his laboratories and closing down in the country he told me himself last time i saw him that the thing hed been working at off and on for the last thirty years was in his hands at last perfect hes through with inventingthats how he put it to me he is going to spend the rest of his days reading dime novels in the mornings and visiting cinemas in the afternoonssays his brains tired i shouldnt wonder at that lavendale observed he was seventytwo last year wasnt he i wonder how long hell keep his word though he seems in earnest he has been very cranky lately and they were all terrified down at lakeside that hed blow the whole place up you dont know any particulars about this last invention i suppose if i did moreton declared with a little laugh i could have had my weight in dollars from the newspaper men alone no i know nothing whatever about it all i can promise is that ill take you up to riverside drive and do my best to boost you in now tell me what youve been doing with yourself this year ambrose youve left the diplomatic service havent you not altogether i have a sort of unofficial position at the embassy perhaps as important as my last one only not quite so prominent still as great a scaremonger as ever do you remember those discussions you used to start at the debating society i remember them all right lavendale assented grimly and since you ask me the question let me tell you this jim ive lived as you know during the last seven years in the diplomatic atmosphere of paris of london and berlin i tell you soberly that anything i felt and believed in those days i feel and believe twice as strongly today just look over your left shoulder jimmy isnt that rather a queerlooking couple for a fashionable roofgarden moreton turned a little lazily around an elderly man and woman who had just entered were being shown to an adjacent table the man was apparently of some seventy years of age his morning clothes were of oldfashioned cut and he wore only a little wisp of black tie his grey beard was cut in the fashion of a century ago his bushy hair was long and unkempt his companion who seemed but a few years younger wore the simplest of dark travelling clothes some jet jewellery a huge cameo brooch fastened a shawl at her throat and she carried a leather handbag dont they look as though theyd come out of the ark lavendale murmured moreton had risen slowly to his feet queer thing that you should spot them ambrose he remarked this is what you might call something of a coincidence you dont mean to say that you know them jim moreton nodded my uncle ned and my aunt bessie he said i must go and speak to them he crossed towards the elderly couple shook hands with the man who greeted him cordially enough and submitted to an embrace from the lady lavendale could hear every now and then scraps of their conversation towards its close his friend turned and beckoned to him lavendale who had been eagerly awaiting a summons rose at once and approached the trio aunt moreton explained laying his hand upon his friends shoulder this is mr ambrose lavendale a graduate of my year at harvard uncle lavendale has just returned from europe and he was talking to me about you he is like the rest of us tremendously interested in what all the world is saying about you and your latest discovery lavendale shook hands with the elderly couple who greeted him kindly discovery eh mr moreton observed jocularly that does seem rather an inadequate word lavendale admitted i think one of your own newspapers here declared that you had learnt how to bottle up the lightnings to oh those damned papers mr moreton exclaimed irritably dont talk to me about them young fellow i would much rather talk to you about what they are aiming at lavendale said simply are you going to give any demonstration siri mean of course to the scientific world the inventor glanced up at his questioner with a little twinkle in his hard blue eyes say youve some nerve young fellow he declared amiably however i am very fond of my nephew here and if youre a friend of jims you shall be one of a very select company tomorrow morning the scientific world can wait but i am going to set the minds of the newspaper people at rest i am going to show them what i can do i was thinking of asking you any way jim he went on and you can bring your friend with you twelve oclock at riverside drive the two young men were both profuse in their thanks mr moreton waved them away there will be just three or four newspaper men he continuedi put the names of the principal papers into a bottle and drew lots the reporters who came down to jersey state agreed to thatyou two your aunt and a young lady you can go and finish your dinner now boys your aunt and i jim are going on to a cinema afterwards were going to make a real night of it the two young men shook hands and made their adieux as soon as they had resumed their places lavendale leaned across the table towards his friend with glowing face jimmy youre a brick he declared well have another bottle on the strength of this the very night i arrive too whoever heard of such luck i dont suppose i should ever have got within a hundred yards of him but for you hes a shy old bird moreton admitted we certainly were in luck tonight though i wonder who the girl is whos going to be there lavendale remarked idly his eyes had suddenly strayed once more over the brilliant yet uneasy panorama of flashing lights huge buildings the throbbing and clanging of cars across the distant line of the river to the blue spaces beyond the leader of the little orchestra behind was playing a familiar waltz suzanne and he had danced it together one night in london he was for a moment oblivious of the whole gamut of his surroundings the world closed in upon him he heard her voice felt the touch of her fingers saw a gleam of the tenderness which sometimes flashed out from beneath the suffering of her eyes his friend glanced at him in wonder it was the insistent voice of a waiter which brought him back from his reverie french or turkish coffee sir lavendale made a heedless choice and climbed down to the present way back somewhere werent you jim moreton remarked his friend nodded i have left behind a great deal that one remembers at a few minutes before twelve on the following morning lavendale and his friend were conducted by a coloured butler across a very magnificent entrance hall of black and white marble strewn with wonderful rugs through several suites of reception rooms and out on to a broad stone piazza at the back of mr moretons mansion in riverside drive it was here that lavendale received one of the surprises of his life mr and mrs moreton were reclining in low wicker chairs and between them a miracle of daintiness in her white linen costume and plain black hat wassuzanne lavendale forget his manners forgot the tremendous interest of his visit forgot everything else in the world he stood quite still for a moment then he strode forward with outstretched hands and a very visible gladness in his face suzanne he exclaimed why how wonderful she laughed at him gaily as she accepted his greeting there was some response to his joy shining out of her eyes but it was obvious that his presence was less of a surprise to her you did not know that i was here she asked but why not men and women have travelled many times round the world before now to learn its secrets lavendale recovered a little of his selfpossession he shook hands with mrs moreton who was beaming placidly upon them mutely approving of this unexpected romance the great inventor turned him round by the shoulder and indicated four men of varying ages who formed the rest of the little company i will not introduce you by name he said but these four gentlemen selected by lot as i think i told you last night represent the mightiest and holiest power on earththe great nevertobedenied press of america they are here because since the first rumour stole from my laboratory down in jersey state that i had reached the end of my labours i have been the victim of an incessant and turbulent siege carried on relentlessly day by dayi might almost say hour by hour for good reasons i desired to keep my discovery to myself a little longer but i know that i am beaten and these gentlemen or rather the power which they represent have been too many for me my country household has been honeycombed with spies my medical man my gardener the assistants in my laboratory have every one of them been made the objects of subtle and repeated attempts at bribery young mr lavendale let me tell you thisthe press of america today is the one undeniable force look at themmy conquerors i am going to present them today with my secretnot willingly mind but because if i do not yield they will continue to eat with me to sleep with me and to walk with me to plague my days and curse my nights this young lady he continued in an altered tone came to me with a personal letter from my cousin our ambassador in paris you mr lavendale are here as my nephews friend now if you are ready i will proceed with the demonstration the four men had risen to their feet one of them a wellsetup handsome young fellow shook hands with lavendale i was a year before you at harvard wasnt i he remarked we think that mr moreton is just a little hard upon us we represent to use his own words the undeniable force and to do it we have to forget that we are human and persist this may be very annoying to mr moreton but as a rule it is the world that benefits the inventor who had disappeared for a moment in the interior of the room which led out on to the piazza suddenly stood upon the threshold his face seemed to have become graver during the last few moments and he motioned them impatiently back to their places then with a reel of what seemed to be fine wire in his hand he made his way to the further end of the broad balcony which completely encircled the house and carefully stretched a length of the wire from the edge of the building to the stone balustrade as soon as he had accomplished this he drew from his pockets what appeared to be a pair of black gloves of some spongy material and a tiny instrument about the size of a ladys watch which none of them could see he drew on the gloves with great care placed the instrument between the palms of his hands and turned to his nephew just ring the bell there will you jimmy he directed the young man obeyed the little group now were all standing up their eyes fixed upon that strip of thin wire mr moreton slowly drew his palms together several times pausing once to glance at the small instrument which lay concealed between them footsteps were heard approaching around the side of the house and a coloured servant in livery carrying a tray in his hand appeared he had no sooner set his foot upon the wire than he stopped short gave a wild jump into the air came down again jumped again and slowly with the salver still in his hand began to dance touch the bell the inventor ordered in a voice which seemed tense with suppressed emotion his nephew obeyed at once and again there were footsteps another servant carrying a chair came round the corner paused for a moment as though in amazement on perceiving the antics of his predecessor stepped on to the wire leapt into the air and commenced to perform almost similar gyrations mr moretons breath was coming fast and he seemed to be the victim of some peculiar emotion this time he only glanced towards the bell which his nephew pushed again there were footsteps a third servant with a box of cigars appeared gave a little exclamation at the extraordinary sight before him stepped forward on to the wire leapt up till his head almost touched the sloping portico and commenced throwing the cigars into the air and catching them mr moreton glanced from the three performers towards his little audience the expression on their faces was absolutely indescribable meanwhile the dancing of the three men in livery became more rapid the man with the salver and glasses began throwing them into the air and catching them again the servant on the outside was now occupied in balancing a cigar on the tip of his nose while his neighbour on the right was twirling the wicker chair which he had been carrying on the point of his forefinger mr moreton stretched out his hand towards the spellbound stupefied little company the hamlin trio gentlemen of jugglers and dancers imported from the winter gardens at great expense for your entertainment good morning with one bound he was through the window they heard the bolt slipped into its place from behind the glass he turned and waved his hand to the newspaper men then he disappeared spoofed my god the journalist who had spoken to lavendale exclaimed for a single moment they all looked at one another the trio of entertainers were redoubling now their efforts there was a roar of laughter the jokes on us one of the other newspaper men admitted candidly but what a story wed better get along and write it you fellows he added before they have it up against us is there any chance a third man inquired of mr moreton talking to us reasonably his wife beamed placidly upon them not one chance in this life she assured them if you knew the language poor dear ned has used about you gentlemen of the press worrying him down at lakeside during the last few months youd only wonder that he has let you off so lightly then perhaps lavendales acquaintance suggested wed better be getting along the hamlin trio at the other end of the piazza suddenly ceased their labours made a collective bow and disappeared the newspaper men still lingered looking longingly at the bolted window mrs moreton shook her head just leave him alone for a little time she begged he has got a down on you newspaper gentlemen and the way they worried him down at new jersey has pretty well driven him crazy dont try him any more this morning if you please she persisted its my belief this little joke hes played on you kept him out of the hospital the silveryhaired old lady with her earnest eyes and the little quaver in her tone triumphed the little company reluctantly dispersed lavendale and suzanne were on the point of following the others when a head was thrust cautiously out of a window on the second storey of the house has the press of the united states departed mr moreton inquired theyve all gone dear his wife called out soothingly then bring the others in to luncheon mr moreton invited ill bring them in right away mrs moreton promised say thats a good sign young people she added turning to them cheerfully he has hated the sight of company lately but i did feel real uncomfortable at sending you away without any offer of hospitality he has locked this window fast enough she added trying it but come right along with me and ill show you another way in they followed her along the piazza lavendale and suzanne fell a little way behind it was their first opportunity how long have you been here he asked eagerly what did you come for why didnt you let me know i have been in new york four days she told him i was on the city of paris we passed you near queenstown as for the rest i suppose i am here for the same reason that you are monsieur senn the great electrician has been working on the same lines as moreton for years and he persuaded me to get a letter from the american ambassador in paris and come out here i do not suppose though that it is any use they say that mr moreton is like youamerican inventions for the american people ive wobbled once or twice he reminded her of course theres always a chance she murmured say that you are glad to see me he begged she gave his hand a little squeeze then mrs moreton turned round with a motherly smile if youll take your cocktail in the smokingroom with jimmy mr lavendale she said ill look after miss de freyne luncheon was a meal of unexpected simplicity served by a couple of trim waitingmaids in a magnificent apartment which overlooked the hudson mr moreton was in high goodhumour over his latest exploit and they all indulged in speculations as to the nature of the stories which would appear in the evening editions underneath his hilarity however lavendale more than once fancied that he noted signs of an immense tension sometimes in the middle of a conversation the great inventor would break off as though he had lost the thread of what he had been saying and look uneasily almost supplicatingly around him until some one supplied him with the context of his speech towards the end of the meal after a brief silence he turned with curious abruptness towards lavendale say youve come a long way to see nothing young man he remarked i have had the pleasure of meeting you sir lavendale replied politely and after all i never believed the things they were saying in london what were they saying mr moreton demanded brusquely there was a report there when i left lavendale answered that you had learnt at last the secret of handling electricity by wireless handling it i mean in destructive fashion oh they said that did they mr moreton observed smiling to himself to be absolutely exact lavendale went on they said that you had professed to discover it a great scientific man whom i met only a few days before i left england howeversir hubert bowdenassured me that mine would be a wasted journey because the thing was impossible a suddenly changed man sat in mr moretons place the unhealthy pallor of his skin was disfigured by dark red almost purple patches his eyes were like glittering beads he struck the table fiercely with his hairy fist bowden is an ass he exclaimed he is an ignorant numskull a dabbler a blind follower in other mens footsteps impossible to memoreton my dear my dear his wife murmured anxiously from the other end of the table the inventor turned to one of the servants telephone to the garage for the car to be here in ten minutes he ordered i have had my little joke he went on as the girl left the room this afternoon well get to business his fury seemed to pass away as suddenly as it had come he ate and drank nervously but with apparent appetite as soon as the meal was over he commenced smoking a black cigar and excusing himself rather abruptly left the room do you suppose lavendale asked his hostess that he is really going to give us a demonstration i dont know she answered uneasily i wish i could get him somewhere right away from every one who talks about inventions and electricity you put his back up you know mr lavendale he was quite all right before you handed him that sort of challenge i am sorry lavendale murmured mendaciously in a few minutes they received an urgent summons they found mr moreton waiting in a large open car below he had quite recovered his temper his face indeed shone with the benign expression of a child on its way to a treat miss de freyne and mr lavendale you can sit by my side he ordered jimmy you get up in front the man knows where to go they swung round and in a few minutes turned into central park at a spot where the road curved rather abruptly the car came to a standstill mr moreton stepped out from his pocket he drew a small skein of what seemed to be white silk and a tiny instrument with a dial face and perforated with several holes hold that he directed lavendale the latter obeyed mr moreton drew the thread of white silk backwards and forwards through one of the apertures in the instrument the finger on the dial face mounting all the time from zero when it reached a certain figure he drew it out and stooping down stretched it across the path from the hedge to the curbstone then he glanced up and down and around the corner the park was almost deserted and there were only a few loungers in sight from the small bag which he had brought with him in the car mr moreton next produced a square black box with a handle in the side and a pair of black indiarubber gloves which he hastily donned then with the box in his hand he turned the handle which protruded from its side a queer buzzing little sound came from the interior a sound which low though it was thrilled lavendale from its utter and mysterious novelty it was a sound such as he had never imagined a sound like the grumblings of belittled and imprisoned thunder the finger on the dial moved slowly when it had reached a certain point mr moreton paused he clasped the machine tightly in his hands the mutterings still continued and from a tiny opening underneath came little flashes of blue fire the inventor stepped into the car motioning the others to follow him and gave an order to the driver they backed to a spot by the side of the road about a hundred yards away from where the thread of white silk lay stretched across the pavement mr moreton gripped the instrument in his rubberclad hand and leaned back in the car his eyes fixed upon the corner his expression had become calmer almost seraphic we shall see now he promised them smiling another land of dance there is only one thing i should like to point out the little instrument i hold in my hand now is adjusted to any distance up to two hundred yards by turning the handle a dozen more times the distance could be increased to a mile and more in proportion the length of my silkcovered wire is immaterial it could stretch if desired from here to broadway now watch they all sat with their eyes fastened upon the corner of the pathway a slight uneasiness which lavendale in particular had felt was almost banished by a thrilling sense of expectancy suddenly a portly figure appeared a policeman whom they had passed soon after entering the park he approached with his hands behind him walking in ruminating fashion suddenly as his foot touched the thread he came to a halt there was something unnatural in his momentarily statuesque attitude then before their eyes he seemed to stiffen fell like a log on his right side with his head in the roadway his helmet rolled a few feet away the man remained motionless lavendale sprang to his feet but mr moreton pushed him back that is of no consequence he said softly wait for a moment lavendale even then would have obeyed his instinct and jumped from the car but his limbs seemed powerless a man and a girl arm in arm appeared round the corner suzanne stood up a strange hysterical impulse seized her and she tried to shout her voice sounded like the feeblest whimper the two lovers as their feet touched the thread seemed suddenly to break off in their conversation it was as though the words themselves were arrested upon their lips as though all feeling and movement had become paralyzed then they too stiffened and fell in the same direction a parkkeeper who had seen the collapse of the policeman came running across the road shouting all the time and an automobile which had been crawling along increased its speed and raced to the spot mr moreton touched a button in the instrument which he was holding the thunder died away and the blue flashes ceased suzanne leaned back in the car her cheeks were as pale as death lavendale bent over her its all right suzanne he assured her sit here while i go down there is nothing wrong with those people really its just another of mr moretons little jokes nevertheless when lavendales feet touched the ground he gave a little cry for the earth seemed quaking around him mr moreton who was walking by his side patted him on the shoulder steady my boy steady he said you see the whole of the earth between here and that little thread of white silk is heavily charged you feel dont you as though the ground were rising up and were going to hit you in the chin ive grown used to it there goes poor jimmy dear me he hasnt the nerve of a chicken young moreton fell over in a dead faint lavendale set his teeth and staggered on a little crowd was already gathering around the three prostrate bodies as they drew near you see mr moreton explained reassuringly i have broken the connection now nothing more will happen what of those threethe policeman the man and the girl lavendale faltered mr moreton patted him on the back they had reached now the outskirts of the little group theirs he said gravely was the real dance you have been fortunate young man your journey from europe has been worth while after all you have seen the hamlin trio in their jugglers dance and you have seen here in the sunshine under the green trees with all the dramatic environment possible the greatest dance of allthe dance of death lavendale felt the blood once more flowing freely in his veins he turned almost fiercely upon his companion as he pushed his way through the gathering crowd you dont mean that they are really dead he cried even your wonderful friend bowden mr moreton assured him sweetly could never wake a single beat in their hearts again an ambulance had just glided up a man who seemed to be a doctor rose to his feet shaking the dust from his knees these three people are dead he pronounced sombrely the symptoms are inexplicable he suddenly recognized moreton who held out his hand genially towards him dr praxton is it not he remarked it is very fortunate that i should have so reliable a witness upon the spot i shall be obliged doctor if you will take the bodies of these fortunate people into your keeping and prepare a careful examination of their condition do you know anything about their death the doctor asked the great inventor smiled in a superior fashion why my dear fellow yes he assented i killed them you see that little skein of what seems to be white silk if a million people had trodden upon it one after the other or if i in my car had been twenty miles away with my instrument properly regulated there would still be a million dead lying here i am moretonned moreton the inventor you know doctor i can strip the universe of life if i choose i should have liked he added glancing a little peevishly over his shoulder the young lady to have seen this i shall make a point of her coming on to the hospital the doctor glanced meaningly at the two or three policemen who had forced their way to the front they led mr moreton back to the car and a few minutes later he was driven off seated between them smoking a cigar the picture of amiability suzanne and lavendale found a taxicab and left the park by another exit she sat close to him clinging to his arm suzanne he whispered can you be a woman now for the sake of the great things she sat up by his side her face was marble white but some latent force seemed to have asserted itself she answered him steadily go on ambrose she begged i can listen do not be afraid i have told this man he continued to drive to the docks the marabic is sailing at five oclock she looked at him for a moment as though she failed to understand his arm tightened around her i have the instruments and a skein of the thread in my pocket he whispered a sudden light flashed in her eyes she leaned over and kissed him firmly and deliberately upon the lips you are a man ambrose she declared do not be afraid we are allies is it not so in this yes he promised her two hours later as they moved slowly down the river the tugs shrieking in front of them and siren whistles blowing on every side they examined for the first time in the security of lavendales stateroom their new treasuresthe black cameralike instrument the smaller one with its dial face and a little skein of the white silkcovered wire they both gazed at them almost in stupefactionharmlesslooking objects silent dead things only think she whispered clutching his arm we have but to learn their secret and we can end the war lavendale hid them away and silently they stole up on deck they heard the engines quicken their beat saw the great buildings of the city fade into an evening mist they saw the lights shoot out from the statue of liberty and felt the ocean breeze on their cheeks they turned their faces eastwards the apprehension of great things kept them silent they faced the unknown chapter ix an interrupted revue madame flanie sat before the gailydecorated mirror which swung upon her dressing table contemplating the result of her maids careful and strenuous attentions her dressingroom during the many months of her great success had become transformed into a little bower of luxury and comfort a telephone stood at her elbow amongst a chaos of tortoiseshellbacked toilet articles there was a soft green carpet upon the floor a wonderful divan in the most comfortable corner a few trifles of empire furniture an etching or so upon the wall madame flanie was a clever woman and she understood the art of environment her costume now for the second act of the brilliant revue in which her success had been almost phenomenal was practically completed she wore still a rosecoloured dressinggown over garments not remarkable for their prodigality and though the evening papers a french novel a little volume of poetry sent from the author and a box of russian cigarettes stood at her elbow she still continued to gaze a little abstractedly at the reflection of her own features in the lookingglass london had found her beautiful seductive vivacious she was all of these her dark and beautifullyset eyes restrained their gleam of natural violet notwithstanding the encompassment of stage makeup no rouge could conceal the pearly brilliancy of her complexion no cake of powder the charming lines of her mouth it was not at these things however that she looked her eyes were fixed steadily upon the roots of her blueblack hair drawn back from her forehead in a manner peculiar to herself she even raised the tiny magnifying glass on the table before her to concentrate her regard and there was in her face almost at that moment a shadow as though some faint foreboding was hovering over her even in these halcyon days of her great triumph she laid the magnifying glass down it is impossible she murmured to herself stretching out her hand for a cigarette there was a knock at the door her maid came softly inan elderly woman in prim black softlyshod and with the art of moving noiselessly she carried a card in her hand which she presented to her mistress madame she announced this gentleman desires the favour of a word with you flanie stretched out her hand you know so well marie she complained that i receive here only those who need send no card give him my address if it is a gentleman from the press i thought madame would prefer to see this gentleman the maid said quietly still with a queer reluctance flanie took the card into her white fingers before she glanced at it she knew very well what name she would find written there and she hated the knowledge the black letters stared up at her mr ambrose lavendale sackville street flanie turned her head slowly and looked upwards at her maid the womans face however was blank the gentleman is doubtless known to mr wiltshaw the latter continued he secured the entre here without difficulty he waits now in the passage you can show him in her mistress ordered there were a few seconds during which another woman looked into that gailyhung mirror and another reflection appeared there the mouth was no longer seductive but grim the eyes were no longer insolent half challenging conquest half promising tenderness but seemed indeed to have receded a little to be filled with the shrinking light of fear the transition was extraordinary and complete here sat a terrified woman face to face with some evil thing then there came a knock at the door as with the touch of her fingers upon the switch the gloom of the room was changed into brilliant light so flanie almost miraculously recovered herself she swung round in her dainty revolving chair her lips even fell naturally and easily into the lines of her most seductive smile what fear there was at the womans heart showed itself no longer in her face monsieur lavendalemonsieur ambrose lavendale is it not she added with a momentary glance at the card you wish to see me lavendale came a little further into the room and bowed at a glance from her mistress the maid softly withdrew closing the door in his severely simple evening clothes lavendale seemed in that little room to be taller even than his six feet two flanie who had risen to her feet felt herself suddenly dominated madame lavendale said i have ventured to present myself in order to renew a very delightful acquaintance she played the game bravely but monsieur she protested i have not the pleasure of knowing you he sighed it is alas then your memory madame which is at fault or yours she queried softly he shook his head those who have had the privilege of knowing the lady who calls herself now madame flanie could make no mistake yet it seems she persisted acknowledging his courtesy with a smile that that is what has happened you are gallant monsieur but there are so many of us upon the stage who resemble one another he shook his head with a selfconfidence which she hated there is no man in this world he declared who could fail to recognize adle goetz even under the guise of madame flanie may i congratulate you upon your great success your revue they tell me will run for ever you are very kind she said her knees beginning to tremble a little but indeed you are mistaken my name is elaine flanie it is my own name i came from the odon i am so wellknown in paris this lady of whom you speak perhaps resembled me lavendale did not for a moment reply his face had become a shade graver his grey eyes held hers is there then a reason madame he asked why adle goetz preferred to disappear and madame flanie to rise from her ashes am i not one of those who could be trusted my memories of mademoiselle adle are too delightful for me to bear anything but goodwill towards madame flanie she stood for a moment quite still her brain was working quickly after all the man was an american she looked at him a little doubtfully he smiledand she yielded she gave him both her hands monsieur ambrose she said it can go on no longer i thought myself an actress but you have conquered you are my friend your devoted friend he assured her you can imagine then why here in england it is elaine flanie alone who exists adle goetz if i remember rightly he replied was of german birth she glanced almost nervously around her he went on without pause so far as that simple fact is concerned he continued you will notyou need have no fear of my discretion she gave him her hands again and this time there was more of invitation in her gesture you were always kind to me she murmured we shall see something of one another now is it not so he shook his head alas no madame he sighed i am engaged to be married and mademoiselle is jealous she inquired with a little pout there is no woman in the world he told her who would not be jealous of madame flanie she laughed at him with something of her old gaiety threw herself back in her chair and passed him the cigarettes we have a few minutes longer at least she pleaded before we make our pathetic farewells you have not lost the gift of saying pleasant things ambrose nor you adle the art of inspiring them he replied oh l l she exclaimed lightly tell me of your life here in london tell me why you came to renew our acquaintance if it is to be only a matter of this one visit he had refused her offer of a chair and the cigarette still unlit was between his fingers yes i will tell you that he said you read without a doubt of the sinking of the marabic she shrugged her shoulders who has talked of anything else in london these few days i was amongst the saved he continued i and the young lady to whom i am engaged to be married we were in the last boat that left the ship and lost everything except the clothes we stood up in that circumstance has to a certain extent changed my outlook upon this struggle there was the slightest of frowns upon her velvet brow she waited he had the air of one however who has concluded all he has to say he turned towards the door she stopped him with an imperative gesture you have not given me the promise i desirei demand she cried monsieur ambrose you will not leave me like this that promise he said gravely is yoursconditionally his departure was a little abrupt and her gesture to recall him too late she sat for a moment thinking a curious shadow upon her face then she touched the bell ask monsieur anders to spare me a moment she directed her maid there was a brief interval then the sound of a cheerful whistling outside the door was opened and monsieur anders himself appeared he was a small man with a strangelylined face a mouth whose humour triumphed even over his plastic makeup he was attired with great magnificence in the costume of a beau of the last century his fingers glittered with rings lace cuffs fell over his wrists and a little waft of peculiar perfume entered with him it was not for nothing that for many years he had been considered upon the french stage the embodiment of a certain type of elegance you have had a visitor chrie he remarked i have she replied shut the door he obeyed at once from outside came the voice of the stage carpenter the occasional rumbling of scenery the music of the orchestra the murmur now and then of applause the curtain was up upon a fresh scene in the revue mysterious anders murmured suddenly even as the word passed his lips apprehension seemed to seize him he remained for a moment dumb and motionless then he too glanced around before he leaned towards her it is trouble perhaps not she answered one cannot tell a young american has been to see me he is one of the few who would remember we were friends in paris nine years ago he was a boy then but notwithstanding everything he recognized me an american anders muttered better that than an englishman well he was serving his apprenticeship in the american diplomatic service in those days she went on what he is doing now i do not know except that he and the girl whom he is engaged to marry were amongst survivors from the marabic he went out of his way to pay me a visit here just to tell me that he recognized me and he made it plain that although he is not an englishman he is in sympathy with them did he threaten anders asked quickly no she replied and yet he terrified me he promised silenceconditionally conditionally how he left that for me to understand i am still puzzled he does not want to see me any morehe took pains to tell me that he was engaged to be married yet underneath his manner i seemed to discover a threat anders stood perfectly still for a moment underneath all the paint and makeup of his face he was suddenly haggard is it worth it henri she faltered why not america at once and safety we could get a great engagement there he stood biting his nails agitated there is this last affair to be carried through he reminded her and the moneythink of it how can one live without money our salaries she murmured pooh what man with my tastes could live on any salary is it worth while to trifle with life and death she asked him bluntly it is a warning this henri the callboys voice was suddenly heard monsieur anders monsieur anders the frenchman turned mechanically towards the door you have destroyed my nerve he muttered you have perhaps ruined my performance afterwards we will see it was french night at luigis restaurant a gala night even in those strenuous war days every table in the place was taken and others had been wheeled in the waiters made their way about with difficulty bohemia and the sycophantic scions of fashion sat arm in arm the grimmer duties of patriotism were for a moment forgotten its other claims met with ample recognition flanie sang the marseillaise twice amidst a scene of wild applause a great french actress from the legitimate stage had recited a patriotic ode the flags on the tables had been sold for absurd sums by a sympathetic duke who should clearly have been an auctioneer a hundred messages of sympathy of love of faith were sent across the wineglasses to the country whom it was designed to honour back in their corner lavendale and suzanne looked on curiously once lavendale drank a little toast with his companion this he murmured is to our fuller alliance she drank with him although she seemed a little puzzled listen dear he went on there is just one little thing id like to say to you tonight you and i have helped one another at times but there has always been a certain reserve i told you months ago that i was for america above all things and america only today i feel differently i have been a witnessyou and i togetherof foul and brutal murder i have seen women drowned have heard their shrieks america may keep the peace with germany it may be in the interests of the highest diplomacy that she should as for me i am at war with germany i am your ally her fingers rested upon his then there is some good she whispered which has come out of that great and abominable evil a very small good he said but it may count tell me do you know who that fair almost sandy young man is sitting at the table with flanie and her friends of course she answered that is lenwade the great flying man she dropped her voice suddenly the young man had risen from his chair and in the act of passing down the room to speak to some acquaintances paused before their table he bowed to suzanne and held out his hand to lavendale they were old acquaintances and spoke for some time on indifferent subjects what have you been doing with yourself lately lavendale inquired not much flying the other confessed i have been down giving lessons and breaking in a lot of the youngsters but i cant stick it myself as i used to plays the devil with your nerves rubbish lavendale laughed you havent a nerve in your body havent i the other replied i remember the time when i could say that id give anything to be at the front now if i felt equal to it or if my doctor would let me lavendale smiled and glanced around to be sure that his neighbours were not listening what were you doing at ypres the week before last then he asked dropping his voice a little lenwade for a moment was silent then he shrugged his shoulders you must have mistaken me for some one else he declared goodnight he took his leave a little abruptly lavendale watched him disappear then he glanced towards his companion his face had become graver let me put a case to you my fellow conspirator he begged i will put one to you instead she replied i know for a fact that philip lenwade has been in france for two months flying every day engaged upon some special task he denies it to usquite properly perhapsbut should he come to places like this should he drink champagne so that he is compelled to hold the table while he stands it is true that all the world knows of his infatuation for flanie she is safe perhapsa frenchwoman and a patriotyet there is something about it which i do not like she and lenwade have been whispering together half the evening and more than once i have seen lenwade shake his head and push her away supposing flanie he whispered were not a frenchwoman at all suzanne said nothing she waited watching her companion with wideopen eyes lavendale looked down upon the tablecloth from you he continued simply i have no secrets nine years ago i knew flanie in paris she went then by the name of adle goetz she was a german go on i watched her from the box tonight at first i was oppressed as i have been before by some vague sense of familiarity in her gestures suddenlyi think it was the way she shrugged her shoulders one higher than the otheranyhow something brought it all back to me that was why i left you suzanne i went to her room her flaxen hair has become blueblack she has altered in many ways but i discovered that i was right she is a german posing as a frenchwoman in london today suzanne exclaimed why does she run this risk that is what i have asked myself he whispered that and another questionwhat is her interest in lenwade hush we are talking too earnestly that fellow andersthey say he is really her husbandwatches us here comes luigi talk to him for a moment the manager paused at their table and received their compliments on the success of the evening when he passed on flanie had risen as though to go and lenwade was arranging her cloak around her shoulders anders was still talking to some other members of the company and friends seated at the great round table in front of the orchestra flanie and lenwade were halfway down the room before the others began to follow lavendale rose quickly to his feet listen he said i am going upstairs and shall come down again just far enough in case i can hear anything you go through alone and wait for me on the divan tell me if those two go away together and if so what is their destination they separated at once a few minutes later lavendale descended from the balcony and stood just out of sight upon the stairs which led into the entrance hall the little place was full of the hubbub of cheerful laughter on one side however flanie and lenwade were talking earnestly flanie had turned suddenly round to anders who had just arrived mr lenwade is going to drive me home she announced au revoir all you good people there was much handshaking vive la france madame a young englishman exclaimed fervently as he bent over flanies fingers and may you too live for ever if one would paint france madame a painter murmured i would choose you for the emblematic figure there were more compliments another little burst of patriotic fervour some one even struck up a few bars of the marseillaise as flanie and her escort disappeared lavendale descended the last few stairs and elbowed his way goodhumouredly through the group he took suzanne by the arm well he whispered as he led her towards the doorway i am not sure she answered under her breath but i think they went to his roomsnumber half moon street lavendales car was a few minutes delayed he gave the man the address almost in a whisper behind pushing his way out on to the pavement was anders he watched lavendale drive off with a slightly disturbed air what are you going to do suzanne asked make a fool of myself very likely lavendale replied i am just working out a theory thats all she is going back to his rooms anders remains behind content and all the world knows that anders whether he is her husband or not is in love with her and furiously jealous you see there must be a reason for her little expedition she is hoping to fetch something where are we going to his rooms lavendale explained oh dont look startled dear i shall have a very good explanation to offer to lenwade even if i break in upon the most ordinary amour they were in half moon street within a few minutes just as lavendales car slackened speed flanie issued from the door of number and looking neither to the right nor to the left sprang into a waiting taxicab and drove off lavendale leaped out on to the pavement follow her suzanne he directed i hope to god shes going straight home if not you must find out where she does go ill come in a taxi i must see lenwade first he whispered a direction to the chauffeur passed through the door of number rang for an automatic lift and ascended to the second storey leaning over the banisters as the lift stopped was lenwade he gazed at his visitor in amazement what the mischief are you doing here old fellow he asked thickly whom are you looking for lavendale retorted madame flanie the other confessed she has gone down to fetch her vanity case from the cab cant think why she doesnt come back lavendale pushed him suddenly back into his room and closed the door you idiot he thundered she isnt coming back now pull yourself together do you hear listen to me youre half drunk but i am going to tell you something that ought to sober you that woman flanie is a born german and a spy what have you given her even through the bluster of his stormy denial lenwade was obviously shaken what bally rot he exclaimed shes a frenchwoman to her fingertips they all love her didnt you hear her singmarseillaise frenchwoman to her finger shut up lavendale interrupted fiercely i tell you i knew her nine years ago under another name she is a german and its my belief shes a spy she and anders what have they worked on you out with it man lenwade swayed on his feet he looked back across his shoulder to a rolltop writing desk which stood open then he snatched up a tumbler from the table by his side filled it with sodawater and drank it off lavendale youre not in earnest in gods own earnest man quick if you want to repair the mischief youve done tell me what you gave her ive lent her my plans lenwade faltered ive been two months making them up above the clouds im the only real draughtsman amongst those who can keep high enoughplans of the german fortifications and the railways behind from the coast beyond where our lines touch the french i say lavendale there was no lavendale he sprang down the stairs three at a time out into the street and at a double into piccadilly where he sprang into a passing taxicab milan look sharp he ordered the man drove swiftly through the halfempty streets with a little gasp of relief lavendale recognized his own car waiting in the courtyard without a pause however he pushed open the swing doors of the court and leaned over the counter towards the night porter what is madame flanies number he asked sixtyfour sir the man replied glancing dubiously at lavendale monsieur anders is up there now however lavendale stepped into the lift ascended to the third floor hurried down the dimlylit corridor and paused outside the door of number sixtyfour he listened for a moment inside he could hear voices then he pressed the bell there was a moments hesitation then anders voice speaking in french lenwade perhaps he heard flanies scornful little laugh the flutter of her garments as she crossed the room the door was suddenly opened and she stood there looking out at him she gazed at this unexpected visitor and the colour slowly faded from her cheeks and the light from her eyes lavendale made his way firmly across the threshold and closed the door flanie caught at her throat what do you want here sir anders demanded lavendale pushed them both back into the sittingroom there was an ugly look in the mans face but flanies courage seemed to have deserted her she clutched at the air for a moment and sank into an easychair hiding her face amongst the cushions lavendales hand fell firmly upon the loose sheets of paper strewn over the table these are what i have come for he announced collecting them and thrusting them into his pocket i presume you have had no time to make a copy he glanced searchingly around the apartment it was obvious that nothing of the sort had been attempted anders stole slowly back towards the writingtable his hand was upon the knob of one of the drawers but lavendale suddenly gripped him by the coat collar and swung him almost off his feet listen he said coldly i know nothing of you anders except that it is my belief that you are one of the vermin of the war a spy selling his own country the woman there was once my friend for that reason if you leave england on saturday for america this matter is finished if either of you remain in london or make any attempt to cross to holland france or any other country between now and then something very ugly will happen you understand anders courage had failed him pitifully flanie on the contrary had recovered herself i have been a fool perhaps she confessed you were just one of the few chances against me very well we go to america on saturday but our contract anders faltered the revue elaines success they have doubled our salaries london is at her feet after saturday lavendale reminded him calmly the best that can happen to you anders is a bandaged forehead and twelve bullets in the courtyard of the tower i will not offend your taste by suggesting flanie stamped her foot and turned her shoulder contemptuously upon anders it is finished monsieur lavendale she pronounced if there were any bribe in the world i could offer you it was her one rather fainthearted effort and he laughed at the seduction in her eyes you will be watched from this moment until the steamer leaves liverpool he concluded leaving the room and closing the door behind him in the hall he met lenwade waiting for the lift incoherent still but sober lavendale drew him out into the courtyard where suzanne was still seated in the car lenwade he announced i have your plans they are safe with me i shall keep them until tomorrow morning you can come to me at sackville street at ten oclock until then they will be safe thank god the other murmured how did you manage it lavendale shook him off a little contemptuously and took his place by suzannes side they leave on saturday for liverpool he told her i hand the care of them from now until then over to your branch she pressed his hand and drew a little closer to him my dear ally she murmured chapter x the sentence of the court lavendale was closeted with a personage and the interview to which he found himself committed came as something of a shock to him the personage was not in the habit of wasting his words and he spoke succinctly and to the point to sum up mr lavendale he concluded we have received direct and categorical complaints concerning you forwarded to us through the german ambassador in washington it is stated that whilst enjoying the shelter and privileges of your association with the embassy here you have rendered direct aid to a branch of the french secret service in this country and that you were yourself responsible for the interception of an important communication from berlin thats leonard johnson lavendale muttered the case of leonard johnson has i believe been cited the personage admitted but your association with a certain member of the french secret service has led you i am informed into further enterprises not entirely in accordance with your position as an american official am i to understand that you wish me to resign sir lavendale asked nothing the personage replied cheerfully is further from my intentions i wish you to reform remember you are an american thats all now go and pay us a visit on the other side i am coming in to do a little handshaking myself presently lavendale put behind him what he felt might be one of the crises of his life and made his way to the ambassadorial reception rooms he paid his respects to his chiefs wife and family and talked for a while to one of the junior secretaries a cleanshaven man tall and slim with gold spectacles and smooth hair came up to them presently with a smile i hope you havent quite forgotten me mr lavendale he said im anthony silburn four years before your time but weve met once or twice in new york of course lavendale assented as a matter of fact we are connections arent we you married my cousin lydia green they sat in a corner and talked for some time of common acquaintances mr anthony silburn besides having the advantage of a frank and engaging manner and a distinct sense of humour was as lavendale very well knew one of the wealthiest and most enlightened of american millionaires i tell you what it is young fellow mr silburn declared as they parted youll have to come down and spend a weekend with us any time you like ive got a real old country house in norfolkleased it before the war broke outhookam court near wells bring your guns down well im off now to catch the five oclock train home he departed with a little farewell nod lavendale looked after him thoughtfully one of the most successful men in america somebody by his side remarked i wonder what he thinks about the war he was educated in germanyi am not sure that he wasnt born there lavendale made his adieux a little later and walked thoughtfully towards the milan court he sent his name up but there was no reply from suzannes rooms miss de freyne went out on monday night the hallporter told him she was motoring i think but she had very little luggage she hasnt been back since weve had a great many telephone messages for her the circumstance was not in itself unusual but lavendale was conscious of a queer little feeling of uneasiness suzanne never left town without letting him know and she had been engaged to dine with him that night i think ill go up and speak to her maid he said the man pointed towards the lift there she is sir just come in lavendale crossed the hall and touched the woman on the shoulder she was a darkvisaged melancholylooking person of middle age with an extraordinary gift for taciturnity do you know where your mistress is anne he asked the woman appeared to recognize him with some relief she evaded a direct reply however would you be so kind as to come upstairs sir she invited lavendale followed her to suzannes suite she stood on one side for him to enter and closed the door carefully monsieur she began my mistress once told me that if there was trouble i was to come to you quite right lavendale assented quickly what is it mademoiselle left me at six oclock on monday night the maid proceeded i know nothing as to her destination except that her journey was decided upon quite suddenly and that she had a motor ride of over a hundred miles she expected to be back the next day if not she promised to send me some instructions since then i have heard nothing of her lavendale reflected for a moment how much are you in your mistress confidence he inquired she has trusted me often with her life was the quiet reply you understand her real position but naturally then do you know lavendale went on if there is any headquarters of the french secret service in this countryany one from whom we could get any idea as to her mission the woman shook her head there are others working often with mademoiselle she said i know no namesonly this in case of the very deepest anxiety but only in extremes i have a telephone number here which i could ring up she opened her purse and drew out a slip of paper it is i believe a private number she continued and not in the book i made up my mind that if mademoiselle had not returned this afternoon i would ring up let us do so at once lavendale suggested if monsieur would be so kind she begged pointing to the instrument my english is not good and i do not know with whom i should speak whom am i to ask for lavendale inquired no names are to be mentioned the woman replied and the number can only be rung up between five and seven it is six oclock now she added lavendale took off the receiver and asked for the number there was a moments pause then a remarkably clear voice answered him well it is a friend of mademoiselle de freyne who speaks lavendale said that is well the voice replied continue miss de freyne left her rooms at the milan court last monday night on secret business she promised to communicate with her maid the next day she has not done so she left in a motorcar and with very little luggage she made the remark that she had a ride of over a hundred miles that is all you know mr lavendale lavendale started a little at the sound of his own name it is all he assented kindly go and repeat what you have told me to major elwell room number whitehall lavendale replaced the receiver and turned to anne i am instructed he said to apply to a man whom i know to be in the english secret service it would be well the maid advised if monsieur applied there at once lavendale walked briskly out of the milan by the back exit through the gardens along the embankment and into whitehall he found number a long narrow private house taken over by the government number consisted of a small office in which two men were busy writing and an inner room lavendale made his inquiry and was told that major elwell would be back in an hour he scribbled a note making an appointment and walked back to his own rooms he let himself in paused to speak for a moment with his servant who was laying out his clothes and turned towards the sittingroom as he opened the door the telephone bell began to ring insistently he crossed the room took up the receiver and tapped the instrument what is it he asked hullo hullo somewhere in the distance he heard a voice say faintlytrunk calland for a moment he was patient then he gave a little start a familiar voice yet unfamiliar shaking with something like fear tremulous hysterical terrified murmured his name his heart leapt with quick sympathy his fingers shook ambrose ambrose is that you speak quickly i am here suzanne he cried where are you suddenly he seemed to hear turmoil and confusion a mans voice a womans shriek at hook then there was silence the connection had been broken lavendale rang up furiously at last he got the exchange the young man who answered his inquiry could tell him nothing he rang through to the inquiry office with little better result they would make inquiries and let him know from whence the call came they believed that it was from a call office he could gain no further information he set down the instrument at last in despair and walked up and down the room she was in trouble danger hook hook what was there familiar to him in the commencement of that word he repeated it feverishly then he rememberedhookam courtanthony silburn whom he had met that afternoon at the embassy it was hard to discover any connection however he drove back to the milan court and found anne is there any news monsieur she asked anxiously none at present lavendale replied i cannot see major elwell for another halfhour tell me have you ever heard your mistress mention any place of which the first syllable is hook ook anne repeated dubiously no monsieur hookam court lavendale went on anthony silburnnorfolknone of that is familiar but no monsieur he kept the secret of the telephone message to himself and made his way round once more to whitehall major elwell was seated in his office and received him at once there was nothing unusual about the place except a large array of telephones lavendale told his story quickly the major listened without comment well lavendale asked eagerly when he had finished major elwell was occupied in drawing small diagrams with his pencil on the edge of the blottingpaper we must see what can be done he remarked at last hookthat is absolutely all you heard absolutely lavendale assured him and you have a friend who lives at hookam court in norfolkmr anthony silburn he said meditatively a very remarkable man silburnlikely to be president some day they tell me who cares about that lavendale exclaimed a little curtly what can we do major elwell i dare say you know as much as i do and more miss de freyne has been very successful during the last few months and there is no doubt theyd give anything they could to get hold of her on the other side but in englandsurely there cant be any organization over here strong enough for actual mischief scarcely major elwell agreed scarcely hdouble ok he went on meditatively you see there are about fifty places in the united kingdom beginning like that lavendale felt his courage slipping away there was something curiously unimpressive in the carefullydressed imperturbable englishman who was occupied now in polishing his eyeglass isnt there anything we can be doing instead of sitting here talking he asked impatiently always a mistake major elwell declared to do things in a hurry have a cigarette he went on offering his case i think ill stroll out and talk with a friend over this little matter isnt there a thing i can do lavendale persisted well major elwell said thoughtfully you spoke of an invitation to visit your friend mr anthony silburn at hookam court why not motor down there tomorrow its one of the places in the country that your call might have come from at any rate a derisive reply quivered upon lavendales lips then for some reason or other he changed his mind and remained silent major elwell without any appearance of hurrying him was holding the door open all right lavendale agreed ill motor down there tomorrow lavendale was conscious of a queer sensation of unreality as late on the following afternoon he followed the butler across the whiteflagged entrance hall of hookam court he felt as though he were an unwilling actor in a play of which the setting was all too perfect the little party of guests still in shooting clothes and lounging before the great wood fire brought into their surroundings a vivid note of flamboyant artificiality the high walls with their ecclesiasticallycurved frescoes the row of family portraits the armour standing in the recesses even the little local touch afforded by the gamekeeper in brown whipcord and gaiters standing waiting in a distant corner seemed to him like part of some cinema production in which the men and women were supers and the setting tinsel his hosts greeting was all that it should have been he advanced across the hall with outstretched hand quietly but sincerely cordial good man lavendale he exclaimed i was delighted to get your telegram very nice of you lavendale murmured i hadnt any idea of being at a loose end so soon when you were kind enough to ask me it couldnt have happened more fortunately mr anthony silburn assured him ive another man coming down tonight but ive room for two more guns now let me introduce you to those of your fellowguests whom you dont know mr lavendalelady marsham mr kindersley mr barracombe sir julius marsham mr henry d steinletter lavendale bowed individually to the women and collectively to the men lady marsham a stout darkhaired lady with a heavy jaw made room for him by her side it is quite a treat mr lavendale she declared to see a young man one feels that he must be either an american or a hopeless invalid you are an american arent you lavendale admitted the fact and rose to welcome his hostess who was coming down the stairs she suddenly recognized lavendale and stopped short for the first time he was conscious of something which freed him from that sense of being part of a carefully concerted picture there was something absolutely human entirely spontaneous in his cousins expression as she recognized him her fingers gripped the oak banisters her lips were parted her eyes were filled with something which was scarcely a welcoming light it all passed in a moment and she came into the picture naturally and easily my dear ambrose how delightful to see you again does tony know lavendale advanced to meet her and took her hands he asked me down for a few days only yesterday when i met him in town and i wired to say that i was coming today i am afraid i didnt give him a chance to turn me down but i meant to say although he hasnt given me an opportunity yet that if its at all inconvenient i could go on to norwich and look up some friends near there for a single moment she hesitated her little laugh was not altogether natural again lavendale had a queer fancy that there was a leaven of insincerity in her welcomethat if it had been possible she would even have sent him away dont be foolish ambrose of course we are delighted i see you people have had tea she went on i really couldnt resist a bath and teagown and i was much too lazy lady marsham yawned lighting a cigarette i shall go up and change early for dinner mr silburns voice was heard from the other end of the hall he was dismissing the gamekeeper with a few parting instructions ill have another covering stand at the long wood reynolds he was saying you can put it on the extreme left near the old oak ill take that myself and mr lavendale will shoot from number three youve got your guns lavendale he added strolling up to them they are in the car lavendale replied but i warn you that i havent shot for two years i dont think my pheasants will bother you any mr silburn promised him barracombe here finds them on the slow side we had a very good day todayover a thousand head altogether sure you wont have some tea or a whiskyandsoda nothing thanks then ill show you your rooms his host continued if youll come this way lydia silburn who had been standing a little irresolutely on the other side of the round teatable suddenly turned towards her husband why didnt you tell me tony that ambrose was coming she inquired i meant to her husband admitted as it happens however i havent seen much of you today have i come along young fellow did you bring a servant bytheby no well ive quite a smart second boy who can look after you we dine at eight and lavendale just one word he concluded as he glanced around the spacious rooms into which he had ushered his guest we have a sort of unwritten rule to which every one subscribes here it saves so much unpleasant argument on a subject where our opinions are a little divided we dont mention the war until halfpast ten very sound lavendale remarked but why halfpast ten after dinner mr silburn promised i will explain that to you we have a little conversazione sometimesbut just wait again an hour or so later when lavendale stood once more in the hall talking to one or two of the men whilst a footman was passing round cocktails upon a tray he felt oppressed by that curious sense of unreality he took himself severely to task for it he told himself that it must lie simply in the innate incongruity of this occupation of a ducal home by an american millionaire in every other respect the men and women were obviously fitting figures one or two of them were even known to him by reputation the whole atmosphere of their conversation was natural and spontaneous and then as he turned resolutely to continue a discussion about wild pheasants with barracombebarracombe whom he knew well to be a great scientific traveller a man of distinctionit was then that the climax came the dramatic note which alone was needed to convince him of the spuriousness of his surroundings he had turned his head quite naturally towards the broad western corridor on hearing the soft rustling of a womans skirtsand he talked no more of wild pheasants it was suzanne in a black evening gown and carrying a handful of pink roses in her hand who was coming slowly across the hall suzanne miss de freyne he exclaimed taking a quick step forward he was conscious of many things in those few seconds conscious of his hosts strenuous regard of suzannes unnatural pallor of the warning in her eyes his rush of joy at seeing her however was allconquering he took her hands in his and held them tightly and to think that no one told me you were here he exclaimed there was a moments strained silence then a cold wave of doubt a premonition of evil suddenly chilled him in the background he had caught a glimpse of a peculiar smile upon his hosts lips and again there was the warning in suzannes eyes i have been down in the neighbourhood for several days she told him it is rather a coincidence is it not anthony silburn who had remained all the time within earshot strolled over towards them so you young people have discovered one another he remarked the gong at last he added with a little burst of enthusiasm lavendale as it is your first evening will you take lydia in miss de freyne i am going to give myself the happiness tonight he held out his arm and led suzanne away lavendale loitered behind with his cousin lydia he whispered as they passed into the great diningroom how long has miss de freyne been here in this house since the day before yesterday she answered she was staying before at the hookam arms down in the village say is there anything wrong about this place he asked i dont know what it is but i feel as though id come into some sort of a theatrical performance i suppose you are all alive arent you that really is barracombe the traveller and old steinletter his tone had been one of half banter but her reply made him suddenly serious i dont know ambrose she confessed nervously sometimes i feel like that myself dont talk too loudly lavendale became a watcher through the progress of the wonderfully served meal the servants in a way were all of the usual type obviously welltrained and attentive the diningroom at hookam had been built out by a favourite of one of the georges almost in the form of a pagoda and under the high domed roof listening to the somewhat stereotyped conversation of those strangelyassorted guests lavendale became slowly conscious of a new sensation the sensation of restriction it was hard to believe that outside lay the park that in the morning he would be wandering about free to come and go as he pleased that in the garage was his own car and a couple of miles away across the park the road to london he tried to talk lightly to lydia of their relatives and friends in america but he found her distraite and depressed dinner was no sooner over however than he made a bold attempt to dissipate some of his presentiments can i use the telephone silburn he asked with pleasure my dear boy was the unhesitating reply youll find an instrument this way they were all crossing the hall the men and the women were to smoke and take their coffee together silburn led his young guest into a small waitingroom comfortably furnished on a table in the middle of the apartment was a telephone instrument and a book of subscribers lavendale took up the receiver can you get through to london he asked sorry sir the line is engaged the operator regretted will it be free presently ill ring up as soon as we can get through what number lavendale gave the number of his own rooms and rejoined the little group in the hall he found barracombe on one side of suzanne and his host on the other but he drew a chair as near to her as he could get through all right silburn inquired i didnt get through anywhere lavendale replied the line was engaged weve a lot of soldiers down here mr silburn explained they are always commandeering the line for military purposes you seem to get plenty of messages lavendale remarked as a servant for the third or fourth time brought a slip of folded paper to his master silburn smiled i have a private line he announced sorry i cant ask you to use it but i have promised the military here that no one else save myself shall communicate by means of it are you a bridger lavendale lavendale excused himself but gained nothing for suzanne was almost forced into the game by her host he wandered about the hall glancing up at the pictures then he went back to the telephone room lines still engaged sir was the laconic reply to his inquiry lavendale strolled back he wandered uneasily about the hall for a time and then approached the great front door think ill have a look at the night he remarked with his hand upon the bolt the servant who was standing by intervened i beg your pardon sir he said we are not allowed to open the front door after dusk the military have complained so much about the lights show me another way out from the back then lavendale persisted no one is allowed to leave the house at all until morning the man told him lavendale turned slowly round towards the bridgetable silburn he asked are we prisoners my dear fellow his host replied dealing out a hand it is not i who am to blame but the english military authorities look how closelycurtained we are everywhere you will find double blinds in every room in the house yet even that has not been enough to satisfy them i have had to promise that no members of my household shall even open a door after dark defence of the realm act they call it i think lavendale turned a little discontentedly away it was difficult to protest further but he was not in the least satisfied that silburns explanation was a genuine one he talked for a few moments to several of the other guests and then drew a low chair up close to suzanne it was evident to him watching her closely that she was playing under great tension more than ever he was convinced that something was wrong with an excuse about fetching some cigarettes of a particular brand he made up to his room and searched in his dressingcase within a few minutes he found himself face to face with a very grim reality the revolver which he carried always with him had been removed lavendale with small hopes of any success called once more at the telephone room before he rejoined the little party the reply was almost brusque line blocked no chance of getting through to london tonight can i ring up norwich lavendale asked with a sudden inspiration line to norwich engaged was the reply is there anywhere i can speak to lavendale persisted is there any number upon the exchange i can be connected with there was no reply he rang again and tapped the wire there was still silence then he replaced the receiver upon the instrument and stood for a moment in the little room thinking there was no doubt but that he had simply followed suzanne into a trap he rapidly reviewed in his memory the guests lady marsham it was well known had been educated in berlin and had german relatives barracombe wore an order conferred upon him by the kaiser steinletter belonged to the greatest germanamerican banking firm in the world kindersleys daughter had married an austrian prince suzanne had succeeded then in this last quest of hers a success which although inadvertently he might be said to share they had in all probability discovered the headquarters of the great teutonic espionage system in england how was it going to profit them his mind rapidly reviewed the situation they were prisonersof that he was certainyet to what extent how far was silburn prepared to go it was after all rather an operabouffe sort of trap if they were caught there was still the question of silencing them then he thought of that abstracted revolver and a queer little wave of apprehension not for himself but for suzanne suddenly chilled him he made his way back into the hall the rubber was just over and he leaned boldly over the chair in which suzanne was seated come and talk to me for a few minutes he begged she hesitated mr silburn who was playing idly with the cards glanced at the clock and back again at halfpast ten he announced in ten minutes that is to say we all meet in the cloister room it is a queer custom perhaps but my guests have been kind in conforming to it prayers lavendale inquired not a bad name for our few minutes serious diversion mr silburn remarked dryly lavendale led suzanne towards a couch at the further end of the hall he laid his hand upon hers and found it as cold as ice suzanne he said quietly are we in a trap i believe we are she answered it is entirely my fault i have never been so foolish before in my life i have always had people behind me who have known my whereabouts and who could come to the rescue if necessary this time i told no one i was selfish i wanted the whole credit but tell me of yourselfhow you came here it was just the merest chance he replied silburn had asked me to shoot here and then you half told me where you were over the telephone i think that the rest must have been instinct you havent told me yet though how you found your way here i was down at the village she said i followed mr steinletter here i had a special permit a military pass i was supposed to be related to one of the officers quartered at the inn i made a few inquiries about this place which increased my suspicions then i met mrs silburn outside the lodge gates she was with the colonel in command here and they stopped to speak to the officer i was with she was delightful and asked me to call i was only too glad to have a chance of obtaining the entre to the house they made me send for my clothes to spend the night that was two days ago since then i have tried in vain to get away let me understand what you mean by trying to get away he begged surely you could ask for a car to take you to the station i have done so three times she replied always with the same result they assure me that every car in the garage has been requisitioned by the government i go to that dummy telephonethe exchange is in the house you knowand of course nothing happens if i start out to walk i am shadowed by one of the menservants and as you know it is two miles before one reaches the road well there isnt much they can do with us dear lavendale assured her coolly tell me now have you made any actual discovery there is a private telegraph and telephone exchange here in the place she said and mr silburn gets messages every few hours there are people always coming and going all people of the same class there is not the slightest doubt that this is the place for which we have searched ambrose if only we could stretch out the net now at this moment we could make a great haul instead of which he remarked grimly we seem to be in the meshes ourselves tell me she begged does any one know that you were coming here i told elwellmajor elwell lavendale replied with a suddenly inspired flash of memory i told him why i was coming here too she clutched at his arm then suddenly she looked down they are watching us she whispered ambrose that may save us yet if only he comes in time in time for what lavendale answered cheerfully i cant look upon this as very serious dear why lydia silburn is my own cousin she is our only hope suzanne declared as for the rest i have grown to suspect every one of them what does this halfpast ten business mean he asked she shook her head at halfpast ten they all go into what they call the cloister room she said as yet i have not been invited there but i have an idea that tonight we are both to be present yes here comes mr silburn now you young people their host observed pleasantly we are going to let you into a few secrets this way they both rose the others were crossing the hall towards the eastern corridor mr silburn drew suzannes arm through his as they walked his face became more serious lavendale had a wild idea for a moment of snatching suzanne away opening the front door by force and clamouring for freedom then he remembered the two miles to the lodge gate and shrugged his shoulders its rather a queer apartment into which i am going to take you mr silburn explained a crazy sort of place really but to us americans this sort of room i must confess appeals some allow me miss de freyne he motioned them both to precede him they found themselves in what seemed to be from the bareness of the walls and the shape of the windows a small chapel built on different levels the larger part of the room which was below was wrapped in complete gloom the smaller part was unfurnished save for a long table around which was ranged a number of chairs one by one the guests seated themselves lavendale and suzanne followed their example as indifferently as possible mr silburn sat at the head of the table with lady marsham on his right and mr steinletter opposite there was a certain significance to lavendale in the fact that his cousin was not present a somewhat gloomy light was thrown upon the faces of the little company from a heavilyshaded oil lamp suspended by a brass chain from the roof and looking around at their mingled expressions lavendale for the first time felt a sense of real danger a thrill of something like fear not for his own sake but for suzannes he groped for her hand beneath the table and held the icycold fingers tightly courage dear he murmured under his breath she smiled at him plaintively and with the fear still lurking in her dark eyes then mr silburn leaned forward in his place and tapped upon the table with his forefinger his voice in the hollow spaces sounded strangely my friends he began few words are best we live as you all know from day to day in danger no such association as ours could continue to exist without hourly peril so far we have triumphed over the secret service of every country so far we have carried on our great work without hindrance or suspicion those days i am forced to tell you are passing the hour of our supreme peril is close at hand there are two people here present who have guessed our secret one of them this young lady upon my left miss de freyne is here for no other purpose than to spy upon us suzanne seemed to have regained her courage in the moment of trial she was stronger than in the indeterminate hours of suspense she turned her head towards silburn what are you all but spies she demanded spies of the lowest and most dastardly class you are here under the shelter of a friendly country to do her all the harm you can to stab in the dark to take advantage of your nationalityyour american nationalityto pose as an anglosaxon you abuse the country which shelters you you call me a spy compared with you all of you i am the most innocent person who ever breathed a strange impassivity seemed to be reflected from all the faces of the little gathering only in mr kindersleys face there trembled for a moment some shadow of sympathy you have heard the young lady mr silburn continued calmly we come now to her companion mr lavendale although an american by birth has embraced the cause of this country doubtless he added with a little satirical bow for reasons upon which i will not enlarge he has become the ally of mademoiselle we secured his presence here i admit by a ruse my friends these two peoples knowledge of our secret is fatal to our safety there was a moments silence then lady marsham leaned back in her chair i propose she said firmly that the same steps be taken with these two people as heretofore there was a little murmur of approval only mr kindersley sighed one must remember he observed reflectively that it is not only for our own safetyit is for the preservation of a great cause lavendale took a cigarette from a box in the centre of the table and lit it i dont know what this penalty is that you propose to inflict upon us he remarked but i should just like to remind you that you are living in a very highly civilized country where people do not disappear at hookam mr silburn said calmly people have disappeared for the last nine hundred years below there the secret cloisters reach almost to the sea the cleverest and most astute criminologists who ever breathed might track you to these doors lavendale and search until their hair was grey before they discovered a single trace of you my servants are mine body and soul for my wifes sake lavendale look here lavendale interrupted i am not sure whether you are in earnest or not but whatever you might be thinking about for me you couldnt be such brutes he stopped short there was a sudden light in his face from outside the door they could clearly hear the sound of an angry voice a little ripple of terrified excitement flashed around the table mr silburns teeth came together with a little click there was a curious tremor of emotion in his tone lock the door he ordered barracombe it was too late in a long travelling ulster with his cap still in his hand major elwell stood already upon the threshold behind him still protesting was lydia silburn elwell lavendale shouted thank god major elwell gazed around at them all through his eyeglass and looked back at the woman by his side he seemed bewildered what in the name of all thats holy is this he demanded there was a moments silence lavendale drew a long breath his arm was stretched out accusingly towards his host suddenly the words failed upon his lips he looked around him speechless amazed it was as though the whole world had gone mad mr barracombe from the opposite side of the table had removed his spectacles from his nose and was wiping the tears from his eyes lady marsham was leaning on one side doubled up there was only one common sound everywherelaughter irresistible compelling unmistakable mr silburn taking off his pincenez and struggling for composure rose to his feet the sentence of the court upon you two he declared unsteadily would have been delivered with more solemnity but for the premature arrival of our friend jack elwell i hereby pronounce it however finally and irrevocably it is this ambrose lavendalethat you offer your arm to miss de freyne that you lead the way in to supper and that you produce your marriage certificate within three weeks almost as he spoke lights flashed out from the great room below a long table was laid for supper there were servants who seemed to appear like magic with bottles and dishes lavendale turned towards elwell looked back at his host and finally down at suzanne suzanne he exclaimed i believe were spoofed she shook her head there were tears of relief in her eyes but a delicious curve of laughter upon her lips i do not know the word she admitted but i believe it is true lead the way young fellow mr silburn insisted forgive us you two but when we heard of miss de freyne down at the village making inquiries about uswell you remember i had to leave harvard for a practical joke all the same lydia silburn declared from the background the sentence of the court is final they took their places and the supper party very soon became a much gayer meal than the dinner which had preceded it towards its close lavendale whispered to suzanne dear he said im afraid well have to own up that we havent been quite as astute as usual perhaps we are getting a little stale supposing we takea holiday she flashed a wonderful smile up at him it was the sentence of the court she murmured the end printed in great britain by butler tanner frome and london the novels of e phillips oppenheim the profiteers
