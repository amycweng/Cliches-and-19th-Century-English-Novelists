found its way through a pall of clouds and a lowhanging mist suddenly fell as though exhausted across the asphalt path of the embankment gardens a tall gaunt young man who had been seated with folded arms in the corner of one of the seats stared at it as though bewildered his eyes suddenly met those of a young lady in deep black who was gazing about her in similar stupefaction almost at once and with perfect spontaneity she smiled upon him but it is astonishing this she exclaimed sunshine in londonin january the young man was a little confused he was very diffident and such lack of conventionality on the part of a perfect stranger surprised him it is unusual he admitted it is a thing which i have never seen she went on dropping voice a little and glancing towards a bathchair close at hand in which an elderly and very delicatelooking old gentleman was muffled up in furs and apparently asleep it is something even for which i had not dared to hope we seem so far here from everything that is bright and beautiful and cheerful aaron rodd who was a shy and awkward being felt unexpectedly at his ease he was even anxious for further conversation he had a rather long pale face with deepset eyes and rugged features he was soberly even sombrely dressed in dismal black he had the air of a recluse perhaps that was why the young lady smiled upon him with such confidence you are not english he ventured she shook her head what we are now alas she sighed glancing towards the bathchair i scarcely know for we have no country like every one else in such a plight we come to england it is your father who sleeps there he enquired it is my grandfather she told him togetherhe and i and my brotherwe have passed through terrible times he has lost all power to sleep at night in the daytime when it does not rain he is wheeled out here and if it is only not too cold then he sleeps as he does now and i watch you are very young to have charge of him she smiled a little pitifully one grows old so quickly in these terrible days i am already twentyone but you she went onsee how inquisitive i ami saw you yesterday from the distance seated here there are nursemaids and queer fragments of humanity who seem to pass through these gardens and loiter and sometimes there are those with affairs who go on their way but youwhat do you think of as you sit there you are a writer perhaps he laughed a little harshly his voice was not altogether pleasant i am a lawyer he declared without a practice sometimes the ghosts who call at my empty office stifle me and i come out here to escape from them a lawyer an avocat she repeated softly to herself evidently she found something to interest her in the statement she glanced towards the sleeping man then she came a little nearer he was conscious of a very delightful and altogether unenglish perfume aware suddenly that her eyes were the colour of violets framed underneath with deep but not unbecoming lines that her mouth was curved in a fashion strange to him englishmen they say are so much to be trusted she murmured and a lawyer too i am an american by birth he interposed although i have lived over here nearly all my life it is the same thing we need advice so badly let me ask you one question is it not the first principle of a lawyer to hold sacred whatever confidence his client may confide in him absolutely he assured her even if that confidence she persisted should bring the person who offered it within the hold of the law a lawyer may refuse a client he said but he may never betray his confidence will you tell me your name and address she asked eagerly my name is aaron rodd he told her my address is number seventeen manchester street adelphi and my office is on the third floor mr aaron rodd she repeated with a queer little foreign intonation that is a strange name and i shall remember it when might one visit you monsieur at three oclock this afternoon i shall be in all day then au revoir she exclaimed with an abrupt gesture of farewell the old gentleman had opened his eyes and was gazing fretfully about she crossed the asphalt walk swiftly towards him an attendant who seemed to have gone to sleep standing on one leg gripped the handle of the bathchair the girl passed her arm around the old mans shoulders and whispered something to the attendant they passed away together the little streak of sunshine had gone aaron rodd thrust his ungloved hands into his coat pockets and made his way in the opposite direction about an hour later a small rubicund man a man whose dark hair was turning grey but whose eyes were bright and whose complexion was remarkably healthy paused before the doorplate of an office building in one of the back streets leading from the adelphi he was dressed with extreme neatness from the tips of his patent boots to his grey felt hat and he was obviously of a cheerful disposition he glanced down the list of names twirling his cane in lighthearted fashion and whistling softly to himself suddenly he paused his cane ceased its aimless configurations and rested for a moment upon a name about halfway down the list the name of mr aaron rodd solicitor and commissioner for oaths there was also an indication that mr rodds offices were to be found upon the third floor his prospective visitor glanced around and discovering that there was no lift started out for the stone stairs on the first landing he encountered a small boy descending with a roll of papers under his arm him the newcomer whose name was mr harvey grimm promptly addressed my young sir he said pleasantly from the red tape around that bundle of papers which you are carrying i gather that you have legal connections you are probably the confidential clerk of the gentleman whom i am proposing to visit can you tell me before i attempt another flight of these very dusty and unsympathetic steps whether mr aaron rodd is within the boy glanced at his questioner suspiciously i am not in mr rodds office he replied im steel and agnett second floor that mr harvey grimm sighed regretfully is unfortunate a very excellent firm yours my boy do not let me any longer interfere with your efforts on their behalf aaron rodds prospective visitor with a sigh recommenced the ascent the boy looked after him for a moment dubiously and then disappeared arrived at the third floor at the extreme end of the corridor the former discovered a door on which was painted the name of mr aaron rodd he knocked was bidden to enter and stepped at once into a single bald and unpromisinglooking apartment good morning aaron he said cheerfully closing the door behind him and advancing across the dusty floor aaron rodd who had been seated before a desk apparently immersed in a legal document first raised his head and then rose slowly to his feet his first look of expectancy as he had turned towards his visitor faded by degrees into a very curious expression an expression which seemed made up of a great deal of amazement and a certain amount of dread with his left hand he gripped the side of the desk my god he exclaimed its ned his visitor held out his hand no no my dear aaron he interrupted firmly you are deceived by a slight resemblance you are thinking probably of that poor fellow ned stiles you will never see ned again aaron the intelligence appeared to cause the listener no grief neither did it carry with it any conviction harvey grimm is my name the newcomer went on mr harvey grimm if you please of chicago you remember me now without a doubt he extended his hand confidently his smile was ingratiating his air that of an ingenuous child anxious for a favourable reception aaron rodd slowly thrust out his inkstained fingers i remember you all right he admitted the visitor having established his identity seemed disposed to abandon the subject he glanced around the room and discovering a canebottomed chair on which were piled some dustcovered documents he calmly swept them away annexed the chair which he carefully flicked around with a silk handkerchief and brought it to the side of the desk sit down my dear fellow i beg you he invited laying his hat on the floor by his side hitching up his blue serge trousers and smiling in momentary satisfaction at his wellpolished shoes i have appropriated i fancy the clients chair am i right i wonder in presuming that there has not been much use for it lately perfectly right was the grim reply hard times these have been for all of us harvey grimm declared with an air of placid satisfaction you are not expecting a client this morning i presume nor a miracle in that case i will smoke the newcomer continued producing a small gold case selecting a cigarette and lighting it try one aaron rodd hesitated and finally accepted the offer he smoked with the air of one unused to the indulgence mr harvey grimm of chicago he muttered studying his visitors very immaculate appearance havent i heard the name somewhere or seen it in the papers lately possibly was the suave reply my arrival in london has i think created some slight interest even your press i find is not above recording the movements of a capitalist a what a capitalist harvey grimm repeated calmly with a name like mine and an abode like chicago i am amazed that you did not divine it seven years ago aaron rodd observed we divided seventeen pounds four shillings and eightpence it was i believe our united capital and to judge by your surroundings his companion sighed i fear my friend that you have been emulating the man who tied up his talent in a stocking i on the other hand have changed your name and become a capitalist aaron rodd interrupted drily precisely there was a moments silence mr harvey grimm with the beatific smile of opulence was whistling softly to himself his companions thoughts had apparently travelled back into the past well the latter said at last i will imitate your candour the document i was examining with so much interest when you came in is a sevenyearold lease long since cancelled the few black boxes you see around the room are with one exception bogus i sit here from morning till night and nothing happens i sit here and brood dear me dear me his visitor murmured sympathetically by turning my chair around aaron rodd continued i can just catch a glimpse of the river across the gardens there i sit and watch wonder whether a tug will go past next or a lighter watch the people in the gardens wonder where they are going why they are loitering why hurrying i speculate about the few passersby down in the street there sometimes i close my eyes and i fancy myself in lincolns inn seated in a padded morocco chair with a turkeycarpet on the floor and rows of boxes black tin boxes with wonderful names inscribed upon them in white lettering reaching to the ceiling and my secretary poring over my engagement book wondering when it would be possible for me to squeeze in half an hour for an important client too much of the dreamer about you harvey grimm pronounced perhaps after all it is the fault of your work its a sedative profession you know aaron it wouldnt suit me to have to sit and wait for clients its the black bogey of my life the other assented with a thin note of passion in his tone if only one could get out and work even if one didnt get a penny for it and financially harvey grimm enquired with an apologetic cough on the rocks was the bitter reply you can understand he went on with a heedless sarcasm what a wonderful thing it is for me to welcome a capitalist in my shabby office and an old friend was the cheerful reminder come come aaron we must look into this i must place some of my affairs in your charge aaron rodds lip curled with bitter incredulity some of your affairs i had a taste of those in the old days nedi mean harvey you brought me to the brink of singsing you drove me over here to make a fresh start harvey grimm waved his hand these reminiscences were indelicate my dear fellow he protested now come answer me a few questions such affairs of business as have fallen to your lot have been conducted witherdiscretion if you mean have i preserved my reputation the lawyer replied grimly i have i have no temptation to do otherwise that is capital his friend declared that helps us at once and now i think he went on glancing at his neat little wristwatch lunch aaron rodds first movement was almost eager he checked himself however then a glance at his visitors immaculate toilet and distinctly opulent appearance reassured him there will be no trouble i presume he said a little diffidently as to the settlement of our bill i warn you before we start that a shilling and a few coppers harvey grimm laid his hand almost affectionately upon the others shoulder my dear aaron he expostulated you are a little confused you have not yet taken in the position a capitalist is of course a relative term i will not press that point but let me assure you that i have a suite of rooms at the milan ample credit for any meals i choose to take there even money to pay for them if necessary i am not fit to go to the milan aaron rodd muttered brushing himself vigorously that is entirely your mistake his friend replied rising to his feet and lighting another cigarette a judicious shabbiness is today an approved form of eccentricity with your ascetic face my dear aaron that little wisp of black tie your clean but frayed collar your sombre wellworn clothes you would be mistaken by the casual observer for either a chancery lawyer with an indifferent housekeeper or a writer of dramatic blank verse which every one admires but no one buys reassure yourself aaron i predict that as a companion you will do me every credit for the first time a grim hard smile parted the lips of the man who was making out with rather weary fingers the accustomed card to affix to his door the needy adventurer is what i feel like in these days he observed and why not adventurer harvey grimm protested as they descended the stone steps we are all needy that is to say we all need something or other and we allthose of us who understand life at any rateseek adventures even with the success i have myself attainedi will be quite frank with you my dear aaroni am entirely unchanged i can assure you that i am not above finding interest and pleasure as well as profit in any adventure which may come to hand his companion chuckled drily i can well believe it he murmured they strolled up the street a somewhat curiously assorted couple mr harvey grimms grey felt hat his neat and somewhat jaunty figure rather suggested the successful trainer of careful habits or elderly jockey enjoying the opulence of middle age aaron rodd on the other hand looked exactly what he wasthe lean and hungry professional man with whom the times have gone ill queer neighbourhood this youve chosen for your office aaron his friend remarked pausing as they neared the corner what sort of people come into these parts anyway its just a backwater theres the broad stream of london flowing on to success and prosperity a few yards up the hill if you listen for a moment you can hear it these little streets are just parasitical branches still alive and still struggling but fit for nothing but to be snapped off all the furtive businesses in the world might be conducted behind these silent unwashed windows and blank doorwaysshabby theatrical agencies doubtful publications betting offices of poor reputation people come here to hide or to escape notice there was a murder committed down by the railings at the end of the street only a year or so ago obviously harvey grimm remarked cheerfully the region of melancholia and tragedies we must see how things go aaron perhaps later on it would be as well for you to move to a betterknown part just at present however it is well enough the tall young man looked down at his companion half derisively half eagerly he knew him too well to ask many questions knew him too well to hope unduly knew too the danger into which this simple luncheon might lead him yet only a few nights ago he had thought of the river it was better to take luncheon with harvey grimm at the milan than to feel the black waters sucking his breath away feeling better aaron harvey grimm enquired of his friend about an hour and a half later aaron rodd was both feeling and looking better and acknowledged the fact his manner towards his host too showed signs of a subtle change the latter was obviously persona grata in the restaurant their table although a little retired was in a coveted corner and attentions of every sort had been respectfully offered them nevertheless his guest felt some sense of relief when he saw the bill signed with a little flourish and accepted with a low bow by their waiter harvey grimm leaned back in his chair and removed the cigar for a moment from his lips youve no faith in me aaron he declared with an encouraging smile thats what you always lacked even in the old daysfaith youre losing touch with the world you know cooped up in that musty office of yours you dont expect anything to happen to you so long as you grub away there do you nothing has happened at any rate aaron rodd admitted i will not say that it is your fault his companion continued tolerantly you are by nature of a meditative and retiring temperament it is a piece of extraordinarily good fortune for you that i never forget old friends have you anything to propose to me aaron rodd asked bluntly his host leaned across the table always so downright my dear aaron he murmured so material however you have asked the question and here is my answer i am proposing to remain in london for some little time there are various schemes which have suggested themselves to me which might readily lead to an enlargement of my income for their prosecution my dear aaron i need one only one companion whom i can trust one man who is out for the big things that is why i come to you i offer you a partnership in the concernharvey grimm and rodd traffickers in fate dealers in adventures how your hand shakes man there youve dropped the ash from your cigar aaron rodds thin lips were quivering his eyes seemed full of unutterable things i have made such a fight of it he muttered youve got me though harvey ive eaten my last crust i should have had to sell my office stool for a meal tomorrow his friend shook his head genially my dear aaron he protested such a confession from a man of brains when one considers how the world is overrun with fools is a terrible one one has a conscience rodd sighed and a profession like mine doesnt lend itself to crooked dealing harvey grimm smiled tolerantly he had the air of one listening to a child the wolves of the world he said keep their conscience and as regards wrongdoing its just success that makes the difference my dear fellow he broke off looking up into the face of a man who had paused at their table and whose hand was now reposing heavily upon his shoulder my dear brodie this is most opportune let me present you to my friend mr aaron rodd aaron this is mr brodiein the language of the cinemas he added dropping his voice a little and leaning forward the sleuthhound of europe the greatest living detective aaron rodd sat for a moment motionless the cigar slipped from his fingers on to the plate all his new hopes seemed crumbling away his eyes were fixed upon the hand which gripped his companions shoulder harvey grimm began to laugh softly cheer up my pessimistic friend he exclaimed this isnt the grip of the law which is upon my shoulder mr brodie and i are friendsi might even say allies aaron rodd recovered himself and murmured a few words of mechanical greeting the newcomer meanwhile took the chair which the waiter had offered him he was a tall burly man cleanshaven with steely grey eyes and grey hair brushed back from his forehead his manner was consequential his tone patronising so this is our third hand eh guessed it in one with your usual astuteness harvey grimm acknowledged cheerfully a lawyer of unblemished character not momentarily affluent with the principles of a latitudinarian has he got the nerve mr brodie demanded if we are on the right track theres no room for weaklings in the job aaron rodds all right his friend declared confidently you leave that to me ill answer for him the younger man leaned across the table do i understand he enquired that our enterprise is on the side of the law harvey grimm smiled the present one my dear aaron i should explain to you perhaps that mr brodie is not officially attached either to scotland yard or to police headquarters in new york he spent some years at scotland yard and having the good luck to inherit a small fortune and feeling himself handicapped by the antiquated methods and jealousies of his competitors he decided to strike out for himself as an independent investigator some day he will tell us a few of his adventures mr brodie had folded his arms and was looking very imposing i have hunted criminals he asserted in every quarter of the world i have methods of my own i have a genius for making use of people so you see my dear aaron harvey grimm pointed out at present mr brodie and i are the greatest of friends he recognises the fact that i am what is baldly spoken of as an adventurer and that the time may come when we shall find ourselves in opposite camps but just at present it is our privilege to be of service to mr brodie then a thing ordinary enough in its way happened in a curious manner mr brodie was a large man but he seemed suddenly to fade away there was his empty chair and a dim vision of a retreating figure behind one of the central sideboards aaron rodd seemed dimly conscious of a look of warning flashed between the two men but nothing equal to the swift secrecy of mr brodies movements had ever confused his senses harvey grimm leaned across the table holding his liqueur glass in his hand slick fellow brodie he murmured no good his being seen talking to us when the quarrys about eh nice brandy this on the dry side perhaps but with a flavour to it aaron rodd understood that he was to ask no questions and he discussed the subject of brandy in a sufficiently ignorant manner he too however within the course of the next few seconds found need for the exercise of all his powers of selfcontrol only a few yards away from him was a young man in some foreign uniform with his arm in a sling discussing with a matre dhtel as to the locality of his table by his side was the girl with whom he had talked that morning in the embankment gardens and behind the two a somewhat pathetic picture was the old man his face as withered as parchment his narrow white beard carefully trimmed leaning heavily upon a stick almost as he realised their presence they moved on escorted by the matre dhtel to a table in a distant corner aaron rodd drew a long breath as they disappeared his companion looked at him curiously are those the people the lawyer asked eagerly on whose account brodie moved away harvey grimm watched them settle in their places they are he admitted a patheticlooking trio and now my dear aaron he went on we will discuss your little adventure in the embankment gardens this morning you perceive that the moment is appropriate my little adventure aaron rodd repeated blankly whyyou mean to say you were there then you saw her speak to me certainly i was seated a little further down talking with my friend mr brodie we had our eyes upon the young lady aaron rodd felt a sudden disinclination to speak of that little gleam of sunshine she spoke to me quite casually he declared afterwards she asked me my profession i told her that i was a lawyer perhaps she had already guessed it i suppose i do rather look the part you do indeed my friend and then the younger man hesitated his partners benevolent face suddenly assumed a sterner aspect aaron he reminded him we are on business the truth pleaseno reservations she asked me the other went on whether the confidence of a client is always respected by one in my profession and your reply i assured her of course that under any circumstances it was harvey grimm leaned back in his chair he rolled the remaining drop of brandy around in his glass his expression was beatific my dear aaron he said fate smiles upon our new partnership the young lady is going to pay you a visit at three oclock this afternoon if she keeps her word finish your brandy and come with me to my apartment harvey grimm directed we have matters to discuss and arrange before you receive that visit an hour or so later aaron rodd was seated once more before his dilapidated inkstained desk the gloom of the winter afternoon was only partly dissipated by the single gasjet burning above his head the same old lease was spread out underneath his hands in his face however there was a distinct change the listlessness had gone he had the air of one awaiting events so he had sat for the last halfhour with his eyes fixed alternately upon the outside door purposely left ajar and the inner one which led to his humble bedsittingroom there came at last the sound for which he had been waiting up that last flight of stone stairs he could hear distinctly the slow movement of weary footsteps the continual tapping of a stick the occasional cough and querulous complaint of a tired old man and by the side of those shuffling footsteps others marvellously light the swish of a silken skirt the music of a clear very sweet young voice you see we are arrived she was saying there is the name upon the door you will be able to sit down directly courage dear grandfather remember it is for leopolds sake then there followed a gentle knock the somewhat hesitating entrance of the two the halfdoubtful look of the girl towards the tall gaunt young man whose face seemed almost saturnine underneath that unshaded light as he moved forward however she recognised him and a smile of relief parted her lips ah it is mr rodd is it notthe gentleman with whom i spoke in the gardens this morningthe lawyer he bowed anxiety made his voice sound even harsher many things had happened since the morning you have kept your promise then he remarked you have come to consult me i am at your service one moment he brought two of the chairs which stood stiffly against the wall and placed them by the side of his desk the old man sat down with an air of relief the passage up the stairs had apparently exhausted him we are very haphazard clients i fear mr rodd he said wearily this is unfortunately one of my bad days i must leave my granddaughter to explain the reason of our visit and in what manner we hope to be able to make use of your services if i do so grandfather she said turning a little towards him i am going to tell the whole truth if it must be he murmured uneasily the girl took up at once the burden of explanation my grandfather my brother and myself she began are staying at the milan hotel we make use of a name the name of brinnen to which we have some right even though it may be a shadowy one we happen to be belgians by birth a fact which at the present moment makes our position easier to be honest with you however my brother has just returned from america he has been engaged for some time in more hazardous enterprises even than defending his country against the germans the old man interrupted her impatiently these explanations are waste of time he insisted tell this gentleman quickly what we desire of him she patted his hand and glanced half apologetically across at aaron rodd he had resumed his seat before his desk his face half hidden by his hand listening to the girls voice he had become conscious of a longforgotten sentiment encumbered though she was with a difficult mission there was a certain fineness of speech and manner an appeal for sympathy in even this last gesture which he found strangely disturbing you need explain to me no more than you wish he told her a little stiffly i shall be glad to be of any service to you there is no need for you to enter into any painful details she shrugged her shoulders protestingly you and my grandfather are of one mind she remarked then i will make a confession which may sound abrupt but which is nevertheless true we threemy brother my grandfather and myselfare not entitled to the sympathy we receive we are to a certain extent impostors is your standard of morals a very high one mr rodd ii scarcely really know he stammered as a lawyer i am brought into contact with all conditions of people i have before now done my best for the criminal as i have for the honest man it is reassuring she admitted behold then my full confession you have to do now with criminalsor may i say adventurers we have we three to dispose of secretly a very large amount of precious stones i have come to you for advice the ordinary avenues of sale are closed to us how can we get into touch with some one who will buy them and ask no questions aaron rodd was conscious of a little shock up to this last moment he had been doubtful notwithstanding the story which had been unfolded to him by harvey grimm he had clung to his first impressions impressions from which he was parting now with dire reluctance it is not an easy matter he admitted but if anyone can help you i can the girl nodded there must be secrecy she declared you see my brother is in a way notorious he has been very daring and very successful for the sake of those who buy them as well as for our own sake the jewels must not be recognised afterwards i have a friend who might arrange it aaron rodd announced i must warn you however that selling your stones in this way you cannot possibly receive their full value we do not expect that the old man mumbled what we want though is the moneyquickly my friend could doubtless manage that the lawyer declared when can we see him the girl asked eagerly at once was the prompt reply he was with me when you came and i sent him into my private apartments if it is your wish i will fetch him by all means the old man insisted eagerly yes yes the girl echoed aaron rodd rose to his feet and crossed the room to the door which led into his private apartment he opened it and beckoned to its unseen occupant i have some clients here who would like a word with you grimm he announced there may perhaps be some business harvey grimm made his appearance at once his air of curiosity as he looked into the room was very well done business he repeated this gentleman and young lady aaron rodd explained are clients of mine their names are unnecessary they have consulted me as to the disposal of valuable jewels their claim to whichmight be open to question harvey grimm threw the cigar which he had been smoking into the fireplace i see he murmured better tell me the circumstances the girl repeated her story with a few more details the old man listened in a sort of placid stupor he interrupted only once it is a foolish way this there is a man in amsterdam you will tell me what you advise monsieur the girl begged we must have money and the jewels must be made unrecognisable harvey grimm took a small magnifying glass from his pocket and screwed it together you have probably brought some of the stones with you he observed briskly the girl hesitated she turned to her companion as though for guidance he was still mumbling to himself however something about amsterdam it is absolutely essential harvey grimm continued that i should know something definite about the character of the stones you have to offerthat is if you wish me to deal with them there was a brief silence then the girl rose to her feet and deliberately turned away from the three men for several moments when she swung around again she held in her hand a small chamois leather bag very carefully she opened and shook out its contents into the palm of harvey grimms outstretched hand the large one she said simply belonged to an american millionaire my brother says that it is worth twenty thousand pounds he too is a wonderful judge of precious stones the old man seemed to wake up for a moment it is worth he faltered a kings ransom they all three bent over the little collection of jewels aaron rodds expression was one of simple curiosity his knowledge of diamonds was nil his partners manner on the other hand underwent a curious change there was a hard glitter in his eyes and unsuspected lines about his mouth the atmosphere of the little room had become charged with new forces the girls face was tense with excitement the old man seemed suddenly and subtly different do not waste time the former begged a little feverishly it is not safe to bring these jewels into the daylight even here if you will buy state your price give us an idea we can meet again perhaps harvey grimm turned towards them the small stones are negligible he pronounced the large stone is worth quite as much as you say to cut it up however and then sell it in a secret market is another thing the most you could hope for would be five thousand pounds the girls face was a little vague tell me she enquired in english money how much is that a year two hundred and fifty pounds so that if there were ten stones like that she went on a little wistfully that would be an income of two thousand two hundred and fifty pounds one could live comfortably on that one could hide somewhere in a quiet country place and live like gentlefolk certainly harvey grimm assured her she turned a little doubtfully towards her companion i am afraid she sighed that grandfather is almost past realising what money means in any case we must consult my brother then there came without warning an interruption which seemed equally startling to all of them without any preliminary summons the door of the office was thrown open the detective brodie followed by a man in plain clothes out with an unmistakably professional appearance entered the room the latter closed the door behind him brodie approached the little group the girls eyes were lit with terror harvey grimm dropped his handkerchief over the jewels whilst his partner stepped forward aaron rodds tone was harsh with anxiety his face seemed more drawn than ever what do you want here he demanded mr brodie smiled tolerantly his eyes were fixed upon the table he pushed the questioner on one side and lifted the handkerchief which harvey grimm had thrown over the diamonds then he turned towards his companion with a little cry of triumph that he declared pointing to the jewel upon the table is one of the van hutten diamonds i do not understand the girl said quietly enough although she was shaking from head to foot it belongs to us it is the property of cut it out brodie interrupted brusquely well talk to you young lady at police headquarters the girl turned to aaron rodd who is this man and what does he want she cried is this a trap into which you have drawn us is it a crime here in england then to offer jewels for sale well talk this all out at the police station brodie intervened curtly inspector the man in plain clothes stepped forward and took command of the situation my instructions are he announced politely to ask you both to come with me to the policestation the old gentleman simply looked dazed he rose to his feet obediently and turned towards the girl she patted his arm reassuringly but there was a look in her face which brought a sob into aaron rodds throat he was filled all the time with a silent fury he cursed the moment which had taken him into the embankment gardens which had brought harvey grimm once more into his life the single look which the girl had flashed upon him was like a dagger in his heart brodie had replaced the diamonds one by one in the little bag he handed them over to his companion and motioned them all towards the door the old gentleman moved wearily along leaning upon his granddaughters arm aaron rodd hurried forward and opened the door he tried to say something but the girl turned from him contemptuously he stood on the threshold listening to their slow footsteps as they descended into the street then he swung back into the room slammed the door and sank into the chair in front of his desk it was as though he had passed through some terrible nightmare he sat gazing out through the shadows had it all really happened then he caught a faint unfamiliar breath of perfume which suddenly set his heart beating with unaccustomed vigour a little morsel of white lace lay underneath the chair upon which she had been seated he stooped and picked it up smoothed it out and let it slip from his fingers almost in despair it was all true then she had sat in that chair had come to his office trusting him had walked into the harveygrimmcumbrodie trap it was an hour or more before harvey grimm returned he closed the door after him and came briskly across the floor well young fellow he exclaimed you cant say that i havent fished you out of the backwaters i wish to god youd left me there was the bitter reply tell me whats happened to her to heroh the young lady harvey grimm murmured with an illuminating smile shes all right shes back at the milan by this time they couldnt identify the diamond then aaron rodd asked eagerly not by a long chalk was the smiling reply to tell you the truth brodies about the sickest man in london just now the stone he rolled out in front of the expert they had waiting down at scotland yard was was what a lump of paste harvey grimm declared lighting a cigarette queer business eh theres no charge against the old gentleman and his granddaughter then aaron rodd demanded breathlessly none whatever why not try a cigarette aaron youre all nerves the lawyer pushed the box away from him you may think this sort of things worth while he declared gloomily i cant say that i do therell be no reward to share and it seems to me that weve made an enemy theres no reward harvey grimm agreed but theres this he drew his handkerchief from his pocket a diamond almost as large as a cobnut rolled over and lay upon the desk aaron rodd stared at it in amazement whats that he demanded one of the van hutten diamonds was the triumphant reply look at it well you wont see it again by this time tomorrow it will have been cut aaron rodd was stupefied he looked from the stone up to his companions face even his demand for some elucidation was mute i had the duplicate ready harvey grimm explained that was my game i changed them underneath my handkerchief it was perfectly easy theyve got the imitation one at police headquarters and they arent feeling particularly pleased with themselves that fellow brodie is about the bummest detective who ever crossed the atlantic aaron rodd was sitting transfixed his fingers were shaking as they beat upon the desk my god he exclaimed as light streamed in upon him were thieves dont talk like a fool the other admonished its a fair enough game between crooks weve stolen a stolen jewel and by doing it weve saved the girl and her grandfather and her brother too from gaol thats fair dos isnt it when ive finished with that therell be a matter of three or four thousand pounds for us to divide what about it eh he swept the jewel back into his pocket aaron rodds fingers were still idly beating upon the desk the walls of his dusty bare apartment had fallen away the thrall of his sordid poverty lay no longer like a dead weight upon his spirits three or four thousand pounds to divide what you need harvey grimm declared briskly handing him his hat is a drink come right along chapter ii poetry by compulsion mr paul brodie walked unannounced into aaron rodds office a matter of ten days after the episode of the changed diamond he had lost a little of his bombast and he carried himself with less than his usual confidence his eyes however had lost none of their old inquisitive fire he was perfectly aware even as he greeted the two men who rose to welcome him that aaron rodd was wearing a new suit of clothes that the office had been springcleaned that the box of cigarettes upon the desk were of an expensive brand and that the violets in the buttonhole of harvey grimms immaculate coat had come from a bond street florist good morning gentlemen he said airily subsiding into the chair which the latter had vacated for him nice little trio of conspirators we are eh harvey grimm shrugged his shoulders its rough on you he admittedgives you kind of a twist of course with the policebut i cant see any sense in the thing yet they werent meaning to trade off that bit of paste on a diamond expert surely the detective scratched his chin that bit of paste he declared was all they had on them anyway seems as though they hadnt quite sized you upyou and mr rodd hereand were paying you a test visit gee theyre clever you had them searched i suppose the other enquired to be sure they hadnt the real goods with them you bet the detective assented gloomily made it all the worse for us afterwards i tell you i darent show my face at scotland yard these days harvey grimm nodded sympathetically still they must know that these people arent what they profess to be he observed thats all very well brodie agreed but every one goes about with kid gloves on in this country thats why i threw up my job and went over to the states even a criminal a known criminal has got to be treated as though he were a little god almighty until the charge is right there and the proof lying handy i spent last night with inspector ditchwater hes as sure as i am that the young man is no other than jeremiah sands but hed sooner let him slip through his fingers than take a risk how does it come about then aaron rodd asked quietly that a famous diamond thief is wearing the uniform of a belgian officer that he is decorated and wounded simple as possible brodie explained we knew perfectly well that jeremiah sands was a belgian that little fact had been in every description of him thats ever been issued he chucked his little enterprises in new york the moment war was declared and sailed for europe bringing the loot with him he was as clever as paint though he played the old game of sending a double to chicago and he was in belgium before we knew the truth there from what we gather he handed over the stuff to the old man and his sister and took up his soldiering job the worst of it is hes covered up his traces so well that we havent a chance unless we can catch him or one of the three with the goods meanwhile there he is less than a quarter of a mile away with half a million of loot under his nose theres a reward of twentyfive thousand dollars for his apprehension and here we three men sit needing the money and pretty well powerless i wouldnt go so far as that harvey grimm said quietly i dont fancy youve come to the end of your tether yet brodie the detective knocked the ash from his cigar and rose to his feet well he admitted i aint giving up sure all the same this little failure has made things difficult for me if i put my head in at headquarters and whisper jeremiah sands theyre down my throat i just looked in to see how you boys were he added theyll have tumbled to you both now so im afraid the games off so far as you are concerned so long see you round at the milan about cocktail time harvey eh mr brodie took his leave with more expressions of cordiality aaron rodd closed the door carefully after him and came back into the room for several moments neither of the two men spoke harvey grimm carefully selected a cigarette and lit it then he walked to the door opened it and peered down the stairs too damned amiable he muttered as he returned to his place did you see the way he peered around you have brightened things up a bit aaron i havent done more than was absolutely necessary the young lawyer protested the place was simply filthy harvey grimm suddenly burst into a hearty laugh and slapped his knee thats all right old fellow he declared it dont matter a snap of the fingers that chap brodie does get me though a baby could see through him hes got just sense enough to believe that we pinched the diamondthats why hes been round here it just dont matter a damn aaron what he suspects that diamond doesnt exist any longer neither our friends whom weerrelieved of its incriminating possession nor paul brodie will ever see that stone again lets lunch aaron rodd reached for his hat and followed his friend out into the street at the end of the little dingy thoroughfare as they made their way up towards the strand harvey grimm paused abruptly in front of what seemed to be a small bookshop there were only one or two volumes in the window of what seemed to be editions de luxe of some unknown work there was a single modern engraving and a watercolour of futurist propensities for background harvey grimm eyed these treasures appreciatively this place pleases me he announced it has an air of its own we will spend a few minutes here the two men entered and looked about them a little bewildered by their surroundings they seemed to have stepped into a small and feminine sittingroom the walls of which were hung with watercolours of unusual subjects and colouring there was a little pile of papercovered volumes upon the table a young lady of sombre and uncertain appearance came forward and harvey grimm promptly removed his hat we have perhaps made a mistake he observed tentatively from the exterior appearance of your establishment i gathered that we might possibly be able to procure here something unusual in the way of literature in a small way i am a collector of old books we are entirely modern here the young woman replied i can show you handmade pottery or the watercolours of a young futurist artist or i can offer you the poetical works of one or two of our most modern poets secondhand books or objets dart we do not deal in we consider she concluded that modernity absolute modernity is the proper cult harvey grimm fanned himself for a moment with his hat his companion was gazing with his mouth a little open at a picture upon the wall which appeared to him to represent the bursting of a ripe tomato upon a crazy landscape an impression of war the young woman remarked following his gaze a wonderful piece of work by a young futurist painter harvey grimm studied it for a moment through his eyeglass and coughed he turned back to the table and picked up a papercovered volume poetry he murmured is one of my great solaces have you met with the work of stephen cresswell the young woman enquired almost solemnly harvey grimm repeated the name several times for the moment he confessed eightpence the girl interrupted depositing one of the papercovered volumes in his hand perhaps your friend would like one too i can promise you that when you have read cresswells spring lyrics you will find all victorian poetry anmic harvey grimm handed a copy to his companion laid down two shillings and pocketed the eightpence change a little diffidently you would perhaps like to look around the young lady suggested she vanished into an inner room almost at that moment the door leading into the street was violently opened and a young man of somewhat surprising appearance abruptly entered he was over six feet in height he wore a flannel shirt and collar much the worse for wear a brown tweed coat from which every button was missing and through an old pair of patent boots came an unashamed and very evident toe the two visitors stared at him in amazement the young mans eyes from the moment of his entrance were fixed upon the paper volume which harvey grimm was carrying sir he enquired am i to conclude that you have purchased a copythe copy of poems you hold in your hand i have just done so harvey grimm admitted also my friend the young man pushed past him towards the inner room bertha he exclaimed loudly eightpence please you have sold two copies of my poems the eightpence there was a momentary silence and then the clinking of coins the young man reappeared and made for the door with an air of determination in his face harvey grimm tapped him on the shoulder sir he said forgive me if i take a liberty but am i right in presuming that you are the author of this volume i am was the prompt reply and i am going to have a drink one moment if you please his questioner begged this you must remember is an impertinent age modernity demands it are you not also hungry ravenous mr stephen cresswell confessed but what can one do with eightpence you will join my friend and myself harvey grimm declared firmly we are going to take a chop the young mans tongue seemed to wander around the outside of his lips a chop he repeated absently at a neighbouring grillroom harvey grimm went on come i have bought two copies of your poems i have a claim for your consideration do i understand the young man asked that you will pay for the chop that will be my privilege was the prompt assertion you are doubtless mad the poet observed but you are probably opulent let us hurry they left the place and crossed the street the young man in the middle aaron rodd was speechless his eyes seemed fascinated by the deficiencies of their new friends toilet a fact of which he himself seemed sublimely unconscious harvey grimm however proceeded to make a delicate allusion to the matter some little accident i gather he remarked has happenedforgive my noticing itto your right shoe the poet glanced carelessly downwards it occurred this morning he sighed to tell you the truth i had scarcely noticed it there was a green streak in the sunrise i hastened harvey grimm had paused in front of a boot shop this place he said firmly will do as well as another why not the young man agreed entering promptly seating himself upon the nearest vacant chair and holding out his foot something light he begged you will observe that my foot is long and narrow the shopman withdrew the tattered remnants of shoes and stared in amazement at his prospective customers bare feet the latter held out his hand for a cigarette and tapped it against the side of harvey grimms case it appears to me he continued gazing at his mudstained feet that i came out without socks the sunrise again however it is a deficiency which i perceive that you are in a position to remedy he selected without embarrassment a pair of socks and shoes and was perfectly willing to don a tie which they purchased from a small haberdashers shop at the end of the street that affair disposed of however he became quite firm the affair of the chop he insisted we are there harvey grimm interrupted leading him to an hotel grillroom the young man paused before the large open grid and carefully indicated the chop which he considered suitable for his consumption he then seated himself opposite his two friends and expressed himself in favour of a mixed vermouth a very pleasing encounter this he declared drawing the eightpence from his pocket and looking at it thoughtfully may i ask sir whether you are acquainted with my poems not yet harvey grimm confessed your purchase then was accidental entirely his patron explained my friend and i are adventurers we seek the unusual the appearance of the shop where we met you attracted us the young lady to whom we addressed some enquiries tendered us a copy of your verses the young man sighed it is a scandalous thing he said to be published in paper covers at eightpencefourpence to the author so you are adventurers you mean by that thieves sir aaron rodd interrupted i am a solicitor my ignorance the young man declared is amazing but that i presume is a legalised form of robbery i am one of the few persons in the world who give value for the money i earn i produce create if only ten thousand people in the city were to pay eightpence for a copy of my works i should be affluent as you two are i should lunch here every day and drink burgundy then in a very short time harvey grimm reminded him you would cease to write poetry his protg shook his head a wellnurtured body is an incentive to poetic thought he insisted there is a richness of imagery which comes with afterdinner composing a sort of mental starvation an anmic scantiness of similes which follows the fruit luncheon and cold water of necessity adventurers gentlemen are you that is to say you are people with wits tell me thenbring me an idea from the practical worldhow shall i make ten thousand people buy a copy of my poems come thats an interesting problem harvey grimm declared of course if one were to answer you in a single word that one would be advertisement if i could write my name across the heavens or flash it from a million lights through the clouds the young man remarked i would do so but these things call for either miraculous powers or money i have neither your case harvey grimm promised shall have our attention my friends and mine in the meantime the moment seems opportune pending the arrival of our chops for a glance at your work permit me the poetaster crossed his legs leaned back in his chair thrust an eyeglass into his eye and turned over the pages of the paper volume which he had been carrying aaron rodd followed his example the poet entirely unembarrassed eyed hungrily each covered dish which passed at the arrival of the meal harvey grimm solemnly pocketed his book and replaced his eyeglass aaron rodd went on reading for a moment then he glanced surreptitiously at their guest and laid his volume face downwards upon the table your poems i perceive harvey grimm observed as he helped himself to a potato are not written for the man in the street they are written the poet declared falling hungrily upon his chop for any one who will pay eightpence for them conversation faded away it was not until the service of coffee and cigars that anything more than disjointed words were spoken the young mans face was still colourless but his eyes were less hard he took out his pencil and toyed for a moment with the menu some little trifle he suggested commemorative of the occasion i would rather harvey grimm confessed think out some scheme for advertising your work theres a little thing here about a lame busman any scheme you suggest the young man assented dreamily i frankly admit that the dispersal of my productions is a matter in which i have failed the appreciative few may have purchased but the man of the day passes on ignorant of the great need he really has of poetry ten thousand copies of my poems sold in london would produce at once a more gracious spirit you would observe a difference in the deportment the speech the greater altruism of the multitude how shall i force my works into their hands and their eightpences into my pocket fourpence only aaron rodd reminded him the publishers get half in the event of a large circulation the poet pointed out with a wave of the hand better terms might be arrived at you as a legal man can appreciate that possibility there is only one idea which occurs to me harvey grimm declared after a brief pause come and we will make an experiment they marched out into the streets and walked solemnly along towards leicester square suddenly harvey grimm stopped short and accosted a small greyhaired man who was carrying a bag and walking quickly i beg your pardon sir the former began what is it the little man demanded harvey grimm took him gently by the lapel of his coat the little man seemed too surprised to resist i want the privilege of a few minutes conversation with you harvey grimm continued you are one of the uneducated ten thousand who on behalf of my friend here stephen cresswell the great poet i am anxious to reach have you read cresswells poems i am in a hurry the little man insisted gazing at his interlocutor in a bewildered manner and struggling to escape the whole world is in a hurry harvey grimm observed drawing the paper volume from his pocket with the other hand this volume of poems will cost you eightpence it will bring relief to its impoverished author you yourself will become an enlightened i wish youd let me go the little man protested angrily i dont know you and i dont want to stand about the streets talking to a stranger let me go or ill call a policeman a policeman can afford you no assistance harvey grimm assured him i shall remain polite but insistent you will buy this volume of poems for eightpence or or what his victim demanded harvey grimm leaned down and whispered in his ear the little mans hand shot into his pocket he produced sixpence and two coppers snatched at the book and hurried off the victor in this little rencontre turned to his companions with an air of triumph and handed the eightpence to the poet who immediately pocketed it the whole problem is solved he declared you are a great man sir the poet exclaimed grasping him by the hand but what was it you whispered in his ear i simply told him harvey grimm said blandly that i should biff him one the cost of a new hat is ten and sixpence the price of your poems is eightpence you are a great man sir the poet repeated heartily watch the newspapers with a bunch of early violets in his buttonhole neatly and correctly dressed from the crown of his hat to his patent boots mr harvey grimm one morning about a fortnight later turned down the narrow street which led to his friend aaron rodds office he took a few steps and paused in surprise a little crowd encumbered the pavement in front of him there were at least half a dozen taxicabs waiting by the side of the pavement a printers van was busy unloading a constant procession consisting chiefly of elderly and middleaged men were entering and leaving the little bookshop waiting his turn harvey grimm stepped in the whole of the central table was taken up by great piles of a little papercovered volume recognisable at once as the poetical works of stephen cresswell and as fast as the flow of customers could be served they departed with one or more copies in their pockets the young lady whose hair was more untidy than ever and who wore a stupefied air doled them out in dolllike and mechanical fashion she had lost her air of superiority she pointed no longer to the sketches upon the walls or the pottery beyond she behaved like a dazed automaton now and then harvey grimm could hear her reply to enquiries there will be a cloth edition of mr cresswells works out in a few days she said the printers have promised them by the end of the week in the background were two very obvious newspaper men waiting so far unsuccessfully to get in a word with her mr harvey grimm elbowed his way by some means or other into the line paid his eightpence and retired into the recesses of the little suite of rooms beyond for a moments breathingspace a rush of at least a dozen old gentlemen had made exit temporarily impossible as he stood and watched the scene he was conscious of a fashionably dressed young man lounging in an easy chair a few yards away the young man suddenly arose my benefactor he cried harvey grimm gripped his copy of poems tightly and held it up pax he exclaimed i have one the poet smiled wearily he drew his erstwhile patron a little further back into the most retired portion of the premises listen he said this has been the most stupendous the most colossal joke of the day on the first night i sandbagged a wholesale provision merchant who admitted that he had never read my poems and he wrote to the times the next morning i made myself objectionable to seven others the following night they too made various complaints after that i retiredtheir description of my identity was becoming embarrassing mr harvey grimm was a little puzzled but the thing has been going on right up till last night he declared the papers for days have been a source of joy to me after the first few nights the young man explained i was compelled to engage substitutes i have acquaintances whose life has been spentshall we say on the fringe of things with their aid i made the acquaintance of various professional gentlemen from the east end who for a suitable remuneration took up this business with avidity they were of all sizes and they operated in all localities choosing their victims so far as possible with discretion there was but one questionhave you read the poems of stephen cresswellgenerally a bewildered negative and then biff the people began frantically to enquire who was stephen cresswell where were his poems to be obtained people who had the slightest pretensions to literary knowledge were assailed with questions punch i saw punch mr harvey grimm interrupted very clever then the stream began the young man continued i can assure you that from the opening time till dark this place is mobbed you see on the third night a confederate was saved from an imaginary assault by promptly producing a copy of my poems he wrote to the paper in mock indignation but describing his escape then the rush began eleven thousand copies have been sold some at a premium eleven thousand fourpences have found their way into my pocket a moroccobound and vellumcovered edition are waiting in the press for one thing and that the name of my benefactor i wish to dedicate the third fourth and fifth editions of my poems to you the young man declared grandiloquently mr harvey grimm pondered it is an immense compliment he acknowledged we will talk of it in the meantime the poet went on listen the curse of these days is jealousy and imitation a young man of worthy upbringing but wholly ignorant of art who perpetrated the daubs which you see upon the walls here was struck with my success only last thursday an elderly gentleman such a one as might have been selected by my own employs was stopped in hampstead and asked whether he had seen the sketches of sidney wentworth displayed in manchester street adelphi the fool admitted that he had never heard of them and down he went i ask you sir was there ever a more flagrant case of spoiling a mans market from the moment this absurd affair was reported public feeling has begun to change curiously enough there has been very small resentment even on the part of those who have suffered slight pains in the cause of art as to my methods now however that the idea has commenced to spread that such means are becoming a regular curriculum of the advertiser i have noticed distinct expressions of indignation in plain words i can see the end coming nothing lasts mr harvey grimm pointed out and you must admit youve had a run for your money ive had more than that sir the poet admitted i am established many of the leading periodicals of the day including titbits and the london mail have invited me to contribute to their pages the society of authors has made me a tempting proposition to join their ranks you may look upon me sir as a man whose future is now assured i am delighted to hear it mr harvey grimm declared heartily i fear i must now be getting on the young man took down his hat possessed himself of a pair of expensive doeskin gloves and a silvertopped cane i will let you out by the back way he suggested it is my desire to accompany you i am going to call upon a friend in the neighbourhood harvey grimm remarked the friend with whom i met you first the same i shall accompany you the young man announced cautiously opening a side door and peering up and down a stoneflagged passage the way is clear sir come with me they sallied out and found themselves in the street the young man gripped the arm of his companion for the moment he confessed i am weary of poetry i seek life you are an adventurer you have told me i shall link my fortune with yours you have a brain sir enterprise and i should imagine that you are untrammelled by the modern conscience i am in the same position poetry is affording me for some time at least the means of sustenance let us go together a little further afield the older man looked his companion up and down he was a strong wellbuilt young fellow and the hollows of his cheeks had already filled out notwithstanding his mannerisms he was without doubt a young man of resolution we will see harvey grimm suggested what aaron rodd has to say about it i like your friends name the young man declared solemnly i am sure that he will accept me as a comrade they trod the few remaining yards of pavement ascended the stone stairs and after a preliminary knock at the door harvey grimm exercising the privilege of familiarity turned the handle and stepped inside followed by his companion for a single moment neither of them spoke harvey grimms first conscious action was to close the door behind him then they stood inside the apartment transfixed around them was a scene of the wildest disorder the linoleum had been torn up and thrown into a corner planks had been torn bodily from the floor the cupboards stood open and their contents were thrown right and left the little row of tin boxes stood on their sides and masses of dusty parchment littered the whole place seated in his chair before the desk was aaron rodd with a gag in his mouth his arms bound behind him his legs tied together his face was livid his eyes half closed he showed no signs of life at their coming the poet produced a knife we must set him free he said his companion subconsciously amazed at the young mans initiative followed him to the desk methodically the latter having removed the gag from aaron rodds mouth cut the bonds which held him one by one harvey grimm produced a small brandy flask and held it to his lips the poet threw open a window and swung the chair round aaron rodd groaned he is coming to cresswell remarked hopefully he caught up a sheaf of newspapers and fanned the swooning man vigorously then he suddenly paused harvey grimm followed the direction of his gaze a sheet of violetcoloured notepaper was pinned upon the desk the poet sniffed what a delicious odour he murmured and how familiar they both approached a little nearer the sheet of notepaper fluttering a little in the breeze which streamed through the window gave out the subtlest and most delicate perfume a perfume which seemed like a waft from a field of violets carried on a west wind there were only a few words written in a delicate feminine handwriting should there not be honour even amongst thieves the young man struck a theatrical attitude fate has sent me to join you he declared waving his hand towards the sheet of violetcoloured paper i recognise the handwriting i know well the perfume i can tell you who wrote that note chapter iii an alliance of thieves aaron rodd was walking along the to him unfamiliar thoroughfare of bond street when he was suddenly confronted with a vision a large limousine motorcar was drawn up just in front of him an elderly lady with white hair leaning upon the arm of a powdered footman crossed the pavement followed by a girl who was smothered in sables carried a small dog under her arm and wore a great bunch of violets partially concealed by her furs aaron rodds abrupt pause was not one of politeness alone with an eagerness which took no account of manners or discretion he gazed at the girl openeyed openmouthed blankly unashamed if anything were left to complete his bewilderment it was the little smile upon her lips as she met his eyes good afternoon mr aaron rodd she murmured as she passed she disappeared through the swing doors of the shop aaron stared after her as though expecting a backward glance stared at the very handsome motorcar at what appeared to be a coronet upon the panel at the imperturbable expression of the powdered footman standing with a rug over his arm looking into vacancy then he limped on a few feet and devoted himself to an absorbed contemplation of some japanese trifles in a curio shop he lost count of time in his firm determination to await her return as a matter of fact it was only a few minutes before he was conscious of her reappearance she hesitated for a moment on the threshold of the shop shook her head at the footman who was already opening the door of the car and approached aaron rodd he turned abruptly from the window and greeted her with grave politeness she glanced at his left arm still in a sling at the heavy walkingstick by which he supported himself good afternoon mr rodd she said you have met perhaps with a little accident it is so your friends were a little rough he replied i shall be annoyed with them she promised you received my message certainly he replied on the whole i agree with you she shrugged her shoulders and what are you doing in bond street she asked him i am on my way to meet my friend harvey grimm she nodded that is your clever confederate who stole our diamond she remarked suavely a very fortunate circumstance for you he ventured to remind her if that stonethe real one i meanhad been discovered in your possession at the policestation i fancy that your position in this country would have become a little difficult oh la la she laughed you should have seen the face of mr brodie though when they examined the imitation stone i do not think that the english police are pleased with him they were very kind to my grandfather and me nevertheless he advised if i were your brother i think that i would keep away from london just now and why aaron rodd glanced up and down the pavement to be sure that there were no listeners that fellow brodie is not such a fool as he seems he declared he has made one mistake i do not think that he is likely to make another she laughed if it is to be a duel of wits she murmured between leopold and mr brodie do you know i believe that leopold will win there is such a thing as overconfidence he reminded her i have so many ways she told him with twinkling eyes of diverting these people from the scent do you recognise the old lady upon whom i am in attendance today the old lady who went with me into that shop i have not that pleasure he replied grimly is she one of the gang she is a royal princessthe princess augusta if you do not believe me look in this weeks tatler and you will see her pictureperhaps mine you are a very funny man mr aaron rodd and you have treated us very badly indeed but i like youyes i like you quite well how much money did you get for that stone you stole from us the colour mounted mercilessly to his temples he seemed suddenly bereft of words do not be foolish she continued quickly really as you know i am an adventuress myself and i rather admire you both i think that we ought to make friends you could be of great service to us there is no need for us to quarrel because you have had the best of this first little exchange what do you say to that my friend aaron rodd found himself and became once more a man he looked her squarely in the eyes i would rather be friends with you he said than any one in the world for a moment the triumph was his it was she who was almost embarrassed by his directness then intervention came ah she exclaimed the princess au revoir she stepped lightly away from him with a little nod of farewell the footman stood bareheaded as he opened the door of the car one of the principals of the establishment which the greyhaired lady had just quitted stood bowing upon the pavement in the face of all this the girl turned deliberately around and waved her hand as the car drove off aaron rodd limped down bond street called for a taxi and drove to the milan court his two auditors listened to aaron rodds story with varying expressionsthe poet with pleased and affable sympathy harvey grimm on the other hand with obvious irritation they were seated in a corner of the smokeroom and the latter at once despatched a waiter for a copy of the tatler when it arrived they all three pored over one of the leading illustrations there was no doubt whatever in the minds of any of the three men as to the identity of the girl who was depicted as being amongst the ladiesinwaiting of a royal personage that the poet declared is a young lady whose name is henriette de floge she has an underhand service at badminton and she wants to learn to be a futurist she attended a class last year organised by an artist friend of mine in chelsea ye gods that without a single doubt aaron rodd assented laying his forefinger upon the illustration is the young lady who was in attendance this afternoon upon the princess augusta and it is equally and absolutely and conclusively certain harvey grimm pronounced that she came to manchester street adelphi as the confederate of jeremiah sands who the poet asked eagerly is jeremiah sands i like the name jeremiah sands harvey grimm told him is the head and brains of the smallest but most formidable band of criminals who have ever succeeded in eluding justice for nearly ten years there is a reward of twentyfive thousand dollars for his arrest in america and he is wanted in most of the capitals of europe he has a dozen aliases and a score of personalities this much about him is certain he is either of belgian or french birth he is a young man and he has spent the greater part of the last seven years in america the universal excuse given by the police of every country for their failure to apprehend him is that for at any rate the last five years he has simply accumulated his booty and has made no effort to dispose of it as you know most of the thieves of the world are traced backwards through the receiver of stolen goods his last exploit in new york was the theft of the van hutten jewels it was without a doubt one of those diamonds which was mislaid in aaron rodds office and it was one of jeremiah sands agents who paid our friend here that last domiciliary visit in search of it what by the by became of that diamond the poet enquired we are living upon it mr harvey grimm confessed the poet sighed enviously it is a beautiful existence he declared when are we going to embark upon another adventure of the sort the aftermath of the last one is still enveloping us mr harvey grimm reminded him there is scotland yard who have seen the imitation stone and who suspect us of changing it then there is mr jeremiah sands who knows that we did and who is only just beginning to realise that we have been clever enough to dispose of it finally there is mr brodie the amateur detective who has the same idea and who is furious with us for letting him down with the authorities between the three you see our position is a little difficult personally i am much interested in our friend aarons account of his conversation with the young lady her suggestion of some measure of alliance appeals to me and me the poet agreed let us approach them at once i should like to come into contact with this jeremiah sands there was a brief interval whilst a waiter deposited before them a tray of cocktails subtly ordered by the poet by means of sundry evolutions with his forefinger afterwards mr harvey grimm sat for a few moments in silence smoothing out his immaculate doeskin gloves listen he said presently after a cautious glance around the room i will tell you my impressions jeremiah sands has never been caught for two reasonsfirst because he has stored up all his booty and has never been in the hands of the receivers secondly because he has hidingplaces in every capital of europe all of them safer than london or new york at the present moment he is like a rabbit which has been ferreted out of its hole europe is suddenly closed to him he has been driven to london he is ill at ease here he has lost many of his agents to maintain his belgian nationality he has been forced into the army the perfect machinery of his wonderful system must be seriously dislocated the time too has probably arrived when he finds it necessary to dispose of some of his plunder let us offer him a tentative amity aaron rodd frowned do you think that he would trust us after that last little affair i dont mind being the thief or the thiefcatcher he added bluntly but i rather hate being the third party the only party we have to consider is ourselves harvey grimm replied deliberately to tell you the truth i fear that we have lost the confidence of paul brodie i am not sure whether it would be worth our while to try and regain it the sharing of rewards is a poor game i would rather hear what jeremiah sands has to say he took up his pencil and scrawled a few lines across a half sheet of notepaper they both looked over his shoulder if the young lady with violets would like to resume her conversation with a certain person in bond street this morning please reply in fridays telegraph i propose mr harvey grimm explained to insert this in tomorrow mornings telegraph to send a copy to mr brinnen and await results brilliant the poet exclaimed it gives the proper flavour to the whole thing but why not write a note and send it up by the waiter mr harvey grimm smiled my young friend he said you are an adventurer of the bulldog type let me tell you this i happen to know it to be a fact from the moment when mr paul brodie communicated his suspicions as to our friends to scotland yard their every movement and without doubt their correspondence has been closely watched i will guarantee to you that not a letter is delivered to either captain leopold brinnen to mr brinnen or to the young lady which does not run a very considerable risk of being opened the poet listened with a pleased smile i like the flavour of this sort of thing he acknowledged let us insert the advertisement by all means if the young lady suggests a meeting i shall recommend myself as the most suitable person to keep the appointment soon after midday two mornings later mr stephen cresswell entered the smokingroom at the milan he was carrying a daily telegraph under his arm he wore a bunch of violets in his buttonhole and he was dressed with great care he approached the table where harvey grimm and aaron rodd were awaiting him you too have seen the answer to our advertisement he exclaimed capital we were just now discussing it harvey grimm assented the poet sat down made signs to the waiter hitched up his trousers and made himself thoroughly comfortable i have decided he announced that i am the proper person to entertain the young lady harvey grimm nodded thoughtfully tell us through what channel of thought my young friend you have arrived at that conclusion he begged the poet straightened his tie there was no doubt that he was a remarkably goodlooking young man i am a modest person he said but it is useless to deny that nature has been kind to me then too there is a peculiar and romantic importance attached to the successful poet whose reputation has been enhanced in so singular a fashion the young lady will be interested in me from the start she will be proud to remember that we are old acquaintances and she will treat me with greater confidence than any ordinary person harvey grimm lit a cigarette deliberately aaron rodds heavy eyebrows seemed to have contracted a little why are you so sure that it will be the young lady who will keep the appointment the former enquired stephen cresswell placed his forefinger upon the advertisement in the paper which he had been carrying milan caf luncheon wednesday will discuss bond street that tells us nothing harvey grimm pointed out so far as the probabilities are concerned i should say that it is extremely unlikely that either the young lady or any of those associated with her will keep the appointment any negotiations we may have will probably be conducted through a third party the poets face fell he ordered another cocktail brusquely how shall we know whom to look out for then he demanded the onus of recognition will rest with the others harvey grimm replied i have engaged a table just inside the door we shall take our places there before onefifteen and await the arrival of whoever may come in case it should be the young lady the poet persisted you would find that my previous acquaintance with her would be of immense service to us she would place confidence in me you shall be of the party harvey grimm promised i have ordered the table for five so as to be on the safe side i do not understand our friends selecting a place for a meeting but on the other hand there is a flavour of genius in such apparent recklessness if you are ready i think it is time that we made a start they strolled down to the caf and took their places at a table just inside the door at precisely a quarter past one a little tremor of excitement suddenly unloosed their tongues my god harvey grimm muttered they must be mad aaron rodd whispered in a hoarse undertone it is henriette de floge stephen cresswell murmured complacently you will perceive soon the advantage of my presence the girl approached their table smilingly she was followed by the young officer in belgian uniform the three men rose to their feet she smiled pleasantly at aaron rodd you have not yet met my brother have you she asked let me present captain leopold brinnenmr aaron rodd mr harvey grimm and she paused with her eyes fixed questioningly upon the poet the young officer had brought his heels together and bowed ceremoniously to the two men i am not i hope forgotten the poet observed my name is stephen cresswell i have had the pleasure of playing badminton with you in walter donnes studio she looked across at him with slightly upraised eyebrows the faint tracings of a somewhat insolent smile at the corners of her lips badminton is that an english game i perceive that i have a double i have not played it you are mademoiselle de floge the poet persisted she shook her head gently on the contrary she replied i am henriette brinnen leopold this is mr stephen cresswell they all took their places the poet a little heavily his stupefaction even though it proceeded from a different cause was only a little less profound than that of the other two mr harvey grimm took up the menu once more and gave a few murmured orders to the matre dhtel aaron rodd who was on her righthand side leaned towards the girl his face was almost haggard with anxiety forgive me he whispered but is this wise have you counted the cost of it i do not understand she answered a little vaguely you know that we are all watched he reminded her we thought it best even not to communicate with you direct you three are such droll men she laughed there is your nicelooking friend mr stephen cresswell who sits there and will not take his eyes off me he does not believe that he has never met me before and mr harvey grimmwell he does not seem a nervous person does he and just now he is almost pale and you tooyou speak with bated breath of risks and being watched how then do you carry through your great coups my friend have you not learnt the first axiom of the adventurerthere is nothing which dispels suspicion so readily as candour aaron rodd shrugged his shoulders and busied himself with the task of attending to his companions wants conversation around the little table became platitudinal the three men although they behaved in all respects reasonably were unable to keep their thoughts and attention from wandering continually towards their slim gravelooking young guest in his somewhat battered uniform who seemed chiefly engrossed with his luncheon it was hard to believe that he sat there in one of the bestknown restaurants in the world with a great price upon his head in some respects he was like his sister aaron rodd decided although there was a curious virility of expression which flashed sometimes into his features and a more calculating light in his hard clear eyes his mouth was unusually long straight and thin his cheekbones a little high one could believe that notwithstanding his inconsiderable stature his frame was like steel he spoke english very deliberately with now and then the slightest american accent but on the few occasions when he addressed his sister it seemed to be a relief for him to relapse into french it was not until the coffee was served that he leaned a little towards harvey grimm and dispelled by a few words the atmosphere of unreality which had somehow or other hovered over the little luncheonparty sir he proposed let us approach the object of this meeting with pleasure harvey grimm assented for some reason or other the young man continued my sister although as we know to our cost her acquaintance with you so far has not been altogether profitable has confidence in you let us speak frankly you gentlemen i believe are what is generally known as chevaliers dindustrie there was a sudden flush of colour in aaron rodds cheeks the poet who was a little sullen distinctly scowled only harvey grimm bowed placidly seemingly unconscious of the faint note of contempt in the others tone in the ordinary sense of the word that is true he admitted consider then our position the young man continued my grandfather and sister whom i meet again after an absence of some years owing to the haste with which they were compelled to leave belgium are almost penniless my ownsavings consist of perhaps half a million pounds worth of diamonds these jewels he went on knocking the ash from his cigarette have all been stolen they can only be disposed of in an irregular fashion that is to say the stones must be recut in normal times this problem would present no difficulties to me today when london is the only capital of europe open to us i must admit that i find myself in a difficult position the few artificers in this country are i understand well known and watched i am bound therefore to employ an agent under the peculiar circumstances to which i have alluded i cannot seek for an honest man i am prepared to make it worth the while of men such as yourselves to deal honestly with me my brother has your english gift of plain speech you see the girl whispered soothingly to aaron rodd the young officer lit a fresh cigarette and watched the smoke curl upward for a moment surely it is best he said softly these gentlemen are at the present moment living and living no doubt exceedingly well upon the proceeds of one of my diamonds they should not therefore be sensitive i may be allowed to remind you sir harvey grimm interrupted that incidentally the little artifice by means of which we secured it is responsible for your unhindered presence here today i take that fact into consideration leopold brinnen assented in the toleration with which i view the circumstance the point is are you willing to deal with me i am perfectly willing to do so sir harvey grimm replied i am willing too and so i am sure are my friends to take a certain amount of risk i may add that i am probably the only man in england who can dispose of your jewels so that they cannot be traced but before we proceed further let me ask you a question are you aware sir of your position there is an amateur detective here from new york named paul brodie who has no other object in life than to lay his hands upon a certain person scotland yard although just now they are a little fed up with mr brodie have very definite intentions with regard to the same person you are living here openly you are even flaunting your wellknown belgian uniform there are eyes upon us as we sit at this table there are eyes upon you and your sister and your grandfather from the moment you rise in the morning till the moment you retire at night your rooms are at all times subject or liable to be searched any place you might visit is liable to be searched let me ask you then a plain question more than any other quality i admire courage dont you think however that you are playing a little too near to the fire the young officer stroked his thin black moustache he had listened to harvey grimms words attentively he even indicated in the slow movement of his head some measure of approbation to all that you have said mr harvey grimm i can make you only one reply he said every step which i have taken in life has been carefully thought out the present position although necessity has here intervened to some extent has been subject to the same attentive consideration i am safer than you think let that be enough that i have friends is proved by the little visitation which was made upon mr aaron rodd the other day i offer you no apologies sir he continued bowing across the table it was part of the game when we thrust the law outside our lives as you have done and i then we must take our knocks philosophically for the future however even though we play the thieves game there is no reason why we should not play it honestly a very admirable sentiment the poet murmured to put this matter upon a business basis mr grimm captain brinnen continued supposing i supply you with a certain quantity of diamonds will you guarantee to have them cut as so to render them unrecognisable dispose of them hand me twothirds of the proceeds and retain a third yourself i have worked before upon those terms harvey grimm replied i accept them there is one little matter though to be cleared up captain brinnen smiled grimly i fancy that i follow you he observed you refer to the mysterious disappearance of a diamond from your friends office harvey grimm coughed bearing in mind as i took the liberty of pointing out a few minutes ago that its disappearance saved you from considerable inconvenience he began the affair is finished brinnen interrupted carry out faithfully the other transactions which we may arrange and we will adoptshall i say a resigned attitudewith regard to that incident when are you prepared to deal with the first parcel of stones at any moment harvey grimm promised you will bring them to me the girl who had been listening eagerly to their conversation leaned across the table i think she said that this time you had better come and fetch them mr grimm or better stillsend mr aaron rodd or me the poet suggested she shook her head it is to be mr aaron rodd she decided you will not be afraid she added turning towards him with a little smile at the corners of her lips where am i to come to and when he enquired she glanced at her brother then back again towards her neighbour i shall tell you presently she whispered the little party broke up shortly afterwards the hall outside where they lingered to make their adieux was unusually crowded harvey grimm felt a touch upon his elbow a pleasant luncheon i trust he frowned as he recognised brodie who was apparently waiting for a friend it was exactly the meeting which he had desired to avoid he greeted him however with his customary geniality lunching late arent you he observed brodie seemed scarcely to hear him his eyes were fixed upon the young belgian who with his arm in a sling was being helped carefully into his overcoat suddenly however he stretched out his arm laid it upon harvey grimms shoulder and drew him to within whispering distance see here harvey he muttered i dont know what game youre playing but if any man tries to boost me hes going to have a rough journey harvey grimm was shocked my dear fellow he began dont waste your breath the other interrupted as he turned away remember ive got my eye on you as well as our friend there it may be a waiting game but youll find me there at the finish sure as my names paul brodie he strode off towards the telephone booth harvey grimm found his hand gripped by his guest my sister and i thank you for a very excellent luncheon mr grimm captain brinnen said politely i trust that you will soon give us an opportunity of repaying your hospitality you will come to me the girl whispered in aaron rodds ear at number thirteen grosvenor square this afternoon at five oclock the poet was inclined to be peevish as the three men walked down the strand in this adventure he declared i do not see where i come in aaron rodd is to go and fetch the diamonds and probably have tea with the beautiful young lady who has changed her name and you he went on addressing harvey grimm thereupon vanish with the stones to your mysterious treasurehouse and return with the gold i am simply not in it i might as well not exist it is regrettable but true harvey grimm assented remember however that you are a selfinvited newcomer to our little circle a place shall be found for you presently i can promise you that the cycle of our adventures will not be ended with the realisation of jeremiah sands diamonds this affair unfortunately presents no opportunity for your activities i do not propose even to offer you more than a trifling share in the financial results financially the poet announced airily i am independent the taste for my poetry has spread like a forest fire there will be a trifle of mine by the by in the pall mall tonight dont forget to look out for it harvey grimm for once was unsympathetic look here he said stopping suddenly i wish youd forget your poetry for a few minutes there is just one way you can make yourself useful you saw a sleek podgy bulky fatfaced looking man with hair brushed back who spoke to me in the hall at the milan the poet nodded i remember he murmured wishing that you would allow me to edit your acquaintances that man harvey grimm continued was paul brodie an amateur detective he has set himself the task of bringing about the arrest of jeremiah sands he came to europe with that idea it was he who had the old gentleman and his daughter taken to the policestation from my rooms we have been working together but hes out with us now and he blames us for that fiasco i should like to know why he is still hanging about the milan court i will return there the poet promised i will endeavour to engage him in conversation harvey grimm smiled pityingly oh my ingenuous youth he murmured your ideas of tackling a detective are bright and engaging yet do your best the very imbecility of your methods may lead to success i should very much like to know where paul brodie is proposing to spend this afternoon cresswell nodded in mysterious fashion and left them harvey grimm passed his arm through his friends as they turned into the little street which led down to aarons rodds offices aaron he said earnestly if your little expedition this afternoon should by any chance involve you in any manner of trouble remember that theres one golden mottosilence you make a cult of it in private life if anything should happen to youdont depart from it at precisely the appointed hour aaron rodd was shown by a footman in deep black livery into a small but charminglyfurnished room in the largest house which he had ever entered on his way thither he had caught the sound of many voices laughing and talking the tinkling of teacups the scraping of a violin evidently some sort of reception was in progress for outside a canvas shelter was stretched to the curbstone and a long row of automobiles and carriages was in evidence it was almost ten minutes before the door was abruptly opened and henriette brinnen appeared she had changed her clothes since luncheon and was wearing a gown of some soft grey material and a large hat with black feathers in her hand she was carrying a small brown paper package sealed at both ends the little smile with which she welcomed him was bewildering i have kept you waiting she exclaimed and i must send you away again quickly believe me i am not always so inhospitable this afternoon as it happens madame is receiving and i must help her i would ask you to come and be presented but it is more important that you proceed swiftly with your mission of course he assented taking the parcel from her hand tell me first she begged keeping her fingers upon the closed door why were you so sad and silent all luncheontime he laughed a little hardly hesitated and was suddenly frank because he told her i have not yet got used to my new rle in life but it is amusing surely perhaps i am oldfashioned he sighed i rather resent being driven into the crooked ways you are thinking only of yourself then to be perfectly truthful he assured her i was thinking very little of myself i am afraid for you but why for me because you are reckless he answered your brother may be the cleverest adventurer who ever kept the police at arms length but there is always the risk you cannot go on playing a part for ever you may hide at the milan court and call yourself what you will and the chances are with you but to borrow some one elses identity to advertise yourself as the companion of a reigning princess to occupy a position of trust and favour in her household and help to receive her guests how long do you think that will go on she laughed at him but her eyes were full of kindness you speak only of my brothers cleverness she said is that because i am a woman let me assure you my dear friend in many ways i am his equal your fears are exaggerated i am right am i not when i assume that your present position is new to you it is aaron rodd confessed until these last few weeksuntil the day in fact when i first saw you in the embankment gardens and harvey grimm sauntered an hour later into my officei have lived miserably perhaps but honestly she laughed once more in his face oh but you are so foolish she murmured believe me no person is really honest we all live upon our neighbours there is only one thing in life which is common to all religionshonour by honour i mean fidelity to ones friends take that into your heart dear mr aaron rodd and you can hold your head as high as any mans on earth he stooped and kissed her fingers as she stood by the open door an action curiously enough which he had never contemplated in his life before in connection with any woman yet which seemed to him at that moment an entirely natural proceeding that at least he promised is something which i can hold on to he descended the stairs the clasp of her fingers still tingling on his was handed from the grave majordomo who guarded the hall to another servant and on to the footman who summoned a taxicab for him he gave the address of his office and was driven promptly off a few yards from the corner of the square however the taxicab slackened speed and stopped by the side of the pavement almost before he realised what was happening the door was opened an inspector in uniform and peaked cap let down the vacant seat and sat opposite to him mr paul brodie smoking a large cigar followed and took the place by his side the cab went on aaron rodd remained stonily silent the eyes of the two men were fixed upon the brown paper parcel which he had had no time to conceal sorry to take you out of your way mr rodd brodie said with ponderous sarcasm but we just want you to call for a moment at the marlborough street policestation in the meantime you wouldnt care to tell us i suppose what you have in that small parcel you are holding so carefully aaron rodd sat perfectly still a chain of wild ideas flashed through his brain only to be instantly dismissed he thought of throwing the parcel out of the window hurling himself upon the two men and making a fierce struggle for liberty there was something ignominious in the facility of his capture in the completeness of his failure yet he realised perfectly well that escape by any means was hopeless that behaviour of any sort incompatible with his supposed position would be an instant confession of guilt i am engaged on confidential business on behalf of a client he announced stiffly and i cannot conceive what authority you have to delay me or to ask me questions mr brodie nodded sympathetically thats perfectly correct he admitted perfectly correct not another word was spoken until the cab drew up outside the policestation mr brodie paid the taxicab driver and aaron rodd with an escort on either side of him crossed the pavement passed through the bare stone hall and into a small waitingroom a superintendent who was writing at a desk glanced up as they entered mr brodie leaned down and said a few words in his ear the former nodded and turned to aaron rodd have you any objection he asked to our examining the parcel which you are carrying none whatever aaron rodd answered coolly mr brodie took it from him and carried it to the desk the superintendent broke the seals and withdrew the lid from an oblong wooden jewellers box there was a mass of cottonwool inside which he hastily removed then his fingers suddenly stopped he gazed downwards and frowned mr brodies face was a study the imprecations which broke from his lips were transatlantic and sufficing aaron rodd emboldened by their consternation stepped forward and looked over their shoulders at the bottom of the box reposed a small black opal scarfpin the safetychain of which was broken the superintendent rose to his feet whispered something sharply to mr brodie who lapsed into a gloomy silence and turned to aaron rodd do you mind telling me where you were taking this box mr rodd he asked to a jewellers to have the pin mended was the prompt reply the superintendent replaced the wadding thrust the lid back along its grooves tied up the box and returned it to its owner we are very sorry to have interfered with your mission he said but before you leave us i am going to ask you so that we may be perfectly satisfied to allow me to search your person aaron rodd shrugged his shoulders pray do as you will he consented holding out his arms the superintendent went carefully through his pockets felt his clothing and returned to his place we are very sorry to have detained you sir he said the necessities of the law you know inspector get mr rodd another taxicab i know something about the law aaron rodd declared trying hard to feel that this was not some absurd nightmare and i still fail to realise on what possible authority you can practically arrest a solicitor leaving the house of an exceedingly distinguished client break the seals of a private packet and dismiss him without a word of explanation the superintendent glanced severely at mr brodie we are unfortunately in the position mr rodd he confessed of having been misled by false information we can do no more nor less than apologise our action mistaken though it seems to have been was undertaken in the interests of the law with the profession of which you are connected i hope therefore that you will be tolerant aaron rodd received his packet wished the three men a brief good afternoon and left the policestation he drove at once to his office where he found the poet reclining on three chairs drawn up to the window with a block of paper in his hand and a pipe in his mouth wheres harvey grimm aaron demanded the poet laid down his pencil and waved his hand gone gone where i have no idea was the bland reply i spent an hour or two at the milan conversing with several friends and incidentally looking out for mr brodie then an idea came to me i needed space and solitude i thought of your empty rooms and i hastened here if you would like to listen damn your poetry aaron rodd interrupted tell me what you mean when you say that harvey grimm has gone he was to have been waiting here for me as i left the milan the poet explained i enquired of the hallporter if mr harvey grimm had returned the man told me that not only had he returned but that he had left again in a taxicab a few minutes afterwards i understood the fellow to say that he had gone into the country and would not be back for several days aaron rodd put his hand to his forehead already a dim suspicion of the truth was finding its way into his brain then there was a gentle tinkle from the bell of his newly installed telephone he took up the receiver the voice which spoke was the voice of harvey grimm that you aaron yes anything happened yes its ok you neednt explain back in about a week so long aaron rodd laid down the receiver he was still a little bewildered oppressed by a certain sense of humiliation he threw the packet which he had been carrying so carefully upon his desk and scowled whats upset you cresswell asked amiably seems to me im nothing but a catspaw aaron rodd replied gloomily a messenger boy could have done my job dont worry the poet advised by the by you dont happen to know of a rhyme for silken do you the telephone bell ringing once more intervened to save the poet from the inkpot which aarons fingers were handling longingly what is it he demanded taking up the receiver just a little message for mr aaron rodd please was the soft reply please forgive meit was so necessary and the pin was for youa little peaceoffering will you please have the chain mended and wear it that was all there was no pause for any reply the connection was finished aaron laid down the receiver lit a cigarette and almost swaggered back to his desk sorry old fellow he said genially i cant seem to think of one for the moment ill have a try chapter iv ulysses of wapping on the following morning aaron rodd somewhat to his surprise received a visit from his only client mr jacob potts who was a publican and retired pugilist and whose appearance entirely coincided with his dual profession looked around the apartment with a little sniff ho he exclaimed better times arrived eh ad a springcleaning avent you telephone too and new chairs golly does it run to cigars aaron rodd shamelessly offered him a box of harvey grimms cabanas his client bit off the end of one with relish and seemed inclined to swallow it he eventually spat it out however lit the cigar and throwing himself back in a chair crossed his rather pudgy legs know anything about maritime law he began not much aaron rodd admitted a lawyer very seldom knows anything outside his little bent he went on we have great rows of books properly indexed turn up the point and read the decisions where are yourn mr jacob potts enquired looking around the somewhat bare walls pawned aaron rodd confessed all the same i can go into the law library and give you an answer on any point you like to put forward within a very few minutes mr potts nodded thats why i kind of took a fancy to you years ago when you was a nipper he confessed no doubling and twisting about you just a straightforward answer to a straightforward question do you know anything about maritime law sez i no sez you but i can find out and so you can now one of the regular kidney of you fellowsd have been messing about for half an hour and then have read it all out of a book you never tumbled to it yet guvnor did you what my new line of business was never aaron rodd acknowledged from your conversation at various times i gathered that you saved money in the ring acquired a prosperous publichouse property and were in some way or other responsible for the organisation of labour in your neighbourhood mr jacob potts grinned let it go at that he decided well the point i want to know about is this supposing in the course of business i committed an offence against the law you understand and i legs it for a nootral country you seemight be holland for instancecan i be auled off a dutch boat in nootral waters on my way to holland it would depend aaron rodd replied on the nature of your offence i will let you know your exact position if you like to come in a little later that goes mr potts agreed ive a call to make at a publichouse in craven street theres a promising lad there i saw with the gloves on for the first time in is life the other night i thought of making a match with im against canary joe ave you ever seen canary joe box i have never seen a boxing match in my life aaron rodd replied lumme mr jacob potts gasped well i suppose yours aint a sporting profession mine isin every sense of the word he added with a grin what about twelve oclock guvnor thatll give me time to get a can of beer and some bread and cheese i shall be quite ready for you at that time aaron rodd promised the expublican departed and aaron rodd after giving him time to get away followed him out into the street spent half an hour in the nearest law library and returned with a volume under his arm he found the poet seated on the top of the stairs outside his rooms my dear fellow the latter exclaimed peevishly as he rose to his feet this new habit of yours of locking the door after you is most inconvenient why not go to your club and wait aaron rodd suggested its only a few yards away inhospitable the other sighed and i have come to you filled with a most generous idea listen this may seem a commonplace thing to you but to me it is an epoch in my career i have opened a banking account i noticed that the bookshop was thronged as usual as i came by aaron rodd remarked this week the poet declared solemnly will practically sever my connection with the bookshop my publishers insist upon it that my work must be distributed in the regular fashion henceforth the poems of stephen cresswell will be on sale at every reputable booksellersat four and sixpence if you please i have also an agent and as i before remarked a banking account things have changed with me aaron rodd only yesterday i found myself in need of a tenpound note referred the matter to my publishers and found them most affable how are adventures this morning nothing doing was the prompt reply until harvey grimm comes back my only client has been to ask me a question about maritime law he is coming back directly the poet ignored the hint my presence here will do you good he pointed out he will perhaps take me for another client he is not a man of culture by any chance he is not aaron rodd admitted tersely nor is he one of those who have been whacked into reading one of your poems he must have read about them at any rate cresswell insisted a little irritably if you introduce me you had better mention my identity fame so far has left me quite unspoiled i still feel a little thrill of pleasure in noticing the effect which the mention of my name has upon strangers come in he added pleasantly in response to a thunderous knock at the door the door opened and mr jacob potts entered bringing with him a strong atmosphere of old ale and bread and cheese to aaron rodds surprise he recognised the poet with a broad grin my ulysses of wapping the latter exclaimed holding out his hand what a meeting mr jacob potts jerked his thumb towards cresswell as he turned to the lawyer one of my clients he remarked aaron rodd was puzzled he had once paid a visit to the riverside publichouse over which jacob potts presided and he found it hard to associate cresswell in any way with the atmosphere there mr jacob potts had pressed a thick forefinger to his lips mums the word guvnor he declared reassuringly dont you worry the poet picked up his hat from this gentleman he asserted grandiloquently i have no secrets to be frank with you it was he and another friend who are responsible for those incidents in my career with which you have been professionally connected mr jacob potts glanced at him admiringly thats ow e talks down at wapping aint it wonderful he observed stephen cresswell edged towards the door when you have finished with our friend here he said addressing aaron come across to the milan i have a proposition to make anent the opening of my banking account it is connected with food and drink au revoir farewell my riverside goliath he added waving his hand to jacob potts remember our little bargain still goes mr potts large face was convulsed into humorous wrinkles thats a queer gent he declared as the door closed come to me e did sometime agoheard id been a bit of a bruiser and asked me to teach him a knockout blow something quick and not dangerous lord love me i used to let im go on and give im is fill o beer for the sake of hearing im talk ow i larfed when i tumbled to is gameme and the missis hed written some stuff wot no one would read and is idea was to advertise it up you goes to an old gent at a dark corner ave you read my book he arsks no sez the old gent cresswells poems eightpence a copy number thirtytwo manchester street he sez and biffs im one then other nervous old gents ear about this and buys the poems give the proper answer when theyre tackled and ome they goes to tea oly moses it was a great scheme but it was a greater before id done with it where did you come in aaron rodd asked curiously jacob potts drew his chair a little closer to aaron rodds desk well he explained its giving things away a bit but to ones lawyer i dont know as it matters im a kind o provider of men as can be trusted to give any one a clout on the side of the ead and no questions arst i could lay my hand at the present moment on some titty of em good to give any ordinary person a dom why the third night after yon chapd come to me id twentyfive of em out all asking the same question at ten bob a time it cost im a bit but where on earth did he get the money aaron rodd asked he was broke when we met him first i financed him jacob potts confessed i tell you the idea fair tickled me i found the coin and he paid me back like a gentleman i only sends em out now when were slack with other work but whenever we ave a little affair doing whatever the cost may be we always commence it the same wayave you read stephen cresswells poems noand then biff the publican leaned back in his chair and his fat body shook with laughter he mopped the tears from his eyes with a big red bandanna handkerchief to think of meeting im ere he murmured weakly you see we as our jokes even in the serious professions not that i ever let my boys go too far he concluded and i keep em out of trouble as much as i can thats why i want to know the law about this sea business aaron rodd read him extracts from the volume he had brought back and explained several doubtful points the publicans face was a little grave when he had finished i aint at all sure he decided that i fancy trusting any of my best boys with this job and i loathe foreigners any way well i wont ask you any questions aaron rodd said but if you want any free advice here it is youve made plenty of money i should keep friends with the law if i were you you cant employ such a band of ruffians as youve been talking about and not find a wrong un amongst them now and then if one o my lads jacob potts declared solemnly was to squeal i tell you the rest would be on im like a pack of foxounds on a fox theyd tear im limb from limb thats wot theyd do that wouldnt do you a great deal of good if you were in prison aaron rodd reminded him however you know the law now i know it and i aint sweet on the job mr jacob potts confessed owsomever good morning to you mr rodd and much obliged youll add your little bit on to my quarterly account wot o another client he added im toddling he shook hands with his adviser and reached the door just as it was opened and henriette entered he stood for a moment as though stupefied then as he disappeared through the doorway he turned round and winked solemnly at aaron wishing you good morning guvnor he said as he closed the door curiously enough as on that first morning when they had met in the embankment gardens a little ray of wintry sunshine which had stolen in through the dusty uncurtained windows lay between them aaron rodd whose first impulse had been one of joy at this unexpected visit stopped suddenly in his progress across the room there was something so entirely different about her a change so absolute and mystifying the faintly supercilious deportment and expression of the young woman of the world carrying herself so easily and with such natural grace and selfpossession seemed to have deserted her she was suddenly a frightened child seeking for shelter and with a lightninglike effort of imagination he seemed to see her flying for sanctuary from those terrors of which he had already warned her is anything wrong he enquired quicklyanything fresh i mean she sank into his chair she was panting a little as though she had been hurrying i am afraid she confessed i am terrified give me your hand to hold and listen she gripped his strong fingers they both almost held their breaths there was no sound except the distant rumble of traffic by degrees she grew calmer you are not worrying about my errand he asked anxiously you know what happened to me it isnt that she told him simply that was all planned beforehand you didnt mind of course not he assured her it is something which happened before i came to england she went on something terrible something from which it seems to me i can never escape listen i must tell you one dayi shall tell you now leopold has always been fortunate but the luck went against me one day i was face to face with detection i had the whole of the jewels in my possession i was confronted with the worst i hadnt time to think i killed the man who would have brought ruin on all of us andand on me worse than ruin do you heari killed him aaron rodd sat speechless she seemed so small and delicatelooking it was incredible he was a great man a colonel in the prussian guards he had high connections some of them belgian the threats of his people reached my ears even before i had escaped they swore to get me back into belgium and if i were once there god knows what would happen to me at first when i reached london i felt safe i managed to become attached to the household of madame surely in london was sanctuary and lately i have felt different this mani will not tell you his namehe is connected even with the family of madame herself i begin to fear that they have suspicions the princess has been cold to me lately there are several others in the household who seem to look askance at me i have had letters from relatives in belgium inviting me to go back some of them i know have been forgeries during the last few days i have been followed about only yesterday there was a little fog i was in the square near the corner of brook street suddenly i heard swift footsteps just behind me there was a whistle a taxicab drove up by the kerb there was a man in it sitting back in the corner i saw his faceit was cruel horrible i could hear another man running from out of the fog towards me i knew what they wantedto thrust me into the taxicab and just at that moment i shrieked and two strangers came from one of the big houses and i clung to them the taxicab drove off and the man seemed to melt away the two gentlemen thought i was mad they escorted me to another taxicab since then i dare not move alone how did you come here he asked in one of madames cars it waits for me outside even at the corner of this street there were two men who frightened me today my week of service is up with madame she has not encouraged me to stay longer she looks at me with the eyes of suspicion and at the milan court i am afraid my grandfather is so oldthe world is finished for him and leopold is so cold and mysterious he comes and goes with never a word there you see what has happened to me she exclaimed with a little quaver in her tone i have lost my nerve and i have been brave monsieur aaron roddbelieve me i have been brave of course you have he answered encouragingly and of course you will continue to be brave you must not fancy things believe me you are safe heresafe at least against being sent back to belgium against your will the fears for you and about you well what are they she interrupted anxiously tell me about them these diamonds he continued slowly if i might venture to say so it seems to me that your brother is making a mistake in dragging you into the affair at all we could have done our business with him and left you out of it but he is watched every hour of the day she explained they cannot find the jewels and they can prove nothing against him unless they do find them but they know very well that soon he must dispose of them and they never willingly let him out of their sight besides we are all to share in the proceeds why should we not take a little of the risk oh believe me she went on eagerly i can face anything that comes to me through the jewels it is the other thing i am afraid of i cannot speak even to you of that awful moment the man who guessed our secrethe offered silence we were alone she broke off suddenly absolutely incapable of speech she was white almost to the lips her eyes were filled with reminiscent horror he leaned over and took her hands once more a little clumsily in his dont think of it he begged that part of it at any rate is done with one must fight for what one has for the sake of others i knowi know she agreed trying to smile at him but tell me againthere isnt any way is there that the belgian authoritiesi suppose they do still control their own lawcourtscould be cajoled into having me sent back i am frightened i begin to wonder whether these men who i am sure have been watching me are emissaries from the foreign police he smiled reassuringly not a chance he declared they have something else to do just now believe me you are frightening yourself about nothing if you are being watched and i should think it extremely probable that you are being watched it is simply because you are living under the same roof as your brother and because you are an exceedingly likely medium for the disposal of the jewels if i were sure that that was all she murmured it is all he told her confidently there besides in that other case remember that you are not friendless i dont think i need tell you he went on a little awkwardly that if there were any way i could help any way i could ensure your safety it would make me very happy i think that i felt that she answered softly i think that that is why i came to you leopold has gone to one of his hidingplacesi do not know whereand he will not be back for several days please do not go far away be where i can telephone to you or come i wouldnt ask anything better he promised her eyes glowed for a moment she gave him her hand impulsively and he was dizzy with the strangeness and the joy of it he had been so long debarred from intercourse with her sex that femininity was making a late but extraordinarily subtle appeal to him he found himself even in the moment when he was studying the colour of her eyes counting the wasted years of his life remembering with a sick regret the lines upon his face the streak of grey in his hair you are going back now to the milan he enquired from here you could not of course i could he assented eagerly taking down his hat i promised to meet our friend cresswell there that ridiculous poet she laughed whatever made him a friend of yours he would tell you fate was the smiling reply harvey grimm would tell you a sense of humour i really dont know what i could say about it he isnt a bad fellow you are sure you have no more business to attend to she asked earnestly i can sit and wait quite patiently while you finish he sighed as he closed his desk i am afraid my office itself is rather a farce he told her as a lawyer i have been a failure my only client passed you on the stairs as he went out she heard him a little incredulously that seems so strange she observed i am sure that you are clever the majority of the world seems to have come to a different conclusion he sighed as he stood on one side to let her pass out here comes your client back again she whispered i will wait for you upon the landing mr jacob potts came puffing up the stairs he beckoned mysteriously to aaron rodd and drew him on one side guvnor he whispered ave you got any pals in this building i dont know that i have particularly was the somewhat doubtful reply why gave me quite a turn mr potts confessed theres two of my boys below two of them who are on that job i came to consult you about they are probably shadowing you aaron rodd suggested id give em shadow if they tried that game on mr jacob potts asserted truculently owsomever youve got the office if theres any pals of yourn about if youve any fancy sir he added as he turned away for seeing a little bout tonight down at my place ive arranged for that young fellow i spoke about to come down and put em on with canary joe arfpast nine and no questions arst of a friend ill remember the other promised wont keep you longer mr potts observed turning heavily away theres other clients than me about this morning wot o he turned back from the doorway and indulged in a huge and solemn wink arfpast nine he called out nothing charged for admission but the salt air down wapping way encourages the thirst which is good for the trade bring a pal if youve a mind aaron waited until his client had reached the first landing before he rejoined henriette they drove in what was to him unaccustomed splendour to the milan and parted in the little hall it is foolish she said as she held out her hand but i feel better because i have been frank with you sometimes my fears seem so unreal and then sometimes i close my eyes and i get these horrible little mind pictures ah but you do not know the terror of them this is england though and that was what they all saidin england you will be safe tell me you are sure that i am safe absolutely he declared confidently she waved her hand to him from the lift and he proceeded to the smokingroom in search of cresswell the poet having received forty pounds from his publishers was thoroughly disposed towards a frivolous evening he was consequently a little dismayed when as they sat at dinner that same evening aaron rodd who had been a little distrait suggested an alteration in their evenings entertainment i wonder he said if instead of going to the empire you would care to see a bout between canary joe and a youthful barman who i understand possesses genius the poet made a wry face i am rather fed up with biffing just now he confessed but canary joewhy thats old man potts protg aaron nodded the affair is to take place in a room at the back of his publichouse he observed cresswell sipped his wine and considered his attitude was obviously unfavourable i am in the humour he declared for a more enervating atmosphere the warmth and comfort of the empire lounge the charm of feminine societyeven from a distance he added hastily i am feeling human tonight aaron roddvery human it is possible his companion continued slowly that an adventure the poets manner changed more than anything in the world i am in the humour for an adventure he asserted eagerly then i think we will see canary joe aaron rodd decided you shall be my guide the long taxiride would have been a little depressing but for the poets uproarious spirits he sang himself hoarse and filled the vehicle with cigarette smoke they reached at last a region of small streets all running one way in the background a vision of lights suspended apparently from nowhere the sound of an occasional siren the constant sometimes overpowering odour of riverside mud when at last the taxicab came to a standstill they were near enough to the river to hear its rise and fall against a little bank of shingle from behind the closelydrawn windows of the publichouse one side of which seemed to abut on to the riverside came the sound of many voices they dismissed the taxicab and pushed open the swingdoors the poet who had been complaining bitterly of thirst on the way down led the way to the counter two whiskies and sodas tim he ordered wheres the guvnor the man jerked his thumb over his shoulder up in the room getting things to rights he announced if you take my advice mr cresswell youll slip in there as soon as youve had your drink therell be a crowd when the gong goes and theyre a tough lot to struggle with for seats aaron glanced around the room was filled with a motley throng of riverside loafers with here and there a sprinkling of sailors one huge dutchman in a soiled nautical uniform was already furiously drunk the two young men slipped up the stairs to which the poet led the way and passed through the door into the further apartment just as the dutchmans truculent eye fell upon them shouldnt wonder if we didnt tumble across something in the way of an adventure here the poet remarked cheerfully we ought to have changed our clothes hello heres the boss mr jacob potts on his way down the long dimly lit room came to a sudden standstill his expression scarcely confirmed the welcome which the heartiness of his invitation earlier in the day had promised he glanced at the two visitors in something like dismay nothing however could damp the poets spirits weve come down to see the scrap guvnor he declared if you have mr jacob potts replied with something which sounded threatening in his tone youre welcome if so be that youve any other reason for your coming maybe a word of advice from me wouldnt be out of place and that words git when weve seen the scrap and not before cresswell chuckled do you know that it cost the best part of a quid to get down here guvnor bring em in and lets see what stuff theyre made of jacob potts looked at the speaker doubtfully youve ad a drop young fellow you ave he muttered trenchantly and convincingly put old chap the poet replied steadying himself by the back of the chair my dear friend and i are making an evening of it mr potts face cleared a little boys will be boys he assented amiably and theres none of you the worse for a drop o good liquor on board fact is im a bit jumpy tonight he confessed my boys have got a little game ontonight of all nights did you happen to notice he asked anxiously if that golldarned dutchman was down there there is a son of holland in the bar the poet replied in a glorious state of inebriation he is seeking for some one to destroy tell you the truth we fled before him his eye rested upon us and he scowled mr jacob potts lifted a blind and stared out towards the river thats his steamer lying there he muttered i wish to god hed get aboard her aaron rodd moved softly to his side is this little game you spoke of he enquiredthe game your boys have on tonightthe one which brought you up to consult me about maritime law this morning it is jacob potts admitted and wot about it aaron rodd shrugged his shoulders before he could reply however a gong sounded the door of the room was thrown open and a surging mob from the bar streamed in front seats yelled the poet making a dive forward but aaron caught him firmly by the arm stephen he whispered theres something up here tonight we may have to come into it lets get seats by the door where we can slip out quietly im not joking considering all things cresswell was wonderfully amenable they stood on one side and let the crowd rush past them and eventually found two seats against the side wall within a few yards of the door mr jacob potts seemed for the moment to have forgotten their existence he was standing in the middle of the little ring which was roped off on a raised platform stamping with his heel upon the floor there were shrill whistles and cries of order gents mr potts announced this is a lightweight scrap twelve rounds between our old friend canary joe and a youngster i found in craven streetjimmy dunks he pointed first towards a pimplyfaced young man with flaxen hair brushed smoothly down over his forehead attired in scarlet knickerbockers and a pink vest over which heterogeneous attire he had thrown a soiled lightcoloured ulster his opponent wore a thin flannel vest a pair of dilapidated golfing knickerbockers and the remains of a dressinggown they both arose and made awkward salutations canary joe was evidently the favourite but mr potts himself led the applause for his opponent fair dos gents he begged this young uns a stranger but from what ive seen of im i believe es out to do is best and we none of us cant do more there were a few more preliminaries and the two young men faced one another they moved round for a moment like cats amidst an almost breathless silence then there were one or two wild plunges a little more cautious sparring and a yell of applause as the young man in the golfing knickerbockers landed his right very near his opponents mouth dont you treat im too light canary they yelled from the back keep your eye on is left there was a brief pause at the end of the first round canary joe sat scowling at his opponent as he received the attentions of his second the next round although without decisive effect was more vigorous the third produced a black eye each the audience settled down to enjoy itself suddenly the door at the back of the room was opened and from somewhere below came the sound of a gong struck three tunes there were little murmurs of annoyance disjointed oaths and growls from various quarters but without a single moments hesitation at least a score of the audience rose to their feet and made for the door aaron rodd and his companion watched them as they slunk by the poet was exceedingly interested someones going to get a biffing tonight he confided i wonder what its all about aaron acted on an inexplicable impulse lets go and see he suggested the poet rose at once to his feet he was ready enough if a trifle dubious they wont want us butting in he remarked all the same we might see a little of the fun it will be more like the real thing than this they passed down the few stairs into the bar several of the men had paused for a drink but others had already slunk out into the street following on the heels of the hindmost aaron rodd and his companion found themselves almost swallowed up in a sudden fog which had rolled in from the river from somewhere in the midst of the chaos they heard a quick authoritative voice joe you and half a dozen of you take the corners of the street hold up anything that tries to come down start a fight amongst yourselves if there are coppers about you others come out on the wharf that dutchmans in this ill swear the poet whispered lets try and find our way down to the river i know where the gate is almost as he spoke a heavy hand descended upon his shoulder and a dark evil face was thrust almost into his look here guvnor the man said you maynt be after any arm down ere but its one o them nights we dont need strangers around you tumble the old mans wolves are out and theyve a nasty way of snapping anything that comes along whats the game sid the poet asked engagingly were only here for a bit of sport never you mind what the game is was the terse reply you get back and watch those two chickens scratching one anothers faces there was a moments silence then from a few yards off came the sound of a slight moan as from a person suffocating whats that aaron rodd demanded sharply never you mind what it is was the swift reply from their unseen adviser take your carcases inside if you want to keep them whole he vanished in the fog aaron rodd gripped his companions arm stephen he muttered that was a womans voice sounded like it the poet assented have you got your electric torch in your pocket yes they heard the rattle of a key in the gate which led out on to the wharf for some time it refused to turn again they heard the moan and aarons blood ran cold i cant stand this stephen he whispered hoarsely come on one moment the poet answered they cant get the gate open i dont believe the guvnors on to this stay where you are for a minute he hurried back tore up the stairs and into the dimly lit room filled still with breathless expectancy it was the end of another round during which canary joe had obtained some slight advantage the poet walked straight up the room regardless of the growls which assailed him and touched its presiding spirit upon the shoulder guvnor he said you told me when we had dealings that youd never taken on any job in which there was a woman to be harried thats right boy jacob potts agreed theres a woman in the game tonight a woman who has been brought down here by some of your lot and who is down there now either drugged or half conscious they are trying to get her on the dutchmans steamer how do you know its a woman was the brief demand i tell you we both heard her groan the poet insisted jacob potts rose to his feet boys he said addressing the belligerents and gents there will be a ten minutes interval sorry but its business joe will serve the drinks which for this occasion only will be free the ten minutes interval softened by the promise of free drinks displeased no one jacob potts still in his shirtsleeves strode out of the place through the front room of the publichouse and out into the street where a queer unnatural silence seemed to reign there aint no woman about ere he exclaimed aaron rodd suddenly flashed his torch the iron gate was closed there was no one before it they could hear the sound of mens footsteps a few yards away on the old wooden wharf theyve just gone through aaron whispered fiercely come on jacob potts produced a key from his pocket and swung the gate open if you fellows have made a fool of me he muttered therell be trouble but if my boys have let me in therell be hell just as he finished speaking they once more heard the faint smothered cry from in front followed by a mans oath they saw the flashing of a light and heard the fall of a rope from the wharf into the river jacob potts quickened his pace turn on that glim o yours guvnor he growled and mind where youre going ullo there there was a confusion of answering voices its the guvnor they heard some one say then the light of aaron rodds torch flashed upon the short wooden dock and upon the halfdozen men grouped at the top of the crazy steps at its furthest extremity one of them came back it was the man who had warned the poet and aaron guvnor he said earnestly this aint your show you leave us alone and get back to the fight that be damned jacob potts replied firmly its no job of yourn to tell me wot to do you know very well theres just one thing i stick at and i asks you a plain question sid and a plain answer expected is that bundle youre carrying a woman or aint it its a woman the man proclaimed doggedly and its going on board the amsterdam the answer of jacob potts was bellicose and unprintable he strode along the little wharf followed by aaron rodd and cresswell behind came the man called sid his face darker and more evil than ever his breath coming short with anger boys jacob potts exclaimed drop that you hear me women aint in the game youve all been told that there was a moments hesitation then they heard the voice of their leader hoarse and vicious get on with it boys its going to be the river for any one who stands in our way tonight there were six of them altogether besides sid three of them moved now towards the steps below which a boat was bobbing up and down another man was seated in it holding to the side by a boathook and the three men at the top of the steps were carrying something sid and the other two turned round guvnor the former began there was a sickening crash as jacob potts fist caught him almost in the mouth he rolled over and up again on to his feet remaining warily out of reach but after that one blow easily able to keep his assailant occupied aaron rodd had sprung for the steps and received a blow on the side of the head from one of the other men which sent him reeling almost into the river get her aboard sid cried out we can tackle this lot no one can get down the street the boysll see to that then there was a fierce ugly silence for several moments jacob potts winded from the first the river on either side of him and murder in the mans face whom he fought panted and groaned with every fresh movement aaron rodd found himself suddenly in a new world a new uplifting instinct sending the blood tingling through his veins he was fighting a thing he had never done since his schooldays fighting with long swinging blows making scarcely an effort to protect himself fighting in an atmosphere indescribable the thirst for blood hot in his veins with one desire throbbing in his heartto kill or throw into the river the man who kept surging up towards him it was a vicious face faircomplexioned once but dark now with engine grease with bleary eyes mouth wide open all the time disclosing a broken row of hideous sicklylooking teeth but for the mans evil life he would have disposed of his opponent with his first few blows for he had been in his day a bruiser of some repute but aaron rodd knew no pain felt no fear and he was the first conqueror through sheer fortune hitting wildly with all his strength his long right arm landed full on the point of his assailants jaw the man went over with a sickening crash sid who was sparring still with jacob potts leaned for a moment downwards lay her down in the boat and come up one of you he shouted bills done in get down and let the other boys through theyre at the gate well finish off these blighters then one of the men who had been stepping into the boat turned back suddenly there was a scream from below and aaron rodd knew that his had been no dream the voice was henriettes help help she cried her voice was smothered but aaron rodds shout rang through the night were here henriette well rescue you hold on then there was the sound of a mighty splash the poet who had suddenly closed with his man had got him to the very edge of the wharf apparently one or both had lost their balance for a moment the fighting ceased every one listened a few yards away they could hear the long level strokes of a man swimmingone man only then jacob potts voice broke the tense silence imim done he moaned aaron rodd who had been waiting for the two men running up the steps swung round a peaceful man all his life he was suddenly a fiend he seized the electric torch from his pocket and brought it down with all his strength on the head of jacob potts opponent the man fell over with scarcely a cry just as the publican reeled backwards the realisation of what had happened gave him a moments extra strength youve done him sir he faltered can you keep those other two off for a moment whilst i get my wind that brutehit mebelow the belt i forgot he wouldnt fight fair mind this little one hell trip you aaron rodd turned almost with a laugh to meet his two assailants it seemed to him that there was a new joy in the world he whirled the torch over his head missed the skull of the nearest of the newcomers and brought it crashing on to his shoulder at the same time he himself received a fierce blow from the second man staggered tripped and recovered himself the whole place went round he put his hands up for a moment before his head felt them battered down struck wildly again and again one of his blows went home with a sickening thud and the joy of it thrilled him both men were closing in upon him however on the other side of the wharf they could hear the gate being rattled there was a low whistle twice repeated the man from the boat shouted climb the gate boys theres more of em jacob potts gasped keep it up for a moment mr rodd im coming in to help you then there was another hush ominous in a sense mysterious there was a sound which conveyed little enough to aaron rodd but which the others recognised promptly enoughthe long mechanical swing of oars without a seconds hesitation aarons two assailants turned and ran fleetfooted and silent off the wharf and vanished somewhere in the darkness the gate was rattled no more and from up the street came the sound of flying footsteps jacob potts began to sob its the policethe river police that ever i should be glad to welcome em get down to the boat mr rodd my god whats come to you sir aaron rodd walked from one side of the quay to the other like a drunken man there were all manner of stars in front of him he gripped hold of the rope and stole down the steps he was suddenly steadied by a great excitement with a black shawl torn back from her head in that last struggle her feet and hands tied together the remains of a gag hanging from her mouth her face livid her eyes full of horrible fear lay henriette she saw him swaying over her gripping the end of the rope his face streaming with blood but with all manner of things in his eyes and she made a little movement tried to hold up her hands tried even to smile oh thank god thank god the sound of the oars was no longer audible a long boat crowded with men in dark uniform came gliding out of the shadows a boathook gripped the side of the quay the poet looking like a drowned retriever stood up in the bows and cheered lustily one of the uniformed men who seemed to be an inspector flashed a lantern upon the scene whats wrong here he asked quickly aaron rodd kneeled upon the slippery steps and pointed to the girl one of the men clambered into the boat and cut the ropes they half carried her up on to the wharf the policemen followed they flashed lanterns around the man sid was lying on his side motionless aaron rodds first assailant was tying in a doubledup heap moaning to himself mr jacob potts was just beginning to recover himself so youre in this are you potts the inspector remarked grimly the boys broken loose eh just a little scrap the publican groaned then aaron rodd was suddenly aware of a new sensation he felt a pair of warm arms thrown around his neck the poet who had been shaking himself like a dripping dog sprang to his side the sky came down and the planks beneath his feet seemed jumping towards his throat but aaron rodd though the world around him was fading fast from his consciousness had found new things and he was quite happy chapter v the mysterious assistant abraham letchowiski stood in the doorway of his small but brilliantly lit shop in one of the broad thoroughfares leading out of the mile end road and beamed upon the saturday night passersby he was in his way a picturesque looking objectpatriarchal almost biblical he wore a long rustyblack frockcoat from which the buttons had long since departed but which hung in straight lines about his tall spare form his dishevelled grey beard reached to the third button of his waistcoat his hornrimmed spectacles were pushed back to his forehead every now and then he harangued a likelylooking couple in mild and persuasive accents young shentleman shtop von minute bring the beautiful young lady inside i am selling sheap tonight very very sheap young shentleman you want a real diamond ring i have the sheapest diamond rings in the vorld i am letchowiski the gem merchant you bring your moniesh to me you get better value than anyvere in vitechapel or the vest end come inside my tears a few of the passersby answered him with chaff one or two of the more forward of the girls threw him a kiss old father letchowiski on a saturday night was a familiar feature of the dingy marketing thoroughfare but tonight more than one fancied that his heart was not in it presently during a lull he turned back into his shop fingered lovingly a few of his wares gewgaws of the most glaring description and then turned to a small boy who stood behind the counter a remarkable crosseyed youth standing little higher than the counter with black hair a narrow face and sallow complexion david you call me the moment anyone puts their head in the shop you hear call loudly all right granfer the boy replied can i go to the door and shout at them if you like the old gentleman agreed tolerantly if you sell anything perhaps i give you a little commission a beatific smile spread over the boys face as he scrambled under the counter abraham letchowiski opened a door which led into the rear of the premises drew aside the curtain and peered for a moment back again through the shop into the street over the head of the small boy who with outstretched hands was making the night hideous with cries of fervid invitation then he dropped the curtain descended two stairs passed through a small illventilated sittingroom the table of which was laid for a homely meal on through another door and along a dark passage through a further door at the end came a chink of brilliant light he knocked twice softly and stepped inside a man with a tired livid face his clothing covered by a long smock heavy spectacles disfiguring his features was stooping over a tiny lathe the soft whir of a dynamo from a corner purred insistently a brilliant droplight from the ceiling was lowered almost over the bench something glittered in the white hands of the workman as he turned around with a little start letchowiski he muttered well finish for tonight letchowiski whispered imploringly all the evening i have been uneasy just now i stand in my doorway and i shout my wares and my eyes search there is a man in the clothing shop opposite he pretends to deal with hyam for a suit but i see him often with his eyes turned this way he is like the man of whom you have told methe man brodie the artificer did not hesitate for a moment he looked in the mirror opposite to him and straightened a little more naturally the coal black hair which only an artist could have arranged with his foot he stopped the dynamo from a cupboard opposite to him he brought out a dozen cheap watches and spread them around one of these he proceeded with neat fingers to take to pieces it is well to be careful abraham letchowiski he agreed softly go back to the shop is supper ready there is a little cold fish upon the table letchowiski replied it is useless to wait for rosa we will sit down you and i when you wish a faint flicker of disgust crossed the face of the listener he watched the disappearing figure of the old man then he half closed his eyes it is the end he reminded himself softly all that remains is to get away mr harvey grimm took off his overalls and looked at himself carefully in the glass he was wearing a wellworn blue serge suit a flannel shirt and collar a faded wisp of blue tie his black hair was plastered down on to his forehead ending on one side in a little curl after the fashion of the neighbourhood the man was so consummate an actor that his very cast of features seemed to have assumed a semitic aspect he readjusted his spectacles busied himself at the bench for a few more minutes covered over the dynamo and finally made his way stealthily into the shop he paused for a moment with his hand upon the counter listening to the old man who stood in the doorway his fingers played with a tray of atrociouslooking pieces of cutglass set in common brass abraham letchowiski in one of his pauses for breath glanced around and saw him you have finished he asked eagerly finished was the quiet reply let us eat together the jeweller abandoned his place which was promptly taken by the small boy you go and have your supper granfer he begged i do some good business arent you hungry the old man asked affectionately the small boy shook his head i rather stay here and do business he declared young shentleman went by just now wants diamond ring to give to the lady he promised to come back they left him standing upon the threshold eager and expectant and took their places in the musty little room before the fragment of cold fish at which harvey grimm glanced for a moment in disgust they had barely settled down before the door was thrown vigorously open a tall dark young woman dressed in all the finery of the neighbourhood swung into the room she held out her cheek to her grandfather but her bold black eyes rested upon harvey grimm what a supper she exclaimed scornfully and after ive been away for nearly ten days too you dont expect me to eat this do you sit down my dear and take a little the old man begged nervously if i had been sure that you had been comingbut we are never sure of you rosa we expected you last saturday but you never came pooh that is your own lookout the girl declared you are rolling in money grandfather and you live like a pauper i wonder your young men stay she added showing a row of white teeth as she beamed upon harvey grimm im sure i shouldnt unless you treated me better than this if you like my dear abraham letchowiski suggested i will go out and buy some fruit she pushed him back in his place sit still she ordered i will eat with you what there is afterwards we will see they proceeded with their very scanty meal the girl talked loudly about her situation in the great tailoring establishment dwelt on the fact that she had just been made forewoman over one of the departments invited their admiration of the cut of her skirt standing boldly up with her arms akimbo to display the better the allurements of her luxurious figure her eyes flashing provocatively the whole of the time harvey grimm who had been at first silent and unresponsive seemed suddenly to fall a victim to her charms he met her more than halfway in the flirtation which she so obviously desired they were seated arm in arm whispering together his lips very close to her flushed cheek when the little door leading to the shop was suddenly opened paul brodie stood there looking down upon them and behind him another man also in plain clothes there was a brief and somewhat curious silence the two newcomers seemed content with a close scrutiny of the dingy odoriferous apartment it was abraham letchowiski who first spoke he rose to his feet and leaned over the table the hand which lowered his spectacles on to his nose was shaking vat you vant here he demanded sorry to disturb you sir brodie said pleasantly bowing towards rosa we want to search your premises dont be alarmed unless you have something to conceal we shall do you no harm and well take care of all your treasures but who are you then the old man persisted vy should you search my premises i have done nothing wrong i have lived honest always thats all right brodie declared soothingly we aint going to hurt you any you know me mr letchowiski the other man observed my names bonejohn bone i am the detective attached to the policestation around the corner we wont worry you any more than were obliged to but on this gentlemans information we are bound just to have a look round but my piznessit will be ruined abraham letchowiski cried wringing his hands if my customers know they will never believe again that i am an honest man i shall be ruined they will come no more near my shop nothing of the sort the detective assured him i have only left one man outside and he is in plain clothes we can search this room and the bedroom and your workshop without attracting anyones attention come mr letchowiski you and i know one another the old man was still vociferous in his expressions of dismay i am seventythree years old he moaned i have never been in trouble i am honest just as honest as a man can be then keep your hands exactly as they are now brodie told him so with the ease of experience he ran his fingers over the old mans clothing searching him from head to foot well i never rosa exclaimed her eyes flashing angrily fancy treating an old man like that is anyone going to try to do it to me i should like to know theyll feel my fingernails if they do it will not be necessary john bone replied politely we watched you enter what you looking for she asked her curiosity getting the better of her anger ah the detective murmured is this your assistant mr letchowiski he went on harvey grimm rose slowly to his feet and held out his hands i am not an assistant of anybodys he declared and his voice seemed to have undergone an extraordinary change my name is ed levy and i am a skilled watchmaker john bone searched him briefly from head to foot all the while brodie was going round the apartment cupboards were peered into ornaments turned upside down the boards and walls tapped every possible hidingplace ransacked john bone disappeared for a few minutes up the stairs and they heard his heavy tramp in the bedroom above as soon as he had returned the two men made their way towards the inner door come with us down to the workshop abraham letchowiski the detective invited vot you want me for the old man asked querulously never mind come along with us we may have questions to ask they disappeared the old jeweller groaning in the rear as they passed through the door paul brodie glanced for a moment back the young man who had called himself ed levy had passed his arm once more through rosas their faces were close together an amorous grin had parted the young mans lips and he was whispering in the girls ear brodie smiled at his halfconceived suspicion as he turned away rosa and her grandfathers assistant were left alone what you think she asked him has grandfather been doing anything eh not he was the confident reply abraham letchowiski is too old and too clever to run such risks at his time of life besides he has plenty of money rosa assented she was apparently convinced of her grandfathers probity youre right she declared he has got plenty of money and no one to leave it to except david and me a nice dowry for me eh lucky girl harvey grimm sighed these young menthey know it she went on theres mr hyam from opposite and the two solomons but i dont like themtheyre too clumsy i like you he held her hand tighter she presented for his examination her fingers exposing a very large and brilliant ring and a massive gold bracelet i love jewellery she confided isnt that beautiful some day you give me a ring eh and i wear itwhich finger you like me to wear it on some day he promised when i am earning a little more i will give you a jewel that will make all the girls in your workshop mad with envy if you want to earn more money she asked why do you work for grandfather all the young men make jokes about him he never pays anyone half what they are worth harvey grimm nodded mysteriously you wait he told her i never stay long anywhere i am a journeyman repairer i earn more money that way i have about finished here now tonight the girl whispered you take me to a cinema palace theres a fine one at the corner of the street if you like she added with a sigh i pay for my own seat he hesitated for a moment then he smiled we will start directly these men have gone he promised and i will pay for both that is better she acquiesced with an air of relief it is always better for the gentleman to pay tell me she went on a little abruptly what do they look for these men they are a long time in the workshop it is always the same he told her wherever i go i find it there are always robberies day by day up in the west end and they think there is nowhere else the stones can be brought and sold but in this neighbourhood every little jewellers shop from here to the far end of the mile end road is ransacked this is the second time they have visited us then they are very foolish people rosa declared grandfather wouldnt buy anything that was stolen he is too nervous he has no courage yet she went on thoughtfully if he is really as rich as they say he is one wonders how he makes it all out of this poky little shop harvey grimm nodded his head many times in wise fashion a very clever man abraham letchowiski he declared oh i know many things those brooches he sells hundreds of at a shilling eachthey cost one halfpenny the engagement rings with the rubies or sapphiresyou take your choicenine shillings he charges for those tenpence halfpenny they cost him money comes soon when one can persuade people to buy then he lends money everywhere when it is safe many of these tradespeople in the street owe him money hush they are coming back after the cinema perhaps we have a little supper together eh she hugged his arm affectionately which was precisely what he meant her to do the entrance of the three men found them engaged in amorous whisperings brodie scarcely glanced in their direction he was frowning sullenly just a few minutes in the shop mr letchowiski the detective said and well move on and leave you in peace they passed up the two steps and through the little door which they closed behind them harvey grimm for a moment seemed to forget his companion he rose to his feet and stealthily crept to the curtained window he stood there peering through a chink into the shop it was becoming difficult now to retain that wonderful composure the hand which had stolen into his trousers pocket was tightly clenched upon a small hard object why do you watch there rosa demanded petulantly come back to me grandfather will be here directly her new admirer made no reply his eyes were riveted upon paul brodie who held in his hands the little tray piled with abominable gewgaws presently he set it down again upon the counter harvey grimm bit his lip until the blood came why do you bother about those stupid men she protested come back here or i shall come to you he heard her rise with a great rustle he felt the odour of patchouli and cheap sachets about him she crept to his side just as the shop door opened and the two men went out then he turned and kissed her full on the red pouting lips she giggled hysterically for her grandfather had just pushed open the curtained door and was standing looking down upon them he stamped his foot shook his head and raised his hands you kiss my granddaughteryou he cried harvey grimm held out his finger the old man suddenly stopped he crossed the room towards his highbacked chair and sank back with a little sigh of relief i am too old for excitement like this he mumbled i am getting very old rosa turned towards him mr levy is going to take me to a picture palace grandfather she announced would you like me to call and ask mr hyam to come across and sit with you the old man shook his head no no he replied it would mean coffee for two and i have no money you go to the cinema with mr levy and enjoy yourself my dear these men have terrified me i am oldtoo old i shall go to deuchers and get some coffee by myself come and get your supper he cried through the open door to the boy i will come into the shop for a little time the boy came reluctantly from behind the counter and pushed past his cousin and her escort into the sittingroom rosa turned back to speak to him for a minute and harvey grimm was alone in the shop he stretched out his hand towards the tray of gewgaws and a little shower of its contents slipped into his overcoat pocket presently rosa reappeared drawing on her gloves we go now she declared walk slowly out of the shop i like mr hyam to see us from opposite he is always bothering me to go out with him i like you best there this way they made a very deliberate progress along the crowded street until they reached the cinema palace harvey grimm paid for sixpenny seats and sat arm in arm with rosa in an atmosphere which seemed to reek of fried fish rank tobacco smoke and cheap scent his left hand held her purposely ungloved fingers inside her muff his right hand toyed with forty thousand pounds worth of diamonds thrust into common settings which sometimes pricked his fingers when the performance was over they left still arm in arm rosa he announced tonight i give you a treat i tell you a secret as well i am leaving your grandfathers i have a much better place i have saved money too she clung to him in unrestrained affection how much she whispered never mind he replied maybe three hundred pounds maybe more tonight i have the spending fit upon me we take a taxicab and we drive together up west i give you some supper at the monico she drew a little breath of delight suddenly she was serious let us go by the tube she suggested we shall save three shillings towards the supper you can buy me a bottle of scent with that he laughed and handed her into the taxicab which he had already hailed directed the man to drive to the monico and stepped in by her side i can buy you a bottle of scent all right he assured her and in here dont you see we are quite alone rosa in the restaurant there will be people we might have had the taxicab home she sighed her head upon his shoulder listen he explained after supper i pay for your taxicab if you will but i must leave you i have to see a man on business at halfpast eleven it is my new employer for a moment she drew away and looked at him doubtfully on business at halfpast eleven she repeated what is your business are you an honest man ed levy eh i am as honest as your grandfather he answered and listen i am clever i can make moneymake it quickly she sat a little closer to him and with her own fingers drew his arm around her waist shall we be married soon she whispered grandfather must die some day soon and theres no one knows how much money hes got david and i will have it all well talk about that harvey grimm promised at a few minutes after twelve on the following morning harvey grimm very spruce and very debonair pushed open the swingdoors of the small smokingroom of the milan and crossed the room with the obvious intention of proceeding towards the bar a little welcoming chorus assailed him from a circular lounge in the righthand corner of the room seated there were four of his friends whom at first he scarcely recognised there was aaron rodd with his arm in a sling a piece of stickingplaster on his forehead and a thick stick by his side the poet with a bandaged head and a shade over his eye henriette looking a little fragile but very animated and her brother still in uniform leaning back in an easy chair by her side harvey grimm stared at them all in blank and everincreasing astonishment has there been an earthquake he asked as he shook hands and exchanged greetings with everybody or have i in my country seclusion missed a scrap you have missed the scrap of your life cresswell replied eagerly you have saved your skin at the expense of untold glory tell me about it the newcomer begged as he took his place in the little circle where can one find words the poet began expansively it was an homeric sight a battle royal it took place in the darkness upon a slippery wooden wharf with the black waters of the river beneath and murderous parasites assailing us on every side it was an epic of biffing the glorious triumph of the unfit over the riverside apache and let me tell you this my friend harveyfor an untrained fighter the world doesnt hold a man who can hit so quickly and so hard as our newly established hero mr aaron rodd i have decided that he has earned immortality i am composing a poem which i shall dedicate to him could i hear what it was all about harvey grimm asked meekly me henrietta sighed then they told their story all of them in turn except brinnen supplying details towards the end however the poet took up the running and finished alone his face the latter declared gripping aaron rodd by the arm was like a pastel in white chalk against the soft background of velvety blackness heaven lit the burning light in his eyes the swing of his right arm was like the pendulum of fate oh keep this rot for the poem aaron rodd interrupted forcibly if you want to gas what about your own swim to the river policestation a series of truly homeric episodes the poet assented with a gentle sigh my pen shall give them immortality i shall not forget to allude to the part which i too played in this drama of fog and river the water was very cold he added suddenly finishing his cocktail and our friend from the country brinnen asked quietly how has he fared there was a breathless silence harvey grimm nodded slightly he glanced around the room of which they were the only occupants both doors were closed all is well he announced softly i returned last night the business is finished how much brinnen enquired eagerly there will be fortyfive thousand pounds i could not draw it all last night but it will be paid within a week i have nine thousand with me six of that i will hand over at any moment you please there is no one in the room brinnen murmured suggestively harvey grimm drew out a pocketbook ran some notes through his fingers and passed them over to brinnen once more the latter glanced around the room then with his left hand he produced from the pocket of his coat a necklace of brilliants one of which the centre one seemed to shine with a faint rosy light better see what you can do with that he remarked tossing it lightly across harvey grimm held the necklace for a moment in his fingers before he slipped it into the concealment of his pocket during that moment he caught an impression of henriettes eyes full of amazement fixed upon it she turned towards her brother leopold she exclaimed wonderingly i do not remember he brushed her words aside you have not seen all he told her significantly harvey grimm rang the bell i warn you he said that it will be a few days before i can abandon civilisation again even for a task like this brinnen moved uneasily in his chair it is work this he pointed out which carries with it a special urgency remember that its results will last for a lifetime quite true was the somewhat grudging admission it also means great risks i have been as near the end of things within the last twentyfour hours as i care to be the waiter appeared with a tray full of cocktails harvey grimm accepted his and leaned back in his chair with a beatific aspect this he murmured is one of the decadent luxuries denied to me in my country seclusion like many other things in life it is almost worth while to lose it for a time for the sake he broke off in his speech they all leaned a little forward in their chairs from a side door at the further end of the apartment leading to the private suites in the hotel a lift man suddenly appeared with a valet upon his heels they crossed the room with almost feverish haste they were obviously distressed a small boy followed a moment or two later with face as pale as death there was a confused murmur of voices just outside the glass door leading to the main portion of the hotel and a moment afterwards they reappeared with the manager between them all talking excitedly at the same time then the door opened once more and a woman tall and dark in a long dressinggown of green silk rushed in she threw out her hands towards the manager send for the police she cried my husbandhe is murdered and my jewelsthey are all stolen the police do you hear they all vanished through the distant door the woman clinging to the managers arm and talking excitedly all the time the little party looked at one another that was madame de borria the wife of the south american millionaire harvey grimm said slowly the woman who wears the necklace with the rose diamond henriette exclaimed breathlessly then there was a queer tense silence captain brinnen lifted his glass to his lips and finished his cocktail there is more than one rose diamond in the world he observed coolly chapter vi paul brodie strikes mr jacob potts blowing very hard and with his tongue protruding from the corner of his mouth finished an elaborate signature patted his waistcoat pocket in which he had just deposited a cheque laid down the pen and leaning back in his chair crossed his legs he was once more occupying the distinguished position of being aaron rodds only client i never thought to do it he declared i never thought to part with the sailorboys while i was so to speak in the prime of life its aving the lads turn agin me thats done it it shows mr rodd he added impressively what money will do in this world financially aaron rodd reminded him you are independent absolutely independent of work i know but whats a man to do mr potts replied with a sigh there was plenty down there always to keep me occupied and those ladswell i could have sworn to their running straight till that blarsted dutchman came along i tell you mr rodd he went on ive done some deals in my life and ive been up against propositions where money didnt seem much object ive ad jobs brought to me which i wouldnt allow my lads to tackle where they in a manner of speaking thrust a blank cheque down under my nose but i never in my born days knowed money chucked about like them as was at the back of that dutchman was willing to chuck it about why for an ordinary job if my boys got a tenner apiece they thought themselves on velvet from wot tim my barman told me and he generally noses out wot there is going abaht there was two undred quid for each of those boys if they got the young woman on board no wonder they were kind of off their chumps where exactly did they mean to take her aaron rodd asked mr jacob potts grinned i bet she knows sir and i should ave thought shed told you before this he replied give every man is due i say and for an amateur that ad no more idea than a babe unborn how to put up his dukes i must say you did fairly let into em mr rodd i never seed a man lose old of imself so in a manner of speaking and as for that young gent as writes poetry why id make a bruiser of im in six months e dont seem to feel pain and bein as were on the subject of that scrap sir are you above taking a word of advice from an old man i certainly am not aaron rodd assured him if i was you i should go a bit quiet with the young lady and er friends jacob potts said seriously ive nowt straightforward to tell agin em and thats a fact but a bit here and a bit there is good enough for a man with a level head theres three or four of er kidney in this country and if im not greatly mistook theyre wrong uns i cant think that the young lady comes altogether under that designation aaron rodd protested stiffly at the same time mr potts i must admit that her associations are mysterious steer clear of them sir and take an old mans advice the expublican begged ive ad things inted to me about them that i shouldnt like altogether to put into words aaron rodd saw his client out and found an old friend ascending the staircase harvey grimm was whistling softly to himself his hat was at its usual jaunty angle his violets were as fresh as ever his clothes as carefully brushed only his expression was different he was almost serious he took aaron by the arm put on your hat my friend he said we will walk for a little time aaron obeyed and they made their way down to the embankment gardens listen harvey grimm began looking around to be sure that no passersby were within hearing distance there is such a thing as tempting fate a little too far i think we have come to the point when we had better draw in explain yourself please his companion begged during the last few weeks harvey grimm proceeded i have broken up and cut into different shapes nearly a hundred thousand pounds worth of diamonds i have actually handled nearly eighty thousand pounds in money you and i are fifteen thousand pounds each to the good our friends want to go on frankly ive got the funks id like to cry off for a time that doesnt sound like you aaron remarked perhaps not his friend admitted all the same ive no fancy for thrusting my neck into the noose brodie doesnt even know it himself but he was hot on the scent last time he found out somehow or other the very house in which i was living we were in the same room he even had me searched once i saw him stare i thought it was all up then his suspicion passed it was just the way one of the jewish girls down there had accepted me which put him off but i tell you aaron it was touch and go then the diamonds themselvesthere was a stroke of genius there of which i am proud i hadnt long to do it either where do you think i hid them no idea of course you havent listen i had set them roughly in common brass fittings like a pile of common brooches that were being sold and i mixed them all up together let them lie there on the counter of the little jewellers shop where i have been doing my work and where i was hiding brodie took up some and let them fall through his fingers i tell you that was the closest shave of my life i think we should be wise to drop it aaron declared earnestly we are off the rocks now harvey i am content with what ive got thats how im feeling the other assented and yet theres this last necklace it seems rather playing it lowdown on brinnen not to get rid of that for him you see unless its broken up quickly its more dangerous stuff to handle than the others why aaron demanded dont be foolish harvey grimm admonished a little impatiently theres the hotel where it was stolen right in front of you here am i with the necklace a hundred yards away theres brinnen on the same floor theres madame de borriawhy its a daredevil piece of work anyway you dont mean that its madame de borrias necklace youve got aaron rodd groaned of course it is harvey grimm replied a little testily you saw it yesterday didnt you there it is in my overcoat pocket the pocket nearest you at the present moment aaron rodd paused abruptly before a bench and sat down it was quite close to where he had first seen henriette look here he said for gods sake harvey jump into a taxi at charingcross there and take the thing off somewhere take it off was the grim response id give a cool hundred to be rid of it at this minute the trouble is that if i make a single move in the direction of any of my haunts the whole thing will be blown upon you mean that you are being followed brodie hasnt been fifty yards away from me since nine oclock harvey grimm muttered madame de borria saw him yesterday just after the theft and he persuaded her to put the matter into his hands see that windowthe end one but three on the top storey but two aaron looked up to where the spotless white front of the milan gleamed through the budding trees i see it he admitted that is the window of madame de borria now count five windows to the left and one downthat is my room now up again and two on to the right and you come to the apartments of captain brinnen known to paul brodie as the redoubtable jeremiah sands when you add to these geographical coincidences the fact that the necklace is at the present moment in my pocket and that i cant move a yard without being followed you will understand that one needs all ones wits this morning we are getting just a little near the bone nearer than you imagine perhaps aaron rodd whispered heres brodie harvey grimm was for a moment curiously still his frame seemed to have stiffened into a sort of rigid attention one felt that his brain was working with the same concentrated force he neither moved nor looked in the direction which his companion had indicated instead he leaned a little further back in the corner of the seat and lit a cigarette one needs to remember he murmured that it is really quite a long time since i have seen this unwelcome intruder upon our privacy brodie came strolling along the asphalt walk puffing out his cheeks and gazing about him as though exercise and an interested contemplation of the river were the sole reason for his peregrinations he appeared to recognise the two men only in the act of passing them he at once stopped short and greeted them in his usual hearty fashion pleasant little spot this for an hours recreation he declared i was thinking about you by the by grimm as i walked along i am flattered was the calm reply i should have thought that all your attention would have been engrossed upon the little affair over yonder i understand that madame de borria has placed the recovery of her necklace in your hands quite a feather in your cap my friend if you succeed brodie glanced casually at the block of buildings in front yes he assented i have that on my mind of course by the by were you going back to your rooms by any chance i was on my way there come thats fortunate with your permission we will walk along together the two men rose and they all strolled along towards the hotel curiously enough brodie went on i was wondering whether i should be likely to run up against you today grimm we wanted to ask your advice inspector ditchwater and i about that little affair the night before last you heard the particulars i suppose i was in the smokingroom harvey grimm admitted when madame came running down in her dressinggown naturally we heard the story told a good many times just so madame it seems the detective continued heard nothing knew nothing until late in the morning when her maid told her that the floor valet was unable to obtain admittance to her husbands room she at once stepped through the communicating door and found him still unconscious with the necklace missing has he recovered yet harvey grimm enquired is he able to give any account of what happened i saw him for a few minutes last night brodie replied he seemed still very dazed and confused but he talked quite coherently his story is simple enough and doesnt help us much he was fast asleephe cant even say at what hourwhen he was awakened by the thrusting of a gag into his mouth and a bandage over his eyes he thought at first it was a nightmare and he tried to spring out of bed he was held down however quite firmly and something placed under his nose which made him feel just as though to use his own words he was sinking back to sleep again he remembers nothing more until the morning when he was found by his wife the moment they released the gag he was violently sick and the room certainly smells ethery what about the necklace well the necklace for some reason or other seems to have been kept in a tin dispatchbox in his room it was locked of course but the keys were under his pillow a fact which the thief whoever it was seems to have known the box was simply opened and the necklace taken it all sounds as though the thief must have been some one staying in the hotel aaron observed the detective smiled pleasantly upon him they had left the gardens now and were approaching the back entrance to the milan the legal mind mr rodd he remarkedthe legal mind yes i may say that we have come to that conclusion ourselves ditchwater and i some one staying in the hotel we think they passed through the mahogany doors and brodie rang the bell for the lift by the by grimm he suggested have you any objectionyou have so often asked me to have a look at your rooms here delighted im sure the other assented cheerfully we had better get out on the restaurant floor and take the lift on the other side of the caf i am afraid you wont see them at their best just now i only returned yesterday from a weeks absence that so brodie murmured say these little trips away from town are very pleasant i dont seem to be able to get away from my work often enough not that ive been doing much good he confessed dolefully during the last few months things have been going rather against me grimm ive put in a lot of work and it dont seem to have panned out according to expectations too bad harvey grimm sympathised youre up against a genius though brodietheres no question about that paul brodie nodded solemnly i tell you sir he declared that jeremiah sands is more than a genius he has the devils own luck too and i have come to the conclusion he added dropping his voice to a confidential undertone that the young lady is almost as clever as he is i dont mind admitting he went on as they passed through the caf and stood waiting for the other lift that at one time grimm i was inclined to think that youd put it over methat little affair of the faked diamond you know when we tried to make a scoop in mr rodds office i have changed my mind though jerry sands was too clever ever to walk into a trap like that i guess i did you an injustice there grimm and you mr rodd things have been a bit better with you lately though havent they he wound up a little abruptly aaron rodd raised his eyebrows he had the air of one who considered the last remark impertinent have they he observed coolly no business of mine of course brodie went on say is this your floor grimm the lift had come to a standstill and they stepped out my rooms are this way the latter announced the little party traversed a corridor at the further end of which harvey grimm threw open a door leading through a small entrancehall into an octagonal sittingroom having a pleasant outlook on the thames a man was standing with his back towards them gazing out of the window he turned around at their entrance ah our friend ditchwater brodie murmured you know inspector ditchwater dont you grimm i know him certainly harvey grimm replied frowning but i cant imagine what the mischief he is doing in my rooms perhaps i ought to have explained the detective said apologetically we have taken the liberty grimm of making a few slight investigations in your apartments the devil you have their tenant exclaimed gazing through the halfopen door into the inner room is that the reason why my bedroom seems all upside down probably the detective admittedquite probably you see he continued you are in your way my friend an exceedingly interesting person to the police in this country as you were at one time i believe to the police of new york when a little affair such as weve been talking about happens only as it were a few yards away from your rooms why naturally weve some interest in your doings have you anything against me harvey grimm asked quietly a few questions the other murmured see here grimm he went on with a sudden change of tone youve been absent from town for exactly nine days until yesterday morning just where have you spent those nine days harvey grimm moved to the sideboard and helped himself to a cigarette from an open box well he observed im hanged if i can see that thats anybodys business except my own i will admit sir brodie proceeded that there is at the present moment not the slightest necessity why you should answer that questionit is in fact a matter slightly removed from the immediate object of our visit this morningand yet it is a question which i am going to press upon you and which should you feel so disposed mr grimm you might possibly answer with great benefit to yourself the long and short of it is this is it worth your while to put yourself right with the authorities and with me or isnt it i tell you as man to man i have a theory of my own about you and your disappearances i should have thought harvey grimm remarked after a brief pause that inspector ditchwater having made himself so free with my apartments would have been in a position to have told you everything himself however come this way he led them into the bedroom a portmanteau not wholly unpacked was open upon the stand my portmanteau he pointed out which as you have doubtless already ascertained from the hallporter came back with me the night before last theres the label mr brodie turned it over and examined it exford he murmured just so harvey grimm assented now what about those two sets of fishingrods there the detective fingered the label and read the address aloud mr harvey grimm the crown hotel exford that of course harvey grimm continued drily is not evidence as the label is in my own handwriting but you will find that the golf clubs there bear a railway label i think the detective turned the bag around and nodded very interesting he admitted but exfordat this time of the year youre no sportsman brodie harvey grimm said reproachfully or youd know all about the march trout just a moment come back into the sittingroom he led the way searched for a moment on the sideboard and threw a daily mirror on to the table brodie adjusted his eyeglasses in the lefthand corner of one of the inner pages was a small picture of a man fishing and underneath fine catch of mr harvey grimm a london sportsman in the river ex last monday quite a good likeness too the detective observed as he laid down the newspaper say this is very interesting grimm it disposes altogether of one of my theories i had no idea that you possessed such simple tastes ive done a little seafishing myself well well stillnow ditchwateryou got back in time last night to help yourself to madame de borrias necklace it was all an affair of seconds ditchwater had suddenly caught harvey grimms two arms from behind whilst brodies hand had dived into his coat pocket the necklace glittered upon the table there was a moments intense silence brodie was breathing quickly there was a gleam of triumph in his eyes dear me harvey grimm exclaimed fancy your finding that the detective bent over his prize the middle diamond is without doubt he announced a rose diamond quite a peculiar red light ditchwater step round to madame de borrias rooms ask her if she will be so good as to come here at once the inspector disappeared harvey grimm relit his cigarette took off his overcoat in a dazed way threw it over the back of a chair and hung up his hat i shouldnt bother to do that grimm the detective advised him quietly i am afraid we shall have to ask you to come and pay us a little visit youve got plenty of common sense i know it isnt necessary i suppose to tell you that there are a couple more men in the corridor ive no idea of making a fool of myself harvey grimm replied but do you mind if i help myself to a whisky and soda your methods are a little nerveshaking the detective stepped in front of the sideboard say i dont believe for a moment grimm he said that youre up against it badly enough for that but i dont think id worry about a drink just now mix it for me yourself then the other suggested the detective hesitated for a moment and then did as he was asked keeping his back however to the sideboard and reaching first for the whisky and then for the sodawater say when he invited courteously with his hand on the siphon thatll do nicely thank you brodie your very good health harvey grimm drained the tumbler and set it down almost as he did so there was a knock at the door the sound of voices and madame de borria entered the detective had just time to throw a newspaper over the necklace before she appeared you sent for me she exclaimed turning at once to brodie tell me have you news of my necklace do you mind just running over its points once more brodie asked she made a little grimace i wrote it all out for scotland yard she reminded him patiently the stones are very fine but without any special character there are sixtythree of them almost equal in size until you come to the front it is the front that is so wonderful the middle stone is a rose diamond the only one in the world which flashes a natural pink cross there is nothing else like it the two on either side are slightly pink and there is one yellow one two places from the middle stone but it is the middle stone mr brodie that is worth all the rest put together it is the most wonderful in the world please do not keep me in suspense the detective lifted the newspaper from the table it was seldom that he permitted himself any emotion there was a slight gesture of triumph however as he turned towards the woman she literally sprang upon the necklace turned it over gazed at it blankly for a moment and flung it back upon the table you brought me here to look at this she exclaimed contemptuouslyand after you have heard my description too why my necklace has twice as many stones and my rose diamond has the flash of the cross both brodie and the inspector stood for a moment as though stupefied incapable of speech harvey grimm threw his cigarette into the hearth madame de borria he said i should perhaps add my apologies to those which our good friend there is engaged in framing the necklace is mine or rather it is entrusted to me for sale i am well aware that it does not resemble yours which i have often seen and admired mr brodie however in his excessive zeal gave me no time for explanations he descended upon my rooms seized the necklace from my overcoat pocketscarcely a likely receptacle i think for stolen goods he added with a little expostulatory grimaceand sent off for you the lady turned almost savagely upon the detective so this is the way she said you conduct your affairs mr paul brodie you insult a harmless gentleman whom no one but an idiot could mistake for a thief you drag me from my room to look at a necklace which does not resemble mine in the slightest and meanwhile the thief gets further and further away she added with biting sarcasm oh you are very busy are you not catching him you are very near that two thousand pounds she stamped her foot and turned away brodie opened the door for her his attitude was apologeticalmost cringing madame de borria he said im sorry but two necklaces who could conceive such a thing rest assured however that this is not the end she strode away without another word brodie came back into the room he fingered the brim of his hat thoughtfully say are you in the habit of carrying valuable necklaces about with you in your overcoat pocket grimm he asked harvey grimm took up his stand very deliberately on the hearthrug i am he announced i also occasionally wear a coronet instead of a hat and a suit of armour instead of pyjamas i do these things because i choose and because its damned well no one elses business except my own so youre going to take that tone are you brodie observed thoughtfully between ourselves i think its time i did was the prompt reply the sooner you make up your mind that i am a harmless individual the better i told you openly within twentyfour hours of making your acquaintance upon the steamer that i was an expert in precious stones that is how i make my living and it is perhaps as reputable a way as yours the necklace which you have had the impertinence to accuse me of stealing is entrusted to me for sale and if at any time there was any real reason for me to disclose the name of the owner i would do so at present however i consider that i have humoured you far enough you will oblige me by leaving my rooms at once and taking inspector ditchwater with you so thats the line eh that is the line harvey grimm assented and what are you going to do about it personally inspector ditchwater decided turning towards the door i am going to wish you goodmorning and offer you my apologies mr grimm we seem to be always in the wrong when we act upon mr brodies information and the report im going to make to headquarters will perhaps save you any further trouble brodies face was imperturbable he accepted the situation however and followed ditchwater from the room the two men left behind listened to their retreating footsteps harvey grimm threw himself into an easy chair so thats that he observed an exciting quarter of an hour eh aaron i am bewildered aaron rodd admitted i dont understand even now wasnt it madame de borrias necklace then that one wasnt you dont mean to say that youve got two necklaces feel in the other pocket harvey grimm directed him aaron obeyed from the righthand pocket of the overcoat which was hanging over the chair he drew out a second and more beautiful necklace as he held it before him the cross flashed out from the rose diamond in the centre good god he exclaimed you mean to say that it was here all the time of course it was i told you that i was in a tight corner he never gave me a chance to hide it i knew these rooms would be searched fortunately he chose the lefthand pocket of my overcoat instead of the right what are you going to do with it aaron asked breathlessly harvey grimm glanced at the clock it was a quarter to one you shall see he replied just open the door will you i think i heard some one ring put the necklace away firstin that drawer will do aaron did as he was told a short dark man dressed with extreme care pushed past him into the room it was the husband of madame de borria i have come he announced how is the good mr grimm and what is the news this morning the news is harvey grimm told him that the detective your wife employed has been up here searching for the necklace marvellous the little man declared rolling himself a cigarette nervously how sagacious what foresight but as to results eh harvey grimm with a little sigh of relief thrust his hand into the drawer produced the necklace and handed it to the south american mr de borrias face glowed with satisfaction i have had a leetle trouble with madame he announced but it is past she agreed at last eagerly to the advertisement you have seen it harvey grimm nodded two thousand pounds reward and no questions asked he murmured mr de borria drew from his pocket a battered and soiled cardboard box into which he proceeded to stow the necklace i make a package here as you see he pointed out i have received an anonymous note which makes a demand upon my honour that if i accede to its terms i destroy it it is destroyed the letter harvey grimm began mr de borria tapped his forehead in the airin my brain he exclaimed what does it matter it is destroyed i go to the place named i produce the two thousand poundsbeholdand the necklace is mine he laid a pocketbook upon the table and drew out a sheaf of notes which he carefully counted into two heaps one he pushed towards harvey grimm the other he replaced in his pocket then he smiled he had the engaging smile of a child so he pronounced we are all happy and contented madame my wife will wear her necklace tonight and once more rejoice i shall have that thousand pounds in my pocket which is so necessary for a man like myself in this your great city of gallantry and happiness and you my dear mr harvey grimm who played the burglar and assisted me in my little scheme you too have a thousand pounds so now that all is well shall we visit the little lady down in the american bar afterwards i will take a taxi just to nowhere and i will come back in another taxi from nowhere i shall break into my wifes rooms and she will hold out her arms to me and she will have her necklace and i have got my thousand pounds enfin let us descend harvey grimm took up his hat and aaron rodd followed suit it seems to me aaron remarked as he brought up the rear of the little procession that the only man who gets nothing out of this is mr brodie chapter vii the infidelity of jack lovejoy cresswell and aaron rodd were dining with captain brinnen and his sister at a corner table in the milan restaurant harvey grimm had once more left them for an unknown destination and they were all aware that the period of his absence would be this time more than ever one of strain as though by general consent however the conversation did not touch once upon personal matters they spoke a good deal of the war brinnen himself was roused by sundry reflections into a momentary bitterness an expression of that peculiar irritation common to many of his countrypeople notwithstanding their underlying gratitude you people in england he declared you have no perceptions no brains with which to combat a perfectlydeveloped system of espionage nothing but an infinite complacency an infinite stupidity the people who hate you walk in your midst unharmed even if they are pointed out your officials shrug their shoulders and smile in a superior fashion they can do us no harm they assure you there are reasons why we prefer to leave them alone and you are at war you people ah if only you would realise it you are quite right aaron rodd admitted we have grown too accustomed to look upon espionage and secret service as the bonne bouche of the novelist i suppose they do exist they not only exist brinnen continued but they are becoming a very important factor in the progress of the war look at this room did you ever see a more cosmopolitan gathering there are belgians russians americans the two young men who have just come in are roumanians over here no one knows why this however i could tell you if england takes no heed of their presence germany does they will be watched by germany until they leave and for all your army of censors germany will know day by day just what they do and even nearer to us i could give your secret service a very useful piece of advice concerning the young man at the third table from here with the lady in white spangles aaron rodd and the poet both glanced cautiously in the direction indicated a tall cleanshaven young man dark with big black eyes a mass of sleeklybrushed black hair and rather puffy cheeks goodlooking in a stagy sort of way was entertaining an artistically decorated young ornament of the musical comedy stage you know him perhaps brinnen enquired both men shook their heads he is always about here cresswell remarked generally in the bar he is an american actor brinnen continued his name on the programmes is jack lovejoy his real name is karl festonheim and he was born in cologne his father and his grandfather his mother and his grandmother were germans he married a german wifea negligible affair perhaps as the matrimonial arrangements of those sort of people are inclined to be but still it shows his tendencies the man like many thousands of others calls himself an american because he went there as a boy and has lived there ever since yet every relative he has lives in germany every spark of real feeling such a person may happen to possess is german he eats like a german he lives like a german he even talks like one yet that young man has no difficulty about passports he can live in london listen to the secret voices of your nation and make his way unhindered and unharmed over to germany whenever he chooses there are of course many technical difficulties aaron rodd pointed out in dealing with naturalised americans whatever the country of their birth you are very punctilious over here captain brinnen observed with fine sarcasm however i give that young man as an instance because i know that certain information concerning the whereabouts of three of your cruisers earlier in the war was conveyed by him to the german admiralty i cannot prove this but i know it i also know that while if you speak to him he will tell you that he is out of a job that the war has played the deuce with musical comedy he has refused three parts within the last month on some pretext or another because he is better occupied stephen cresswell sat up in his place an expectant light shone in his eyes an adventure he murmured if you sir brinnen remarked could develop the sagacity of a french or german secret service man and fasten upon the life of that young man you would probably gain the adventure which you seek i am the very man for the task the poet declared eagerly i have stuck like a leech to my friend aaron rodd here in the hopes of travelling with him a little way into the land where adventures are as plentiful as gooseberries the only one to which he has introduced me has been highly satisfactory in its way he declared bowing to henriette and the remembrance of it will be a happiness to me all my life but one cannot live on one adventure alone i am eager for more i claim that young man rodd do you hear i claim him he is yours the other acquiesced grimly poor fellow one is almost inclined to pity him cresswell smiled in superior fashion my dear fellow he said you are without doubt a man of energy and brains but what you lack is initiative initiative is the gift vouchsafed to genius i have genius therefore i have initiative to you the affair connected with this young man appears at present to be as impenetrable as a blank wall you would not know where to start wait you shall watch my methods in the meantime henriette whispered gazing intently towards the doorway behold madame de borria and her recovered necklace they all turned their heads the south american woman was on her way through the room and around her neck flashed the light from her wonderful necklace aaron rodd leaned a little forward in his chair she is soon wearing it again he remarked brinnen shrugged his shoulders why not it was lost only for a few hours madame had the good sense to follow her husbands advice and to offer that greatest of lures to the educated thiefa reward and no questions asked madame deserves to have recovered her necklaceand it becomes her well shall we take our coffee outside they all rose to their feet and left the restaurant together the poet thrust his arm through brinnens and led him on one side talking earnestly aaron was left alone for a few minutes with henriette they found a corner as far as possible from the strains of the overpersistent band it is three months today he reminded her since i saw you first in the gardens of the embankment what a memory she murmured and i like the very forward person you have since discovered me to be made tentative overtures to you with the object of discovering whether you were a lawyer not too squeamish about your clients or their business his face hardened a little are we coming soon he asked to the end of your stockor rather your brothers stock of jewels why she whispered looking up at him with slightly contracted eyebrows because i am tired of it he declared frankly tired of it in connection with you that is to say i spend whole days sometimes in a positive state of terror luxury is a small thing compared with freedom and life you have had over forty thousand pounds now why dont you take your grandfather somewhere away into the country even if you have to be content with half that sum you could live on it and be safe let your brother go his own way it isnt really worth while henriette she looked at the point of her slipper carefully for a moment she wore a perfectly plain black velvet gown and only a single pearl hanging from a strip of black velvet around her neck her fingers were ringless even her hair was arranged in the simplest of coils yet there was no one else in the room quite like her henriette he went on leaning over her if you dont speak i shall make a fool of myself she started and looked timorously into his eyes then as quickly she looked away again her hands clasped the arms of her chair she seemed suddenly interested in the orchestra saywhat you were going to say she begged you know he obeyed almost roughly i am nearly forty years old i have no money except the ten or fifteen thousand pounds i have made by helping to dispose of your stolen jewels and im sick of it all sick of it because ive found something in life worth living differently for you know what that is leave your brother to live his own life bring your grandfather and come away somewhere henriette and marry me it sounds absurd doesnt it he went on a little wistfully but in a way youve been so kind to me you must have known she suddenly laid her hand upon his it was a delightful little gesture please dont say any more just now she implored i shall remember every word that you have said and i dont think i have ever felt so much like like what doing what you ask she continued quickly there just nowfor a little timewe must think of other things you see here comes my brother and mr cresswell whatever is mr cresswell going to do look the american actor and his companion had taken seats almost opposite to them suddenly cresswell left his hosts side and crossed the room towards them with a slight bow he addressed lovejoy brinnen who had strolled over to where his sister and aaron rodd were seated smiled a little cynically what you call in your expressive language rather the methods of a bull in a china shop he observed i fancy that we shall see our friend return a little chastened you dont know stephen his friend murmured he has more confidence than any other man on earth look a waiter had been summoned to bring a chair the poet was seated now next the young lady to whom he had just been introduced they were all three chatting amiably a waiter was receiving an order for coffee and liqueurs that is what he calls initiative henriette whispered the first steps are easy brinnen remarked and after all one must remember that lovejoy is by no means a clever person he is conceited and bumptious well at any rate we must wish mr cresswell luck i was just asking your sister aaron said abruptly whether we were almost coming to the end of your hidden stores the young belgian glanced around for a moment quickly and flicked the ash from his cigarette why because i am beginning to fear the risk more every day for your sisters sake aaron continued steadily our friend mr brodie has made a good many mistakes but he is not an entire fool grimm admitted only the other day that he had tracked him down to the very place where he recuts the diamondshad been within a few feet of them nothing came of it though brinnen observed frowning it may not be so every time aaron rodd persisted i was trying to persuade your sister to be content with small things your grandfather is very old think what the shock would be to him if anything were to happen to either of you put what you have left in a safe deposit if you like for a time and start again disposing of them when things have blown over a little the brother and sister exchanged glances which to aaron were inexplicable what does mr harvey grimm say about it the former asked oh grimm will go on till he drops aaron rodd declared adventure danger whatever the cost is the spice of life to him but he is just a man alone its a different thing when a girl like your sister is concerned it is for her sake that i want to see the thing closed up brinnen dropped his eyeglass and rubbed it for a moment with his handkerchief you seem to take a great interest in my sister mr rodd he said calmly i have just asked her to marry me aaron rodd replied bluntly brinnen turned slowly around he was suddenly like his grandfather his eyebrows were a little uplifted his expression was the expression of one who listens to some unthinkable thing absurd he muttered it is nothing of the sort aaron rodd answered simply if your sister has been guiltily concerned in your adventurous life i too have turned myself into a receiver of stolen property we are in the same boat only i want to get her out of it i have asked her to marry me and come over to america we could start life again on what i have she leaned over suddenly and spoke to her brother in a low tone and in a language which was strange to aaron rodd his expression changed a little as he listened then the waiter appeared with their coffee and liqueurs when they were served and he had left captain brinnen reopened the subject i gather that you yourself mr rodd he observed have hankerings towards the humdrum life the life of honesty and the virtues and that sort of thing i have tried for many years to make an honest living aaron replied shortly the only time i ever crossed the line was long ago when harvey grimm and i were in america it wasnt anything very serious then our present transactions have been my only other essay i come of an oldfashioned new england family and however one may laugh at their principles and the narrowness of their outlook i have those principles in my blood and frankly i hate this life if its bad for me its worse for your sister i want to take her away i will consider what you have said mr rodd brinnen replied for the present we will if you please abandon the conversation a little glance of entreaty from henriette closed aarons lips they spoke of general things for a few moments then captain brinnen rose to his feet i am afraid that i must take my sister away now mr rodd he announced she has an engagement for this evening but before we leave he added holding out his hand whatever i may feel concerning the proposals you have made i should like once more to express my thanks for your great courage the other night my sister and i owe you more than we can ever repay your sister aaron said with a boldness which surprised him can repay me if she will she looked into his eyes and they seemed to him larger and softer than he had ever seen them there was a little quiver at her lips too even though her words were light ones you are growing into a courtier mr rodd she murmured au revoir they passed up the stairs and aaron sank back in his chair there was a certain satisfaction mingled even with his disappointment at least he had spoken his mind then the little group on the other side of the way arose and the poet catching his eye beckoned to him in friendly fashion this the poet declared as aaron approached is my friend aaron rodd aaron allow me to present you to a lady whom you have often worshipped from a distance miss pamela keane aaron who had no idea who miss pamela keane was bent over her hand and cursed the poet under his breath the latter who was thoroughly enjoying himself laid his hand upon lovejoys shoulder and also to my friend mr jack lovejoy he continued lovejoy is the one man in london who makes me wish that i could write for the musical comedy stage one has ones limitations alas there followed a few minutes desultory conversation then miss pamela keane picked up a wonderful collection of golden trifles and turned towards the exit we shall meet again mr cresswell she said smiling upon him do bring mr rodd with you if he cares to come au revoir she turned away followed by lovejoy the poet linked his arm through aarons and demanded another liqueur you didnt really know the fellow did you aaron asked curiously not i he replied but as i have told you many times i am a born adventurer i am equal to any situation have i ever mentioned that i am also something of a snob i dont seem to remember the confession well i am i have an aunt who is the wife of a baronet i make use of her occasionally in the days of my more abject poverty i used to go there for a free meal when i had a black coat she is by way of being a patroness of the arts entertains all sorts of jumbled up parties in all probability mr lovejoy has either been asked to one of them or wishes he had hence my selfintroduction mr lovejoy i say in my best manner i believe i had the pleasure of meeting you at my aunts lady sittingleys he hesitates and i can see that i have him fixed he hasnt the least intention of ever denying that he was there although he doesnt know me from adam and there you are you know its the natural spirit of the adventurer what was that about going on there tonight aaron enquired we are both going my boy was the cheerful reply miss pamela keane is entertaining a few friends to chemin de fer at her flat in buckingham gate i have explained that i do not play but we are going to look in for a glass of wine and a chat as a matter of fact i just want to cast my eye over lovejoys friends do you see theres no need for me to come aaron rodd protested there is every need the poet insisted watching the arrival of the liqueurs with satisfaction i like companionship i like some one with whom to compare impressions after such a visit as this you may notice something which has escaped me aaron frowned a little wearily captain brinnen was probably talking quite at random he remarked lovejoy doesnt seem to me to be the type of man whod take a serious interest in anything except his own pleasures quite right the other agreed shrewdly but he might reasonably take an interest in the means of procuring those pleasures and as to our jewelcollecting friend talking at random i dont believe it a man with a face and a character like his doesnt chatter well just spruce up here a bit and follow them right along the two men spent the next two hours in entirely different fashion stephen cresswell made a host of new friends with marvellous facility flirted with many pretty but unnamed ladies ate pt de foie gras sandwiches and drank champagne as though it were his first meal of the day aaron on the other hand found the customary stiffness of his manner only intensified by the bohemianism of his fellowguests the women with their laughing eyes their frankly flirtatious speeches their general air of goodfellowship and lack of reserve seemed to him simply intolerable every time he thought of henriette he hated his surroundings and longed for the solitude which notwithstanding his efforts he was only partially able to achieve to escape the new acquaintances whom the poet was continually bringing up to him he even played for an hour afterwards when the rooms became more crowded he escaped into a corner and sat looking on it was exactly the sort of gathering he had expecteda good many young ladies from the stage with their escorts a strong element of the betting fraternity a theatrical agent or two and a sprinkling of those nameless people always well dressed always mysterious who seem to pass through life so easily without toiling or spinning he was just deciding that so far as the object of their visit was concerned the evening had been wasted when pamela keane came suddenly across the room and sat down by his side i want to talk to you mr rodd she said throwing herself back in a chair and displaying an amazing amount of white silk stocking you are very kind he murmured mr cresswell tells me that you are a lawyer that is so aaron admitted a little startled where are your offices seventeen manchester street adelphi he replied third floor can i come and see you at eleven oclock tomorrow morning with pleasure good ill be there not a word to jack mind come and have a glass of champagne he drank his glass of champagne and watched his companion drink three then she floated off to greet some newcomers and aaron made his escape the poet called him up in the hall the usual sort of crowd here he remarked as they left the house pretty hot lot some of those bookmakers and jockeys but i didnt see a soul whom id ever suspect of getting off his own little run what about you come and see me at twelve oclock tomorrow morning was all the poet could get out of his companion that night miss pamela keane was marvellously punctual in a blue serge costume straight from paris a hat which was a marvel of simplicity a wonderful veil and a wave of perfume she swept into aaron rodds room the next morning as eleven oclock was striking he handed her the clients chair into which she sank a little breathless say this is some climb she remarked dont you have any elevators in your offices on this side plenty he assured her i have a very small practice and these are outofthe way premises she lifted her veil her face was thick with powder and her eyes seemed to him artificially brightened there was some stuff which he didnt understand upon her lashes and in contradistinction to these to him somewhat ghastly allurements her expression was hard her tone as she spoke almost rasping see here mr rodd she began i have come to talk to you about jack lovejoy know anything about me nothing he confessed i dont suppose youve ever seen me on the stage even never so much the better i didnt want to go to one of these knoweverybodyandeverything theatrical lawyers who call you my dear and promise you the earth well i married a millionaire over in the states and i fixed things so that he couldnt get rid of me without it costing him something ive got an income of five thousand pounds a year mr rodd and though that aint the earth its useful naturally he assented ive done more than i should like to tell you for jack lovejoy she went on of course we live together and were as much married as the law allows hed got nothing but what he was earning and that wasnt much when i took him up now hes got his motorcar and anything he wants im not a changeable woman im older than he is of course but im barely forty and all i wanted of jack was that he should play the game hes not doing it mr rodd the lawyer shrugged his shoulders ever so slightly the question of lovejoys infidelities appeared to him profoundly uninteresting ill tell you how i know she went on we had a little trouble a month ago and ive waited for him to come to me for his cheque since instead of handing it over he hasnt been and hes had all the money he wanted hes getting it from somewhere what i want to know is where aaron was a little more interested betting card playing he suggested she waved her hand scornfully i know the firm with whom he does his betting and he owes them a tidy sum already and as to card playing why any of em would clean him out in no time he hasnt the brains of a rabbit its a woman he goes to see her every day at six oclock ive found that out for myself and ive found out the direction he goes in for the rest i have come to you to me aaron exclaimed a little startled yes its part of your job aint it supposing it was a divorce i wanted i should have to go to a lawyer shouldnt i im not imagining you hang about street corners yourself but youve got to employ some one to have him watched and youve got to begin this afternoon i can give you a start all right from luncheon time hell bring me anywhere i saymilan grillroom today at two oclock we shall leave there perhaps at halfpast three and hell drive me home from that point hell have to be watched he may come in for an hour or he may not but its where he goes to afterwards that i want to know will you take this job on mr rodd with pleasure he agreed its a little out of my line but i think i can arrange it then thats that the lady remarked rising ive got to be at my dressmakers at halfpast ring me up when youve anything to report aaron rodd bowed his client down the stairs went back to his office and threw the windows wide open then he telephoned for the poet i am going to do a disgraceful thing he told him upon his arrival im going to betray a clients confidence would it well out easier with the help of a matutinal the poet suggested with a glance at the clock my throats as dry as a limekiln this morning aaron shook his head and told the story now get at it he enjoined as he bundled him out its your job not mine and i have a letter to write the poet a few days later paid an afternoon call he rang the bell of a flat in northumberland court enquired for mrs abrahams and after a moments hesitation was shown into a small drawingroom in which half a dozen people were seated the lady who was evidently a hostess a large jewishlooking woman rose from her place on the couch and regarded him with mingled distrust and curiosity the poet however who had seen jack lovejoy in a corner of the room was not in the least abashed you havent forgotten me i hope mrs abrahams he said bending gallantly over her hesitating hand i met you at my aunts lady sittingleys and you were kind enough to say that i might come and see you sometime i ventured to bring you the small offering i promised youmy poems bound now i am thankful to say with a little more dignity than when we last met mrs abrahams face cleared slightly but she remained somewhat disturbed of course you are mr cresswell arent you the poet i remember the curious stories there were about the beginning of your popularity you have really brought me that book how charming of you i have promised myself this pleasure for a long time cresswell assured her let me see she went on making room for him by her side when was it that i met you at your aunts i have no memory even for such inspiring events he confessed ingenuously but i think it was about three months ago she sighed gently this terrible war she murmured makes it difficult to remember anything you will have some tea mr cresswell let me introduce you to professor david the poet bowed to his neighbour and glanced around the little circle winding up with a nod to lovejoy who seemed hopelessly out of place they were for the most part a very gloomy and serious little company i interrupted an interesting conversation i am sure the poet declared genially may it not continue there was a moments rather awkward silence and mrs abrahams sighed alas she said i am afraid there was nothing original about our conversation this afternoon it was the waralways the war cresswell balanced his plate upon his knee sipped his tea and talked commonplace nonsense for a quarter of an hour then he got up to leave coming my way lovejoy he enquired the young actor hesitated for a moment and then acquiesced mrs abrahams bade them both farewell she extended to neither of them any invitation to return rather a heavy sort of crowd for you isnt it cresswell asked as they descended in the lift mrs abrahams was kind to me when i first came to london lovejoy remarked a little vaguely i promised id look in there some day and i happened to be near this afternoon just so the poet murmured as they paused at the corner of the street so long jack lovejoy stepped into a taxi and was driven away westwards cresswell crossed the road turned into whitehall made his way into a block of public buildings and after half an hours delay was shown into the presence of an importantlooking gentleman who bade him take a seat and peered at him doubtfully over the top of his eyeglasses sir lionel his visitor began i have come to you because i have some information which should be exceedingly valuable to the home branch of the secret service young man the official replied you are the fifteenth caller within the last few hours who has brought me information guaranteed to save the empire lucky number the fifteenth the poet remarked cheerfully do you happen to know mrs abrahams of northumberland court i know her slightly sir lionel admitted she is a friend of several members of the cabinet why isnt she interned cresswell demanded she is a german her husband was born in england but she is a redhot german all the same the young man persisted i have been making enquiries about her myself and i find that for years before the war she was doing nothing but run down the culture and customs of this country as compared with germany the official shrugged his shoulders there is no information that i am aware of against mrs abrahams he said and you must remember that she is as i told you a friend of several members of the cabinet they would not be likely to listen to anything against her what a country the poet sighed what officialdom what methods of making war have you anything against mrs abrahams sir lionel enquired i have was the prompt reply i have no proof to offer because i am an unofficial person and i cannot take those steps which are necessary to procure proof but i can assure you that every afternoon from four till six mrs abrahams drawingroom in the northumberland court is a bureau for the meeting of various persons whose interests are inimical to this country dear me the other exclaimed blandly what do they do there i cant tell that cresswell admitted my idea is that they each bring information of various sorts which mrs abrahams transmits to germany isnt that rather an assumption on your part an assumption with a very definite background the poet persisted unruffled for instance take this afternoon amongst mrs abrahams visitors were professor david who has spent half his life in germany has stumped this country lecturing on german ideals and since the war has maintained a sedulous and enigmatic silence there were also present mr halston who married a german and has had to resign his seat in parliament owing to his doubtful sympathies jack lovejoy the germanamerican actor two men who from their conversation are i gathered censors and the minister of a country whom we all know quite well to be inimical to us these men meet every afternoon they arent there for fun are they and it isnt by chance that they all have the same point of view sir lionel stifled what seemed suspiciously like a yawn you must forgive me if i seem a little unmoved he observed but we hear so many of these vague stories the matter shall be looked into mr cresswell but i may as well warn you at once that mrs abrahams has several friends in the cabinet and they are not likely to countenance any proceedings unfavourable to her the poet rose from his chair thank you sir lionel he said humbly i begin to realise what that a friend of a cabinet minister in this government can do no wrong the young man declared picking up his hat aaron rodd and the poet lunched together the next day at the milan miss pamela keane saw them from the other end of the room where she was talking to the matre dhtel about a table and at once came over towards them well she asked aaron rodd i have some information already the latter replied i am not in a position to make a definite report but if it interests you to know it i do not think that mr lovejoys afternoon philanderings are of an amorous nature say do you hear that she exclaimed her face suddenly lightening if it interests me to know it isnt that exactly what i came to you for well cant you give me an idea what he is up to then not at present aaron rodd regretted but you might if you would help me with another hint get on with it then the lady urged he may come in at any moment can you tell me in which direction his sympathies lie with regard to the war miss pamela keane was for a moment serious then she shrugged her shoulders well you know she said there are a good many of us americans who think that great britains been asking for trouble for some years back a little too much of the lord almighty you know i shouldnt say that jack was overmuch in sympathy with you britishers that helps aaron rodd admitted in two or three days at the most i think i can let you have a report so far as i can see at present he added i think that it will be satisfactory to you say youre smarter than you look mr rodd she declared as she turned away with a little nod come round and see me any time the two men finished their luncheon and walked round to scotland yard inspector ditchwater for whom they enquired received them with some surprise gentlemen he said this is a most unexpected pleasure we have come aaron rodd began to lay certain information before you which has come to me professionally and to ask for your aid the facts are these a certain mrs abrahams who is a german woman by birth married to an anglicised german jew who was naturalised fifteen years ago is in the habit of receiving a little circle of friends every afternoon these friends are every one of them of more or less german sympathies although they some of them occupy public posts in this country one of them i have reason to know is receiving money continually from mrs abrahams i have no proof of anything and i am not in a position to proceed far enough in the matter to secure it the authority of the law is needed my friend here mr cresswell has been to the home office and has interviewed sir lionel rastall he however declines to intervene in the matter because mrs abrahams who is a woman of a great deal of superficial culture and many acquaintances is a friend of several cabinet ministers if sir lionel declines to interfere the inspector pointed out what can we do get on to the track and find some proof aaron rodd suggested there isnt any one can stop you then from behaving in a commonsense manner and lose our promotion and get snubbed for our pains the detective remarked i dont care much about the job mr rodd thanking you all the same i dont mind telling you that mrs abrahams was on the list of suspected persons kept here and has been crossed off at the special instructions of a highlyplaced personage it isnt my business to interfere with her or her doings the two visitors withdrew a little perplexed the poet however was undaunted my friend he said this was to be my adventure and i tell you ive a trump card left yet come along they paid one more call at a large and imposing establishment no great distance away after a wait of nearly an hour an orderly came in the chief will see you and your friend mr cresswell he announced be as quick as you can please the poet who loved words showed that he knew how to dispense with them he shook hands with the somewhat grizzledlooking handsome soldier who welcomed them this is my friend mr rodd a solicitor he said sir horace i have put my hand by accident upon a nest of conspiracy within a quarter of a mile from here the home office or the police wont touch it because the woman chiefly concerned is persona grata with cabinet ministers will you take it on i will sir horace promised if theres anything in it get on with your information the womans name is abrahams and she has a flat in the northumberland court the poet continued i followed a young man there the other afternoon who is born a german but calls himself an american mrs abrahams was entertaining a small party of friends every one of whom is of german sympathies although two are employed as censors by his majestys government the young man i followed is drawing money from her nearly every week and spends most of his spare time motoring round london with one of the new naval air defence commanders that all pretty well the poet admitted but theres espionage work going on there every afternoon sounds probable the other agreed now what do you want me to do i cant raid the place without more information lend me two men and ill take the risk of something turning up the poet begged sir horace scribbled a few lines on a piece of paper get out with you he said my regards to your aunt show this to the orderly in room c and hell give you a couple of plainclothes policemen the poet gripped aaron rodds arm triumphantly as they stepped outside a man he exclaimed a man at last it was two days before anything fresh happened then about halfpast five in the afternoon aaron rodd and the poet who had wandered round by the front of the northumberland court to see that their watchers were in position almost ran into the arms of a huge roughly dressed man with closecropped brown beard a man who looked illatease in his clothes and walked with a rolling gait my god the poet muttered its the dutchman come on aaron they turned round and followed him at a short distance he entered the northumberland court they followed him a few minutes later and cresswell addressed the hallporter whom he knew slightly my names cresswell he said im on a government job tell me what flat that man asked for who has just gone in number sixtyseven sir the man repliedmrs abrahams seen him here before he comes about once a week sir generally on a sunday i shant move from here cresswell declared turning to his companion i shall hold on to that chap myself if he comes out before we can get the men together will you hurry aaron theres one at the corner of parliament street and the others here a quiet voice said behind its all right mr cresswell ive sent for jimmy i saw that man go in know who he is i do that the poet assented his ships been searched twice the inspector went on we had a secret service man on board the last time they crossed nothing was discovered but hes under suspicion when i saw him turn in here i thought things might be coming our way inspector cresswell asked eagerly your powers will allow you to hold him wont they i think ill have to stretch them a bit sir the man replied well wait till he comes out youd better let the hallporter get an extra constable this dutchman is a pretty difficult customer to tackle the hallporter who had been divided between curiosity and nervousness departed with alacrity the men spread themselves out a little the poet and aaron rodd affected great interest in the lighting of cigarettes a small boy in buttons eyed them with immense inquisitiveness there was something up he whispered the news to the liftboy who had strolled out for a breath of fresh air a ripple of electrical interest thrilled the group the hallporter returned an unwilling constable in the rear whats this he enquired of the elder of the two plainclothes men i cant leave my beat unless theres a charge the man showed him a badge the constable saluted wait just outside the former whispered the hallporter suddenly thrust his head through the swing doors party youre enquiring for sir has just come out of number two he announced hes stepping into a taxi there was a rush for the door which the poet led the taxicab was disappearing round the corner as they reached the entrance of the next block of flats the hallporter still dangling his whistle watched their approach with amazement what addressthat taxi the inspector asked quickly monicos shaftesbury avenue another taxi quick the man blew his whistle a taxicab from the rank obeyed the summons the fellow cant suspect anything if hes really gone to the monico the inspector observed they all crowded into the vehicle in a few minutes they were at the caf the poet gave a little sigh of relief as he peered eagerly around somehow or other he felt that this was his own special adventure and that the onus of its success rested upon him at a table a little way in the room the dutchman was seated with a huge tumbler of what seemed to be brandy and water in front of him he was in the act of striking a match to light a cigar which was already in the corner of his mouth suddenly his eyes fell upon the poet a vague sense of recognition coupled with a premonition of danger seemed to oppress him his frame seemed to grow tenser even underneath his clothes one could fancy that his muscles were stiffening he watched the four men approach and those few of the neighbouring loungers who chanced to be looking that way held their breaths the atmosphere around seemed to have become electric the inspector stood by the dutchmans table although he was not in uniform his official bearing was unmistakable i want you my man he said you must come with me to the policestation why i am acting under special orders the inspector told him i can satisfy you as to my authority the thing is are you coming quietly apparently the dutchman was not for pandemonium ensued the inspector was no lightweight and he was on guard but his adversarys rush was irresistible he went crashing over against an opposite table and the dutchmans left fist sent the second man prostrate the inspector however was not yet done for and aaron rodd and cresswell suddenly sprang simultaneously into the fray men and women leapt from their tables there were shrieks a crash of breaking glass the policeman who had been knocked down staggered to his knees and blew his whistle furiously the dutchman kicking shaking even trying to bite the poets fingers which had somehow seized his throat dragged his assailants yard by yard towards the door the whole place was in an uproar suddenly the swingdoors were pushed open two uniformed constables hurried in even then the dutchman did not abandon the struggle he wrenched himself almost free from the three men who had momentarily relaxed their hold dealt the leading constable a terrific blow which only just missed the side of his head and knocked his helmet into pulp that however was the end the other constable was a powerful fellow and within thirty seconds the dutchman was handcuffed there was a crowd now upon the pavement the dutchman his face covered with blood and his eyes glaring like the eyes of a wild animal was bustled into a taxi aaron and the poet were left behind they were neither of them much the worse for the struggle but aarons collar was torn to pieces and the poets coat had been ripped down one side a waiter was hovering around them admiringly bring you something to drink gentlemen he suggested they drank a brandy and soda each then the poet rose he was conscious of various bruises but he was very happy home and seclusion i think for a time my friend he said what a heavenly scrap late that evening a very immaculately dressed young man of most superior appearance discovered the poet in an easy chair in his club awaiting the midnight rush of journalists and actors the young man presented a card you will find my name there sir he said and also the service on behalf of which i pay you this visit cresswell scrutinised the card and sat up in his chair have a drink he suggested his visitor begged to be excused the chief asked me to find you at the earliest possible moment he announced to first of all express his thanks and the thanks of his department for your valuable services had the dutchman got the goods on him the poet asked eagerly he had indeed he was carrying documents of high importance which were obviously destined for our enemies the young man said their contents are to a certain extent a secret and i am to ask you to add to your services by allowing the matter to slip from your memory whats going to become of mrs abrahams cresswell enquired we received an indirect suggestion tonight from the home office the young man replied that the lady in question should be cautioned if it is any relief to you let me assure you that my chief is not the sort of man to listen to such tosh the lady will be interned whatever her friends may attempt on her behalf two of the other people implicated both in the censors office i regret to say will be shot you appear to have discovered a bureau which existed for the purpose of collecting and dispatching abroad every week various items of information likely to be of service to our enemies whatll the dutchman get the young man hesitated i have already somewhat exceeded my latitude he said gravely may i ask you to consider what i have said in confidence to forget this little adventure and never again in this life to worry about the dutchman i wont the poet promised with a chuckle by the by what about jack lovejoy there is a reference only to some promised information from a person whom we concluded to be that young man was the reply he has been asked to leave the country within twentyfour hours the young man took his leave and a few moments later aaron rodd appeared he was wearing a pearl pin of wonderful quality which the poet eyed curiously a little farewell present the former explained as he settled down from miss pamela keane chapter viii the yellow eye at a few minutes before the popular dining hour aaron rodd having selected a table ordered in consultation with the chief matre dhtel a small dinner and possessed himself of a theatre guide sat in the reception lounge of the carlton grillroom awaiting the arrival of henriette there was a mirror exactly opposite to him and as he sipped his cocktail he caught a glimpse of his own face he set down his glass momentarily startled somehow it seemed to him like being brought face to face with the ghost of his youth he rose to his feet and lounged over towards the mirror on the pretext of examining some illustrated papers in the intervals of glancing at them he looked furtively at his own reflection trying to account for the change he saw there at the poets earnest solicitation he had visited a firstclass tailor had bought the right shape of collar had learnt to tie his evening bow with the proper twist a personally conducted visit to a fashionable hairdresser had followed and his fine black hair no longer ragged and unkempt was brushed back from a face which seemed even to its owner to have changed in some marvellous way during the last few months he was without a doubt younger there was a new expression about his lips from which the hardness seemed to have gone and curiously enough he was conscious that notwithstanding all his anxieties never more poignant than at this particular moment life had taken a sudden and sympathetic turn with him since the coming of harvey grimm he had at last been lifted up from that weary rut of depression and illbeing but since the coming of henriette he had been transported bodily into the world where human beings live where the flowers have a different perfume and the sun shines always even if sometimes from behind the clouds but you then also are vain a rather surprised very amused voice exclaimed almost in his ears why you remind me of mr cresswell standing there preening yourself before the mirror for a moment he felt almost embarrassed then he smiled as he bent over henriettes fingers i was wondering he confessed what could have brought so great a change into my lifeand then you came her eyes softened as she looked at him her lips parted she studied him for a moment apprisingly you are changed you know she decided you look younger you seem somehow to have moved from one world into another you were looking very melancholy that first day when we met in the gardens i do not think that adventures have disagreed with you if one could only stop them now he exclaimed eagerly she laid her finger upon her lip the matre dhtel stood bowing before them madame will come this way henriette approved of the table approved of the dinner approved of her companion as for aaron rodd the shadows which sometimes terrified him seemed to have passed far away into the background he was deaf and dumb to the voices and glances of their neighbours attracted by his companions unanalysable elegance her aristocratic little face with its flawless complexion her little airforeign perhaps but all the more attractiveof quaint individual distinction she wore no ornaments except the pearls which hung from her neck her hair to his untutored eyes might have been arranged with her own fingers her gown as always was black this time of chiffon and it was not for him to know that its simplicity represented the last word in fashion he simply found her adorable and dinner was almost concluded before she uttered a little cry why we have not yet decided what theatre to go to he sent for a messenger do try she begged and get some seats for the casino i want so much to see the revue the boy brought them a plan of the theatre and aaron secured a small box very reluctantly they left their table a short time later i have loved my dinner so she declared as they sat together in the taxi i think that i am getting greedy everything tasted so good and i think that i too am greedy her companion whispered leaning towards her because i want so mucheven the greatest thing in the world could have to offer she suddenly clutched his arm with her white fingers drew it tightly to her hold my fingers please she begged sit just like this dont let us spoil anything will you be content please he leaned a little towards her her eyes were half pleading with his half doubtful i will be content he promised if she drew away from him a moment later i did not mean to let you kiss me she declared naively i meant to if i could he confessed she laughed a little hysterically but not unhappily let us pretend that we have behaved like a couple of bad children she said because we must not just now talk of these things that was just a slip a slip he repeated a very wonderful delightful slip she murmured and here we are they found themselves soon in a little box small even for two people henriette settled down almost from the first to enjoy the performance she laughed at the whimsical frenchman applauded the versatile leading lady entered with wonderful facility into the spirit of the place and then some halfhour after their entrance aaron rodd felt the fingers which he was holding under cover of a programme suddenly twitch he glanced up to his amazement all the joy and lightheartedness had passed from her face her features seemed as though they might have been carved out of a piece of ivory her lips were a little parted her eyes filled with fear she was gazing with strange intensity upon the figure of a girl who heralded by much applause had suddenly bounded on to the stage he leaned towards her is anything wrong henriette he asked softly she roused herself a little yes she whispered that girldo you see what she is wearingaround her neck he glanced down on to the stage in puzzled fashion the girl in question french and a newcomer who was singing a little song of the boulevards with a good deal of appropriate action wore no jewellery except a single rather curious yellow stone suspended from her neck by a platinum chain you mean that yellow thing she looked at him in surprise but of course you do not know she exclaimed that is the great yellow diamond it belongs to to whom he interrupted eagerly to leopoldsto my brothers collection she explained hesitatingly he was puzzled for a moment then the sense of her words and their import began to dawn upon him you mean that the stone is amongst those that your brother has acquired he continued diffidentlyone of those he has not yet tried to have recut yes she murmured there was a moments embarrassed silence henriette was obviously distraught she watched the rather fascinating figure upon the stage with strained eyes it isnt she went on turning abruptly to her companion that i mind if leopold chooses to amuse himself he has probably lent the girl the diamond for her first appearance i see that it is her debut tonight it is not that but he is so rash so daring that stone is known throughout the worldits history its description have been published everywhere why if there is anyone in the house who knows anything of the history of gems they will recognise it it will be tracedso easily traced to leopold oh what folly i must go and see her i must go at once she rose to her feet they drew a little into the background of the box i am afraid it will be rather difficult aaron rodd warned her it must be arranged she insisted we will go together and find some one at the box office who will take a message round they spent a more or less uncomfortable ten minutes at the box office where they were assured that owing to the smallness of the theatre visits to the artistes were not permitted the manager at last appeared and began an explanation on similar lines henriette interrupted him monsieur she begged it is a great exception there is something which mademoiselle should know something which it is very important for her to know and i am the only person who can tell her you will make an exception please this once the manager was quite human and a person of discrimination he made no further difficulty if you will both please follow me he invited mademoiselle larilly has just gone off he led them by a tortuous way to the back of the stage and knocked at the door of a room entrez was the shrill response their guide ushered henriette and aaron rodd into a tiny little apartment prettily furnished notwithstanding the bare floors mademoiselle larilly was standing before a pierglass admiring herself she swept round at their entrance madame she murmured in surprise the manager spoke a hasty word or two of explanation in french and disappeared henriette waited until the door was closed then she turned to the girl mademoiselle she said i owe you perhaps an apology for this unusual visit i come for your sake as well as my own and anothers will you tell me please who lent you the diamond which you wear the girl held it tightly to her bosom it has not been lent to me she declared it is given but that is not possible henriette protested do you know that the jewel you are wearing is worth nearly a million francs the girl started but she simply shrugged her shoulders oh la la she exclaimed what do i care it was given me by a gentleman not an englishman and no one has any right to ask me questions about it i do not receive here mademoiselle i have but a few minutes to rest if you would please go henriette made efforts to modify the haughtiness of her tone the air of aloofness with which she seemed shrouded mademoiselle larilly she said i will not believe that you wish evil things to the gentleman who lent or gave you that jewel yet believe me you will bring harm upon him if you wear it in public you will bring a greatthe greatest of all misfortunes the girl opened her hands a little and gazed at the gem she shook her head that i cannot help she decided it is his affair he must know better than you i promised him to wear it he may even be here tonight i shall keep my word mademoiselle henriette began then the words died away on her lips the door of the dressingroom had opened and closed without any knock mr paul brodie stood there suave and with a little smile upon his lips he bowed politelya gesture which seemed to include every one mademoiselle larilly glanced at him contemptuously but who allowed you to enter she demanded i do not receive here i will send for the manager it is an impertinence when people come to my room without permission mr brodie held out his hand deprecatingly miss larilly he begged pray do not disturb yourself i am one of those who must go anywhere they choose at any time indeed she exclaimed indignantly you are not the owner of the theatre or the author of the revue and i do not know you i beg you to leave at once young lady mr brodie continued his eyes fastened upon the gem which hung from her neck i have not the good fortune to be either of the gentlemen you mention but i represent a force which has to be reckoned with by lawabiding people i am of the police she stood quite still once more her hands clutched at the jewel which rested on her bosom the police she repeated but i do not understand what do youwhat do the police want with me in my room now come miss larilly mr brodie went on soothingly its nothing you need worry about i just want your permission to examine the jewel which you are wearing no she refused sharply no one shall do that the jewel has been lent to me lent to me on one conditionthat i permit no one to touch it look here young lady brodie protested quietly but forcibly i dont want to make any disturbance and id sooner deal with this matter in a friendly fashion all the same if youre out for trouble i can soon bring you plenty of it come it wont take you long to slip that off your neck she began to look a little frightened she glanced towards henriette as though for guidance henriette however seemed almost on the point of breaking down herself she had sunk into the chair which aaron had fetched courage aaron whispered in her ear that brute is watching you brodie had drawn closer to mademoiselle larilly she held her hands tightly against her bosom if you come a step further she cried i will shriek i will call the artistes to defend methe manager you must come to me when i am not playing if you would ask questions young lady the detective said with a new sternness you can call the manager if you will and i shall repeat to him what i say to you if you do not suffer me to examine that jewel i shall stop the performance and have you taken to the policestation she was obviously terrified now the rouge upon her cheeks seemed like a great daub of red she set her teeth her hands flew apart it is a miserable country she exclaimed passionately in france this could not happen look then at the stone and go but rememberi will give it up to no one if you take it you must drag it from my neck and i will follow you shrieking even on to the stage i will not be robbed how do i know that you are of the police you may be a thief yourself the stonei tell you that it is worth a fortune i can well believe it brodie assented calmly one moment if you please he held the stone in the palm of his hand and fitted a magnifying glass into his eye there was a moments silence henriette suddenly gripped her companions hand mademoiselle larilly stood there panting her bosom rising and falling quickly there was murder in her eyes presently brodie let the stone fall replaced the magnifying glass in his pocket he stood for a moment as though thinking then he turned towards the door miss larilly he said looking back at her my apologies the bauble which you are wearing is a worthless piece of yellow crystal worth perhaps twenty pounds i was deceivedas was perhaps the young lady over yonder he added with a little ironical bowby a wonderful resemblance he closed the door quietly behind him there was a queer silence in the room henriette was deathly pale relief and bewilderment were struggling in her face the french girls expression had become electrically transformed with a sudden little gesture she leaned towards the closed door her hand flashed in front of her face her gesture was significant if vulgar it is worth twenty pounds my bauble is it she mocked and he thinks that big ugly man that i would come on to the stage with a bauble round my neck worth twenty pounds eh but he is not a gentleman of france that an inner door suddenly opened leopold brinnen appeared and behind him the tall slender figure of monsieur larkson the leading french actor in the revue with your permission brinnen began bowing to mademoiselle larilly henriette he stopped short in amazement henriette rose to her feet and came towards him leopold she exclaimed talking to him rapidly in french what have you done how dare you for all our sakes run these awful risks if the man brodie had not been a fool if he had known anything of jewels if he had not been blind where should we have been at this moment do you think they would have let mademoiselle go until she had told from whence came the yellow eye oh but you are so reckless take it away from her quickly hide it leopold listened to her words a little gravely will you tell me my sister he enquired what you are doing here i have dined and am spending the evening with mr aaron rodd she explained we sit in the box here and i recognise the yellow eye i hurry here mademoiselle receives me i beg her to take it off not to wear it i warn her that there is danger she scoffs at me and then brodie comes but that manhe must be mad he held the stone in his hand the young man smiled quietly then he listened at the door which led into the passage and softly turned the key he glanced towards mademoiselle ah but if you all will she exclaimed behold her hand disappeared for a moment down her back she threw the platinum chain and stone which she was wearing on to the dressingtable in a moment another flashed upon her bosom you see she went on how simple i obeyed on the stage i wore that great beautiful stone and even before i had reached my room in the passage the other hung in its place leopold brinnen smiled amiably nevertheless he was a little apologetic as he turned towards his sister it is that man brodie he sighed he is so persistent and yet he has not the wits for success he wearies me with his blunders this is just a little lesson a little lesson henriette repeated reproachfully with a sob in her throat which might have cost us he waved his hand ah no little sister he protested you take too gloomy a view even paul brodie he continued lowering his voice so that it was inaudible at the other end of the room has not yet succeeded in forging the missing link between jeremiah sands and captain brinnen of the belgian artillery you permit now madame he went on turning back to the others that i present to you my sister and monsieur aaron rodd mademoiselle larilly he explained is the wife of monsieur larkson here whom i take the liberty also to present what do you say which stone shall mademoiselle wear when she sings her next song one may play with fire a little too long aaron rodd observed leopold his sister implored clasping her hands the young man bowed it shall be as you will he promised holding out his hand and accepting the stone which mademoiselle larilly was eagerly pressing upon him into my pocket with this one then madame shall dance for the first time in her life with a worthless bauble around her throat but there shall be a recompense i insist we will all sup together at giros you agree and you rodd my sister he added will i am sure be delighted to see more of you madame and your husband it will give me the greatest pleasure henriette assented a call boy came shouting down the passage giros at eleventhirty brinnen reminded them all it shall be au revoir then madame henriette said as she passed through the door which aaron was holding open for her there was a great relief in henriettes face as she leaned back in the darkest corner of the box and closed her eyes the atmosphere of the evening however had departed she was no longer full of that quivering electrical gaiety she watched the rest of the performance with interest and talked now and then to aaron but their homeward drive afterwards was performed almost in silence she rested her fingers in his and leaned back forgive me if i rest she murmured i am terrified i shake now when i think of that moment it is all over now he reminded her try and be quiet for a little time presently she sat up listen she said it will be half an hour at least before they can arrive at giros madame must change her toilette as madames last toilette had been one of pink silk in which there was very much more stocking than skirt the suggestion seemed probable what would you like to do aaron asked i would like to call back at the milan she begged i nearly always see my grandfather for a moment before he goes to sleep and i can rest and bathe my eyes you will not mind waiting of course not he redirected the driver and they drew up a few minutes later at the milan she descended at the court entrance and crossed over at once to the lift i will not ask you up she said i shall find you here perhaps insay ten minutes he assented and bought an evening paper in less than the time she had stated the lift stopped and she reappeared to his surprise she had taken off her hat she came towards him with a strange look in her face he could see the tears quivering in her eyes dear friend she whispered be kind to me i have had a great blow my grandfather died this evening while we were awayonly an hour ago he murmured an eager word or two of sympathy she laid her hand upon his arm will you go please at once to giros she begged him and tell leopold try and prevent him if you can entering the supperroom there are so many things that will happen now she went on please go quickly see she raised her fingers to his lips he caught them and kissed them then she turned away and he hurried outside jumped into a taxi and drove to giros leopold brinnen and a little party of guests were standing in the hall the former frowned as he entered alone where is my sister he demanded aaron took him by the arm captain brinnen he said i am sorry but i am the bearer of bad news your grandfather died this evening the young man stood perfectly still for a moment dead he muttered poor fellow dead inside the room the music was crashing and the hum of conversation was already swelling to a tumult a couple of early dancers were whirling round the room brinnen turned to his guests i am so sorry he explained mr rodd here has brought me bad news a near relative of mine has died suddenly you must excuse my joining you luigi will serve the supper there was a little murmur of sympathy his bohemian friends crowded silently around him one by one they shook his handa queer little function then he turned away and stood for a moment on the pavement outside aaron rodd by his side mr rodd he said my grandfathers death may make a difference in many ways aaron rodd straightened himself he was never sure of the demeanour of this young adventurer who seemed for the most part to treat life as a jest in what way he asked brinnen replied with a question can you communicate with mr harvey grimm aaron shook his head i do not even know where he does his work forgive me for reminding you he added that your sister is in great distress the young man stepped into a taxi it is necessary that i see harvey grimm as soon as possible he insisted harvey grimm wont be hurried over his work aaron declared for your own sake he is better out of sight until it is concluded shall i tell the man to go to the milan brinnen nodded he leaned out of the window for a moment however before the cab started mr aaron rodd he said do you mind if i speak to you for a moment with perfect frankness not in the least aaron assured him promptly in some respects brinnen continued confidentially i am inclined to like you but on the whole i have come to the conclusion that you are a very simple fellow that is all chapter ix the vengeance of rosa letchowiski the small boy assumed an air of vast importance he leaned over the counter and with mysterious gestures arrested the progress of his cousin through the shop rosa ive got something to thay to you motht important he announced come right over here she paused and swung around a little unwillingly her scarlet underlip was thrust outwards she walked with her hand upon her hip not averse to impressing even this young cousin of hers with all the allurements of her slipshod finery i thay rosa you look fine the boy declared admiringly lithen now you told me to keep my eyes open if ever i should see any more of mr levy eh the girls face was suddenly alight she moved close to the counter youve heard of him she exclaimed eagerly you know where he is the boy nodded many times he placed a finger upon his lips in his eyes was the glint of avarice you promithed me a shilling he reminded her i worked hard i know now just where he ith you can see him for yourthelf its worth a shilling rosa eh the girls hand dived into the recesses of her halffastened skirt she produced a cheap purse of imitation russia leather and solemnly counted out a sixpence and six coppers you tell me the truth she adjured him parting with the coins reluctantly honest and sure the boy promised sweeping them into his pocket he came back again tuesday night hes at work now in the repairing room you little shark his cousin cried indignantly why i should have found out myself if id gone straight in to grandfather maybe and maybe not he answered with his finger upon his nose and his hand guarding the pocket where the shilling reposed the girl was breathing quickly with excitement the loss of the shilling after all was a slight thing to a girl earning mans wages listen she enjoined dont you say ive been im off back to tidy up i shall be here in half an hour he wont be gone by then sure not was the confident assent he brought his valise heth come to stop rosa almost tiptoed her way out of the shop dived into the stream of people and disappeared it was rather more than half an hour before her small cousin with palms outstretched upon the counter struggling to sell a oneandsixpenny brooch to a girl who had a shilling to spend glanced up and recognised her his look of admiration was a genuine tribute for a moment the glamour of the transaction upon which he was engaged faded my rosa you do look fine he exclaimed them clothes must have cost something she nodded haughtilya vision of cheap furs with a black hat from which flared one great scarlet flower she carried a bag of some jingling metal in her hand her patent shoes squeaked loudly she displayed at least twelve inches of silkclad limbs and she diffused little waves of a perfume carefully selected on account of its farreaching qualities the customer who knew her by sight gazed after her admiringly thats your cousin rosa isnt it she asked the small boy nodded withdrawing his eyes from the disappearing figure with reluctance it must be wonderful to earn enough money to dress like that he observed enviously my did you see those furs the firtht ornament rosa ever bought from me wath one of these brooches he went on reverting to the subject in hand two shillings she paid my dear and eighteenpence im asking you jutht because i like to do business when the old man aint here maybe you could pay the extra sixpence next saturday rosa swept through the door and descended the two steps into the dingy sittingroom in a highbacked chair drawn up to the scanty fire his head a little on one side sat her grandfather asleep she passed on tiptoe through the room down the narrow passage and softly turned the handle of the workshop door the air was vibrating slightly with the monotonous hum of a concealed dynamo bending low over the board with huge magnifying glasses in his eyes mr levy with a small bright instrument in his hand was absorbed in some delicate process of refashioning a little glittering mass carefully held between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand some instinct told the girl to keep silence she watched him breathlessly until the consciousness of her presence reached him through his finer senses he raised his knife from its task and turned swiftly around touched a knob with his foot and the dynamo gradually slackened speed and died away you he exclaimed removing the glasses from his eyes she saw the stone upon which he had been working transferred swiftly to his pocket she was immensely curious nevertheless the personal element came first youre a nice man arent you eh she demanded coming slowly towards him what about that little dinner we were going to have eh and a theatre you just leave your place without a word of warning i wonder grandfather took you back again my dear young lady he began rosa she pouted rosa then he went on pleasure is a great thing but business is a greater i have been away on business the business i spoke to you of now you see i am back again the other place didnt suit me and grandfather took you on without a word as you see what is it you are working at she asked curiously i never knew you had a dynamo here or that you needed one for watch repairing it is an idea of my own he told her you see it isnt only watches but every article of jewellery we repair it saves another assistant what were you working at when i came in she persisted a piece of glass cutting it up into a few of those beautiful diamond brooches you see in the window he explained but dont lets talk about the work how well you look she tossed her head a lot you care about how well i look she retorted going away like that with never a word by the by he enquired suddenly how did you come in where was your grandfather grandfather was asleep in the easy chair she told him i came through on tiptoe like to keep yourself private down here dont you part of my training he replied i cant work unless i am absolutely alone and undisturbed she leaned against his bench and raised her foot as though to look at the patent tip of her shoe he was privileged to behold a goodly number of inches of silkclad limb what are you doing tonight she asked after work he shook his head disconsolately your grandfather is a hard taskmaster he grumbled i generally stick on here until im tired out well see about that she promised would you like oh bother she broke off i promised to go to the pictures with stolly wykes her companions faint sigh of regret was very cleverly assumed perhaps another evening then he suggested youre such a slippery customer she went on here today and gone tomorrow sort of chap i suppose i could put stolly off she went on meditatively raising her eyes and looking at him i wouldnt do that he protested i cant help thinking how disappointed i should be in his place plenty of feeling for others you have havent you she observed sarcastically i dont know as i care about going out with stolly hes always worrying me to get engaged ive wondered more than once he told her confidentially why you havent been engaged long ago how old are you twenty i am twentytwo she confessed and if im not engaged its because i havent been overanxious i dont think much of these young fellows round here i feel somehow as though i wanted something different he sighed sympathetically and then as though with an effort turned back to his bench if the old man wakes up and finds im not working he remarked hell be annoyed you can get on with your work then she replied im going to talk to him for a minute or two be good she gave him a little backward nod enigmatically encouraging and left him closing the door softly behind her she made her way into the stuffy little parlour and shook her grandfather by the shoulder wake up old man she exhorted nice thing going to sleep over the fire in the middle of the afternoon eh whatwhat my dear he exclaimed sitting up its rosa is it ah how beautiful you look rosa but those furswere they very expensive my dear they were rather the girl admitted complacently but im earning good money and i want to get married to get married my dear the old man repeated a little vaguely well well you find some young man with good prospects and moneymoney in his hand mind ive found the young man id like to marry rosa interrupted hes your assistant down there abraham letchowiski stretched out his hands in protest he shook his head vigorously no no my tear he cried you cannot marry him he is just a journeyman repairer he has no money saved he spends too much on his clothes hes a clever workman isnt he oh he is clever the old man admitted very clever indeed but there are many clever people in the world who have not much money look here the girl expostulated youre going to leave david and me your money arent you youve no one else but i have not much the old man whined and i may live quite some time yet youre getting too old to work the girl declared why not take him into partnership bartnership the old man shrieked ah my tear you do not understand i understand the way to deal with you anyhow rosa retorted you wait she walked to the end of the passage and raised her voice mr levy please to come here there was a smothered reply and after a few moments he appeared abraham letchowiski now thoroughly awake sat in the chair wringing his hands rosa he exclaimed i implore you rosa listen to me she cut him short she seemed somehow to dominate the little roomstrong forceful and determined mr levy she announced grandfather has something to say to you he makes such a muddle of things that although it is rather embarrassing i shall say it myself david and i are his heirs he has saved a great deal of money no no my tearno the old man interrupted tearfully he has saved a great deal of money she went on placidly he has no other relatives he is always bothering me to get married i tell him today that i have made up my mind if you are willing mr levy he will take you into partnership we will see that little david is done fairly with later on when you grow older he shall be your partner now grandfather sit up and hear what mr levy has to say for once in his life harvey grimm was taken at a disadvantage he stood speechless and hopelessly astounded rosa held out her hands to him before he knew exactly where he was he was holding one of them so thats all settled the girl pronounced drawing him closer to her now grandfather mr levyedward we must call him nowis going to leave off work at once we are going out to supper and a cinema the old man suddenly struck the table with his clenched fist there was a curious solemnity in his voice i will not have it he cried his eyes flashing all that you have spoken is foolish rosa i will not have this young man for my partner nor shall you have him for your husband even if he were willing why not she demanded because he is not of our faith abraham letchowiski declared solemnly because his name is not levy he is not one of us rosa was taken aback she looked at her prospective suitor incredulously is that true she asked him i dont care twopence whether youre a jew or not but isnt your name levy it is not he confessed why dont you go about under your own name there was a moments silence a sudden understanding leapt into the girls face wait she criedthe dynamo downstairs and those men who came here to search what is it you do in that back room eh there was still silence she passed her arms suddenly through his be sensible she urged i am not a fool i know that grandfather loves money and loves making it so do i if he lets you work secretly in his back room it must be because you make money there well why not you need have no fear of me tell me the truth i shall be faithful i do not mind that you are not a jew i will marry you all the same i like you better than any of the jews i know harvey grimm wiped the perspiration from his forehead it was a situation this for which no foresight could have provided and i abraham letchowiski thundered swear before the god of my fathers that you shall marry none but a jew the girl made a face at him and dragged him back into his easy chair dont you be a silly old man she enjoined times have changed since you were young a girl has to have a husband doesnt she you wouldnt have me marry any of those skimpers that come around here a fit of coughing seized the old man and he was momentarily speechless she turned away from him thats all right she declared confidently hell be reasonable by morning you go and wash and get ready harvey grimm sighed mournfully his wits were serving him at last presenting a tardy possibility of escape miss rosa he said i havent had the chance to say anything you took me by surprise this afternoon perhaps i ought to have told you when we first met but i didnt i am married she stood looking at him for a moment her voluptuous red lips parted her eyebrows contracting married she exclaimed a little hysterically you beast i cant help it he apologised humbly i ought to have told you but i never thought that is why i kept away before i see she murmured with the air of one whose thoughts are far away abraham letchowiski sat up in his chair he mopped his eyes with a yellow handkerchief you see my tear he pointed out feverishly the young man is honesthe tells the truth that is the end is it the girl muttered perhaps anyway he is going to take me out this evening your wife aint here with you is she no he replied she is in america go and get yourself ready then harvey grimm meekly acquiesced and devoted himself for the rest of the evening towards the entertainment of his companion the girls manner was a little queer at the restaurant to which he took herthe best in the neighbourhoodshe appeared to thoroughly enjoy the lavish meal which he provided she even held his hand under the table and smiled many times into his eyes she took his arm as they walked through the streets but in the theatre which she chose in preference to a cinema she sat most of the time silent and absorbed on the way home she clung to his arm when they reached the little jewellers shop she paused let me take you across to your rooms first he suggested she shook her head i want to find my handkerchief she told him i must have left it in the parlour open the door please he obeyed her and they stumbled through the darkened shop down the steps into the close stuffy little apartment the remains of the fire were smouldering upon the hearth but the room was unlit abraham letchowiski and the boy had long since gone to bed suddenly she threw her arms around him kiss me she cried in a choked tone he yielded struggling however against her vehement embrace his hands gripped her shoulders he wrenched himself free he stood on the other side of the table for a moment panting her eyes luminous shone through the darkness at him then suddenly she swung round climbed the two steps passed through the shop and closed the door softly almost immediately she reopened it in the dim street light outside he could see the outline of her figure thank you very much mr married man she said for my evening he made no reply there was a seconds hesitation a last opportunity of which he declined to avail himselfthen the door was closed a few minutes later he locked it went back to his workshop and from a cupboard drew out a whisky bottle and some soda heres a cursed mess he muttered dolefully as he mixed himself a drink mr paul brodie laid down his cigar and newspaper and swung round in his chair to receive a visitor already in his mind a prospective new client a small boy had opened the door the lady sir he announced mr brodie recognised his visitor with a thrill of expectancy say this is miss letchowiski isnt it he exclaimed holding out his hand glad to see you young lady please take a seat rosa ignored the invitation she came up to his desk and leaned over it look here she said youre the man arent you who came messing round my grandfathers jewellery shop a few weeks ago you were after the assistantedward levy well brodie ejaculated eagerly you bungled things or else he was too clever for you rosa continued ive come to tell you that hes back again there now carrying on the same game got an electrical dynamo in the workshop and no end of tools his name aint levy at all and he isnt a jew what do you suppose he is doing there brodie enquired look here the girl went on if i tell you will you swear that you wont get my grandfather into this i think i can promise that was the cautious reply breaking up diamonds thenthats what hes doing the girl confided hes at it now mr brodie showed no signs of excitement but he was already struggling into his overcoat there will probably be a reward for this he said to rosa i shall not forget i dont want your reward the girl replied ive done it just becausewell never mind you go and nab him brodie did not suffer the grass to grow beneath his feet he drove straight to scotland yard and chafed very much at the delay which kept him five minutes from inspector ditchwaters presence inspector he announced as soon as he was ushered into the latters room i want you to give me a man and a warrant at once this time i think ive got a clue that will lead us straight to jerry sands is that so the inspector remarked dryly weve been there before you know see here ditchwater brodie continued youve kind of lost faith in me and i cant say that im altogether surprised but just listen the girl from abraham letchowiskis shop has been up to me today she says that that fellow i went after is back again there hes got a dynamo in the back place and a whole set of tools and is breaking up diamonds just what i suspected before only i couldnt lay my hands on him this time we shall do it the inspector scribbled a few lines on a piece of paper you can take your man he said but dont get me into any trouble over this we cant be raiding peoples premises for ever on suspicion therell be no trouble this time mr brodie promised triumphantly a jealous womans the real thing in our job well i wish you luck the inspector replied if youre really on to jerry sands youre on to a big thing mr brodie with a plainclothes constable took a taxicab to the mile end road the two men entered the shop together david was alone behind the counter what can i show the shentlemen he enquired urbanely we want to speak to your grandfather brodie announced you neednt leave the shop i know the way they passed down the little steps into the stuffy parlour abraham letchowiski was sitting in his chair gazing into the fire and mumbling to himself he looked at the visitors uneasily what do you want here he asked i am not well today i am not speaking of business thats all right mr letchowiski brodie answered its just a word with your assistant were after the uneasiness in the old mans face changed into terror what do you want with him he exclaimed he is a respectable young man a very clever watchmaker he comes from switzerland he has done nothing wrong brodie turned to the constable dont let him move he directed i hear the dynamo stopping he ran down the passage and threw open door the man who had been working at bench turned to face him the whir of the dynamo was slackening but harvey grimm had had no time to collect his tools there were several curiously shaped knives and fine files and chisels lying about brodie saw them and his eyes sparkled edward levy he said i arrest you on the charge of breaking up stolen diamonds i have a constable in the room outside youll have to come up to the policestation with us and be questioned the young man laughed scornfully he pointed to something bright held in the teeth of a small brass vice with a touch of his finger he released it diamonds he scoffed why i am an expert on sham jewellery brodie pressed incautiously forward and harvey grimms left hand swung round with a lightninglike stroke the detective went over like a log groaned for a moment and staggered to his feet harvey grimm pressed him back forced his knotted handkerchief into his mouth and closed and locked the door through which he had entered then he threw off his overall and caught up his coat and overcoat youre a clever fellow paul brodie he said to the writhing figure upon the floor sorry i cant stop to discuss this matter with you he threw a little higher open the window which led into the yard vaulted through and walked swiftly down the entry he strolled into the broad thoroughfare wiping the moisture from his forehead and looking everywhere for a taxi my god he muttered to himself were coming near the end of things listening all the while for footsteps behind which never came he at last hailed a taxicab and was driven to aldgate at the mansion house he alighted and in another taxicab made his way to one of the streets on the north side of the strand here he entered a passageway climbed the stairs past a secondhand clothes shop and on the second flight opened the door of a room with a latchkey which hung from his chain he gave a little murmur of relief as he discovered a young man in a dressinggown seated in an armchair with his feet up on the mantelpiece reading a paperbacked novel the young man bore a remarkable resemblance to mr harvey grimm thank heaven you are in the newcomer exclaimed commencing like lightning to throw off his clothes turn on the bath jimquick as you canand take these clothes down to the shop shove em away anywhere the young man was already busying himself about the place anything wrong sir he asked ive just had the devil of a squeak harvey grimm declared itll be touch and go this time how did i spend the morning we made a point of calling at your tailor sir the young man replied also your hosier we looked in at bendleburys in cork street and we had a cocktailtwo i thinkat fitzs bar capital harvey grimm muttered what did i do last night last night we wore dinner clothes sir the young man went on we dined at romanos alone i trust harvey grimm snapped quite alone sir the young man assented we conversed for a time with two ladies at an adjoining table luigi spoke to us twice harvey grimm bolted through the door and a few moments afterwards there was a sound of splashing when he reappeared a short time later his complexion seemed to have undergone a marvellous change and the most wonderful wig in the world had disappeared the young man helped him into a blue serge suit in five minutes he was dressed my george this is quick work harvey grimm murmured his eyes sparkling theres ten pounds on the table jim put it in your pocket ill drop in tomorrow or the next day clean gloves and my malacca cane dont wait two moments after ive gone get rid of all the clothes i have been wearing in the darkest corner of the store there goes the wig he added throwing it on the fire there wont be any more mile end for a little time get to work like blazes jim and goodbye the young man handed him a sheet of paper there are our movements sir since you left last wednesday you will find about a dozen recognitions a day harvey grimm thrust the paper into his pocket stole swiftly down the stairs paused for a moment on the thresholdit was his one moment of dangerand then strolled jauntily out the street was almost empty a few seconds and he was in the strand he plunged into a tobacconists shop bought halfadozen cigarettes one of which he lit and a few minutes later he climbed the stairs leading to aaron rodds office there was no immediate answer to his knock so he opened the door and stepped inside a tall figure in khaki was standing in front of the lookingglass going through sundry mysterious evolutions harvey grimm stared at him in blank amazement good heavens he gasped its cresswell the poet turned round and saluted harvey grimm in jaunty fashion cheero harvey he exclaimed you see ive taken the plunge fine fellow harvey grimm murmured tell us about it i came in to tell aaron the poet went on but he is for some unaccountable reason absent the fact is at first i didnt feel the call of this sort of thing at all in my soul i hate war today that is in its external and material aspectsthe ugliness the bloodshed the mangled bodies and all the rest of it but a few days ago old harris asked me to write them a patriotic poem i tell you i no sooner got into the swim of it than i felt the fever burning in my own veins i will read you the poem shortly it will create a great sensation the first person whom it brought into khaki was myself you seem to have done the job pretty quickly harvey grimm observed i joined an officers training corps only a few days ago cresswell explained i went to my tailors for a uniform and found that he had one made for a man exactly my height who was down with pneumonia so i just stepped into it and here i am i came round to tell aaron to take a fond farewell and all that sort of thing im afraid my adventures will be of a different sort for a time weve had some fun though he added with a reminiscent gleam in his eyes we shall miss you harvey grimm sighed but i am beginning to fancy that our own numbers about up ive had the narrowest shave of my life this morning and i dont feel that i am out of the wood yet where is aaron i wonder he was out when i arrived the poet replied ive been waiting here for an hour harvey grimm consulted his watch it is time he decided for number one it is several days since i tasted a cocktail after that we might lunch together the poet assented with alacrity they left a note for aaron and made their way round to the milan the bar was rather more crowded than usual and they took their cocktails to a settee in a corner of the room harvey grimm sent for a page and wrote the name of captain brinnen on a piece of paper will you see whether you can find this gentleman in the hotel he directed he is staying i believe in the court the boy departed harvey grimm who as a rule was a temperate man drank up his cocktail quickly and sent for another do you believe in forebodings stephen he asked i was brought up on them the poet replied there is irish blood in my veins i am most superstitious i have had an exciting adventure this morning harvey grimm went on so far as any human being can see i am out of it as i have been before i have made the most careful arrangements toobut there its well for you not to know too much theres just this about it i wish to god i could see that belgian and get rid of a few baubles let me have them his companion begged no one would suspect me harvey grimm shook his head theyre not your trouble my boy he said besides youre too damned careless the page returned a few moments later the gentleman left the hotel yesterday sir he announced the hall porter well harvey grimm interrupted the hall porter the boy continued a little confused said something about the gentleman having changed his name harvey grimms face grew sterner and the look of trouble about his eyes more pronounced he put a shilling in the boys hand and sent him away theres something up here he muttered first of all aaron disappears and now brinnen has changed his name my god if they only knew what his other name really was the poet chuckled and to think he murmured that i have been in it what a man the devil of it is for me harvey grimm declared that ive fifty thousand pounds worth of his stolen jewls around my body at the present moment i fought my way out of a trap this morning i tell you stephen as a rule this sort of thing stimulates me i hold my head a little higher i whistle gayer tunes i am looking out for the bright things in life every second of the time and my feet scarcely touch the earth but today its all different i cant walk without turning round i cant hear that door open without starting hell bring me another cocktail waiter steady old chap your nerves are dicky thats whats the matter with you its the first time in my life harvey grimm muttered but ive got them now i feel that im cornered i did brodie in this morning i left him at eleven oclock gagged and tied in the workshop he tracked me to i was edward levy there and there isnt one of them except the old man who knew otherwise brodie himself never recognised me the only fear is if the old man peaches hes had a couple of thousand of the best and he hoards gold and loves it as though it were his own lifeblood thank god here are the cocktails i shall write an epic about you this afternoon the poet declared youre tense harvey thats what you are youre strung up theres a different sense in the words you speak a sort of quivering significance in everything you say youre feeling life man im feeling afraid if thats anything harvey grimm confessed raising his glass there was a woman in it of courseand god knows i was carefula fierce strong young jewess if she gets her grandfather by the throat shell wring the truth out of him cresswell rose to his feet it will do you good to eat my friend he suggested i find you exciting vibrating stimulating but you are wearing yourself out harvey grimm sat with tightly clenched fists im afraid to go in the restaurant he said do you notice how that man at the bar is staring cresswell whos he dont be a silly ass his companion exclaimed thats greaves the london correspondent of the new york trombone hed be all over our story if he knew it come along pull yourself together man upright harvey grimm did his best he walked into the restaurant with almost his usual airy bonhomme an acquaintance stopped the two men wouldnt look at me in fitzs grimm he complained getting proud old chap sorry harvey grimm replied i saw your back afterwards i was looking at a man over your shoulder they seated themselves at their usual table another chance acquaintance paused to speak to them thought youd given up this place grimm saw you at the piccadilly on thursday i like a change sometimes the latter observed hows the new play going capitally thanks the actor passed on harvey grimm glanced at a sheet of paper which he brought out from his pocket yes he murmured i was at the piccadilly on thursday nothing like being thorough in these things stephen my alibi was pretty successful eh mean to say you get a chap to go about when youre in hiding and establish alibis for you the poet asked wonderingly thats exactly the idea harvey grimm agreed and to tell you the truth if i hadnt a fit of nerves on me i should say that my alibis would take a little upsetting they ordered luncheon and a bottle of wine but for some reason or other the old spirit was lacking they missed aaron rodd and speculated as to the cause of his absence cresswell too seemed to have inherited a new seriousness with his unaccustomed attire it was their mutual recognition of the drawing to an end of one little cycle of their life and try though he might harvey grimm could never escape from the queer sense of foreboding which had haunted him for the last few hours and then towards the end of the meal a pageboy came into the room gazed around for a moment and approached their table two gentlemen would like to speak to you mr grimm he announced harvey grimm laid down his knife and fork he nodded to the boy but there was a queer hunted look in his eyes as he turned towards his companion stephen old fellow he muttered its come the poet laid his hand upon his friends shoulder look here harvey he asked do you want to make a scrap of it im your man if you do or i say have you anything youd like to hand over to me i can stand the racket harvey grimm shook his head firmly no he decided if its the end well ill face it if only jerry hadnt cleared out i might have got rid of the stones goodbye stephen and good luck to you better follow me out perhaps if i dont return he made his way without undue haste from the room exchanging one or two greetings pausing even in the swing doors to say a few words with a friend then when he stood in the little lobby he knew that there was truth at the back of all his forebodings it was a wellknown scotland yard inspector and a subordinate both in plain clothes who were standing there with their hats in their hands the inspector greeted him cheerily but dropped his voice mr grimm he said ill have to trouble you to come along to headquarters just a few questions you understandas quietly as you like you see weve come here in mufti go back and say goodbye to your friend if you want to thats very considerate of you inspector was the grateful reply ill just tap the window if youll allow me the poet obeyed the summons promptly harvey grimm met him by the door and took his arm theyre after me stephen he confided theyre doing it jolly civilly though theres a time for going on to the bitter end and theres a time for dropping it im dropping it once more good luck to you the two men gripped hands the pageboy came up again and touched harvey grimm on the shoulder wanted on the telephone sir he announced the former turned towards the inspector pray dont hurry mr grimm the latter remarked courteously our time is entirely yours harvey grimm stepped into the telephone box and took up the receiver the voice that answered his enquiry was hoarse as though with some unnatural emotion is that harvey grimm yes this is aaronaaron rodd where are you can you come and help im in trouble so am i harvey grimm replied a little bitterly whats yours i came down to tilbury this morning with henriette to see her brother off we couldnt find him henriette got on the wrong steamer and theyve taken her off it was a trap harvey do you hear theyve got her where are you im at tilbury telephoning from the docks was the hoarse reply the whole thing was a sell the munition boat by which brinnen was supposed to leave has never been heard of can you come down harvey grimm closed the door tightly behind him and almost whispered down the telephone can you hear aaron yes jerry sands has got away all right he wasnt on any munition boat i was arrested five minutes ago im being taken to scotland yard and ive fifty thousand pounds worth of his diamonds on me i shouldnt worry about the girl if i were you aaron i think jerry sands sister can take care of herself wheres cresswell here with me could he come hes joined an otc i dont suppose he could get leave besides cant you understand aaron she is jerry sands sister and theyre off together somewhere for certain whats that what there was a confused babel of soundsnothing more distinct the connection had been cut harvey grimm spent five minutes in vain trying to reestablish it then he left the booth nice cropper for us stephen he announced to the poet who was waiting outside that was aaron the girls given him the slip down at tilbury hes like a madman of course the inspector who had lit his second cigarette strolled up i am afraid he said that people are beginning to recognise us dont you think you are quite right sir harvey grimm assented you have been very considerate i am entirely at your service now good luck to you cresswell go back and finish your luncheon you can sign the bill for me the poet played the game and departed after a hearty handshake harvey grimm took his seat in a taxicab the inspector by his side the constable opposite they drove off enquiries eh harvey grimm ruminated i wonder what you want to enquire about i fancy the inspector said confidentially that the chief will start by having you searched what do you expect to find if its a fair question the inspector smiled he had thrust his arm in friendly fashion through his companions weve an idea he replied that this time we shall find a few of jerry sands diamonds chapter x the end of jeremiah sands aaron rodd clasped his arms a little further around the barrel against which he was leaning trod water with his feet and thought about death the curtain of a slight mist had fallen around him there was nothing visible but the cold grey sea sometimes high above his head sometimes like a waterslide tumbling away many feet below him all around him he could hear the hooting of the steamers sounding their weird notes of warning from some unseen unimaginable world a few feet away also clinging to a barrel was a bronzed and hairy man in nautical attire who was using the most awful language no good wasting your breath aaron gasped try another shout the man did as he was advised without eliciting any reply from the other side of the grey walls whereupon he proceeded once more in lurid language to express his opinion of murdering foreigners and mysterious gents who tempted honest tugmasters into doubtful enterprises suddenly he broke off crikey eres something on the top of us he exclaimed shout guvnor quick once more aaron rodd drew a long breath and shouted his voice sounded like a childs falsetto lost in the stentorian roar of his companions demand for immediate help and rescue then the grey fog was suddenly pierced a huge dark mass seemed to be gliding almost on the top of them from somewhere up in the clouds came an answering shout aaron rodds companion was moved to one supreme and successful effort a clear loud voice shouted directions to them were lowering ropes catch hold if you can before the wash well lower boats in a minute half a dozen ropes came down like curving snakes one of them hit the water scarcely a foot from aaron he gripped it tightly twist it round your body mate his companion spluttered twist it two or three times round and hold on for dear life the next few minutes were barely realisable aaron felt himself tossed like a cork on to the top of a seething mass of churnedup sea flung down again with the roar of it in his ears left for a moment in peace and then dragged through the water at such a pace that he found himself wondering whether his arms were going to be torn from his body then he was shot forward with a new impetus his body and arms ached with the strain he was only half conscious thats done it matey he heard his companion shout hold on theres the boat coming aaron rodd never wholly lost consciousness he heard the measured beat of the oars the sharp clear voice of the officer standing up in the stern he saw the boat emerge from the gloom heard the quick orders felt himself lifted up by the shoulders felt the luxury of something solid beneath his feet the officer in charge of the boat looked at the two men curiously whats this he asked collision aaron rodds companion took a long breath and tried to explain what it was the officer listened to him spellbound the men almost forgot to row some one seems to have been playing a dirty trick on you eh the former remarked when at last the mariner ceased through sheer exhaustion well you can tell the commander when we get on board gradually a fuller consciousness returned to aaron rodd he was able to walk along the deck of the ship they boarded to grope his way unaided down the narrow stairs into the small cabin below where a man was seated at a table with a chart before him he pushed it away as the two men were ushered in hullo whats this he exclaimed the officer who had brought them made a brief report the commander nodded fetch them some hot whisky quick he directed now tell us your story the tugmaster got in first but after a few sentences the commander stopped him i think ill get at the truth quicker from you he decided nodding to aaron quick please aaron pulled himself together and took a long gulp of the hot whisky which was at that moment brought in may i enquire if this is an english manofwar he asked as he set the glass down his majestys destroyer flying fox was the brief reply now tell me what you two men are doing on barrels in the north sea aaron rodd found a few terse and explicit words early this morning he said i escorted a young lady to tilbury we went there on the strength of a bogus telegram which informed us that her brother who is a belgian officer was leaving there at midday on a munition ship bound for havre we found a ships boat waiting for us at the dock mentioned in the telegram but they refused to take me on board with her i thought this reasonable as it was supposed to be a government vessel and i stayed behind to wait for her she was no sooner safely on board than the steamer hoisted the norwegian flag and steamed off the commander stared for a moment then he looked away sounds a queer story he observed its a true one aaron assured him of course theres a reason for this abduction the young lady some months ago i dont want the whole story the commander interrupted i want to know how you got into the north sea i was coming to that aaron rodd proceeded my companion can bear me out as to the rest i hired his tug meaning to follow the steamer into whatever port it might go if they refused to take me on board we caught her up and signalled her to stop she manoeuvred a little disclosed a gun and blew us to pieces the captain here and i are the only two who ever came up again the commander glanced at the lieutenant who had remained in the room not a word passed between them who are you he enquired my name is aaron rodd was the prompt reply i am an american but i have practised law in england for a good many years i know my story sounds fanciful but theres no getting away from the sequel the tugmaster here can confirm every word of it the tugmaster proceeded to do so and the two officers listened for a time as though fascinated the commander interrupted him at last whats the name of this boat he asked she had ss christiania painted across her stern the tugmaster said and she was flying the norwegian flag but the ships names new painted i passed close alongside yesterday and a queerlooking lot they were on board the two officers exchanged quick glances the christiania the commander murmured softly he paused for a moment and bent over the chart then he looked up take mr rodd and the tugmaster to the wardroom he directed rig them both out in some dry clothes and see that they have everything they want aaron rodd had forgotten the discomfort of his condition he had only one idea in his brain sir he told the commander that ship the christiania is in the pay of the germans you may be right mr rodd the latter assented when you have changed your clothes come down and have another chat if i am not on the bridge even then aaron lingered sir he went on i know that theres nothing i can say will keep you for one moment from what you think to be your duty i have just had a fortune left me in america ill give a destroyer to the british navy if youll overhaul the christiania search her and take that young lady off the commander smiled the british navy doesnt need bribing sir he said ive had a hint about the christiania myself ill see what can be done now off you go and get into those dry clothes the two unexpected guests were hospitably entertained in the wardroom and aaron rodd made a very creditable appearance an hour later in some oddments of naval uniform they found their way on deck but were only allowed at the top of the companionway the fog had lifted there were half a dozen steamers in sight and the destroyer seemed to be completing a rather violent curve suddenly there were loud orders the roar of the machinery was lessened she glided through the water slackening speed at every instant looking down the deck they could see a sight which thrilled them both the tugmaster understood it better than aaron shes cleared for action guvnor he exclaimed the gunners are all at their posts see the signal my god thats the christiania he pointed to the steamer round which they had circled theyve signalled her to stop he continued if i get my hands on the captain hullo another signal watch it guvnor thats the last callheave to at once or or what aaron rodd asked the tugmaster smacked his lips those little sixinch boys will talk he replied with gusto we could send the christiania to the bottom in something less than thirty seconds you watch the angle of those guns look at the mans face whos just had an order hes trained on her my god the christiania had pursued her course suddenly there was a deafening roar a vibration which shook the ship fifty yards in front of the christiania the sea was all churned into foam its just an int the tugmaster exclaimed in delight its a blankety int look at em running about on board there were signs of an immense commotion on board the christiania another signal slowly fluttered to the masthead the tugmaster who was watching the steamers progress grinned theyre giving in he declared theyve stopped the engines oh if theyd only let me go on board her the lieutenant came running lightly down the bridge and approached aaron we are sending a crew on board the christiania he announced youd better go and see if you can identify the young lady theres a boat being lowered from the other deck may i go along sir the tugmaster asked eagerly the officer shook his head you stay where you are my man he directed youll get compensation for your tug if your story turns out to be true the man sighed theres two sorts of compensation he muttered as he spat upon his hands aaron rodd sat by the side of the lieutenant and though he had never done such a thing in his life before he stepped confidently up the rope ladder after him and boarded the christiania the captain was waiting to receive them he was a small very fair man who spoke english with a harsh and guttural accent his manner was exceedingly perturbed by what right will you tell me this piracy he demanded barely accepting the lieutenants salute my papers were cleared in london my cargo a few words with you below if you please captain the lieutenant interrupted you had better stay on deck mr rodd he added looking around aaron walked up and down and endeavoured unsuccessfully to converse with various members of the crew the ship bore all the usual evidences of being a small cargo steamer but there was to his fancy something sinister in the appearance of the sailors and the sound of their conversation as they pointed to the destroyerlong grey and evillooking rising and falling upon the waves a short distance away suddenly a man who might have been a steward appeared from below and touched him on the shoulder come this way please he invited he led aaron downstairs into a dark odoriferous saloon the captain and the english lieutenant were seated at the top of one of the long tables the latter motioned aaron rodd to approach the captain denies having any passenger on board mr rodd he observed i saw a young lady taken on board at tilbury aaron pronounced firmly she was brought here under a false pretext and she is here now it is not true the captain declared furiously there is no young lady on board what do you say to that mr rodd the lieutenant enquired aaron leaned a little forward he stretched out his hand and the captain for a moment shrank back the man is lying he said calmly the young lady was brought here under the pretext of seeing her brother if this vessel is allowed to proceed on its way to norway she will be intercepted somewhere by a german boat and the young lady will be made a prisoner that is a certainty the gentleman has made a mistake the captain insisted there were many vessels lying in the thames yesterday morning we do not carry passengers the boatswain of the destroyer who had accompanied them on board entered the saloon and coming up to the lieutenant saluted could i have a word with you sir he asked the lieutenant rose to his feet and retired for a few moments to the further end of the saloon when he returned his manner had undergone a change captain hooge he said in confirmation of this gentlemans story i find that you have two concealed guns on board and there are other suspicious circumstances which my boatswain has pointed out which confirm my own impressions about you i am signalling for a prize crew and shall take you to harwich the captain sprang to his feet his eyes were red with fury you damned meddlesome englishmen he cried if you keep me here another hour you will hear of it my government will protest it is contrary to the accepted principles of maritime law it is very much against the principles of maritime law as i read it the lieutenant answered coolly for you to blow to pieces with a concealed gun a tug which simply came up to ask you questions now be a sensible man captain hooge i shall have your ship searched from top to bottom if the young lady is found you will have to stand your trial in an english court on an extremely serious charge if there is any young lady on board the captain declared sullenly it is without my knowledge i will go and see the purser we will come too the lieutenant said dryly they passed down a little companionway the captain opened the door of a small stateroom and talked for some time in norwegian to a bearded and spectacled man the latter after some time turned towards the two men and spoke in english there is a young lady here she must have boarded us by accident we were on the point of starting and we could not land her come this way they followed the man down a long gloomy passage he knocked at the door of a stateroom at the end of it a faint voice answered the door was thrown open henriette white and eager stood shrinking back against the wall there was a rush of cold air into the place aaron she exclaimed in blank astonishment aaron rodd words failed her altogether it seemed too wonderful she peered into his face shook him by the shoulders and finally almost collapsed in his arms its all right henriette he cried his own voice shaking youre quite safe but where did you come from how did you get here she gasped i followed in a tug he told her these pleasant people blew us up i heard the gun she cried i saw the tug i saw it go down i saw the men swimming in the water it was horrible i was one of them aaron continued the master and i were picked up by an english destroyer this is one of the officers i managed to make them believe my story and we overhauled and boarded your steamer we are going to take it into harwich you are safe henriette she began to sob the tears stood in aarons own eyes as he saw thrust through the open porthole the umbrella on which she had tied various fragments of clothing i have been waving this out of the porthole she explained hysterically i thought they might see i was locked in until a moment ago better bring the young lady up on deck the officer suggested weve no accommodation for you on board the flying fox but i am going to signal the commander for a prize crew and place the captain and officers of this ship under arrest so youll both feel quite safe here youll be in harwich in five hours and we shall be standing by all the time you wont leave me aaron she begged not i he answered heartily i expect i shall take the steamer in the officer remarked you are quite safe now young lady he added reassuringly i should come on deck and get a little fresh air if i were you she clung to aaron as they passed out they met the captain and the purser talking together in the companionway the former saluted a little awkwardly sorry to hear that there was a mistake miss he said we were expecting a young lady on board the daughter of the owner who had been giving her people some trouble henriette simply looked at the man he turned away i want to go on deck she whispered to aaron i want to get away from this atmosphere come quickly please oh look look half a dozen english sailors came down the companionway they were in war trim and they looked like ruddy goliaths by the side of the pale anmiclooking crew of the christiania henriette gave a little sob i feel safe she cried safe after all aaron yes dear her little face so white and pitiful was strained up to his the ghost of one of her old provocative smiles quivered at her lips even leopold she murmured will not be able to say no any longer do you know that you are a wonderful person you are like one of those heroes in romances there never was such a rescue he pressed her arm our last adventure he whispered is going to be the greatest of all the magistrates court was crowded almost to suffocation when for the third time harvey grimm was charged with having aided and abetted in the theft of various jewels found in his possession the solicitor for the treasury rose at once when called upon urbane even apologetic yet firm i trust that this time mr dyson the magistrate remarked you are in a position to offer sufficient evidence to enable me either to discharge or to send the prisoner for trial the solicitor for the treasury proceeded to explain he reminded their worships that the prisoner had been discovered last week owing to the assiduous efforts of mr brodie actually engaged in secretly cutting up and disguising valuable diamonds there was no question at all but that these diamonds were stolen the trouble which the prosecution had to contend with was the fact that they were stolen in america and that some of the stones had been mutilated in such a fashion as to render them almost unrecognisable a commission from the police force of new york had already sailed not only to identify the jewels but with a strong hope of identifying the prisoner as a confederate of one of the most notorious jewel thieves of this generation he was exceedingly sorry to have to ask for a fourth remand but in this case there was no alternative he sat down a mildmannered man arose from his side and addressed the magistrate your worship he said i am defending the prisoner in the event of the prosecution having no further evidence to offer today which i understand to be the case may i be allowed to call a witness the magistrate coughed you would be within your rights mr ransome he admitted leaning forward and looking over his eyeglasses but i need scarcely remind you that to a certain extent by calling witnesses for the defence at this stage of the proceedings you might possibly prejudice your clients case the solicitor bowed my client being a wholly innocent man your worship he said is only anxious to have the truth known as soon as possible you can do as you choose mr ransome the magistrate consented there was a moments whispering a name only partially heard was called outside and a ripple of interest passed through the court when captain brinnen still in his belgian uniform entered the witnessbox the solicitor for the prosecution looked a little staggered the solicitor for the defence stood up will you tell the magistrate your name he asked the witness bowed leopold francis henri brinnen de floge and your titles comte de malaison baron dasche chevalier di scolo vicomte de floge there was a distinct sensation in court a sense of impending events which left every one pleasantly excited harvey grimm leaned forward gripping at the rail in front of him you are i believe the solicitor continued a godson of the late king of the belgians that is so the witness admitted do you know anything of the prisoner the witness glanced at harvey grimm and meeting his astounded stare greeted him in friendly fashion certainly he replied mr harvey grimm is a valued acquaintance i engaged him recently to recut and if possible to present to me in an altered form a variety of precious stones may i ask your reason for this the solicitor enquired it is a matter of almost political history the witness explained turning towards the magistrate the de floge collection of diamonds is famous i believe i may say throughout the world they were the subject at the time of the outbreak of the war of a lawsuit between the german branch of the de floge family and my own during the hearing of the case the jewels were deposited by common consent at the antwerp museum where anybody who is an expert in these matters will tell you that they have been inspected by connoisseurs from all over the world with the invasion of our country my grandfather and i determined to do our best to prevent these jewels which were worth an immense sum from falling into the hands of the enemy the curators of the antwerp museum although they were under a bond consented under the circumstances to hand them over to our branch of the family and they were transported to my grandfathers chateau which is very near the french frontier just before the sack of antwerp subsequently my grandfather and my sister the comtesse de floge after a series of remarkable adventures in which the latter especially was concerned managed to escape to england with the bulk of the jewels my cousin however who represents the german side of our family has seized our lands and home and has made desperate attempts in various directions to secure also the jewels which the authorities would now award him as a matter of course i deemed it wise bearing all these things in mind to yield to my grandfathers almost passionate insistence and dispose secretly of as many as possible there was a great sensation in court mr harvey grimm asked for a chair and sat down did you the solicitor for the defence asked impose entire secrecy upon mr harvey grimm under the peculiar circumstances of the case i did was the prompt reply the solicitor turned to the magistrate there is nothing left your worship he said but for me to ask you to sanction the immediate release of my client he resumed his seat the solicitor for the prosecution promptly arose i may be allowed your worship he asked to crossexamine the witness certainly the magistrate assented may i ask you sir whether you have any evidence in support of these extraordinary statements of yours the young man bowed certainly he replied the belgian minister who was my fathers greatest friend and relative and the princess augusta my godmother are both i believe present the solicitor for the prosecution turned to the magistrate if these witnesses may be called and are found to support the story your worship he said the case for the prosecution is withdrawn leopold de floge left the witnessbox strolled along the back of the benches and held out his hand to harvey grimm my profound regrets and apologies he murmured i wait here and we will lunch together the court rocked itself with excitement the belgian minister was called and promptly took his place in the witnessbox asked if he knew the last witness his reply was comprehensive the vicomte de floge he said is the first nobleman in belgium he is a godson of the late king is himself connected with the royal family and is a young man whose gallantry in the field has won special commendation from the king do you know anything about the de floge diamonds certainly the witness replied they are of historical and priceless value and special efforts were made to seize them at antwerp museum my friend the vicomte de floge was able to rescue them just in time i may say that he consulted me and under the difficult circumstances i advised him to dispose of as many as possible secretly very powerful influences have been brought to bear through a neutral country to effect their restoration the magistrate bowed and the witness stood down there was a moments whispered consultation between the two solicitors then one of them stood up the case for the prosecution is withdrawn your worship he announced harvey grimm and leopold de floge by the courtesy of the magistrate left the court by the back entrance arm in arm the former was looking a little haggard from his six days detention and was scarcely his usual spickandspan self he was a little dazed too he leaned back in a luxurious motorcar and tried to realise what had happened his first question was not an unnatural one will you tell me he asked earnestly why your grandfather and you and your sister all practically confessed that you were jeremiah sands the international jewel thief i must admit that the idea was my own de floge explained you see we were extremely anxious that no one should know whose jewels these really were the one way to ensure absolute secrecy was to dispose of them as stolen property that is what we did and i must say that under the circumstances mr grimm your silence was more than admirable to a great extent i must admit we were humouring my grandfather who was oppressed the whole of the time with a nervous fear of being ordered by the british government to restore them his death makes all the differencein fact i have this morning entrusted the whole of the rest of my collection to christies and they will offer them for sale as soon as the south american buyers can be duly advised it is perhaps just as well that we have passed the crisis for i see by this mornings papers that jeremiah sands was arrested at chicago yesterday harvey grimm cleared his throat you havent such a thing as a cigarette i suppose de floge produced his case at once my profound apologies he said i should have known the one thing you needed most after this regrettable detention to think harvey grimm muttered to himself that i stole way down to letchowiskis and lived in terror of my life with that rat of a brodie dogging my footsteps and all the time i might have fitted up a laboratory and have done my work at home that would never have done de floge objected by the decision of the belgian courtsgerman inspired of course but still according to the law of the landthe whole of the jewels are in a way stolen property stillit is not the sort of theft that counts harvey grimm looked out of the windows there was a queer sort of plaintive happiness dawning in his face its london all right he murmured the strand too i never thought to see them againnot till i was an old man at any rate where are we going the milan for luncheon de floge replied where you will meet some friends i have more wonders to tell you will you hear them first or wait till you have had a cocktail more wonders harvey grimm murmured and this is the city which lacks the spirit of adventure i think he went on as they stepped out of the car and walked towards the smokeroom you must leave this to me there is just one concoctioni cant call it by a name i must speak to coley what a cigarette he went on for six days i know de floge interrupted i am sorry we will try and make up for it they drank a cocktail together and the sense of unreality began to fall away once more the earth was firm beneath harvey grimms feet the money i have wasted he groaned why i had a young actor establishing alibis for me all the time i was away wheres aaron just back from the north sea with my sister de floge replied he will tell you a story that will make your hair stand on end and the poet down with an officers training corps he is coming up to lunch if he can get off harvey grimm glanced at the clock his companion interpreted his thoughts you have an hour he said a shave and a bath the other murmured ecstatically and the corner table as you come in in the grillroom de floge added we will all meet there at onethirty some time before the hour had elapsed harvey grimm was entirely his usual self shaved and bathed clad in one of his favourite blue serge suits patent shoes and spotless gaiters a bunch of violets in his buttonhole a sense of stupefied but immeasurable satisfaction radiating from him he took his place at the round luncheon table between aaron rodd and henriette and raised the glass of amber liquid which he found waiting there to his lips de floge however checked him my friends he said but wait here is mr cresswell the poet came to them with outstretched hands my heartiest congratulations he exclaimed pausing before harvey grimm you will be able to write a ballad of the bow street cells perhaps i will collaborate it will mean immortality for you where do i sit a place was found for him he too raised the wineglass which he found in front of him to his lips but was checked by de floge we will with your permission the latter proposed drink to the happiness of my dear sister henriette and your friendand mine too that is to be he added with a bowmr aaron rodd they are to be married this month and if you would care for a wonderful entertainment during the service of our luncheon they shall recount their adventures of the last six days i promise you mr harvey grimm that yours will seem to you monotonous they listened to the story told by one and supplemented by the other it was all amazing the poet was frankly envious after all he grumbled it seems to me that i am the one who treads the dreary path of commonplace life de floge leaned across towards him sir he said that is not wholly true for both you and i along different paths are pledged to the greatest and most wonderful adventure the world can offer we have drunk to the happiness of my sister and mr aaron rodd i drank to you a short while ago mr harvey grimm full of respect for that sporting spirit which kept you silent in captivity we will drink now all of us to the common cause to the great adventure of life and death to the end which is written in letters of blood across the scarred face of europeto
