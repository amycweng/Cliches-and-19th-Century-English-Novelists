every student of earthlore knows there is high magic too in the marriage of rivers so that the spot where two mingle their streams is sacred endowed with strange properties of evocation and of purification such spots go to the making of history and ruling of individual lives but whether their influence is not more often malign than beneficent may be perhaps open to doubt certain it is however that no doubts of this description troubled the mind of thomas clarkson verity when in the closing decade of the eighteenth century he purchased the house at deadham hard known as tandys castle overlooking the deep and comparatively narrow channel by which the rivers arne and wilner after crossing the tideflats and saltmarsh of marychurch haven make their swift united exit into marychurch bay neither was he troubled by the fact that tandys castleor more briefly and familiarly tandysfor all its commonplace outward decency of aspect did not enjoy an unblemished moral or social reputation the housea whitewashed featureless erectionwas planted at right angles to the deep sandy lane leading up from the shore through the scattered village of deadham to the threemile distant market town of marychurch standing on a piece of rough landbare save for a few stunted weymouth pines and a fringe of tamarisk along the broken seawalltandys at the date in question boasted a couple of bowed sashwindows on either side the front and back doors and a range of five other windows set flat in the wall on the first floor there was no second storey the slate roofs were mean lowpitched without any grace of overshadowing eaves at either end a tall chimneystack rose like the long ears of some startled vacantfaced small animal behind the house a thick plantation of beech and sycamore served to make its square blank whiteness visible for a quite considerable distance out to sea built upon the site of some older and larger structure it was blessedor otherwisewith a system of vaults and cellars wholly disproportionate to its existing size one of these by means of a roughly ceiled and flagged passage gave access to a heavy door in the seawall opening directly on to the river foreshore hence the unsavoury reputation of the place for not only did it supply a convenient receiving house for smuggled goods but a convenient rendezvous for the more lawless characters of the neighbourhooda backofbeyond and no mans land where the devil could with impunity have things very much his own way in the intervals of more serious business the vaults and cellars of tandys frequently resounded to the agonies and brutal hilarities of cockfights dogfights and other repulsive sports and pastimes common to the englishboth gentle and simpleof that virile but singularly gross and callous age nevertheless to thomas clarkson verity man of peace and of ideas tandys representedand continued to represent through over half a centuryrescue security an awakening in something little short of paradise from a longdrawn nightmare of hell he paid an extortionate price for the property at the outset and spent a small fortune on the enlargement of the house and improvement of the grounds yet never regretted his bargain for in good truth when in the spring of the soft nimble roundbodied very polite learned and loquacious little gentleman first set eyes upon its mean roofs prick ears and vacant whitewashed countenance he had been horribly shocked horribly scaredfor all the inherited valour of his good breedingand above all most horribly disappointed history had played very dirty pranks with him which he found it impossible as yet to forgive five years earlier fired like many another generous spirit by extravagant hope of the coming regeneration of mankind he hurried off to paris after the opening of the national assembly and fall of the bastille with the overture to the millennium in full blast must he not be there to hear and see associating himself with the girondist party he assisted busily enthusiastic at the march of tremendous events until the evil hour in which friend began to denounce friend and heads quite other than aristocraticthose of men and women but yesterday the idols and chosen leaders of the peoplewent daily to the filling of la veuve guillotines unspeakable marketbasket the spectacle proved too upsetting both to mr veritys amiable mind and rather queasy stomach faith failed while even the millennium seemed hardly worth purchasing at so detestable a cost he stood altogether too close to the terrible drama in its later stages to distinguish the true import or progression of it too close to understand that however bloodstained its cradle the goodly child democracy was veritably here and now in the act of being born among men rather did he question whether his own fat little neck was not in lively danger of being severed and his own headso full of ingenious thoughts and lively curiosityof being sent flying to join those of brissot and verginaud of wayward explosive camille and sweet lucile desmoulins in that same unspeakable basket and to what end for could he suppose the human race would be nearer by the veriest fraction of a millimetre to universal liberty equality and prosperity through his insignificant death modesty and a natural instinct of selfpreservation alike answered never a jot whereupon with pertinacious if furtive activity he sought means of escape and at length after months of hiding and anxious flitting found them in the shape of a doubtfully seaworthy and undoubtedly filthy fishingsmack bound from le havre to whatever port it could make on the english south coast the two days voyage was rough the accommodation and company to match mr verity spent a disgusting and disgusted fortyeight hours to be eventually put ashore a woefully bedraggled and depleted figure in the primrose carmine and dovegrey of a tender april morning on the wet sand just below the seawall of tandys castle never was briton more thankful to salute his native land or feel the solid earth of it under his weary and very shaky feet he an epicure ate such coarse food washed down by such coarse ale as tandys could offer with smiling relish later mounted on a forest ponyan illfavoured animal with a walleye pink muzzle bristly upper and hanging lower lip more accustomed to carry a keg of smuggled spirits strapped beneath its belly than a cosmopolitan savant and social reformer on its backhe rode the three miles to marychurch proposing there to take the coach to southampton and after a measure of rest and refitting a postchaise to canton magna his elder brothers fine place lying in a fold of the chalk hills which face the sussex border the pony moved slowly and sullenly but its rider felt no impatience his humour was of the kindliest his heart indeed came near singing for joy simply spontaneously even as the larks sang climbing up and upward from salt marsh and meadow on either side the rutted road into the limpid purity of the spring sky a light wind flapped the travelstained highcollared blue cloth cloak which he wore and brought him both the haunting fetidsweet reek of the mud flatsthe tide being lowand the invigorating tang of the forest and moorland uprolling there ahead in purple and umber to the pale northern horizon against that sombre background fair and stately in the tender sunlight as a church of vision or dream marychurch abbey rose above the roofs and chimneys of the little town during the latter half of the eighteenth century not only were religious systems very much at a discount among persons of intelligence but the deity himself was relegated to the position of an exploded idea becoming an object of vituperation witty or obscene according to the humour of the individual critic as one of the illuminated mr verity did not escape the prevailing infection although an inborn amenity of disposition saved him from atheism in its more blatantly offensive forms the existence of the supreme being might be probably was so he feared but a fond thing vainly imagined yet such is the constitution of the human mind that age confers a certain prestige and authority even upon phantoms and suspected frauds hence it followed that mr verity in the plenitude of his courtesy had continued to take off his hatsecretly and subjectively at all eventsto this venerable theological delusion so dear through unnumbered centuries to the aching heart and troubled conscience of humanity but in the present glad hour of restored securityhis head no longer in danger of plopping hideously bodiless into la veuves basket his innerman moreover so recently and rackingly evacuated by that abominable channel passage now comfortably relined with tandys meat and drinkhe went further in the way of acknowledgment a glow of very vital gratitude swept over him so that looking at the majestic churchsecular witness to the souls faith in and need of almighty gods protective mercy and goodnesshe took off his hat no longer metaphorically but actually and bowed himself together over the pommel of the saddle with an irresistible movement of thanksgiving and of praise recovering himself after a minute or soalmost thou persuades me to be a christian he said aloud shaking his head remonstrantly at the distant church while tears started to his busy politely inquisitive eyes then striving by speech to bring his spirits to their accustomed playfulness and poise he soliloquized thus still aloud for to be candid what convincing argument can i advance in the light of recent experience to prove that rousseau my friends the encyclopeadists or even the great m de voltaire were really wiser in their generation truer lovers of the people and safer guides than st benedictof blessed memory since patron of learning and incidentally saviour of classic literaturewhose pious sons raised this most delectable edifice to gods glory seven hundred years agothe tower is considerably later than the transepts and the navefifteenth century i take itupon my soul i am half tempted to renounce my allegiance and to doubt whether our modern standards of civilization surpass in the intelligent application of means to ends those of these mediaeval cenobites and whether we are saner philanthropists deeper philosophers more genial humanists than they but here his discourse suffered mortifying interruption he became aware the pony stood stockstill in the middle of the road and turning its head so that he beheld its pink muzzle bristly upper and hanging lower lip in disagreeable profile regarded him with malevolent contempt out of its one sound eye as who should say whats the silly fellow trumpeting like this about doesnt the veriest noodle contrive to keep a quiet tongue in his head out on the highway sensible of a snub mr verity jerked at the reins and clapped his heels into the creatures sides as smartly as fatigue and native civility permitted sending it forward at a jogtrot nevertheless his soliloquya silent one nowcontinued and that with notable consequences to others besides himself for his thought still dallied with the subject of the monastic life as lived by those same pious benedictines here in england long ago its reasoned rejection of mundane agitations its calm its leisure its profound and ardent scholarship were vastly to his tastea man touching middleage might do worse surely than spend his days between worship and learning thushe saw and approved its social office in offering sanctuary to the fugitive alms to the poor teaching to the ignorant consolation to the sick and safe passage heavenward to the dying saw not without sympathy its more jovial momentsits good fellowship shrewd and witty conversation well salted storieswhereat a man laughs slyly in his sleeveits good cheer too with feasts on holydays and highdays rich and succulentand in this last connection as he reflected much was to be said for the geographical position of marychurch since if river mists and white dullness of sea fog drifting in from the channel were to hand so also in their season were fresh run salmon snipe woodcock flocks of wild duck of plover and other savoury fowl for in this thankfulness of awakening from the hellish nightmare of the terror mr veritys facile imagination tended to run to another extreme with all the seriousness of which he was capable he canvassed the notion of a definite retirement from the world public movements political and social experiments ceased to attract him his appetite for helping to make the wheels of history go round had been satisfied to the point of nausea all he desired was tranquillity and repose he was free of domestic obligations and close family ties he proposed to remain sophilosophy his mistress science his handmaid literature his pastime books remembering the bitter sorrows of the tumbril and scaffold in paris in future his closest friends but unfortunately though the great church in all its calm grave beauty still held the heart the fair landscape the monastery which might have sheltered his renunciation had been put to secular uses or fallen into ruin long years ago if he proposed to retire from the world he must himself provide suitable environment marychurch abbey at the end of the eighteenth century had very certainly nothing to offer him under that head and then with a swiftness of conception and decision possible only to mercurialminded persons his thought darted back to tandys that unkempt morally malodorous backofbeyond and no mans land its vacant whitewashed countenance and longeared chimneystacks had welcomed him if roughly and grudgingly to england and to peace was he not in some sort thereby in debt to tandys bound by gratitude to the place should he not buy ithis private fortune being considerableand there plant his hermitage should he not renovate and transform it redeeming it from questionable uses by transporting thither not himself only but his fine library his famous herbarium his cabinets of crystals of coins and of shells the idea captivated him he was weary of destruction having seen it in full operation and practised on the gigantic scale henceforth he would devote all the energy he possessed to constructionon however modest and private a oneto a building up as personal protest against much lately witnessed wanton and chaotic pullingdown in prosecution of which purpose hopeful once more and elate bobbing merrily corklike upon the surface of surrounding circumstancealthough lamentably deficient for the moment in raiment befitting his position and his pursemr verity spent two days at the stags head in marychurch high street he made enquiries of all and sundry regarding the coveted property and learned after much busy investigation that the village and indeed the whole hundred of deadham formed an outlying and somewhat neglected portion of his acquaintance lord bulparcs hampshire estate here was solid information to go upon greatly encouraged he took the coach to southampton and thence up to town where he interviewed first lord bulparcs lawyers and then that highcoloured freeliving nobleman himself gad sir the latter assured him youre heartily welcome to the damn little hole as far as im concerned if you have the bad taste to fancy it i suppose i ought to speak to my son oxley about this just as a matter of form not that i apprehend oxley will raise any difficulties as to entailyou need not fear that we shall let you off easy enoughonly too happy to oblige you but i warn you verity you may drop money buying the present tenant out if half my agent tells me is true the fellow must be a most confounded blackguard up to the eyes in all manner of ungodly traffic by rights we ought to have kicked him out years ago but his lordship chuckledi scruple to be hard on any man were none of us perfect live and let live you know only my dear fellow im bound to put you on your guard for hell stick to the place like a leech and bloodsuck you like a leech too as long as theres a chance of getting an extra guinea out of you by fair means or foul to which process of bloodsucking mr verity was in fact rather scandalously subjected before tandys castle passed into his possession but pass into his possession it finally did whereupon he fell joyously to the work of reconstructive redemption first of all he ordered the entrance of the underground passage leading to the river foreshore to be securely walled up and with a fine disregard of possible unhealthy consequences in the shape of chokedamp the doorways of certain illreputed vaults and cellars to be filled with solid masonry neither harborage of contraband cruel laughter of man or yell of tortured beast should again defile the underworld of tandysnext he had the roof of the main building raised and given a less mean and meagre angle he added a wing on the left containing pleasant bedchambers upstairs and good offices below and as crowning act of redemption caused three large groundfloor rooms backed by a wide corridor to be built on the right in which to house his library and collections this lateral extension of the house constructed according to his own plans was like its designer somewhat eccentric in character the three rooms were semicircular all window on the southern garden front veritable suntraps with a low sloped roofing of greygreen slate to them set fanwise such was the house at deadham hard when mr veritys labours were completed and such did it remain until a good eighty years later when it was visited by a youthful namesake and greatgreat nephew under circumstances not altogether unworthy of record chapter ii enter a young scholar and gentleman of a happy disposition and good prospects the fourtwenty down train rumbled into marychurch station and tom verity stepped out of a rather frousty firstclass carriage on to the platform there hot still september sunshine tempered by a freshness off the sea met him the effect was pleasurable adding delicate zest to the enjoyment of living which already possessed him coming from inland the near neighbourhood of the sea the sea with its eternal invitation stirred his blood for was not he about to accept the said invitation in its fullest and most practical expression witness the fact that earlier in the day he had deposited his heavy baggage at that house of many partings many meetings radleys hotel southampton and journeyed on to marychurch with a solitary eminently virgin cowhide portmanteau upon the yellowbrown surface of which the wordsthomas clarkson verity passenger bombay first cabin rms penangwere inscribed in the whitest of lettering his name stood high in the list of successful candidates at the last indian civil service examination now he reaped the reward of past endeavour for with that deposition of heavy baggage at radleys the last farewell to years of tutelage seemed to him to be spoken nursery discipline the restraints and prohibitionsin their respective degreesof preparatory school of harchester of oxford and above all and through all the control and admonitions of his father the archdeacon fell away from him into the limbo of things done with outworn and outpaced this moved him as pathetic yet as satisfactory also since it set him free to fix his mind without lurking suspicion of indecorum upon the large promise of the future he could give rein to his eagerness to his high sense of expectation while remaining innocent of impiety towards persons and places holding until now first claim on his obedience and affection all this fell in admirably with his natural bent selfreliant agreeably egotistical convinced of the excellence of his social and mental equipment tom was saved from excess of conceit by a lively desire to please an even more lively sense of humour and an intelligence to which at this period nothing came amiss in the way of new impressions or experiences and from henceforth he was his own master his thoughts actions purposes belonging to himself and to himself alone really the position was a little intoxicating realizing it as he sat in the somewhat stuffy firstclass carriage on that brief hours journey from southampton to marychurch he had laughed out loud hunching up his shoulders saucily in a sudden outburst of irrepressible and boyish glee but as the line clearing the purlieus of the great seaport turns southwestward running through the noble oak and beech woods of arnewood forest crossing its bleak moorlandssilver pink at the present season with fading heatherand cutting through its plantations of larch and scotch fir tom veritys mood sobered he watched the country reeling away to right and left past the carriage windows and felt its peculiarly english and sylvan charm yet he saw it all through a dazzle as of mirage in which floated phantom landscapes strangely different in sentiment and in suggestionsome extravagantly luxuriant as setting to crowded painted cities some desert amazingly vacant and desolate but in either case poetic alluring exciting as scenes far removed in climate faith and civilization from those heretofore familiar can hardly fail to be india and all which india stands for in english history challenged his imagination challenged his ambition since in virtue of his nationality young and inexperienced though he was he went to her as a natural ruler the son of a conquering race and this last thought begot in him not only exultation but an unwonted seriousness while as he thus meditated from out the dazzle as of mirage a single figure grew into force and distinctness of outline a figure which from his childhood had appealed to him with an attraction at once sinister and heroicthat namely of a certain soldier and exindian official his kinsman to pay a politic tribute of respect to whom was the object of his present excursion in catholic countries the world gives its children to the church in protestant countries the process is not infrequently reversed the church giving its children to the world and that with an alacrity which argues remarkable faith and courageof a sort archdeacon verity had carefully planned this visit for his son although it obliged the young man to leave home two days earlier than he need otherwise have done it was illuminating to note how the father brought all the resources of a fine presence an important manner and fulltoned archidiaconal voice to bear upon proving the expediency of the young man visiting this particular relation over whose career and reputation he had so often in the past pursed up his lips and shaken his head for the moral benefit of the domestic circle for the archdeacon in common with the majority of the verity family was animated by that ineradicable distrust of anything approaching genius which distinguishes the english country or rather county mind and that sir charles verity had failed to conform to the family tradition of solid unemotional highly respectable and usually very wealthy mediocrity was beyond question he had struck out a line for himself and as the event disclosed an illustrious one this the archdeacon being a good conservative disapproved it worried him sadly making him actually if unconsciously exceedingly jealous and precisely on that account by an ingenious inversion of reasoning he felt he owed it to abstract justicein other words to his much disgruntled selfto make all possible use of this offending this renegade personage when opportunity of so doing occurred now learning on credible authority that sir charless name was still one to conjure with in india it clearly became his duty to bid his son seek out and secure whatever modicum of advantagein the matter of advice and introductionsmight be derivable from so irritating a source all of which while jumping with his own desires caused tom much sly mirth for might it not be counted among the satisfactory results of his deposition of heavy baggage at radleys that for the first time in his life he was at liberty to regard even his father thomas pontifex verity archdeacon of harchester and rector of canton magna in a true perspective and he laughed again though this time softly indulgently able in the plenitude of youthful superiority to extend a kindly tolerance towards the foibles and ingenuous hypocrisies of poor middleage but here the train emerging from the broken hilly country on the outskirts of the forest roared along the embankment which carries the line across the rich converging valleys of the wilner and the arne tom ceased to think either of possible advantage accruing to his own fortunes or these defects of the family humour which had combined to dictate his present excursion his attention being absorbed by the beauty of the immediate outlook for on the left marychurch came into view the great grey longbacked abbey stands on a heartshaped peninsula of slightly rising ground its western tower landmark for the valleys and seamark for vessels making the haven overtops the avenue of ageold elms which shade the graveyard close about the church the red brick and roughcast houses of the little markettownset in a wide margin of saltmarsh and meadow intersected by bluebrown waterwaysgather as a brood of chickens gathers about a mothering hen beyond lie the pale glinting levels of the estuary guarded on the west by gently upward sloping cornlands and on the south by the dark furze and heathclad mass of stone horse head beyond again to the low horizon stretches the channel sea the very simplicity of the picture gives it singular dignity and repose classic in its clearness of outline and paucity of detail mediaeval in sentiment since the great norman church dominates the whole its appeal is at once wistful and severe and this afternoon just as the nearness of the sea tempered the atmosphere lifting all oppressive weight from the brooding sunshine so did it temper the colouring lending it an ethereal quality in which blue softened to silver grey to lavender while green seemed overspread by powdered gold the effect was exquisite reminding tom of certain watercolour drawings by danvers and by appleyard hanging in the drawingroom of the big house at canton magna and of certain of shelleys lyricsboth of which in their different medium breathed the same enchantment of natural and spiritual loveliness of nameless desire nameless regret and his nerves being somewhat strained by the emotions of the day that enchantment worked upon him strangely the inherent pathos of it indeed took him as squarely as unexpectedly by the throat he suffered a sharp recoil from the solicitation of the future an immense tenderness towards the pasta tenderness for those same years of tutelage and all they had brought him not only in overflowing animal spirits happy intercourse and intellectual attainment but in their limitation of private action their security of obligation of obedience to authority which at the time had seemed irksome enough and upon release from which he had so recently congratulated himself love of home of england of his own peopleof the archdeacon in even his most fullvoiced and moralizing moodlove of things tested accustomed and friendly touched him to the quick suddenly he asked himself to what end was he leaving all these and going forth to encounter untried conditions an unknown nature a moral and social order equally unknown looking at the peaceful ethereally lovely landscape set in such close proximity and notable contrast to the unrest of that historic highway of the nations the channel sea he felt small and lonely childishly diffident and weak all the established safety and comfort of home all the thoughtless irresponsible delights of vanished boyhood pulled at his heartstrings he wanted wanted wildly desperately not to go forward but to go back mind and body being healthy however the phase was a passing one and his emotion though sincere and poignant of brief duration for young bloodhappily for the human story which otherwise would read altogether too saddefies forebodings gaily embraces risks and true soldier of fortune marches out to meet whatever fate the battlefield of manhood may hold for it a song in its mouth and a rose behind its ear tom verity speedily came to a steadier mind pouring honest contempt upon his momentary lapse from selfconfidence he was ashamed of it it amounted to being silly simply silly he couldnt understand couldnt account for it what possessed him to get a regular scare like this it was too absurd for words sentimentyes by all means a reasonable amount of it well in hand and thus capable of translationif the fancy took youinto nicely turned elegiac verse but a scare a scare pure and simple wasnt to be tolerated and he got up standing astraddle to brace himself against the swinging of the train while he stretched settling himself in his clothespulled down the fronts of his waistcoat buttoned the jacket of his light check suit and taking off his wideawake smoothed his soft slightly curly russetcoloured hair with his hand these adjustments and the assurance they induced that his personal appearance was all which it should be completed his moral restoration he stepped down on to the platform into the serene light and freshness as engaging and hopeful a youth of three and twenty as any one need ask to see for the hard very good sir sir charless trap is outside in the station yard one portmanteau in the van quite so dont trouble yourself about it sir ill send a porter to bring it along this from the stationmaster with a degree of friendly deference far from displeasing to the recipient of it whatever the defects of the rank and file of the verity family in respect of liberal ideas it can safely be asserted of all its members male and female clerical and lay alike that they belonged to the equestrian order hence it added considerably to toms recovered selfcomplacency to find a smart twowheel dogcart awaiting him drawn by a remarkably wellshaped and wellgroomed black horse the coachman was to match middleaged cleanshaven his napoleonic face set as a mask his undress livery of pepperandsalt mixture soberly immaculate he touched his hat when our young gentleman appeared and mounted beside him the horse meanwhile shivering a little and showing the red of its nostrils as the train with strident whistlings drew out of the station bound westward to stourmouth and barryport later the horse broke up the abiding inertia of marychurch high street by dancing as it passed the engine of a slowly ambulant thrashing machine and only settled fairly into its stride when the threearched twelfth century stone bridge over the arne was passed and the roadleaving the last scattered houses of the little townturned south and seaward skirting the shining expanse of the haven and threading the semiamphibious hamlets of horny cross and lampit chapter iii the doubtfully harmonious parts of a whole a long low rectangular and rather narrow room supported across the centrewhere passage walls had been cut awayby an avenue of dumpy wooden pillars four on either side leading to a glass door opening on to the garden a mans room rather than a womans and judging by appearances a bachelors at thateighteenthcentury furniture not ignoble in line but heavy wideseated designed for the comfort of bulky paunched figures arrayed in long napped waistcoats and fullskirted coats tabaret curtains and upholsterings originally maroon now dulled by sea damp and bleached by sunglare to a uniform tone in which colour and pattern were alike obliterated handsome copperplate engravings of pisa and of rome and pastel portraits in oval frames the rest of the whity brown panelled wall space hidden by bookcases these surmounted by softly shining pearlgrey chinese godlings monsters philosophers and saints the shelves below packed with neatly ranged books a dusky room in spite of its rounded outstanding sashwindows two on either side the glass door the air of it holding in permanent solution an odour of leatherbound volumes a place in short which though not inhospitable imposed itself its qualities and traditions to an extent impossible for any save the most thickskinned and thickwitted wholly to ignore or resist young tom verity having no convenient armourplating of stupidity suffered its influence intimately aslooking about him with quick enquiring glanceshe followed the manservant across it between the dumpy pillars he felt selfconscious and disquieted as by a smile of silent amusement upon some watchful elderly face so impressed indeed was he that on reaching the door he paused letting the man pass on alone to announce him he wanted time in which to get over this queer sensation of shyness before presenting himself to the company assembled there in the garden outside yet he was well aware that the prospect out of doorsits amplitude of mellow sunlight and of space its fair windless calm in which no leaf stirredwas far more attractive than the room in the doorway of which he thus elected to linger for the glassdoor gave directly on to an extensive lawn set out immediately before the house front with scarlet and crimson geraniums in alternating square and lozengeshaped beds away on the right a couple of greystemmed ilex treesthe largest in height and girth tom had ever seencast finely vandyked and platted shadow upon the smooth turf beneath them garden chairs were stationed and a teatable spread at which four ladies satone the elder dressed in crude purple the other three though of widely differing ages and aspect in light coloured summer gowns to the left of the lawn a high plastered wallmasked by hollies bay yew and at the far end by masses of airy pinkplumed tamariskshut off the eastward view but straight before him all lay open clean away to the curve of the world as he told himself not without a pull of emotion remembering his impending voyage for about sixty yards distant the lawn ended abruptly in a hard straight linethe land cut off sheer as it seemed at the outer edge of a gravelled terrace upon which two small antiquated cannon were mounted their rusty muzzles trained over swirling bluegreen tide river and yellowgrey highcambered sandbar out to sea between these innocuous engines of destruction little black cannon balls had been piled into a mimic pyramid near to which three men stood engaged in desultory conversation one of them tom observed as markedly taller more commanding and distinguished in bearing than his companions even from here the whole length of the lawn intervening his presence once noted became of arresting importance focussing attention as the central interest the one thing which vitally mattered in this gracious scenehis figure silhouetted vertically against those long horizontal lines of river sandbar and faraway delicate junction of opaltinted sea with opaltinted sky whereupon tom became convicted of the agreeable certainty that no disappointment awaited him his expectations were about to receive generous fulfilment this visit would prove well worth while so absorbed indeed was he in watching the man whom he supposedand rightlyto be his host that he failed to notice one of the ladies rise from the teatable and advance across the lawn until her youthful whiteclad form was close upon him threading its way between the glowing geranium beds thenyou are my cousin thomas verity the girl asked with a grave air of ceremony yesand youyou are my cousin damaris he answered as he felt clumsily being taken unaware in more respects than one and for all his ready adaptability being unable to keep a note of surprise out of his voice and glance he had known of the existence of this little cousin having heardon occasionvaguely irritated family mention of her birth at a time when the flame of the mutiny still burned fiercely in the punjab and in oudh to be born under such very accentuated circumstances could in the eyes of every normal verity hardly fail to argue a certain obtrusiveness and absence of good taste he had heard moreover disapproving allusions to the extravagant affection sir charles verity was said to lavish upon this fruit of a somewhat obscure marriagehis only surviving child but the said family talk in toms case had gone in at one ear and out at the otheras the talk of the elder generation mostly does and will when the younger generation is solidly and wholesomely convinced of the overwhelming importance of its own personal affairs consequently in coming to deadham hard tom had thought of this little cousinin as far as it occurred to him to think of her at allas a child in the schoolroom who beyond a trifle of goodnatured notice at odd moments would not enter into the count or matter at all now awakening to the fact of her proximity he awoke to the further fact that with one exception she mattered more than anything or anybody else present she was in truth younghe had been quite right there yet like the room in the doorway of which he still lingered like the man standing on the terrace walkto whose tall figure the serene immensities of sea and sky acted as backcloth and settingshe imposed herself whether she was pretty or plain tom was just now incapable of judging he only knew that her eyes were wonderful he never remembered to have seen such eyesclear dark bluegrey with fine shading of eyelash on the lower as well as the upper lid unquestionably they surpassed all ordinary standards of prettiness were glorious yet curiously embarrassing too in their seriousness their intent impartial scrutinyunder which last to his lively vexation the young man felt himself redden and this considering his superiority in age sex and acquirements was not only absurd but unfair somehow for did not he as a rule get on charmingly well with women gentle and simple old and young alike had he not an ingratiating playfully flirtatious way with them in which he trusted but flirtatiousness even of the mildest description would not do here instinctively he recognized that it would not pay at allin this stage of the acquaintance at all events he fell back on civil speeches and these rather laboured ones being himself rather discountenanced it is extremely kind of you and sir charles to take me on trust like this he began believe me i am very grateful under ordinary circumstances i should never have dreamed of proposing myself but i am going out to india for the first timesailing in the penang the day after tomorrow and as i should be so near here at southampton it was i own a great temptation to ask if i might come for a night i feltmy father feltwhat a privilege it would be for me a really tremendous piece of luck to meet sir charles before i started such a rare and memorable send off for me you know we were very glad you should propose yourself damaris answered still with her grave air of ceremony awfully good of you im sure the young man murmuredno she didnt stare he could not honestly call it staring it was too calm too impersonal too reserved for that she looked with a view to arriving at conclusions regarding him and he didnt enjoy the processnot in the least my father is still interested in everything connected with india she went on he will like to talk to you we have people with us this afternoon whom he could not very well leave or he would have driven into marychurch himself to fetch you dr mccabe who we knew at bhutpur long ago came over unexpectedly from stourmouth this morning and my aunt harriet cowden telegraphed that she and uncle augustus would bring aunt felicia who is staying with them at paulton lacy here to teabut of course you know them quite welluncle augustus i mean and my aunts do i not know them tom replied with meaning while humour getting the upper hand thanks to certain memories he smiled at her and even at this early period in his career it must be conceded that tom veritys smile was an asset to be reckoned with mischievous to the verge of impudence but confidential too most disarmingly friendlya really vastly engaging smile which having once beheld most persons found themselves more than ready to behold often again under its persuasive influence damaris gravity relaxed she lowered her eyes and the soft warm colour deepened in her cheeks her steady gaze removed the young man breathed more freely he congratulated himself intercourse was in act of becoming normal and easy so far it had been quite absurdly hindleggyand for him him to be forced into being hindleggy by a girl of barely eighteen now he prepared to trot gaily comfortably off on all fours when she spoke bringing him up to the perpendicular again with a start i love aunt felicia very dearly she announced as though in protest against some implied and subtle disloyalty but dont we all love cousin felicia he returned promptly eager to maintain his advantage isnt she kindness incarnate christian charity personified as for me i simply dote on her and with reason for ever since those remote ages in which i wore scratchy pinafores and horrid little white socks she has systematically and pertinaciously spoiled me whenever she stayed at canton magnaoh she is an institution no family should be without her when i was small she gave me chocolates tin soldiers popguns warranted to endanger my brothers and sisters eyesight and now in a thousand ways conscious and unconscious he laughed quietly naughtily the words running over each other in the rapidity of his speechshe gives me such a blessed good conceit of myself and damaris verity caught by the wave of his lightheartedness and inherent desire to please softened again her serious eyes alight for the moment with answering laughter whereupon tom crossed the threshold and stood close beside her upon the grass in the brooding sunshine the beds of scarlet and crimson geraniums ranging away on glowing perspective to left and right he glanced at the three ladies seated beneath the giant ilexes and back at his companion he felt absurdly keen further to excite her friendliness and dispel her gravity only one must admit cousin harriet is quite another story he went on softly saucily any conceit our dear felicia rubs in to you harriet most effectually rubs out isnt it so i am as a worm a positive worm before hercan only tremble and obey like the historic lady in the glee she flattens me i havent an ounce of kick left in me and then why oh why tell me damaris does she invariably and persistently clothe herself in violet ink it is her colour the girl said her eyes still laughing her lips discreetly set but why in heavens name should she have a colour he demanded for identification as i have a red and white stripe painted on my steamer baggage really that isnt necessary can you imagine losing cousin harriet augustus cowden mislaying her for example and only recovering her with joyful crieswe take those for granted in his case of courseat sight of the violet ink not a bit of it you know as well as i do identification marks cant ever be required to secure her return because under no conceivable circumstances could she ever be lost she is there dear lady lock stock and barrel right there all the time so her raiment of violet amounts to a purely gratuitous advertisement of a permanently selfevident factand such a shade too such a positively excruciating shade but here a movement upon the terrace served indirectly to put a term to his patter for sir charles verity raising his voice slightly in passing emphasis turned and moved slowly towards the little company gathered at the teatable his two companions followed the shorter of them apparently making answer the words echoing clearly in genial richness of affirmation across the intervening spaceand so it was general am i not recalling the incident myself indeed youre entirely right come damaris said with a certain brevity as of command and feel a worm nocome and speak to my father ah i shall feel a worm there too the young man returned an engaging candour in his smiling countenance and with far better reason unless i am greatly mistaken chapter iv watchers through the small hours love illhealth and debt being as yet unknown quantities to young tom verity it followed that insomnia with its thousand and one attendant miseries was an unknown quantity likewise upon the eve of the stiffest competitive examination those now outlived years of tutelage had imposed on him he could still tumble into bed secure of lapsing into unconsciousness as soon as his head fairly touched the pillow dreams might and usually did visit him but as so much incidental music merely to the large content of slumbertittering up and down too airily lightfooted and evanescent to leave any impress on mind or spirits when he woke this night at deadham hard marked a new departure sleep proving a less absolute break in continuity of sensation a less absolute barrier between day and day the honourable augustus and mrs cowden and felicia verity not without last words adjurations commands and fussings started on their twelvemile drive home to paulton lacy about six oclock a little later dr mccabe conveyed himself and his brogue away in an ancient hired landau to catch the evening train from marychurch to stourmouth dinner followed shortly after which damaris vanished along with her governesscompanion miss theresa bilsona plump roundvisaged pinknosed little person permanently wearing gold eyeglasses the outstanding distinction of whose artless existence consisted as tom gathered from her conversation in a tour in rhineland and residence of some months duration at the university town of bonn then at last came the harvest of the young mans excursion in the shape of firsthand records of war and governmentof intrigue and of sedition followed by stern retributive chastisementfrom that famous soldier autocratic and practised administrator his host in the opinion of a good many persons tom veritys bump of reference showed very insufficient development dons headmasters the pedagogic and professorial tribe generally he had long taken in his stride quite unabashed church dignitaries too left him saucily cool forso at least he arguedwas not his elder brother pontifex private chaplain to the bishop of harchester and did not this facthe knowing poor old ponty as only brother can know brotherthrow a rather lurid light upon the spiritual and intellectual limitations of the bench in respect of the british aristocracy his social betters he also kept an open mind for had not lord bulparcs son and heir little oxley acted as his fag bootblack and baconfrier for the best part of a year at school notwithstanding which factlord oxley was of a mild forgiving dispositionhad not he tom spent the cricket week several summers running at napworth castle where on one celebrated occasion he bowled a distinguished permanent undersecretary first ball and on another chided a marquis and excabinet minister for misquoting catullus yet now sitting smoking and listening to those records of eastern rule and eastern battle in the quiet lamplight of the long roomwith its dark bookcases faintly gleaming chinese images and dumpy pillarshis native cheekiness faded into most unwonted humility for he was increasingly conscious of being to put it vulgarly up against something pretty big conscious of a personality altogether too secure of its own power to spread itself or in the smallest degree bluff or brag sir charles verity struck him indeed as calm to the confines of cynicism he gave but gave of his abundance royally indifferent to the cost there was plenty more where all this came from of knowledge of initiative and of thought only once or twice during the course of their long talk did the young man detect any sign of personal feeling then for an instant some veil seemed to be lifted some curtain drawn aside while with dazzling effect he became cognizant of underlying bitterness underlying romanceof secret dealings of man with man of man with woman and the dealing arbitrary immutable final of death and a greater than death with both these revelations though of the briefest over before he fairly grasped their import gone like a breath were still sufficient to discredit many preconceived ideas and enlarge his mental horizon to a somewhat anxious extent they carried him very far from life as lived at canton magna rectory very far from all indeed in which the roots of his experience were set thus producing an atmosphere of doubt of haunting and insidious unrest and of that atmosphere he was particularly sensible when standing in the hall flat candlestick in hand he at last bade sir charles verity good night it has been a wonderful evening sir he said simply and modestly you have been awfully kind in sparing me so much of your time but indeed it has not been time wasted i begin to measure a little what india means i hope certainly i begin to measure the depth of my own ignorance i see i have nearly everything of essential importance still to learn and that is a pretty large orderalmost staggeringly large now that thanks to you i begin to realize the vastness of the amount the majority of men in your service never realize it charles verity returned they run in blinkers from first to lastnot that i underrate their usefulness they are honest painstaking thoroughly reliable according to their lights they do excellent journeyman work but there lies the heart of the whole matterare you content to do journeyman work only or do you aspire to something greaterif the former then you had best forget me and all i have told you this evening as fast as possible for it will prove a hindrance rather than a help confusing the issuesnonolisten a moment my dear boy this kindly indulgently even as tom made a gesture of repudiation and began to speak if the latterwell the door stands open upon achievement by no means contemptible as the opportunities of modern life go but it is only fair to warn you upon possibilities of trouble even of disaster by no means contemptible either for remember the world is so constituted that if you elect to drive rather than be driven you must be prepared to take heavy risks pay heavy penalties understand he laid his hand on the young mans shoulder i do not pose as a teacher still less as a propagandist i do not attempt to direct the jury the choice rests exclusively with yourselfand here rid your mind of any cant about moral obligations both ways have merit both bring rewardsof sortsare equally commendable equally right only thiswhether you choose blinkers your barrel between the shafts and another mans whip tickling your loins or the reins in your own hands and the open road ahead be faithful to your choice stick to it through evil report as well as through good he lifted his hand off toms shoulder and the latter looking round at him was struckin mingled admiration and repulsionby his likeness to some shapely bird of prey with fierce hooked beak and russetgrey eyes luminous cruel perhaps yet very sad above all be careful in the matter of your affections sir charles went on his voice deepening as you value your career the pride of your intellectyesand the pride of your manhood itself let nothing feminine tempt you to be unfaithful to your choice tempt you to be of two minds to turn aside to turn back for so surely as you do you will find the hell of disappointment the hell of failure and regret waiting widemouthed to swallow you and whatever span of life may remain to you bodily up he checked himself breaking off abruptly the veil lowered again the curtain drawn into place there he said we have talked enough perhaps more than enough you have a long day before you tomorrow so my dear boy go to bed my quarters are down here he made a gesture towards the dark corridor opening off the far side of the hall you know your way the room on the right of the landing yes i know my way thanks sir tom answered and thus dismissed went on upstairs carrying the silver flat candlestick while his shadow black on the panelled wall mounted beside him grotesquely prancing step by step the furnishing of his room was of a piece with all below solid yet not uncomely it included a fourpost bed of generous proportions hangings curtains and covers of chintz over which faded purple and crimson roses were flung broadcast on a honeyyellow ground the colourings were discreetly cheerful the atmosphere not unpleasantly warm the quiet save for the creaking of a board as he crossed the floor unbroken outwardly all invited to peaceful slumber and tom felt more than ready to profit by that invitation this last night on shore last night in england his attention had been upon the stretch for a good many hours now since thatafter all rather upsettinggoodbye to home and family at canton magna following an early and somewhat peripatetic breakfast notwithstanding his excellent health and youthful energy mind and body alike were somewhat spent he made short work of preparation slipped in between the fine cool linen sheets and laid his brown head upon the soft billowing pillows impatient neither to think nor feel any more but simply to sleep for some two hours or so he did sleep though not without phantasmagoria queerly disturbing the sweep of his visions was wide ranging from that redoubtable county lady harriet cowden nee verityfirst cousin of his father the archdeacon and halfsister to his hostin her violetink hued gown to fury of internecine strife amid the mountain fastnesses of afghanistanfrom the austere and wistful beauty of the grey longbacked norman abbey rising above the roofs and chimneys of the little english markettown to the fierce hectic splendour of eastern cities blistering in the implacable sunglare of the indian plains days on the harchester playing fields days on the river at oxford and still earlier days in the rectory nursery at home bringing with them sense of small bitter sorrows small glorious triumphs of laughter and uproarious fun of sentimental passages at balls picnics garden parties too with charmingly pretty maidens who in all probability he would never clap eyes on againall these and impressions even more illusive and fugitive playing hideandseek among the mazelike convolutions of his all too active brain then on a sudden he started up in bed aware of external noise and movement which brought him instantly almost painfully broad awake for a quite appreciable length of time while he sat upright in the warm darkness tom failed either to locate the noise which had thus roused him or to interpret its meaning it appeared to him to start at the river foreshore pass across the garden into and through the groundfloor suite of rooms and corridor which sir charles had indicated as reserved to his particular usewhat on earth could it be what did it remind him ofwhy surelywith a start of incredulous recognitionthe sound of hoofs though strangely confused and muffled such as a mob of scared overdriven horses might make floundering fetlock deep in loose sand alive with curiosity he sprang out of bed groped his way across to the window and putting up the blind leaned out a coppery waning moon hung low in the southeast and sent a pale rusty pathway across the sea to where behind the sandbar rippling waves broke in soft flash and sparkle its light was not strong enough to quench that of the stars crowding the western and the upper sky tom could distinguish the black mass of the great ilex trees on the right could see the whole extent of the lawn the two sentinel cannon and pyramid of ammunition set on the terrace along the top of the seawall and nothing moved there nothing whatever the outstretch of turf was vacant empty bareso tom told himselfas the back of his own hand the sounds seemed to have ceased now that sight denied them visible cause of existence and he began to wonder whether his hearing had not played him false whether the whole thing was not pure fancy a delusion born of agitated dreams he pushed the sash up as far as it would go and leaned further out of the window the luscious scent of a late flowering species of lonercera trained against the house wall saluted his nostrils along with a fetidsweet reek off the mudflats of the haven away in the village a dog yelped and out on the saltmarshes waterfowl gave faint whistling cries then all settled down into stillness save for the just audible chuckle and suck of the river as the stream met the inflowing tide the stillness pleased him for so many nights to come there would be none of it but ceaselessly the drumming of the engines quiver of the screw and wash of the water against the ships sideall the same he did not quite like the colour of the moon or that frayed flattened edge of it westward why is there always something a trifle menacing about a waning moon he did not like the smell of the mudflats either it might not be actually unhealthy but it suggested a certain foulness he yawned drew back into the room and straightening himself up stretched his hands above his head he would get into bed again he was dogtiredyes most distinctly bed then he stopped short listening hastily knelt down by the window and again leaned out for once more he heard horses coming up from the shore across the garden into and through the house hustling and trampling one another as they shied away from the whipthere were laggards tooone stumbled rolled over in the sand got on its feet after a nasty struggle and tottered onward dead lame another fell in its tracks and lay there foundered rattling in the throat the sounds were so descriptive so explicit and the impression produced on tom veritys mind so vivid that carried away by indignation he found himself saying out loud curse them the brutes the cowardly brutes mishandling their cattle like that they and he stopped confounded as it came home to him that throughout the course of this cruel drama he had seen nothing literally nothing though he had heard so convincingly much a shiver ran down his spine and he broke into a sweat for he knew beyond question or doubt not so much as a shadowlet alone anything materialhad breasted the seawall passed over the smooth level turf or enteredhow should itthe house the garden lay outspread before him calm uninvaded by any alien being man or animal the great ilex trees were immobile fixed as the eternal stars overhead and he shrank in swift protest almost in terror being called on thus to face things apparently supernormal forces unexplored and uncharted defying reason giving the lie to ordinary experience and ordinary belief reality and hallucination jostled one another in his thought a giant note of interrogation written against each for which was the true and which the false of necessity he distrusted the evidence of his own senses finding sight and hearing in direct conflict thus the two or three minutes that followed were among the most profoundly disagreeable tom ever had spent but at last a door opened below letting forth a shaft of mellow lamplight it touched the flowerbeds on the left edging the lawn giving the geraniums form and colour laying down a delicate carpet of green transmuting black into glowing scarlet tall and spare in his grey and white sleepingsuit sir charles verity sauntered out and stood smoking looking out to sea earlier that night downstairs in the sittingroom he seemed a storm centre generating much perplexity and disquiet but now tom welcomed his advent with a sense of almost absurd satisfaction to see what was solidly incontrovertibly human could not but be in itself a mighty reliefthings began to swing into their natural relation man living man the centre the dominant factor once more he tom could now shift all responsibility moreover if the master of the house was on guard he might wash his hands of these hateful ghostly goings onif ghostly they wereleaving the whole matter to one far stronger and more competent than himself whereupon he went back to bed and slept profoundly royally until hordle the manservant moving about the bright chintz bedecked room preparing his bath and laying out his clothes awoke him to the sweetness of another summer day chapter v between river and sea we had a grand talk last nightsir charles was in splendid form i enjoyed it down to the ground tom verity lay at full length on the upward sloping sunwarmed bank of sand and shingle only to youth is given enjoyment of perfect laziness joined with perfect physical vigour just because he felt equal to vaulting the moon or longjumping an entire continent should such prodigious feats be required of him could he lie thus in glorious idleness letting the earth cradle and the sun soak into him doubts and disturbances of last night melted in daylight to an almost ludicrous nothingness and selfconfidence reigned so that he declared the world a superexcellent place snapping his fingers at problems and mysteries a spark of curiosity pricked him still it is true concerning the origin of certain undeniably queer aural phenomena he meant to satisfy that curiosity presently but the subject must be approached with tact he must wait on opportunity a few paces from and above him damaris sat on the crown of the ridge where the light southerly wind coming up now and again off the sea fanned her a white knitted jersey pulled on over her linen dress moulded the curve of her back the round of her breasts and turn of her waist showing each movement of her gracious young body to the hips as she leaned forward her knees drawn up and her feet planted among the red orange and creamgrey flints and pebbles looking up at her tom saw her face foreshortened in the shade of her broad brimmed garden hat a soft clear flush on it born of health fresh air and sunlight her eyes shining the blue of the open sea in their luminous depths he received a new impression of her she belonged to the morning formed part of the gladness of universal nature an unfettered nymphlike being today her mood was sprightly bidding farewell to ceremony yet he felt she remained perplexing because more detached than is the feminine habit poised and complete in herself and this detachment this suppression of the sentimental or social notehe being admittedly a very personable fellowpiqued toms male vanity so that he rallied her with but by the way why did you vanish so early why didnt you stay with us after dinner last night i did not want to vanish she answered nothing is more delightful than hearing my father talk but had i stayed miss bilson would have supposed herself free to stay too and that would have spoiled the evening my father doesnt choose to talk freely before miss bilson because she gets into a foolish excited state and interrupts and asks questions she overflows with admiration and that annoys and bores him she brought him butter in a lordly dish tom quoted the illadvised bilson cant one just see her and it is not her place to admire out loud damaris continued over and over again i have tried to explain that to her but in some ways she is not at all clever she cant or wont understand and only tells aunt felicia i am wanting in sympathy and that i hurt her feelings she has unreasonably many feelings i think and they are so easily hurt i always know when the hurting takes place because she sniffs and then plays mendelssohns songs without words on the schoolroom piano tom chuckled she had a caustic tongue on occasion this nymphlike creature alas poor bilson he said for as sir charles walked across the garden with us down to the ferry didnt i hear those same sugary melodies tinkling out of some upper open window i am afraid you did you see she had made up her mind to come with me and you were forced to intimate you found yourself quite equal to conducting the expedition unshepherded i did not mean to be unkind but she would have been so dreadfully in the way damaris gathered up a handful of little pebbles and let them dribble down slowly between her outspread fingers while turning her head she gazed away out to sea this is a day by itself she said it looks like jewels topazes turquoise and pearls and it seems full of things which half tell themselves and then hide from or pass you byi wanted to watch it all and think and she doesnt do it on purpose i know but somehow miss bilson always interferes with my thinking both the tone and substance of this discourse proved slightly startling to its hearer they carried the conversation into regions transcendental and to his blissful laziness the rarefied air of those regions was unwelcome to breathe it demanded exertion so he said chaffingly do i interfere with your thinking i hope not but if i offend that way speak but a word and i disappear like a shot oh no she answered how could you interfere you are part of it you started it you see because you are going to india whereat failing to catch the sequence of ideas male vanity plumed itself tickled to the point of amusement for was not she a child after all transparently simple and candid and very much a womanchild at that tom turning on his side raised himself on one elbow smiling at her with easy goodnature how charming of you to adopt me as a special object of thought and care so much about my going but patronage proved shortlived the girls colour deepened but her eyes dwelt on him coldly i have only been thinking how fortunate you are and seeing pictures in my mind of what you will see which will be new to youandand remembering oh of course i am lucky tremendously lucky he hastened to declare laughing a little wryly such a journey is a liberal education in itself knocking the insularity out of a manif he has any receptive faculty that isand ridding him of all manner of stodgy prejudices i dont the least undervalue my good fortunebut you talk of remembering thats stretching a point surely you must have been a mere baby my dear damaris when you left india no i was six years old and i remember quite well all my caring for people all my thinking begins there in the palace of the sultanibagh at bhutpur and the great compound when my father was chief commissioner her snub duly delivered and she secure it had gone home damaris unbent graciously communicative as never before it was all so beautiful and safe there inside the high walls and yet a teeny bit frightening because you knew there were other thingsas there are todaywhich you felt but couldnt quite see all about you sometimes they nearly pushed throughi was always expecting and i like to expect it hurt me dreadfully to go away but i had been very ill they were afraid i should die and so dr mccabehe was here when you arrived yesterdayinsisted on my being sent to europe a ladymrs pereiraand my nurse sarah watson took me to paris to the convent school where i was to be educated it was all very strange but the nuns were kind i liked their religion and i got accustomed to the other little girls i had rooms of my own and french friends of my fathers visited me and took me out on halfholidays and aunt felicia came over to fetch me for the summer vacations and brought me here damaris pointed across the tideway to the river frontage including with one sweeping gesture the whole demesne of the hard from the deep lane on the one hand opening funnellike upon the shore past seawalltopped at the corner by pink plumed tamarisk the small twin cannons and pyramid of ballthe lawn and irregular white house overlooking it backed and flanked by rich growth of trees to a strip of sandy warren and pine scrub on the other from out which a line of some halfdozen purple stemmed red branched scotch firs along with the grey stone built inn and tarred wooden cottages on the promontory beyond showed through a dancing shimmer of heat haze against the landlocked blue and silver waters of marychurch haven i did not like being here at all at first she told him i thought it a mean place only fit for quite poor people to live in the house seemed so pinched and naked without any galleries or verandahs and i was afraid because we had so few servants and neither doorkeepers or soldiers i could not believe that in england there is so little need for protection against disaffected persons and thieves the sunshine was pale and thin and the dusk made me sad at bhutpur the sun used to drop in flame behind the edge of the world and night leap on you but here the day took so long dying aunt felicia used to praise what she called the long sweet english twilight and try to make me stop out in the garden to enjoy it with her but i could not bear it the colours faded so slowly it seemed like watching some helpless creature bleed to death silently growing greyer minute by minute and feebler i did not want to watch but go indoors where the lamps were lighted and it was warm and cosy i used to cry dreadfully when i could get away by myself where aunt felicia and the maids could not see me cry for my fatherhe resigned the commissionership you know when i was sent home and took service in afghanistan under the ameerand for my darling friend mrs pereira and for the sultanibagh where i knew strangers lived now for the lotus tank and orange grove and all my little tame animals and my pretty playplaces i should never never see any more overcome by which intimate memories damaris grave voicewhich had taken on a chanting cadence at once novel and singularly pleasing to the young mans earquavered and broke poor little exiled princess he cried all his facile kindness to the fore again yes it must have been cruelly hard on you you must have suffered no wonder you criedcried buckets full and drawn by pity for that desolate tropicbred little child tom got on to his feet and crunched up the loose shingle to the crest of the ridge full of a lively desire to pacify and console but here the soft breeze met and caressed him and the whole plain of the tranquil sea came into viewturquoise shot with pearl as damaris recently figured it and fringed with topaz where waves a few inches high and clear as glass broke on the yellow sand at the back of the bar just below how wonderfully lovely he exclaimed carried out of himself by the extreme fairness of the scene and his hands in his trouser pockets he stood staring while once again the pull of home of england of tenderness for all that which he was about to leave dimmed his eyes and raised a lump in his throat upon my word you must be difficult to please if this place doesnt please you or come up to your requirements damaris he said presently sitting down beside her no arabian nights palace in asia i grant you yet in its own humbler anddare i sayless showy manner not easy to beat breathe this enchanting air see the heavenly tints with which our good dirty useful old channel has adorned itself can you ask for more you insatiable person in the way of beauty then slightly ashamed of his outburst tom practised a delightful smile at once sentimental and flirtatious no on second thoughts my dear princess i keep my commiseration for my wretched selfevery crumb of it for i am the lonely exilethat is i am just about to benot you be advised dont quarrel with the good gifts of the gods deadham hard is frankly entrancing how willingly would i put off taking ship for your vaunted india and spend the unending cycles of eternity herewith you well understoodin this most delectable spot instead whereupon damaris with mingled gravity and haste her head bent so that hatcrown and hatbrim were presented to the young mans observation rather than her face proceeded to explain she had spoken not of the present but of the past from the time sir charles returned to inhabit it the hard was transformed his presence conferring interest and dignity upon it rendering it a not unworthy dwellingplace indeedshould any such happen that wayfor sages conquerors or even kings he cared for the little property a fact to her all sufficient for him it held the charm of old associations the pleasantest days of his boyhood were spent here with thomas clarkson verity his great unclewho eventually left him the propertynor had he ever failed later to visit it when home on leave in pious remembrance of that distant era and of his entertaining and affectionate if somewhat eccentric host and friend he forbade any alteration in the house or grounds it continued today just as old mr verity left it there was no break even in details of furnishing or arrangement with the past this to sir charles added to the natural restfulness of the place now after the great achievements and responsibilities of his eastern career he found retirement congenial the soft equable climate benefited his health rough shooting and good fishing could be had in plentystaghunting too in arnewood forest when he inclined to such sport the hard was sufficiently easy of access from town for friends to come and stay with him convenient for crossing to the continent too when he took his yearly cure at aix or at vichy or went south for a couple of months as last winter for instance to cette montpelier and across by pau to the atlantic seaboard at st sebastian biarritz and bayonne when my father travels i go with him damaris said raising her head and looking at the young man with proud deliberate eyes we both suffered too much we must never be separated again and when we go abroad we go alone there is no one to give advice or interfere we take hordle to pack and look after the baggage we are always together and i am always happy i wish we could live like that always with no settled home but after a while my father grows tired of hotels he begins to wish for the quiet of the hard and all the things he is accustomed to and then naturally i begin to wish for it too from which statement made as he judged with intention tom apprehended an attachment of no common order existing between these two persons father and child if as family gossip disapprovingly hinted the affection given appeared to trench on exaggeration the affection returned was of kindred quality fervid selfrealized absorbing and absorbed comparing it with his own humorously tolerant filial attitude tom felt at once contrite and injured the contrast was glaring but then as he hastened to addthough whether in extenuation of his own or of his fathers shortcomings remained open to questionwasnt the contrast between the slightly pompous slightly bowwindowed provincial tory cleric and this spare inscrutable soldier and ruler glaring likewise to demand that the one should either experience or inspire the same emotions as the other was palpably absurd hence comfortable conclusion neither he tom nor the archdeacon was really to blameonly as he further argued once the absurdity of that same demand admitted were you not free to talk of exaggeration or of the grand manner as you chose were not the terms interchangeable if you kept an open mind his personal acquaintance with the grand manner in respect of the affections with heroical love amounted save in literature to practically nothing yet instinctively he applied those high sounding phrases to the attachment existing between damaris and her father both as discovery and in some sort as challenge to his own preconceived ideas and methods this gave him food for serious thought he made no attempt at comment or answer but sat silent beside the girl bareheaded in the soft wind and sunlight between the flowing river and tranquil sea the grand mannerthat was how naturally without posing or bombast these two persons envisaged life for good or evilfor this last too might be possibleshaped their purposes and conduct sir charles he knew had played for big stakes damaris he felt intuitively young though she was played and would play for them likewise he looked at her with awakened speculation awakened curiosity what he wondered would come of it did it make her attractive or the reverse really he wasnt at all sure whereat he grew restive the claims of inherent masculine superiority let alone those of public school university and an honourable profession asserting themselves he began to question whether this young lady did not take up an undue amount of room thus cramping him and denying his powers of conversation suitable opportunity of display was not it about time gently to reduce her relegate her to a more modest position to achieve which laudable resulthe acted of course for her good exclusivelyhe prepared to broach the subject of the unaccountable noises which disturbed his rest last night he would crossexamine her as to their origin thereby teasing and perhaps even discountenancing her somewhat but before tom could put his benevolent scheme into execution his attention was unexpectedly diverted a quite new element projecting itself upon the scene for some little while an open boat a hoary though still seaworthy tub of a thing deep in draught and broad in the beam loaded up with lobsterpotsthe skeleton ribs of them black against the surrounding expanse of shining turquoise and pearlhad slowly neared the bar from seaward the bows in which a small withered old man bent double over the oars cocked up on end the stern where a young man stood erect among the lobsterpots was low in the water now as the nose of the boat grounded the young man clambered along the gunwale and balancing for a minute tall and straight on the prow took a flying leap across the wide intervening space of breaking wave and clear water alighting on his feet upon the firm sand beyond good for him neatly done tom verity murmured appreciating the grace and vigour of the action the young man meanwhile turning called to the rower thank you heartily for putting me ashore daddy proud ill go across home by the ferry but see here can you manage her by yourself or shall i help shove her off for you lord love ee i can manage her sure enough the other called back shrilly and a trifle truculently i knows er ways and she knows her masterought to by now the old strumpet if years count for anythink so dont ee go wetting yer dandy shoes for the likes of her and me capen and keckling with thin wheezy laughter he straightened his back and planting one oar in the sand set the boat afloat again skilfully chapter vi in which the past lays an ominous hand on the present down here on the shore in the serene morning atmosphere voices carried with peculiar distinctness every word of the brief colloquy had reached tom verity and one word at least possessed an elizabethan flavour forbidden to ears victorian feminine and polite noting it tom reddened and glanced uneasily at his companion all inclination to tease giving place to a laudable desire to shield her from annoyance but damaris judging by her demeanour was unaware of any cause of offence whence with relief he concluded that either she had not heard or that the rank expression conveyed nothing intelligible to her mind her open hand pressed down upon the rough surface of the pebbles she leaned a little backward her lithe body twisted sideways from the waist while she scrutinized the man upon the sands below and that the latter presented a gallant and even distinguished appearance though arrayed in leatherpeaked cap blue serge reefer jacket and trousers which had evidently seen service tom could not but admit as he stood just clear of the ripples of incoming tide staring idly after the receding boat with its cargo of black ribbed skeleton lobsterpotsa spiritedlooking wellmade fellow no doubt merchant captain or more probably matetom took him to be about eightandtwentybut in an altogether different rank of life to themselves and therefore a quite unsuitable object for prolonged and earnest attention his advent should be treated as an accident not elevated thus to the importance of an event it was not quite good taste on damaris part tom felt and he made a show of rising saying as he did so by way of excuse it is wonderfully charming out here i am loath to break up our little teteatete but time waits for no man worse luck and if i am to catch my train i must start directly after luncheon sir charles was good enough to promise me various letters of introduction to persons in high places he told me to remind him about them i dont want to be greedy but i should like those letters perhaps i ought to be getting back so as to see your father about them but before damaris had time to collect her thoughts and reply the man in the peaked cap had further asserted his presence either becoming conscious of her observation or caught by something in tom veritys speech he wheeled round and looked up at the two in swift almost haughty enquiry to tom he vouchsafed little more than a glance but upon damaris his eyes fastened for a good minute he stared at her as though in some sort holding her to ransom then with an upward jerk of the head and an ejaculation half smothered oath half sharp laughteras of one who registers eminently ironic conclusionshe began deliberately ascending the slope tom verity though possessed of plentiful cheekiness towards the majority of his elders and betters was no fireeater he preferred diplomacy to war and would adroitly evade rather than invite anything approaching a scene specially in the presence of a woman yet under existing circumstances retreat had become as he perceived not only undignified but useless so in his best oxford mannera manner ornate at that period and quite crushingly superiorhe raised his shoulders smiled faintly resignedly and disposed himself in an easier attitude saying better wait perhaps my dear damaris i would sooner risk losing those precious letters than acquire a possible escort for youand for myselfdown to the river and across the ferry and he threw a meaning glance over his shoulder indicating the obtrusive stranger so doing he received a disturbing impression for seen thus at close quarters not only was the said stranger notably even astonishingly goodlooking but he bore an arresting likeness in build in carriage in expression to tom paused perplexed racking his brainsfor who the deuce was it where had he seen and that as he could have sworn quite recently this same forceful countenance lit by russetgrey eyes at once dauntless and sad deepset well apart the lids of them smooth and delicately moulded the mans skin was tanned by exposure to a tint but a few shades lighter than that of his goldbrown bearda beard scrupulously groomed trimmed to a nicety and by no means deforming the lower part of the face since the line of jaw and chin remained clearly discernible tom turned away and looked absently at the hard in its broad reposeful frame of lawn and trees the cool green foliage of a bank of hydrangeasrunning from the great ilexes to the corner of the housethickset with discs of misty pink and blue blossom took his fancy as contrast to the beds of scarlet and crimson geranium naming in the sun but below any superficial sense of pleasure in outward things thought of that likenessand likeness dash it all to whomstill vexed him as a riddle he failed to guess obligation to guess it to find the right answer obsessed him as of vital interest and importance though for the life of him he could not tell why his sense of proportion his social sense his selfcomplacency grew restive under the pressure of it he told himself it wasnt of the smallest consequence didnt matter a fig yet continued to cudgel his memory and all the while the sound of deliberate footsteps crunching over the dry rattling shingle nearer and nearer contributed to increase his inward perturbation the footsteps halted close behind himwhile for a sensible length of time a shadow lay across him shutting off the genial warmthand started again passing to the left as the intruder traversed the crown of the ridge a few paces from where damaris was seated and pursued his way down to the rivershore on the other side at lasti thank you tom broke out impatiently he felt incomprehensibly nervous and angry with himself for so feeling commend me to our friend for taking his time about things and incidentally wasting oursyours and mine i mean what on earth did he want he certainly treated us to a sufficiently comprehensive inspection well i hope he was satisfied by the same token have you any conception who the fellow is damaris shook her head she too appeared perturbed her eyebrows were drawn into a little frown and her expression was perplexed to the point of childlike distress not any she answered simply some one staying at faircloths inn possibly people come there from marychurch to spend the day during the summer old timothy proud the lobstercatcher who brought him round in his boat lives at one of the cottages close to the inn no she repeated i have no conception who he is and yet his face seemed familiar i had a feeling that i knew him quite wellhad seen him often oh very often before ah then you were puzzled by some mysterious likenesstom began eagerly smiling at her and stopped short openmouthed assailed by so apparently preposterous a recognition that for the minute it left him fairly speechless but damaris busy with her own sensations her glance still following the blueclad figure along the shore and out on to the tumbledown wooden jetty failed to remark his embarrassment and thus gave him time to recover his scattered wits jennifer is bringing the ferryboat across she said presently so you wont have to wait much longer not that you need be at all anxious about those letters it is not my fathers habit to forget a promise most likely they were written last night before he went to bed he sleeps badly i am sorry to say and is glad to cheat the wakeful hours by reading and doing his correspondence until late as she spoke the young girl rose to her feet pulling the closefitting jersey down over her hips and stooping dusted particles of sand off the hem of her dress therethats better now i am tidy shall we go home cousin tom she asked her eyes shone with inward excitement and she carried her head proudly but her face was white and he sensible that she had suddenly hardened towards him and strove he could not divine why to keep him at arms length turned perversely teasing again he would not await a more convenient season here and now he would satisfy his curiosityand at her expenseregarding one at least of the queer riddles deadham hard had sprung on him i did not know your father suffered from sleeplessness he said it must be horribly trying and depressing i am glad in a way you have told me because it may account for my seeing him go out into the garden from the study last night or rather very early this morning it would be about two oclock i put down his appearance to another cause and he smiled at her delightfully ingratiating assaugingly apologetic shall i own itone which frankly struck me as a little upsetting and the reverse of pleasant werent you comfortable i am so sorry damaris exclaimed instincts of hospitality instantly militant what was wrong you should have called someonerung for hordle what was it nonomy dear damaris dont vex yourself i entreat you i was in clover luxuriously comfortable youve allotted me a fascinating room and perfect dream of a bed i feel an ungrateful wretch for so much as mentioning this matter to you after the way in which you have indulged me only something rather extraordinary really did happen of which i honestly confess i am still expiring to find a reasonable and not too humiliating explanation for though i blush to own it he laughed softly humping up his shoulders after the manner of a naughty small boy dodging a wellmerited box on the ear yes i blush to own it but i was frightened downright frightened i quailed and i quaked the sight of sir charles stepping out of the study window filled me with abject rapture metaphorically speaking my craven soul squirmed at his heels he was to me as a strong tower and house of defencebut look here damaris joking apart tell me werent you disturbed didnt you hear any strange noises last night no none she hesitated then with evident reluctancei sleep in the new wing of the house which you imply might make a difference tom asked the older servants would tell you that it does and you agree with them damaris had a moment of defective courage i would rather not discuss the subject cousin tom she said and moved away down over the shifting shingle at first her progress was sober even stately but soon either from the steep insecure nature of the ground or from less obvious and material cause her pace quickened until it became a run she ran neatly deftly all of a piece as a boy runs no trace of disarray or feminine floundering in her action more than ever indeed did she appear a fine nymphlike creature so that watching her flight tom verity was touched alike with selfreproach and admiration for he had succeeded in asserting himself beyond his intention had overcome had worsted her yet as it occurred to him won a but barren victory that she was alienated and resentful he could hardly doubt while the riddle he had rather meanly used to procure her discomfiture remained unanswered as ever dipped indeed only deeper in mystery he was hoist with his own petard in short and stood there nonplussed vexed alike at himself and at circumstance a soft wind meanwhile caressed him as hesitating uncertain what to do next he glanced out over the smiling sea and then back at the delicate shore line the white house the huge evergreen trees and brilliant flower garden a glamour covered the scene it was lovely intimately radiantly lovely as he had lately declared it yet just now he grew distrustful as though its fair seeming cloaked some subtle trickery and deceit he began to wish he had not undertaken this expedition to deadham but gone straight from the normal solidly engrained philistinism of dear old canton magna to join his ship in coming here he had to put it vulgarly bitten off more than he could chew for the place and its inhabitants seemed to have a disintegrating effect on him never in all his life had he been such a prey to exterior influences been twisted and turned to and fro weathercock fashion thus it was absurd of course to take things too seriously yet he could not but fear the archdeacons wellintentioned bit of worldliness and his own disposition to court whatever family prejudice pronounced taboo were in process of leading him a very questionable little dance reaction however set in before long as with so lively lighthearted a temperament it was bound to do the healthy scepticism healthy optimism of untried threeandtwenty rising to the surface buoyant as a cork tom verity shook himself took off his hat smoothed his hair settled his tie hitched up the waist of his trousers stamping to get them into place laughed a little calling himself every sort of silly ass and then swung away down the side of the long ridge in pursuit of damaris he acknowledged his treatment of her had been lacking in chivalry he hadnt shown himself altogether considerate or even kind but she challenged himperhaps unconsciouslyand once or twice had come near making him feel smalloh there were excuses for his behaviour now however he would sail on another tack would placate discreetly cherish her until she couldnt but be softened and consent to make it up after all maidens of her still tender age are not precisely adamantsuch at least was his experiencewhere a personable youth is concerned it only needed a trifle of refined cajolery to make everything smooth and to bring her round he overtook the fugitive as she reached the low wooden jetty crawling like some giant but rather dilapidated black manylegged insect out over the stream its rows of solidly driven piles were intact but the staging they supported had suffered damage from the rush of river floods let alone from neglect and age handrails were broken down planks rotted and wrenched away leaving gaps through which the cloudy greenish blue water could be seen as it purred and chuckled beneath here at the river level it was hot to the point of sultriness the air heavy even stagnant since the bar shut off the southerly breeze upon my word one requires to be in training to race you my dear damaris the young man said gaily ostentatiously mopping his forehead and im disgracefully soft just now i know you beat me utterly and ignominiously but then you did have a good three minutes start in common honesty you cant deny that the girl made no response but began mounting the few sandstrewn steps on to the jetty he saw her face in profile the delicate upward curve of her long dark eyelashes in the shade of her hat saw too that her soft lips quivered as with the effort to repress an outburst of tears and this affected him as the wounding of some strong free creature might stirring his blood in a fashion new to him and strange for not only did he find it piteous but unseemly unpermissible somehow yet marvellously sweet startling him out of all preconceived light diplomatic plans plucking shrewdly at his complacently unawakened heart he came close to her and putting his hand under her elbow gently held it pray pray be careful he said i dont trust this crazy little pier of yours one atom any one of these boards looks capable of crumbling and letting one throughand damaris please dont be cross with me or i shall be quite miserable forgive my having asked you stupid questions i was a blundering idiot of course what i heard last night was just some echo some trick of wind or of the river and tide i was half asleep and imagined the whole thing most likely magnified sounds as one does dont you know sometimes at night your father talked wonderfully and i went to bed dazzled such imagination as i possess all aflame but damaris shook her head while her elbow rested rigid upon the palm of his hand nowhat you heard was real she answered i heard once myselfand the people here know about it they say the dead smugglers still drive their ponies up from the beach across the lawn where the old road was and as it sounds through the round rooms downstairs in which my father lives on their way up into the forestyou cannot help seeingalthough you see nothinghow the ponies are illused hounded and flogged the last of the drove are lame and utterly worn out they stumble along anyhow and one falls oh it is cruel wicked and it iswas really true cousin tom it must have happened scores of times before old mr verity your namesake put a stop to the iniquity by buying the hardi have only heard the ponies driven once about this time in september last yearjust before something very sad quite of my own happened damaris stopped her lips quivering again and too much for speech dont tell me any more i cant bear you to be distressed pray pray dontthe young man urged incoherently while his grasp on her elbow tightened somewhat for he felt curiously flurried and put about near cursing himself moreover for having helped to break up her high serenity thus the whole thing was manifestly impossible as he told himself outside every recognized law of nature and sound science even during the mistrustful phantasybreeding watches of the night when reason inclines to drag anchor setting mind and soul rather wildly adrift he had refused credence to the apparent evidence of his own senses now in broad daylight the generous sunshine flooding him the smooth river purring and glittering at his feet belief in grim and ghostly happenings became more than ever inadmissible not to say quite arrantly grotesque yet damaris version of those same happenings tallied with his own in every point and that her conviction of their reality was genuine profound indeed to the point of pain admitted neither of question nor of doubt chapter vii a critic in corduroy william jennifer who successfully combined in his single person the varied offices of ferryman ratcatcher jobbing gardener amateur barber mender of sails and of nets brought the heavy flatbottomed boat alongside the jetty shipping the long sweeps he coughed behind his hand with somewhat sepulchral politeness to give warning of his presence sweetheartinglost to sight and hearing espoused to forgetfulness he murmured peering up at the two cousins standing in such close proximity to one another upon the black staging above for william jennifer was a born lover of words and maker of phrases addicted to the bandying of pleasantries nicely seasoned to their respective age sex and rank with all he met and when denied an audience rather than keep silence holding conversation with himself the hot morning induced thirst which being allayed by a couple of pints at faircloths inn induced desire for a certain easiness of costume his waistcoat hung openhe had laid aside his coatdisplaying a broad stitched leather belt that covered the junction between buff corduroy trousers and bluechecked cotton shirt on his head a high thimblecrowned straw hat the frayed brim of it pulled out into a poke in front for the better shelter of small pale twinkling eyes set in a foxy face the said face howeverfor all its sharppointed nose long upper lip thin gossipy mouth tucked in at the corners and opening redly cavernous without any showing of teeth a stiff sandy fringe edging cheeks and chin from ear to earcould on occasion become utterly blank of expression it became so now as tom verity realizing the fact of its owners neighbourhood moved a step or two away from damaris and jumping on board himself proceeded with rather studied courtesy to hand her down into the boat looks as there might have been a bit of a tiff betwixt emthus jennifer inwardly then aloudput you straight across the ferry sir or take you to the breakwater at the hard the tides on the turn so wed slip down along easy and im thinking that ud spare miss verity the traipse over the shore path wonnerful parching in the sun it is for the latter end of september oh to the breakwater by all means tom answered with alacrity for reaction had set in not only was the young man still slightly flustered but vexed by the liveliness of his own emotions everything today savoured of exaggeration the most ordinary incidents distended inflated themselves in a really unaccountable manner so that frankly he fought shy of finding himself alone with damaris again she seemed so constantly to betray him into illregulated feeling illconsidered speech and action which tended to endanger the completeness of his selfesteem therefore although admitting his attitude to be scantily heroic he welcomed the prospect of the ferrymans chaperonage until such time as her father or her discarded ladyinwaiting the innocent and pinknosed bilson should effect his final deliverance yes it is uncommonly hot he repeated while with both arms extended he worked to keep the side of the boat from bumping against the range of piles backing it clear of the jetty into the fairway of the river he found exertion pleasant steadying neither miss verity nor i shall be sorry to be saved the walk along that basting path that is he added smiling with disarming goodtemper if were not blocking business and keeping you too long away from the ferry but jennifer mightily pleased at his company and having moreover certain scandalous little fishes of his own to fryor attempt to frywaved the objection aside the ferry could very well mind itself for a while he said and if anyone should come along they must just hold hands with patience till he got back that was all but passengers were few and far between this time of year and of day the seasonas was the newfangled fashion to call itbeing now over trippers tripped home again to wheresoever their natural habitat might be the activities of boys schools picnic parties ambulant scientific societies and fieldclubsout in pursuit of weeds of stonecracking and the desecration of those old heathen burying barrows on stone horse head quieted off for the time being deadham meanwhile in act of repossessing its soul in peace and hibernating according to timehonoured habit until the vernal equinox not that he jennifer as he explained owned to any quarrel with the alien invasion good for trade they were that tripper lot though wonnerful simple he must say when they came to talk blessed with an almighty wide swallow for any longeared fairy tale you liked to put on them mortal full of senseless questions too fit to make anybody laughwhereat overcome by joyous memories of human folly he opened the red cavern of his apparently toothless mouth barking up audible mirth brief and husky from the depth of a beerslaked throat he leaned forward while speaking resting chest and elbows on the oarsonly now and again dipping the blades in the water to steady the boat in its course as it moved smoothly onward borne by brimming stream and tide from out the shadow of his thimblecrowned hat he looked up knowingly with the freemasonry of assured goodtemper at tom who stood before him hands in pockets friendly and debonair class distinctions for the moment quite forgot for let alone immediate convenience of chaperonage the young man found unexpected entertainment in this typical south saxon relic as it struck him of a bygone age and social order might not that tough and somewhat clumsy body that crafty jovial yet noncommittal countenance have transferred themselves straight from the pages of geoffrey chaucer into nineteenthcentury life here was a master of primitive knowledge and of arts not taught in modern board or any other schools a merry fellow too who could as tom divined when company and circumstances allowed be broadly unprintably humorous so in this last connection perhaps it was just as well that damaris still appeared somewhat implacable coming on board she had passed jenniferwho rowed amidshipsand gone right forward putting as wide a distance as conditions permitted between her cousin and herself now as she sat on a pile of redbrown seine nets in the bow of the boat she kept her face averted looking away down the cool liquid highway and presenting to his observation a graceful whiteclad but eminently discouraging back her attitude repelled rather than invited advances so at least tom watching her certainly thought this justified his not following her but staying where he was and leaving her to herself whereupon annoyance again beset him for it was very little to his credit to have mismanaged his dealings with her and alienated her sympathies thus with her it was very evident he had not been at all a success and it pricked his young vanity very shrewdly not to be a success from these unsatisfactory reflections william jennifers voice prefaced by a warning cough recalled him making any long stay in these parts sir he enquired and when tom explained that a few hours from now would witness the termination of his visit and that in all probability many years of absence from england lay ahead indeed indeed to be sure whod have thought it for a young gentleman of the qualitylike yourself but there some are born under the travellers star sircreated with a roving spirit and the lord help em i say for theyre so made as to be powerless to help themselves seemingly rove they must and will if they are to taste any contentmentan itch in their feet from the cradle nought but foreign landsll serve to pacify the sight of the ocean now seems fairly tormenting to em till they can satisfy themselves of whats on the far side of it but here the boat being unduly drawn aside by the suck of some local current jennifer was constrained to apply his mind to navigation he dipped the long sweeps and with a steady powerful pull straightened the course to midstream then raising the glistening blades off which the water dripped white and pattering he leaned forward again resting elbows and chest on the buttend of the oars and once more addressed himself to polite conversation not as ive been greatly troubled that way myself had my chance of going to sea and welcome manys the time when i was a youngster but always a one for the land i was never had any special fancy for salt water though i do make my living of it now as you may say in a sense during this biographical excursion tom veritys attention wandered his eyes dwelt on damaris she had altered her position turning half round as she scanned the strip of sandy warren with its row of sentinel scotch firs bordering the river seen thus threequarter face tom realized suddenly not only how really beautiful she wasor rather could at moments bebut how strangely she resembled sir charles her father there was likeness not of features alone but for all her youthful freshness a reflection of his strength his inscrutability whereupon rather unworthy curiosity reawoke in tom verity to satisfy which he was tempted to descend to methods not entirely loyal damaris sitting to windward must be out of earshot assuredly yet he lowered his voice as he said by the way talking of going to sea can you tell me anything about the young sailor whom you took across the ferry just before fetching miss verity and me i am pretty sure i have met him before and yet i cant place him somehow jennifer shot a sharply enquiring glance at the speaker for here at first sight appeared rare opportunity of that same coveted and scandalous fishfrying yet he debated the wisdom of immediate indulgence in that merry pastime inherent suspicion of class for class suspicion too of this young gentlemans conspicuously easy goodnatured manner preaching caution a show of friendliness supplies fine cover for the gaining of ones own endshadnt he jennifer practised the friendly manoeuvre freely enough himself on occasion and he did not in the least relish the chance of walking into a trap instead of jovially baiting one so he dipped the oars again and answered slowly as though the question taxed his memory sorely his face vacant of expression as an empty plate brought him across before i started to fetch you and the young lady sir did i to be sure there let me see ive had several seagoing chaps of sorts back and forth this morning come and go most days they do come and go without my taking any particular accountthe lord forgive me for it aint over civilunless strangers should hail me or someone out of the common such as miss verity and yourself a passing show sir half the time those i carry no more to me bless you than so many sandfleas ahopping on the beachmr blackmorecoastguard officer he isi fetched him across early with one of his men coming round from the head and that poor lippitylop abram sclanders eldestpity he wasnt put away quietlike at birthterrible drag he is on abram and always will be anybody with an ounce of gumption might have seen hed be a shortwit from the firsti took him over but that ud the opposite way about as he wanted to go shrimping back of the bar so he said jennifer paused as in earnest thought no not a soul to merit your attention today sir that i can call to mind unlesswith an upward look of returning intelligencebut that aint very likely eitherunless it should be darcy faircloth id clean forgot him so i had capen faircloth as some is so busy calling im now in season and out of season till its fairly fit to make you laughremarkable tall johnnyheadinair young feller with a curly yaller beard to him thats the man tom exclaimed he had distrusted jennifers show of ignorance believing he was being fenced with played with even royally lied to but this merely served to heighten his curiosity and amusement something of moment must lie he felt behind so much wandering talk something of value purposely and cunningly withheld until time was ripe for telling disclosure darcy fairclothcaptain faircloth he could not but repeat and with such honest puzzlement and evident desire for further enlightening as to overcome his hearers hesitation nonot a likely person for you to be in any wise acquainted with sir jennifer returned wary still though yieldingeven if you didnt happen to be a bit new to deadham yourself as i may put it for been away mostly from his natural home here young faircloth has ever since he was a little shaver mrs fairclothowns the inn there and all the appurtenances thereof sheds cottages boats and suchlike she doesalways had wonnerful high views for him quite the gentleman darcy must be with a boarding school into southampton and then the best of the merchant serviceno before the mast for him bless you there was a snug little business to count on regular takings in the public week in and week outmore particularly of late years in the summerlet alone the rest of the propertyhe being the only son of his mother too and she a widow woman free to follow any whimsies as took her about the lad jennifer gave some slow strong strokes driving the lumbering boat forward till the water fairly hissed against its sides and tom verity still listened strangely alertly interested convinced there was more well worth hearing to follow oh theres always bin a tidy lot of money behind young darcy and is yet i reckon mrs faircloth being the firstclass business woman she is spend she may with one hand but save and make she does and no mistake lord love you with the other singular thing though he added meditatively his face growing wholly expressionless how little darcy now hes growed up features old lemuel his father squinny redcheeked little old party he was thin as a herring and chilly always chilly sitting over the fire in the barparlour winter and summer toosmall squeaky voice he had minding any one of a penny whistle but a warm man and a close oneoh very secret anybody must breakfast overnight and hurry at thateat with their loins girded as you may say to get upsides with old lemuel he ceased speaking and glanced round over his shoulder calculating the distance to the breakwater for the boat drew level with the seawall of roughhewn pinkishgrey granite along the river frontage of the hard gardens theres some as ud tell you it was the surprise of old lemuels life to find himself a parent he added eyeing tom slyly as he spoke his mouth remaining open as in preparation for coming laughter for those same scandalous little fishes were well into the fryingpan nowsizzling frizzling and this was a vastly agreeable moment to william jennifer worth waiting for worth scheming for unprintable humour looked out of his twinkling eyes while he watched to see how far tom verity caught his meaning then as the young man flushed sudden distaste even a measure of shame invading him jennifer true artist in scandal turned the conversation aside with an air of indulgent apology but lor there you know how peoplell talk in a little country place where there aint much doingand it aint for me to speak of what happened back in those times being barely out of my teens then and away cowkeeping over alton way for farmer whimsett regular chip of the old block he was dont breed that sort nowadays as hearty as you like and swallered his three pints of homebrewed every morning with his breakfast he did till he was took off quite sudden in his fourscoreandten twelve months ago come michaelmas upon the terrace by the pyramid of ball and the two little cannons sir charles verity stood holding a packet of newly written letters in his hand and smoking while he watched the approaching boat damaris rose from the pile of redbrown fishingnets and waved to him jennifer too glanced up steadying both oars with one hand while he raised the other to the brim of his thimblecrowned hat a couple of minutes more and he would part company with his passenger and so judged it safe to indulge himself with a final fishfrying mortal fine figure of a man sir charles even yet he said to tom admiringly but anybody should have seen him as a young gentleman when he used to visit here in old mr veritys time none in the countryside could hold a candle to him for looks as you may say turned the females heads he did might have had his pick of the lot maids and wives alike for arf a word well goodbye to you sirand as certain coin changed handsthank ye sir kindly wish you a pleasant voyage and a rare good picking up of honours and glories and gold and silver likewise there across the seas and oceans where youre agoing to book ii the hard school of things as they are chapter i in maiden meditation it was afternoon about five oclock the fine september weather hot and cloudless lasted still the air was heavy with garden scents the aromatic sweetness of sunbaked gorse and pinescrub on the warren and with the reek off the mudflats of the haven the tide being low upon the sandy skirts of the bar across the river just opposite three cormorantsglossy black against the yellowpostured in extravagant angular attitudes drying their wings above the rim of the silverblue seapatched with purple stains in the middle distancewebs of steamer smoke lay along the southern sky occasionally a sound of voices the creak of a wooden windlass and grind of a boats keel upon the pebbles as it was wound slowly up the foreshore came from the direction of the ferry and of faircloths inn the effect was languorous would have been enervating to the point of mental as well as physical inertia had not the posturing cormorants introduced a note of absurdity and the tainted breath of the mudflats a wholesome reminder of original sin under these conditions at once charming and insidious damaris verity resting in a wicker deckchair in the shade of the great ilex trees found herself alone free to follow her own vagrant thoughts perceptions imaginations without human let or hindrance free to dream undisturbed and interrogate both nature and her own much wondering soul for sir charles was away staying with an old friend and former brotherinarms colonel carteret for a weeks partridge shooting over the norfolk stubblefields sport promised to be good and damaris had great faith in colonel carteret with him her father was always amused contented safe hordle was in attendance too so she knew his comfort in small material matters to be secure she could think of him without any shadow of anxiety her mind for once at rest and this she enjoyed for it is possible to miss a person badly long for their return ardently yet feel by no means averse to a holiday from more active expenditure of love on their account and theresa bilsonpleasing thoughtwas for the moment absent also having gone to tea with the miss minetts two maiden ladies these of uncertain age modest fortune and unimpeachable refinement once like theresa herself members of the scholastic profession but now thanks to the timely death of a relativewith consequent annuities and life interest in a tenroomed stonebuilt house of rather mournful aspect in deadham villageable to rest from their ineffectual labours support the church patronize their poorer and adulate their richer neighbours to their guileless hearts content gentility exuded from the miss minetts andif it is permissible slightly to labour the similetheir pores were permanently open owing both to her antecedent and existing situation it may be added theresa bilson was precious in their sight for had she not in the past like themselves sounded the many mortifications of a governess lot and was she not now called up higher promoted indeed to familiar almost hourly intercourse with the great miss felicia verity was known to treat her with affection mrs augustus cowden that true blue of county dames and local aristocrats openly approved her she sat daily at sir charles veritys table and helped to order his household what more genuine patents of gentility could be asked so they listened with a pleasure deep almost to agitation to her performances upon the piano her reminiscences of bonn and the rhine provinces and above all to her anecdotes of life at the hard and of its distinguished owners habits and speech thus by operation of the fundamental irony resident in things did theresa bilson of all improbable and inadequate little people become to the miss minetts as a messenger of the gods exciting in them not only dim fluttering apprehensions of the glories of art and delights of foreign travel butthough in their determined gentility they knew it notof the primitive allurements and mysteries of sex the moral effect of this friendship upon theresa herself was not however of the happiest fired by their interest in her recitals she was tempted to spread herself at first almost unconsciously for by instinct she was truthful she embroidered fact magnifying her office not only in respect of her expupil damaris but of damaris father also she represented herself as indispensable to both parent and child until she more than half believed that flattering fiction she began to reckon herself an essential element in the establishment at the hard the pivot indeed upon which it turned whereupon a rather morbid craving for the miss minetts society developed in her for with those two credulous ladies as audience she could fortify herself in delusion by recounting all manner of episodes and incidents not as they actually had but as she so ardently desired they might have taken placea pathetic form of lying this though far from uncommon to feminine andmore especiallyspinster practice and habit still theresa was not so besotted but that lucid intervals now and again afflicted her one seized her this afternoon as she prepared to bid damaris goodbye either conscience pricked with unusual sharpness or the young girls smiling and unruffled acquiescence in her departure aroused latent alarms she began to excuse her action in leaving her charge thus solitary to protest her devotion becoming it may be added red and agitated in the process her thick short little fingers worked nervously on the crook handle of her white cotton umbrella her round lightcoloured eyes grew humid to the point of fogging the lenses of her goldrimmed glasses but why should you worry so now just as you are starting billy damaris reasoned with the rather cruel logic of cool eighteen in face of hot and flustered nineandthirty only at luncheon you were telling me how much you always enjoy spending an afternoon at the grey house i thought you looked forward so much to going what has happened to turn you all different like this at the last minute nothing has happened exactly but i have scruples about visiting my own friends and letting you remain alone when sir charles is from home it might appear a dereliction of dutyas though i took advantage of his absence nobody would think anything so foolish damaris declared and then you knew he would be away this week when you made the engagement theresa gulped and prevaricated no surely noti must have mistaken the date but you were quite happy at luncheon and you couldnt have mistaken the date then damaris persisted whereupon poor theresa lost herself the worthy and unworthy elements in her nature alike conspiring to her undoing in her distraction she sniffed audibly a tear ran down either side of her pink shiny nose and dropped on the folds of shepherdsplaid silk veiling her plump bosom for with some obscure purpose of living up to her selfimposed indispensability miss bilson was distinctly dressy at this period wearing her best summer gown on every possible occasion and tucking a bunch of roses or carnations archly in her waistbelt do you think it kind to insist so much on my passing forgetfulness she quavered the habit of criticizing and cavilling at whatever i say grows on you damaris and it so increases the difficulties of my position i know i am sensitive but that is the result of my affection for you i care so deeply and you are not responsive you chill me as i have told dear miss feliciafor i must sometimes unburden myself this hastily as damaris eyes darkened with displeasure for the last year ever since you have nominally been out of the schoolroom i have seen my influence over you lessen and especially since poor mrs watsons death we will not talk about nannie please damaris said quietly yes butas i told your aunt feliciasince then i have tried more than ever to win your entire confidence to make up to you for the loss of poor watson and fill her place with you no one else can ever fill the place of the person one has loved damaris returned indignantly it isnt possible i should be ashamed to let it be possible nannie was nannieshe had cared for me all my life and i had cared for her she belongs to things about which you and there the girl checked herself aware of something almost ludicrously pitiful in the smug tearful countenance and stumpy wouldbe fashionable figure hit a man your own size or bigger by all means if you are game to take the consequences but to smite a creature conspicuously your inferior in fortunepast present and prospectiveis unchivalrous not to say downright meanspirited so damaris swiftly repentant put her arm round the heaving shoulders bent her handsome young head and kissed the uninvitingly dabby cheeka caress surely counting to her for righteousness dont find fault with me any more billy she said indeed i never hurt you on purpose but there are such loads of things to think about that i get absorbed in them and cant attend sometimes directly on the minute absentmindedness should be corrected rather than encouraged miss bilson announced sententious even amid her tears oh it amounts to more than absentmindedness im afraida sort of absenteverythingedness when it overtakes me for the whole of me seems to go away and away hand in hand and all together damaris said her eyes alight with questions and with dreams but dont let us discuss that now she added it would waste time and it is you who must go away and away billy if you are not to put the poor miss minetts into a frantic fuss by being late for tea they will think some accident has happened to you dont beep them in suspense it is simply barbarousgoodbye and dont hurry back i have heaps to amuse me ill not expect you till dinnertime thus did it come about that damaris reposed in a deck chair under the shade of the great ilex trees gazing idly at the webs of steamer smoke hanging low in the southern sky at the long yellowgrey ridge of the bar between river and sea and at the cormorants posturing in the hot afternoon sunshine upon the sand truly she was free to send forth her soul upon whatever far fantastic journey she pleased but souls are perverse not to be driven at will choosing their own times and seasons for travel and hers just now proved obstinately homestayinghad no wings wherewith to fly but must needs crawl afourfoot around all manner of inglorious personal matters for that skirmish with her exgoverness though she successfully bridled her tongue and conquered by kindness rather than by smiting had clouded her inward serenity not only by its inherent uselessness but by reminding her indirectly of an occurrence which it was her earnest desire to forget indirectly mention of her beloved nurse sarah watsonwho journeying back from a visit to her native lancashire just this time last year had met death swift and hideous in a railway collisionrecalled to damaris the little scene of a week ago with tom verity when ho had asked her in the noonday sunshine out on the bar for some explanation of his strange nocturnal experience she went hot all over now with exaggerated childish shame thinking of it for had not she damaris verity though nurtured in the creed that courage is the source and mother of all virtues shown the white feather incontinently turned tail and run away remembrance of that running scorched her so that more than once awakening suddenly in the night her fair young body was dyed rosered with the disgrace of it literally from head to heel she was bitterly humiliated by her own poltroonery ingenuously doubtful as to whether she could ever quite recover her selfrespect glad that every day put two hundred miles and more of sea between her and tom verity since he had witnessed that contemptible fall from grace nevertheless after her first consternationin which to avoid further speech with him she had sought refuge among the unsavoury seine nets in the forepart of jennifers ferryboattom veritys probable opinion of her undignified action troubled her far less than the cause of the said action itself for exactly what after all had so upset her begetting imperative necessity of escape not the apparent confirmation of that ugly legend concerning ghostly ponies driven up across the hard garden from the shore from childhood owing both to temperament and local influences her apprehension of things unseen and supernormal had been remarkably acute from the dawn of conscious intelligence these had formed an integral element in the atmosphere of her life and that without functional disturbance moral or physical of a neurotic sort she felt no morbid curiosity about such matters did not care to dwell upon or talk of themfew persons do who being sane in mind and body are yet endowed with the rather questionable blessing of the seers sixth sensefor while in never doubting their existence her reason acquiesced her heart turned away oppressed and disquieted as from other mysterious actualities common enough to human observation such as illness disease deformity old age the pains of birth and of death such matters might perplex and sadden or arouse her indignant pity but being strong with the confidence of untouched youth and innocence they were powerless in and by themselves to terrify her to the contemptible extremity of headlong flight this she recognized though less by reasoning than by instinct and so found herself compelled to search deeper for the cause of her recent disgrace not that she willingly prosecuted that search but that the subject pursued her simply refusing to leave her alone continually it presented itself to her mind and always with the same call for escape the same foreboding of some danger against which she must provide always too it seemed to hinge upon tom veritys visit and something in her relation to the young man himself which she could not define she revolved the question nowtheresa being safely packed off to her teapartyin shade of the ilex trees with solemn eyes and finely serious face there was not anything unusual in receiving visitors at the hard men came often to see her father and she took her share in entertaining all such comers as a matter of course some she didnt much care about some she liked but with the exception of colonel carteret from childhood her trusted friend and confidant their coming and going was just part of the accustomed routine a survival from the life at the indian summer palace of long ago and made no difference yet though she was still uncertain whether she did like tom verity or not his coming and going had indisputably made a difference it marked indeed a new departure in her attitude and thought her world before his advent was other than that in which she now dwelt for one thing tom was much younger than the majority of her fathers guestsa man not made but still early in the making the glamour of promise rather than the stark light of finality upon him this affected her for at eighteen a career be it never so distinguished which has reached its zenith in other words reached the end of its tether must needs have a touch of melancholy about it with the heat of going on in your own veins the sight of one who has no further go strikes chill to the heart and so while uncertain whether she quite trusted him or not damarisuntil the unlucky running away episodehad taken increasing pleasure in this new cousins company it both interested and diverted her she had not only felt ready to talk to him butsurprising inclinationonce the ice of her natural reserve broken to talk to him about herself halfshyly she dwelt upon his personal appearancea fine head and clever face the nose astute slightly jewish in type so she thought his eyes were disappointing too thickly brown in colour too opaque they told you nothing were indeed curiously meaningless and though well set under an ample brow were wanting in depth and softness owing to scantiness of eyelash but his chin satisfied her demands it was square forcible slightly cleft and his mouth below the flyaway reddish moustache was frankly delightfuldamaris flushed smiling to herself now as she recalled his smile whereupon the humiliation of that thrice wretched running away took a sharper edge for she realized poor child how muchnotwithstanding her proud little snubbing of himshe coveted his good opinion wished him to admire and to like her wanted even while she disapproved his selfcomplacency and slightly doubted his truthfulness to have him carry with him a happy impression of hercarry it with him to that enchanted far eastern land in which all the poetry of her childhood had its root for if remembrance of her remained with him and that agreeably she herself also found passage to india in a sense and this idea recondite though it was touched and charmed her fancyor would have done so but for the recollection of her deplorable flightoh whatwhat made her run away from what had she thus run if she could only find out and find moreover the cause sufficient to palliate to some extent at least the woefulness of her cowardice but at this point her meditation suffered interruption the three cormorants having finished their sunbath rose from the sand and flapped off flying low and sullenly in single file over the sea parallel with the eastwardtrending coastline with the departure of the great birds her surroundings seemed to lose their only element of active and conscious life the brooding sunlit evening became oppressive so that in the space of a moment damaris passed from solitude which is stimulating to loneliness which is only sad meanwhile the shadow cast by the ilex trees had grown sensibly longer softer in outline more transparent and finely intangible in tone and the reek of the mudflats more potent according to its habit at sundown and low tide it quenched the garden scents with a fetid sweetness symbolic perhaps of the languorous sheltered character of the scene and of much which had or might yet happen therethe life breath of the genius loci an at once seductive and as tom verity had rightly divined a doubtfully wholesome spirit over damaris it exercised an unwilling fascination as of some haunting refrain ending each verse of her personal experience even when as a little girl of eight fresh from the gentle restraints and rare religious and social amenities of an aristocratic convent school in paris she had first encountered it it struck her as strangely familiara thing given back rather than newly discovered making her mind and innocent body alike eager with absorbed yet halfshuddering recognition a good ten years had elapsed since then but her early impression still persisted producing in her a certain spiritual and emotional unrest and at that by natural transition her thought turned from tom verity to fix itself upon the one other possible witness of her ignominynamely the young master mariner who coming ashore in proud the lobstercatchers cranky boat had walked up the shifting shingle to the crown of the ridge and stood watching her in silence for a quite measurable period before passing on his way down to the ferry for from her first sight of him had he not seemed to evoke that same sense of remembrance to be like the reek off the mudflats already wellknown something given back to her rather than newly discovered she was still ignorant as to who ho was or where he came from having been far too engrossed by mortification to pay any attention to the conversation between her cousin and jennifer during their little voyage down the tideriver and having disdained to make subsequent enquiriesshe had a rooted dislike to appear curious or ask questionsbut now reviewing the whole episode it broke in on her that the necessity for escape and foreboding of danger which culminated in her flight actually dated from the advent of this stranger rather than from toms request for enlightenment concerning unaccountable noises heard in the small hours damaris slipped her feet down off the legrest and sat upright tense with the effort to grasp and disentangle the bearings of this revelation was her search ended had she indeed detected the cause of her discomfiture or only pushed her enquiry back a step further thus widening rather than limiting the field of speculation for what conceivable connection as she reflected could the old lobstercatchers passenger have with any matter even remotely affecting herself then she started suddenly sensible of a comfortable though warmly protesting human voice and presence at her elbow yes you may well look astonished miss damaris i know how late it is and have been going on like anything to lizzie over her carelessness mrs coopers walked up the village with laura about some extra meat thats wanted and when i came through for your tea if that girl hadnt let the kitchen fire right outamusing herself down in the stableyard i expect mrs cooper being goneand the business ive had to get a kettle to boil verging on forty tall dark deepbosomed and comely a rich flush on her cheeks under the clear brown skin thanks to a kitchen fire which didnt burn and righteous anger which did mary fisher the upper housemaid set a teatray upon the garden table beside damaris chair thats what comes of taking servants out of tradespeoples houses she went on as she marshalled silver teapot and creamjugembossed with flamboyant manyarmed hindu deitieshot cakes ginger snaps and saffronsprinkled buns you cant put any real dependence on them doing their work as suits themselves just anyhow and anywhen mrs cooper and i knew how it would be well enough when miss bilson engaged lizzie trant and mr hordle said the same but it wasnt one atom of use for us to speak the miss minetts recommended the girlso there was the finish of it and thats at the bottom of your being kept waiting the best part of a hour for your tea like this miss notwithstanding the exactions of a somewhat tyrannous brain and her conviction of high responsibilities the child which delights to be petted told stories and made much of was strong in damaris still this explosion of domestic wrath on her behalf proved eminently soothing it directed her brooding thought into nice amusing everyday little channels and assured her of protective solicitude actively on the watch by which exaggerated shames and alarms were withered and loneliness effectually dispersed she felt smoothed contented fell indeed into something of the humour which climbs on to a friendly lap and thrones it there blissfully careless of the thousand and one ills known and unknown which infant flesh is heir to she engaged the comely comfortable woman to stay and minister further to her pour out my tea for me mary please she said if youre not busy but isnt this your afternoon off by rights and mary while serving her acknowledged that not only was it by rights her afternoon off but that mr patch the coachman had volunteered to drive her into marychurch to see her parents when he exercised the carriage horses but while thanking him very kindly she had refused was it likely she said she would leave the house with sir charles and mr hordle away and miss bilson taking herself off to visit friends too from which damaris gathered that in the opinion of the servants hall theresas offence was rank it stank to heaven she therefore being covetous of continued contentment turned the conversation to less controversial subjects and after passing notice of the fair weather the brightness of the geraniums and kindred trivialities successfully incited mary to talk of brockhurst sir richard calmadys famous place in the north of the county whereprior to his retirement to his native town of marychurch upon a generous pensionher father lomas fisher had for many years occupied the post of second gardener here was material for storytelling to the child damaris hearts content for brockhurst is rich in strange records of wealth calamity heroism and sport the inherent romance of which marys artless narrative was calculated to enhance rather than dissipate so young mistress listened and maid recounted until the former fortified by cakes and tea the two sauntered side by sidea tall stalwart black figure white capped and aproned and an equally tall but slender pale pink onedown across the lawn to the battery where the small obsolete cannon so boldly defied danger of piracy or invasion by sea the sun a crimson disc enormous in the earthmist sank slowly south of west behind the dark mass of stone horse head the upper branches of the line of scotch firs in the warren and beyond them the upper windows of the cottages and inn caught the fiery light presently a little wind thin perceptibly chill drew up the river with the turning of the tide it fluttered mary fishers long white muslin apron strings and lifted her cap so that she raised her hand to keep it in place upon her smooth black hair the romance of brockhurst failed upon her tongue she grew sharply practical the dews beginning to rise miss damaris she said and youve only got your house shoes on you ought to go indoors at once butlisten damaris replied and lingered the whistling of a tune shrill but true and sweet and a rattle of loose shingle while a young man climbed the seaward slope of the bar the whistling ceased as he stopped on the crest of the ridge and stood bareheaded contemplating the sunset for a few seconds the fiery light stained his hands his throat his hair his handsome bearded face then swiftly faded leaving him like a giant leaden image set up against a vast pallor of sea and sky mary fisher choked down a hasty exclamation come do come miss damaris before the grass gets too wet she said almost sharply its going to be a drenching dew tonight yesdirectlyin a minutebut mary tell me who that is the woman hesitated out on the bar do you mean no one i am acquainted with miss i did not intend to ask if he was a friend of yours damaris returned with a touch of grandeur but merely whether you could tell me his name oh its mrs faircloths son i supposethe person who keeps the inn i heard hed been home for a few days waiting for a shipand she turned resolutely towards the house its quite time that silver was taken indoors and the library windows closed but you must excuse me miss damaris i cant have you stay out here in that thin gown in the damp you really must come with me miss and the child in damaris obeyed dutifully it went though the soul of the eighteenyearold damaris was far away started once more on an anxious quest she heard the loose shingle shift and rattle under faircloths feet as he swung down the near slope to the jetty the sound pursued her and again she was overtakenoverwhelmed by foreboding and desire of flight chapter ii which canters round a parish pump not until the second bell was about to cease ringing did theresa bilsonfussily consequentialreappear at the hard during the absence of the master of the house she would have much preferred high tea in the schoolroom combined with a certain laxity as to hours and to dress but damaris in whom the sense of style was innate stood out for the regulation dignities of late dinner and evening gowns tonight however thanks to her own unpunctuality miss bilson found ample excuse for dispensing with ceremonial garments nonowe will not wait she said addressing mary and her attendant satellite laura the underhousemaid asagreeably ignorant of the sentiment of a servants hall which thirsted for her bloodshe passed the two standing at attention by the open door of the diningroom i am not going to change i will leave my hat and things down herelaura can take them to my room laterand have dinner as i am during the course of that meal she explained how she had really quite failed to observe the hour when she left the grey house commander and mrs battye were at tea there and the vicardr horniblowlooked in afterwards there was quite a little meeting in fact to arrange the details of the day after tomorrows choir treat a number of upperclass parishioners she found were anxious to embrace this opportunity of visiting harchester and inspecting the cathedral and other sights of that historic city under learned escort it promised to be a most interesting and instructive expedition involving moreover but moderate costand every one presenttheresa bridled over her salmon cutlet and oyster sauceeveryone seemed so anxious for her assistance and advice the vicar deferred to her opinion in a quite pointed manner and spoke which was so nice of him of her known gift of organization so we claim not only your sympathy miss bilson but your active cooperation he had said we feel the hard should be officially represented here the speaker became increasingly selfconscious and blushed what could i do therefore but remain even at the risk of being a trifle late for dinner she asked it would have been so extremely uncivil to the miss minetts to break up the gathering by leaving before full agreement as to the arrangements had been reached i felt i must regard it as a public duty under the circumstances i really owed it to my position here you know damaris to stay to the last it may be observed in passing that miss bilson was fond of food and made a good deal of noise in eating particularly when as on the present occasion she combined that operation with continuous speech this may account for damaris bestowing greater attention on the manner than the matter of her exgoverness communications she was sensible that the latter showed to small advantage being rather foolishly excited and elate and felt vexed the maids should hear and see her behaving thus it could hardly fail to lower her in their estimation as to the impending parochial invasion of harchesterduring the earlier stages of dinner damaris hardly gave it a second thought being still under the empire of impressions very far removed from anything in the nature of choir treats she still beheld the fiery glare of an expiring sunset and against the ensuing pallor of sea and sky a leadenhued human figure strangely almost portentously evident that it appeared noble in pose and in outline even beautiful she could not deny but that somehow it frightened her she could equally little deny so it came about that once again as mary and her satellite laura silently waited at table and as theresa very audibly gobbled food in and words out damaris shrank within herself seeming to hear a shrill sweet whistling and the shatter of loose pebbles and shifting shingle under faircloths pursuing feet the young mans name aroused her interest not to say her curiosity the more deeply because of its association with a locality exploration of which had always been denied hera naboths vineyard of the imagination near at hand daily in sight yet personal acquaintance with which she failed to possess even yet the idea of an island especially a quite little island a miniature and separate world shut off all by itself is dreadfully enticing to the infant mindat once a geographical entity and a cunning sort of toy and faircloths inn with the tarred wooden houses adjacent was situated upon what to all intents and purposes might pass as an island since accessible only by boat or by an ancient paved causeway daily submerged at high tide skirting the further edge of the warren a wide rutted side lane leads down to the landward end of the said causeway from the village green just opposite deadham post office and mrs doubledays general shopa neglected somewhat desolate strip of road this between broken earthbanks topped by ragged firs yet very paintable and dear to the sketchbook of the amateur in summer overgrown with grass and rushes bordered by cowparsley meadowsweet pink codlingsandcream and purple flowered peppermint in winter a marsh of sodden brown and vivid green but at all seasons a telling perspective closed by the lonely black and grey island hamlet set in the gleaming tide small wonder the place stirred damaris spirit of enquiry and adventure she wanted to go there to examine to learn how people lived cut off from the mainland for hours twice every day and night but her early attempts at investigation met with prompt discouragement from both her nurse and her aunt felicia verity and damaris was not of the disposition which plots wheedles and teases to obtain what it wants still less screams for the desired object until for very weariness resistance yields either she submitted without murmuring or fearlessly defied authority in the present case she relinquished hope and purpose obediently while inwardly longing for exploration of her darling little island all the more but authority was not perhaps altogether unjustified of its decision for the inhabitants of the spot so engaging to damaris imagination were a close corporation a race of sailors and fishermen and so said rumour somewhat rough customers at that they lived according to their own traditions and unwritten laws entertained a lordly contempt for wageearning labourers and landsmen and save when money was likely to pass were grudging of hospitality even to persons of quality setting foot within their coasts to their reprehensible tendencies in this last respect the miss minetts could bear painful witness aswith hushed voices and entreaties the sorry tale might go no furtherthey more than once confided to theresa bilson for one saturday afternoonunknown to the vicarbeing zealous in the admonishing of recalcitrant churchgoers and rounding up of possible sundayschool recruits they crossed to the island at low tide and in their best district visitor mannertoo often a sparkling blend of condescension and familiarity warranted to irritateseverally demanded entrance to the first two of the black cottagesthe inn they avoided refined gentlewomen can hardly be expected even in the interests of religion to risk pollution by visiting a common tavern more particularly when a company of halfgrown lads and blue jerseyed menwho may of course have been carousing withinhangs about its morally malodorous door of precisely what followed their attempted violation of the privacy of those two cottages even the miss minetts themselves could subsequently give no very coherent account they only knew that some halfhour later with petticoats raised to a height gravely imperilling decency they splashed landward across the causewaynow ankledeep in waterwhile the lads congregated before the inn laughed boisterously the men turned away with a guffaw dogs of disgracefully mixed parentage yelped and the elder female members of the proud and sclanders families flung phrases lamentably subversive of gentility after their retreating figures from the foreshore modesty and mortification alike forbade the outraged ladies reporting the episode to dr horniblow in extenso but they succeeded in giving miss bilson a sufficiently lurid account of it to make the darling little island in as far as her charge damaris was concerned more than ever taboo their request that the story might go no further she interpreted with the elasticity usually accorded to such requests and proceeded at the first opportunity to retail the whole shocking occurrence to her pupil as an example of the ingratitude and insubordination of the common people for theresa was nothing if not conservative and aristocratic from such august anachronisms as the divine right of kings and the stuart succession down to humble bobbing of curtseys and pulling of forelocks in todays village street she held a permanent brief for the classes as against the masses unluckily the miss minetts hasty and watery withdrawal with upgathered skirts across the causeway had appealed to damaris sense of comedy rather than of tragedyshe didnt want to be unkind but you shouldnt interfere and if you insisted on interfering you must accept whatever followed the two ladies in question were richly addicted to interfering she had reason to thinkand then they must have looked so wonderfully funny scuttling thus the picture remained by her as a thing of permanent mirth so it was hardly surprising in face of the dominant direction of her thoughts tonight that when the miss minetts name punctuated theresas discourse recurrent as a cuckoocry remembrance of their merrily inglorious retirement from the region of faircloths inn should present itself whereupon damaris serious mood was lightened as by sudden sunshine and she laughed hearing which infectiously gay but quite unexpected sound miss bilson stopped dead in the middle both of a nectarine and a sentence what is the matter damaris she exclaimed i was explaining our difficulty in securing sufficient conveyances for some of our party to and from marychurch station i really do not see any cause for amusement in what i said there wasnt anything amusing dear billy im sure there wasnt damaris returned the corners of her mouth still quivering and her eyes very bright i beg your pardon im afraid i wasnt quite attending i was thinking of something else you were speaking about the carriage horses werent you yes but theresa turned sulky she had been posing planing in midair around the fair castles hope and ambition are reported to build there her fat little feet were well off the floor and that outbreak of laughter let her down with a bump she lost her head lost her temper and her opportunity along with it and fell into useless scolding you are extremely inconsequent and childish sometimes damaris she said i find it most trying when i attempt to talk to you upon practical subjects really pressing subjects and you either cannot or will not concentrate what can you expect in the future when you are thrown more on your own resources and have not mefor instancealways to depend upon if you moon through life like this it must lead to great discomfort not only for yourself but for others pray be warned in time damaris turned in her chair at the head of the table a station not unconnected in theresas mind with the internal ordering of those same airbuilt castles and consistently if furtively coveted by her to sir charless chair at the bottom of the table she dared not aspire so during his absence reluctantly retained her accustomed place at the side you need not wait any longer mary damaris said over her shoulder why theresa began fussily as the two maids left the room why damaris took her up because i prefer our being alone during the remainder of this conversation i understand that you want to ask me about something to do with this excursion to harchester what is it please my dear damaris the other protested startled and scenting unexpected danger really your manner and yoursboth perhaps would bear improvement but that is by the way what is it please you want really you assert yourself and you forget yourselfbefore the servants too i do not like it at all you should be more careful damaris she cried aghast confounded to the verge of tearsdamaris yesi am giving you my full attention pray let us be practical the young girl said sitting up tall and straight in the shaded lamplight the white dinnertable spread with gleaming glass and silver fine china fruit and flowers before her the soft gloom of the long low room behind all tender hint of childhood banished from her countenance and her eyes bright now not with laughter but with battle pray let us finish with the subject of the choir treat then we shall be free to talk about more interesting things miss bilson waved her hands hysterically nonoi never wish to mention it again i am too deeply hurt by your behaviour to me damarisyour sarcasmof course she added i see i must withdraw my offer it will cause the greatest inconvenience and disappointment but for that i cannot hold myself responsible though it will be most painful and embarrassing to me after the kind appreciation i have received still i must withdraw it withdraw what offer why the offer i was explaining to you just now when you ordered the maids out of the room you really cannot deny that you heard what i said damaris because you mentioned the carriage horses yourself theresa sipped some water she was recovering if not her temper yet her grasp on the main issue she wanted so desperately to achieve her purpose and incidentally to continue to play both for her own benefit and that of the parish her selfelected role of lady bountiful of official representative of the hardas dr horniblow by a quite innocent if illtimed flourish of speech had unfortunately put it the conveyances in the village are insufficient to take the whole party to the station she continued an extra brake can be had at the stags head in mary church but a pair of horses must be sent in tomorrow afternoon to bring it over here i sawshe hesitated a momenti really could see no objection to patch taking our horses in to fetch the brake and driving a contingent to the station in it next morning and meeting the train at night i suppose damaris said calmly of course theresa answered thus unconsciously declaring herself a rank outsider and rushing blindly upon her fate for what thoroughbred member of the equestrian order does not know that nextand even that not alwaysto the ladies of his family and possibly the key of his cellar an englishmans stable is sacrosanct dispose of anything he owns rather than his horses to attempt touching them is indeed to stretch out your hand against the ark of the covenant and risk prompt withering of that impious limb yet poor theresa blundered on i told the vicar that sir charles being from home i felt i might make the offer myself seeing how much it would simplify the arrangements and how very little work patch has when you and i are alone here it is a pity there is not time to obtain sir charless sanction that would be more proper of course more satisfactory but under the circumstances it need not i think be regarded as an insuperable objection i told the miss minetts and the vicar here miss bilson blushed applying fork and spoon in coy confusion to the remains of the nectarine upon her plate i told them she repeated knowing sir charles as well as i do i felt i might safely assure them of that in damaris meanwhile anger gradually gave place to far more complex emotions she sat well back in her chair and clasped her hands firmly in her flowered pompadourmuslin lap her eyes looked enormous as she kept them fixed gravely and steadily upon the speaker for extraordinary ideas and perceptions concerning the said speaker crowded into her young head she did not like them at all she shrank from dwelling upon or following them put they indeed made her hot and uncomfortable all over had theresa bilson taken leave of her senses or was she damaris herself in faulta harbourer of nasty thoughts consciously she felt to grow older to grow up and she did not like that either for the grownup world to which theresa acted just now as doorkeeper struck her as an ugly and vulgarminded place she saw her exgoverness from a new anglea more illuminating than agreeable one at which she no longer figured as pitiful her little assumptions and sillinesses calling for the chivalrous forbearance of persons more happily placed but as actively impertinent an usurper of authority and privileges altogether outside her office and her scope she was greedynot a pretty word yet a true one covering both her manner of eating and her speech registering which facts damaris was sensible of almost physical repulsion as from something obscurely gross hence it followed that theresa must somehow be stopped made to see her own present unpleasantness saved from herself in shortto which end it became damaris duty to unfurl the flag of revolt the young girl arrived at this conclusion in a spirit of rather pathetic seriousness it is far from easy at eighteen to control tongue and temper to the extent of joining battle with your elders in calm and dignified sort to lay about you in a rage is easy enough but rage is tiresomely liable to defeat its own object and make you make a fool of yourself any unfurling of the flag would be useless and worse than useless unless it heralded victory sure and completedamaris realized this so she kept a brave front although her pulse quickened and she had a bad little empty feeling around her heart fortunately however for her side of the campaign theresaemboldened by recapitulation of her late boastings at the miss minetts teatablehastened to put a gilded dome to her own indiscretion and offence for nothing would do but damaris must accompany her on this choir treat she declared herself really compelled to press the point it offered such an excellent opportunity of acquiring archaeological knowledgehad not the dean most kindly promised to conduct the party round the cathedral himself and deliver a short lecture en routeand of friendly social intercourse both of which would be very advantageous to damaris as she was without any engagement for the day clearly neither should be missed of course everyone understood how unsuitable it would be to ask sir charles to patronize parish excursions and eventshere miss bilson became lyrical speaking with gasping breath and glowing face of a call to exalted spheres of action of great proconsuls empire builders pillars of the statenaturally you hesitated to intrude on the time and attention of such a distinguished personthat in point of fact was her main reason for disposing of the matter of the carriage horses herself how could she trouble sir charles with such a homely detailbut damaris case needless to remark was very different at her age it was invidious to be too exclusive miss felicia verity feltso she theresa was certainthat it was a pity damaris did not make more friends in the village now she was out of the schoolroom may and doris horniblow were sweet girls and highly educated they of course were going and captain taylor she understood would bring his daughter louisawho was home for a few days before the opening of term at the tillingworth high school where she was second mistress it is always well to realize the attainments of young people of your own age even if they are not in quite the same social grade as yourself your going would give pleasure too it will be taken as a compliment to the vicar and the churchmay really in a sense be called patriotic since an acknowledgment of the duty we owe individually to the local community of which we form part and then she added naively giving herself away at the last of course if you go over to the station in the brake patch cannot make any difficulties about driving it here theresa stayed the torrent of her eloquence and looked up to find damaris eyes fixed upon her in incredulous wonder have you nothing to say dear in answer to my proposition she enquired with a suddenly anxious edgy little laugh i am afraid i have a lot to say some of which you wont like how so theresa cried still playfully you must see how natural and reasonable my suggestion is then becoming admonitory you should learn to think a little more of othersit is a bad habit to offer opposition simply for oppositions sake i do not oppose you for the mere pleasure of opposing damaris began determined her voice should not shake but im sorry to say i cant agree to the horses being used to draw a loaded brake i could not ask patch he would refuse and be quite right in refusing its not their worknor his work either she leaned forward trying to speak civilly and gently there are some things you dont quite understand about the stables or about the servantsthe things which cant be done which its impossible to asknowait pleaseplease let me finish for between astonishment chagrin and an inarticulate struggle to protest miss bilsons complexion was becoming almost apoplectic and her poor fat little cheeks positively convulsed i dislike saying such disagreeable things to you but it cant be avoided it would be cowardly of me not to tell you the truthyou shall have the brougham the day after tomorrow and ill write to miss minett in the morning and tell her you will call for her and her sister on your way to marychurch and that you will bring them back at night i will give patch his orders myself so that there may be no confusion and i will subscribe a pound to the expenses of the choir treat that is all i can promise in the way of help butbutdamaris think of the position in which you place me i cannot be thrust aside thus i will not submit it is so humiliating sosoi offered the horses i told the vicar he might consider it settled about the extra brake i know that was a mistake you had no right to make such an offer for justice must take its course theresa must be saved from herself still her implacable young saviour in proportion as victory appeared assured began to feel sad for it grew increasingly plain that theresa was not of the stuff of which warriors any more than saints are made stand up to her and she collapsed like a pricked bubbleso little was left a scum of colourless soap suds in which very certainly there is no fight again she showed a pitiful being inviting chivalrous forbearance you are very hard she lamented and you are always inclined to side with the servants against me you seem to take pleasure in undermining my influence while i am so ready and anxious to devote myself to you you know there is nothing nothing i would not do for you andand for sir charles theresa choked coughed holding her handkerchief to her eyes and what reward do i meet with she asked brokenly at every turn i am thwarted but you must give way in this case damaris positively you must i cannot allow myself to be publicly discredited through your selfwill i promised the horses for the extra brake the offer was made and acceptedaccepted you understand actually accepted what will the vicar say if the arrangement is upset what will every one think damaris pushed her chair back from the table and rose to her feetforbearance wore threadbare under accusation and complaint no theresa was not only a little too abject but a little too disingenuous thereby putting herself beyond the pale of rightful sympathy even while she protested devotion self looked out seeking personal advantage and that devotion in itself shocked damaris sense of fitness where it involved her father it wasnt theresas place to talk of devotion towards him moreover the young girl began to feel profoundly impatient of all this to do and bother for wasnt the whole affair very much of a storm in a teacup petty paltry quite unworthy of prolonged discussion such as this she certainly thought so in her youthful fervour and inexperience whilethe push of awakening womanhood giving new colour and richness to her conception of lifenature cried out for a certain extravagance in heroism in largeness of action of aspiration she was athirst for noble horizons in love with beauty with the magnificence of things seen and unseen alike in love with superb objectives even if only to be reached through a measure of suffering andsearching arresting though the thought was to herpossibly through peril of death in such moods there is small room for a bilson regime and outlook a flavour of scorn marked her tone as she answered at last oh you can lay the blame on meor rather tell the truth which amounts to the same thing say that my father being away i refused my consent to the horses being taken out say you appealed to me but i was hopelessly obstinate it is very simple chapter iii a sampling of freedom when two persons living under the same roof have the misfortune to fall out a hundred and one small ways are ready to hand for the infliction of moral torment the weak it may be added are not only far more addicted to such inflictings than the strong but far more resourceful in their execution theresa bilsons conduct may furnish a pertinent example from the moment of emerging from her bedchamber next morning she adopted an attitude which she maintained until she regained the chaste seclusion of that apartment at night during no instant of the intervening hours did she lapse from studied speechlessness unless directly addressed nor depart from an air of virtuous resignation to injustice and injuryquite exquisitely provoking to the onlooker twice during the morning damaris upon entering the schoolroom discovered her in tears which she proceeded to wipe away furtively with the greatest ostentationdramatic effect on the second occasion was however marred by the fact that she was engaged in retrimming a white chip hat encircled by a garland of artificial dogroses blue glass grapes and assorted foliagean occupation somewhat illadapted to tragedy in addition to making her expupilagainst whom they were mainly directedfirst miserable and then naughtily defiant by these manoeuvres she alienated any sympathy which her redrimmed eyelids and dolorous aspect might otherwise have engendered in the younger and less critical members of the establishment by sending alfred the hallboy up to the vicarage with a note and instructions to wait for an answer at the very moment when every domestic ordinance demanded his absorption in the cleaning of knives and of boots being but human alfred naturally embraced the heavensent chance of dawdling passing the time of day with various cronies and rapturously assisting to hound a couple of wild sweating and snorting steers along the dusty lane behind the churchyard to butcher cleaves slaughterhouse with the consequence that his menial duties devolved upon laura and lizzie who supported by the heads of their respective departments combined to give him the what for in no measured terms upon his eventual and very tardy return it is not too much to say that by luncheon time theresawhether wilfully or nothad succeeded in setting the entire household by the ears while any inclinations towards peacemaking with which damaris might have begun the day were effectively dissipated leaving her strengthened and confirmed in revolt around the stables and the proposed indignity put upon patch and the horses this wretched quarrel centred soas at once a vote of confidence and declaration of independenceto the stables damaris finally went and ordered the dogcart at three oclock for she would drive and drive throughout the course of this gilded september afternoon drive far away from foolishly officious and disingenuous theresa far from deadham so tiresome just now in its irruption of teaparties and treats she would behold peaceful inland horizons taste the freedom of spirit and the content which the long smooth buffcoloured roads leading to unknown towns and unvisited countryside so deliciously give she stood at the front door in blue linen gown white knitted jersey and white sailor hat buttoning her tan doeskin drivinggloves a gallant gravely valiant young creature beautifully unbroken as yet by any real assent to the manifold foulness of lifeher faith in the nobility of human nature and human destiny still finely intact and that was just where her revolt against poor theresa bilson came in for theresa broke the accepted law being ignoble and thereby spoiled the fair pattern showed as a blotnot that she meant to trouble any more about theresa just now she was out simply to enjoy to see and feel rather than reason analyse or think so she settled herself on the sloping highcushioned seat bracing her feet against the driving iron while mary reaching up tucked the dustrug neatly about her skirts patchwhose looks and figure unmistakably declared his callingshortlegged and stocky inclining to corpulence yet nimble on his feet clean shaven napoleonic of countenance passed reins and whip into her hands as tolling the groom let go the horses head the girl squared her shoulders a little and the soft colour deepened in her cheeks as she swung the dogcart down the drive and out of the entrance gate into the roadhere a greenroofed tunnel branches meeting overhead thickly carpeted with dry sand blown inward from the beachand on past the whitewashed cottages red brick and grey stone houses of deadham village their gardens pleasant with flowers and with apple and pear trees weighted down by fruit past the vicarage and church standing apart on a little grassgrown monticule backed by a row of elms which amid their dark foliage showed here and there a single bough of verdigrisgreen or lemonyellowfirst harbingers of autumn into the open now small rough fields dotted with thorn bushes and bramblebrakes on the one side and on the other the shining waters of the haven through the hamlet of lampit the rear of whose dilapidated sheds and dwellings abut on reedbeds and stretches of unsightly slime and ooze a desolate spot bleak and windswept in winter and even under blue skies as today basking in sunshine degraded by poverty and dirt some halfmile further is horny cross where as the name indicates four roads meet that from deadham to the edge of the forest runs north the other from beaupresonsea to marychurch stourmouth and barryport due west damaris having a fancy to keep the coastline out of sight chose the former following the valley of the arne between great flat meadows where herds of dairy cows of red devons and black welsh runts feed in the rich deep grass in one place a curve of the river brings it for three hundred yards or more close under the hanging woods only the width of the roadway between the broad stream and living wall of trees here transparent bluish shadow haunted the undergrowth and the air grew delicately chill charged with the scent of fern of moist earth leaf mould and moss such traffic as held the road was leisurely native to the scene and therefore pleasing to the sightfor the age of selfmoving machines on land had barely dawned yet while the sky was still wholly inviolatea white tilted millers wagon a brewers dray each drawn by wellfavoured teams with jingling bells and brassmounted harness rumbling farm carts a gypsy van painted in crude yellow blue and red and its accompanying rabble of children donkeys and dogs a farmers highhung curtseying gig were in turn met or passed for the black horse damaris driving it gave place to none covering the mounting tale of miles handsomely at an even swinging trot at ladys oak a noble tree marking some ancient forest boundary and consequently spared when the needs of the british navy during the french wars of the early years of the century condemned so many of its fellows to the axethe flattened burnished dome of which glinted back the sunlight above a maze of spreading branches and massive powdergrey trunkthe main road forks damaris turned to the left across the singlearch stone bridge spanning the arne and drove on up the long winding ascent from the valley to the moorland and fir plantations which range inland behind stourmouth this constituted the goal of her journey for once the highlying plateau reached leagues of country open out far as the eye carries to the fine bare outline of the wiltshire downs she checked the horse letting it walk while she took stock of her surroundings it may be asserted that there are two ways of holding converse with nature the one is egotistic and sentimental an imposing of personal tastes and emotions which betrays the latent categoric belief that the existence of external things is limited to mans apprehension of thema vilely conceited if not actually blasphemous doctrine the other is that of the seeker and the seer who approaching in all reverence asks no more than leave to listen to the voice of external thingsrecognizing their independent existence knowing them to be as real as he is as wonderful in their own order as permanent possibly as potent even for good and evil as himself and it was happily according to this latter reading of the position instinctively by the natural bent of her mind that damaris attempted converse with the world without the glory of the heather had passed the bloom now showing only as silverpink froth upon an ocean of warm brown but the colouring was restful the air here on the dry gravel soil light and eager and the sense of height and space exhilarating a fringe of harebells of orange hawkweed and dwarf red sorrel bordered the road every small oasis of turf amongst the heath and by the wayside carried its pretty crop of centaury and wild thyme of bedstraw milkwort and birdsfoot trefoil furzechats tipped about the gorse bushes uttering a sharp gay warning note a big flight of rooks blueblack against the ethereal blue of the distance winged their way slowly homeward to the long avenue of dark trees leading to a farm in the valley the charm of the place was clear and sane its beauty simple almost to austerity this the young girl welcomed it washed her imagination free of the curious questionings involuntary doubts and suspicions which the house and garden at the hard steeped in tradition thick with past happenings past passions were prone to breed in her no reek off the mudflats any more than over luscious garden scents tainted the atmosphere it was virgin as the soil of the moorlanda soil as yet untamed and unfertilized by the labour of man and this effect of virginity even though a trifle farouche harsh and barren in the perfection of its purity appealed to damaris present mood her spirit leapt to meet it in proud fellowship for it routed forebodings discounted introspective broodings discounted even the apparently inevitablesince nobody and nothing so the young girl told herself with a rush of gladly resolute conviction is really inevitable unless you permit or choose to have them sogallant this and the mother of brave doings thoughas damaris was to discover later to the increase both of wisdom and of sorrowa halftruth only for man is never actually master of people or of things but master at most of his own attitude towards them in this alone can he claim or exercise freewill thenbecause general ideas however inspiriting are rather heavy diet for the young immature minds growing quickly tired in the efforts to digest themdamaris having reached this happy if partially erroneous climax of emancipation ceased to philosophize either consciously or unconsciously the russet moorland and spacious landscape shut the door on her had no more to tell her no more to say or to be strictly accurate was it not rather perhaps that her power of response power to interpret their speech and assimilate their message had reached its term all her life the maturity of her brain had inclinedrather fatiguinglyto outrun the maturity of her body so that she failed to continue in one stay and trivial hours trod close on the heels of hours of exaltation and of insight with a sigh and a sense of lossas though noble companions had withdrawn themselves from hershe gathered up the reins and sent the horse forward she fell into comfortable friendly conversation with the napoleoniccountenanced patch moreover consulting him as to the shortest way through the purlieus of stourmouth into the marychurch high road and so home to deadham hard for to tell the truth she became aware she was hungry and very badly in want of her tea theresa bilson setting out the next morning in solitary state contrived to maintain the adopted attitude until the front gates were safely passed then she relaxed and looked out of the brougham windows with a fussy brightness more consonant to the joys of impending union with the miss minetts and the days impending trip she made no further effort to secure damaris participation in the social and educational advantages which it promised on the contrary she left the young lady severely alone and at home as one administering wellmerited punishment thus effectively demonstrating as she wished to believe her personal authority and suiting as she would have stoutly denied her personal convenience for damaris on a string plus the extra brake and carriage horses was one story damaris on her own minus those animals and muchdebated vehicle quite another unless the presence of her expupil could be made to redound to her own glory theresa much preferred reserving representation of the hard and its distinguished proprietor wholly and solely to herself so in the spirit of pretence and of makebelieve did she go forth to find on her return that spirit prove but a lying and treacherous allyand for more reasons than one it happened thus supported by the two brindled tabby house cats geraldine and mustaphadescendants of the numerous tribe honoured during the last halfcentury of his long life by thomas clarkson veritys politely affectionate patronagedamaris spent the greater part of the morning in the long writing room she had judged and condemned theresa pretty roundly it is true nevertheless she felt a little hurt and sore at the latters treatment of her theresa need not have kept up the quarrel till the very last so acridly after all as she was going out purely for own pleasure and amusement she might have found something nice and civil to say at parting and then the mere fact of being left behind of being out of it however limited the charms of a party has a certain small stab to it somehowas most persons probing youthful experiences can testify it is never quite pleasant to be the one who doesnt gothe house moreover when her father was absent always reminded damaris of an empty shrine a place which had lost its meaning and purpose today though windows and doors were wide open letting in a wealth of sunshine it appeared startlingly lifeless and void the maids seemed unusually quiet she heard no movement on the staircase or in the rooms above neither gardener nor gardenboy was visible she would have hailed the whirr of the mowing machine or swish of a broom on the lawnoh if only her poor dear nannie were still alive safe upstairs there in the old nursery and at that the child damaris felt a lump rise in her throat but the girl the soontobe woman damaris choked it down bravely for nobody nothingso she assured herself going back to the lesson learned yesterday upon the open moorlandis really inevitable unless you suffer or will it so to be wherefore she stiffened herself against recognition of loneliness stiffened herself against inclination to mourning refused to acquiesce in or be subjugated by either and to the better forgetting of them sought consolation among her greatgreat uncles books for at this period damaris was an omnivorous reader eager for every form of literature and every description of knowledgewhether clearly comprehended or notwhich the beloved printed page has to give an eagerness it may be noted not infrequently productive of collisions with theresa and at this particular juncture all the more agreeable to gratify on that very account for theresa would have had her walk only in the narrow sheltered neatly bordered paths of history and fiction designed for the greater preservation of female innocence by such authors as miss sewell miss strickland and miss yonge upon damaris however perambulation of those paths palled too soon her intellect and heart alike demanded wider fields of drama of religion and of science above all wider and less conventional converse with average human nature than this triumvirate of victorian sibyls was willing or capable to supply it is undeniable that although words and phrases whole episodes indeed were obscure even unintelligible to her she found the memoirs of benvenuto cellini and saint simon more interesting than the lives of the queens of england vathek more to her taste than amy herbert and if the truth must be told the decameron and tristram shandy more satisfying to her imagination than the heir of redcliffe or the daisy chain to damaris it seemed just now that a book the meaning of which was quite clear to her and could be grasped at sight hardly repaid the trouble of reading since it afforded no sense of adventure no excitement of challenge or of pursuit no mirage of wonder no delightful provocation of matters outside her experience and not understood about these latter she abstained from asking questions having much faith in the illuminating power of the future given patience all in good time she would understand everything worth understandingthat there are things in life best not understood or understood only at your peril she already in some sort divinedhence her reading although of the order obnoxious to pedants as lacking in method and accurate scholarship went to produce a mental atmosphere in which honest love of letters and of art along with generous instincts of humanity quicken and thrive on this particular morning damaris elected to explore to the near east in the vehicle of eoethens virile and luminous prose she sat in one of the solid wide seated armchairs at the fireplace end of a long room near a rounded window the lower sash of which she raised to its full height outside the row of geranium beds glowed scarlet and crimson in the calm light beyond them the turf of the lawn was overspread by trailing gossamers and delicate cartwheel spiders webs upon which the dew still glittered in the shrubberies robins sang and above the river great companies of swallows swept to and fro with sharp twitterings restlessly gathering for their final southern flight no sooner had damaris fairly settled down with her book than mustapha jumped upon her knees and after preliminary buttings and tramplings curled himself round in gross comfort his soft lithe body growing warmer and heavier on her lap as his sleep deepened where a bar of sunshine crossed the leather inset of the writingtable just beside her in the window geraldinehis counterpart as to markings and colouring but finer made more slender of barrel and of limbfitted herself into the narrow space between a silver inkstand and a stack of folded newspapers her forepaws tucked neatly under her chest furry elbows outward her muzzle showed black as did the rims of her eyelids which enhanced the brightness and size of her clear yellowgreen eyes her alert observant little head was raised as with gently lashing tail she watched an imprisoned honeybee buzzing angrily up and down between the windowsashes an elfin creature geraldinerepaying liberal study scornfully secure of the potency of her own charms where mankind or tomcatkind might be concerned royally devoid of morals pastmistress in all sprightly graceful feline devilries she was yet a fond mother solicitous to the point of actual selflessness regarding the safety and wellbeing of her successive and frequently recurrent litters she suckled washed played with and educated those of her kittens who escaped the rigours of stablebucket and broom until such time as they were three to four months old after which she sent them flying amid cuffings and spittings extraordinary whenever they attempted to approach her and oblivious of their orphaned and wistful existence yielded herself with bewitching vivacity to fresh intrigues and amours new the long quiet morning indoors with cats and books for company at once soothed damaris and made her restless after luncheon she put on hat gloves and walking shoes and went down across the lawn to the seawall waylaying her in the hall mary had essayed to learn her programme and anchor her as to time and place by enquiring when and where tea should be served but damaris put the kindly woman offshe couldnt say exactlyyetwould ring and let mary know when she came in if any one called she was not at home in truth her active young body asked for movement and exercise while scenes and phrases from the pages of eoethen still filled her mind she longed for travel not via marychurch to harchester well understood shepherded by theresa bilson the members of the deadham church choir and their supporters but for travel upon the grand scale with all its romance and enlargement of experience its possible dangers and certain hardships as the author of eoethen had known it and her father for that matter had known it in earlier days too she suffered the spell of the eastalways haunting the chambers of her memory and ready to be stirred in active ascendency as by her mornings reading todaysuffered the spell not of its mysterious cities and civilizations alone but of its vast solitudes and silences desert winds and desert sands and hence it came about that as her mood of yesterday sent her inland to pacify her imagination by gazing at the peaceful english countryside so her present mood sent her down to the shore to satisfy or rather further stimulate her nostalgia for the east by gazing out to sea the cause in both cases was the same namely the inward tumult of her awakening womanhood and still more perhaps the tumult of awakening talent which had not as yet found its appointed means of expression she was driven hither and thither by the push of her individuality to disengage itself from adventitious surroundings and circumstances and realize its independent existencea somewhat perilous crisis of development fruitful of escapades and unruly impulses which may leave their mark and that a disfiguring one upon the whole of a womans subsequent career immediately however damaris disposition to defy established convention and routine took the mildest and apparently most innocuous formmerely the making by herself of a little expedition which accompanied by others she had made a hundred times before from the terrace she went down the flight of steps built into the width of the seawall whence a tall wroughtiron gate opens direct upon the foreshore closing it behind her she followed the coastguardpath at the base of the riverbankhere a miniature sand cliff capped with gravel from eight to ten feet highwhich leads to the warren and the ferry for she would take ship with foxyfaced william jennifer as captain and as crew cross to the brokendown wooden jetty and landing there climb the crown of the bar and look southeast over the channel highway towards far distant countries of the desert and the dawn chapter iv out on the bar all which was duly accomplished though with a difference for on reaching the head of the shallow sandy gully opening on the tide where the flatbottomed ferryboat lay damaris found not jennifer but the withered and doubtfully clean old lobstercatcher timothy proud in possession this disconcerted her somewhat his appearance indeedas he stood amongst a miscellaneous assortment of sunbleached and weatherstained foreshore lumber leaning the ragged elbows of his blue jersey upon the top of an empty petroleum barrel and smoking a dirty clay pipewas so far from inviting that the young girl felt tempted to relinquish her enterprise and go back by the way she had come but as she hesitated the old man catching sight of her and scenting custom first spat and then called aloud might e be wanting the ferry miss thus directly challenged damaris could not but answer in the affirmative put e across to the bar he took her up smartly natrally i willbeant i here for the very purposeput e across i will and on the tick too and after further expectoration relinquishing the support of the oil barrel he joined her and shambled down the sandy track at her side talking damaris hastened her step but bent back and creaking breath notwithstanding proud kept pace with her his speech and movements alike animated by a certain malicious glee william e give hisself an oliday he explained to take the little dorgs and ferrets up to butcher cleaves ratting powerful sight of varmin there allers be round they sheds and places comes after the innards and trimmings they do as bold as you please oh yesno doubt i understand damaris said at once anxious to arrest the flow of his unsavoury eloquence yet to appear civil since she was about to make use of his services normous great rats they be he however continued with evident relish normous and fierce as tigers the rascals what with feasting on flesh and fatness like so many lords so mind the ferry for me will you daddy william says coming round where was i taking my morning pint over at the inn youre a wonderful valorous man of your yearsand so thank the powers miss i becan handle the old scraw as clever as i can myself william says there aint much about water salt or fresh nor whatsoever moves on the face of it nor down below in the belly of it any man can teach you which may seem putting it a bit high yet aint no more than truth and justice miss so you neednt fear to trust yourself across the ferry along of me i have no fear damaris answered curtly and loftily holding herself very erect her face slightly flushed her eyes warlike for he was a repulsive old man and said repulsive things such as she had never heard put thus plainly into words before she felt soiled by even this brief association with him she wanted to hear no more of his ugly highcoloured talk although of his skill as a waterman she entertained no doubt stepping lightly and quickly up on to the square stern of the ferryboat she went forward and kept her back resolutely turned upon the old fellow as he scrambled on board after her shoved off and settled to the oars the river was low and sluggish from the long drought with consequently easy passage to the opposite bank it took but a short five minutes to reach the jetty crawling like some gigantic damaged manylegged insect out over the smooth gleaming water instead of the legal twopence damaris dropped a couple of shillings into daddy prouds eager handwith a queenly little air and without waiting for his thanks swung herself up on to the black planking and turned to go down the sandstrewn wooden steps pleased to fetch e back miss any hour you like to name proud called after her standing up and fingering the shillings with one hand while with the other he steered the boats side away from the slippery weedgrown piles thank you i dont quite know when i shall be back she answered over her shoulder for her main desire was to get quit of his unpleasant neighbourhood she would go for a long walk by the coastguard path across the sandhills right out to stone horse head would stay out till sundown in the hope that by then jennifer might have seen fit to exchange the manly joys of ratting for his more prosaic duties at the ferry and so save her from further association with his displeasing deputy but the ridge of the bar reached other thoughts and impulses took possession of her for the sea this afternoon showed an infinitely beguiling countenance not as highway of the nations still less as violent and incalculable holding cruelties of storm and tempest in its heart did it present itself to her view but rather as some gentle softly inviting and caressing creature decked forth in the changeful colours of a doves neck and breast opaline haze veiled the horizon shutting off all unrestful sense of distance the tide was low and little waves as of liquid crystal chased one another over the gleaming sands out to where the haze met and covered it the smooth expanse of sea was unbroken by passing boat or ship nor was any person within sight upon the long line of the beach damaris found herself alonebut deliciously alone with this enchanted dream sea for companion in the sunshine under the vault of tender blue sky and for the present at least she asked nothing better humanity being at a decided discount with her thanks first to the extreme tiresomeness of theresa bilson and later the extreme unsavouriness of timothy proud the element thus eliminated nothing interfered nothing jarred so that she could yield herself to an ecstasy of contemplation active rather than passive in that imagination breaking the bounds of personality made her strangely one with all she looked on consciousness of self was merged in pure delight never could she remember to have felt so lighthearted so happy with the spontaneous unconditioned happiness which is sufficient to itself unclouded by thought of what has been or what may be pushed by her own radiant emotion and an instinct deriving from it to draw even closer to that everlasting beauty of things which is uncreated by and independent of the will and work of man she ran down the slope and sitting on the shingle slipped off her shoes and stockings took off her hat too and leaving the lot lying there just above hightide mark gathered her skirts in one hand and bareheaded thus and barefooted danced out over the wet gleaming sands a graceful flying figure until the little waves played and purred about her ankles her action was symbolic born of the gay worship welling up within her a giving of herself to the shining infinite of nature as just now manifestthings divine and eternal glimmering through at herin this fair hour of solitude and brooding peace till her mood softened damaris danced thus alone unwitnessed on the shore then as she sobered happy still though the crisis of ecstasy had passed smaller seeings began to charm her fancy and her eyespinkish yellow starfish long ribbons of madderred or emerald seaweed their colours the more living and vivid for the clear water covering them presently a company of five birdstheir mottled brown and olive bodies raised on stiltlike legs thin as a strawclaimed her notice so bewitched was she by their quaint and pretty ways that she could not but follow them as they chased one another in and out of the rippling waves ran quickly and bowed catching something eatable floating upon the tide scattered and then joined up into a joyous chorus of association with gentle twittering cries watching them dreaming standing now and again looking out over the sweet wonder of the placid sea sometimes wading ankle deep sometimes walking on the firm floor of uncovered sand damaris passed onward losing count of time the birds led her eastward up channel to the halfmile distant nose of the bar round which the rivers released at last from their narrow channel sweep out into marychurch bay here on a sudden they took wing and damaris looking after them bade them an unwilling farewell for their innocent society had been sweet and with that she became aware she was really quite tired and would be glad to rest awhile the afternoon being young yet before turning homeward the longer she stayed the more hope there was of finding jennifer at the ferry and more than ever the glamour of her wild hour of nature worship still upon her did she recoil from any sort of association with foul old timothy proud therefore she went up across the moist gleaming levels to the tideline and picking her way carefully among the black jumble of seaweed and sealitter which marked it sat down in a fanshaped depression in the dry clean blown sand some few paces above the sunshine covered it making it warm to her bare feet the feel and blond colour of it brought to mind her reading of this morninga passage in eoethen telling of the striking of camp at dawn the desert waiting to claim its own again and obliterate with a single gesture all sign or token of the passing sojourn of man clasping her hands behind her head damaris lay back the warm sand all around her giving beneath her weight fitted itself into the curves of her body and limbsonly it visible and the soft blue of the sky above for a little while she rested openeyed in the bright silent stillness and then unknowing of the exact moment of surrender she stretched with a fluttering sigh turned on her side and dreamlessly slept and while she thus slept two events took place eminently germane to the further unfolding of this historythe weather changed and the local degenerate abram sclanders halfidiot sonthe poor lippitylop who according to jennifer had far better been put away quietlike at birthcommitted theft of the first event damaris gradually became sensible before her actual awakening she grew restless her bed of sand seeming robbed of comfort bleak and uneasy so that she started up presently into a sitting position rubbing her eyes with her fists babyfashion unable for the minute to imagine how or why she came to be lying like this out on the bar hatless shoe and stockingless looking about her still in questioning bewilderment she observed that in the southwest a great bank of cloud had risen it blotted out the sun deadening all colour the opaline haze turned to a dull falling mist closed down and in covering the sandhills and the dark mass of stone horse head and even blurring the long straight lines of the sandbank and nearer shingle the sea had risen but noiselessly creeping up and up towards her no line of white marking the edge of its slothful oncoming damaris stood up pulling her white jerseythe surface of it already furred with moisturelow over her hips for she felt shivery and the air was thick and chill to breathe causing a tightness in her throat the glory has departed very much departed so i had best make haste to depart also she told herself but told herself gallantly smiling at her own strange plight in a spirit of adventure discovering in it the excitement of novel experience she picked her way over the shingle and black sea litter of highwater mark and started to run along the narrow strip between it and the advancing tide to run would circulate her blood warm her through and keep her gallant humour up still she had to own she found this heavy going for her feet were numb and the sand seemed to pluck at and weigh them down her run slackened to a walk then she ventured a yard or two out into the shallow water hoping there to meet with firmer foothold but here it proved altogether too cold she had the misfortune moreover to tread on the top end of a razor shell buried upright which cut the skin making her limp from pain and sharpness of smarting so perforce she took to the deep blown sand again above highwater mark and ploughed along slowly enough in growing weariness and discomfort never surely was any halfmile so long as this between the place of her farewell to the mottled stiltlegged birds and subsequent sleeping and the place where she left her hat and shoes and stockings in the dimness and chill of the falling mist it seemed to lengthen and lengthen to an altogether incomprehensible extent time and again she stopped and scanned the ground immediately before her certain she should see there those so lightly discarded and now so earnestly desired items of clothing once in possession of them she would simply scurry home for visions of warm dry pretty garments of marys comely ministering presence of tea of lamplight andyes she would allow herself that culminating luxuryof a fine log fire in the long sittingroom presented themselves to her imagination in most alluring sequencethe spirit of adventure meanwhile as must be owned beginning to sing small and hang a diminished head but on a sudden raising her eyes from their persistent search damaris realized she must have missed and already passed the spot for she was close upon the tract of sandhillsa picture of desolation in the sullen murk the winding hollows between their pale formless elevations bearing a harsh growth of neutral tinted swordlike grasses she had come too far by a quarter of a mile at least so she judged and must turn her face eastward again and laboriously plough her way back but the return journey was crowned with no better success than the outward one carefully methodically she quartered the beach but simply her things werent there had vanished leaving neither token or trace she was confronted moreover by the unpleasant fact that it grew late soon the dusk would fall its coming hastened by the mist now settling into a steady drizzle of rain precursor of a dark and early night to hunt any longer would be useless she must give it up yet her maidenly pride her sense of what is seemly and becoming revolted from exposing herself to timothy prouds coarse leering glances or evenshould he by luck be her watermanto jennifers more respectful curiosity dishevelled and but halfdressed as she was and then the actual distance to be traversed appeared to her dishearteningly great for she was wearyquite abominably weary now she came to think of it her feet were bruised and blistered they ached her throat ached too and she shivered cold though it was she must wait a minute or two and rest before attempting the ascent of the slope damaris sat down pulling her skirts as low as they would come over her bare legs and clasping her hands round her knees bowed huddled together to gain if it might be some sensation of warmth for a little she thought of that onlywarmthher mind otherwise a blank but soon the consuming sadness of the place in the waning light penetrated her imagination penetrated indeed her whole being only a few hours ago she had danced here in ecstasy born of the sunshine the colour the apparently inexhaustible beauty of things uncreated by and independent of the will and work of man contrast that scene and the radiant emotion evoked by it with this which was real the enduring revelation was this truth the other no more than miragean exquisite dissembling and lovely lie such thoughts are hardly wholesome at eighteenhardly wholesome perhaps at any age if life is to be lived sweetly with honest profit to ones own soul and to the souls of others yet remembering back down the dim avenues of childhood damaris knew she did not formulate the question entertain the suspicion for the first time only until now it had stayed in the vague a shapeless nightmare horror past which she could force herself to run with shut eyes it didnt jump out of the vague thank goodness and bar her passage but now no running or shutting of eyes availed it had jumped out she stared at it and in all its undermining power of discouragement it stared backwhat if the deepest thing the thing which alone lasted the thing which therefore you were bound in the end to accept to submit to was just darkness sorrow loneliness of worn body and shrinking spirit by the shore of a cold dumb and tenantless limitless seawhat then from which undesirable abyss of speculation she was aroused by the sound of her own namedamaris verity heydamaris verityshouted not roughly though in tones of urgent command from above and behind her on the crest of the bar along with it came the rattle of shifting shingle under a strong active tread hearing which the young girls senses and faculties alike sprang to attention she rose from her dejected attitude stood up and faced round forgetful of aches and weariness and of woeful ultimate questionings while in glad surprise her heart went out to meet and welcome theto herbest beloved being in this no longer sorry world for even thus at some fifty yards distant through the blur of falling rain the figure presented to her gaze in height build and fashion of moving was delightfully familiar as were the tones of the voice which had hailed herif in not quite equal degree the manner of that hail some change in his plans must have taken place or some letter miscarried advising her of her fathers earlier return finding her out he had come to look for herthis was perfectly as it should be had colonel carteret come home with him she wondered and then there flashed through her with a singular vividness recollection of another long long ago escapadewhen as a still almost baby child she had stepped off alone in daring experiment and fallen asleep in the open as today but in surroundings how amazingly differenta place of fountains cypresses and palms she curled up in a black marble chair set throne fashion upon a platform of blood red sandstone an ageold oriental garden outstretched below colonel carteretthe man with the blue eyes as she always had called himawakened her bringing an adorable and as it proved in the sequel a tragic birthday gifttragic because to it might actually if indirectly be traced the breaking up of her childhoods home in the stately indian pleasure palace of the sultanibagh at bhutpur her separation from her father and exileas she had counted itto europe it is among the doubtful privileges of highly sensitized natures such as damaris that in hours of crisis vision and prevision go hand in hand as there flashed through her remembrance of that earlier sleep in the open there flashed through her also conviction that history would still further repeat itself now as then the incident of sleep preluded the receipt of a gift adorable perhaps yet freighted with farreaching consequences to herself and her future of just what that gift might consist she had no idea but of its approach she felt as certain as of the approach of the man swinging down through the rain over the rattling pebbles and her gladness of welcome declined somewhat she could have cried off begged for postponement for she was very tired after all she didnt want anything now anything whichhowever delightful in itselfdemanded effort demanded even the exertion of being very pleased she shied away in short and then commendably rallied her forces resolute not to be found unworthy or ungrateful yescome i am here she called in response to that lately heard calling of her name desiring to make an act of faith whereby to assure herself she was indeed ready and assure her hearer of her readiness to accept the impending gift i am here she began again to affirm but stopped abruptly the words choking in her throat for as with decreasing distance the figure grew distinct she saw to her blank amazement not sir charles verity her father as she expected but the blue reefer jacket peaked cap and handsome bearded face of darcy faircloth the young merchant seacaptain emerge from the blur of the wet and the revulsion of feeling was so sharp the shock at once so staggering and intimateas summing up all the last ten days confused experiencethat damaris could not control herself she turned away with a wail of distress threw out her hands and then covering her eyes with them bowed her head the young man came forward and stood near her but an appreciable time elapsed before he spoke when he presently did so his voice reached her as again singularly familiar in tone though strange in diction and in accent im sorry if i startled you he began but i hailed you just now and you told me to comei concluded you meant what you said not im afraid that your giving your permission or withholding it would have made much difference in the upshot timothy proud let on in my hearing that he set you across the river soon after two oclock and that thered been no call for the ferry since so i took one of my own boats and just came over to look for youin case you might have met with some mishap or strayed among the sandhills and couldnt find your thus far he spoke with studied calm and restraint but here as though struck by a fresh and very objectionable idea he broke out nothing has happened has it no cowardly brute has interfered with you or upset you dear god alive dont tell me im too late dont tell me that upon damaris this sudden though to her unaccountable violence and heat acted as a cordial she raised her head pushing back the damp hair from her forehead and displaying a proud if strained and weary face no she said of course not who would venture to be rude to me i have not seen anyone all the afternoonuntil now when you came and she added by way of further explanationshe didnt want to be ungracious or unkind but she did want in justice to herself to have this understoodin the distance i didnt recognize you i mistook you for someone else who else he took her up and with a queer flickerif of a smile then one with a keenish edge to itin his eyes and about his mouth for my father damaris answered it was a stupid mistake because he is away staying in norfolk for partridge shooting and i have not any real reason to expect him home for several days yet but in this deceptive light faircloth took her up again whileas she could not help observingthat flicker became more pronounced it seemed silently to laugh and to mockoh to be sure that accounts for your mistake as to my identity one sees how it might very well come about he took off his cap and threw back his head looking up into the low wet sky at night all cats are grey arent they he went on little ones as well as big and its close on night now thanks to this dirty weather so close on it thatthough personally im in no hurryi ought to get you back to the hard or therell be a regular hue and cry after yourightly and probably too if your servants and people have any notion of their duty i am quite ready damaris said she strove to show a brave front to keep up appearances but she felt helpless and weak curiously confused by and unequal to dealing with this masterful strangerwho yet somehow did not seem like a stranger precisely in this was the root of her confusion of her inability to deal with him but hardly as you are he commented on her announcement she was ready let me help to put on your shoes and stockings for you first and this he said so gently and courteously that damaris lips began to quiver very feminine and youthful shame at the indignity of her present plight laying hold on her i cant find them she pitifully declared i have looked and looked but i cant find them anywhere i left my things just here can anyone have stolen them while i was out at the end of the bar it is so mysterious and so dreadfully tiresome i should have gone home long ago before the rain began if i could have found them and with that the whole little storychildish or idyllic as you pleaseof sunshine and colour of beguiling birds beguiling sea of sleep and uneasy awakening when the cloudbank rising westward devoured the fair face of heaven of mist and fruitless seeking even some word of the fear which forever sits behind and peeps over the shoulder of all wonder and all beauty got itselfnot without eloquent passagesquickly yet gravely told for the young man appeared to derive considerable pleasure from listening from watching her and from questioning her toostill gently and courteously though closely as if each detail were of interest and of value and now you know all about it captain faircloth damaris said in conclusion essaying to laugh at her own discomfiture and i am very tired so if you will be kind enough to row me across the ferry i shall be grateful to you and glad please to go home at once by all means he answered only you know i cant very well let you cut your feet to pieces on these cruel stones so i am just going to carry you up over the bar nonoi can perfectly well walk i mean to walksee she cried and started courageously up the rough ascent only to slip after a few paces and to stagger for as soon as she attempted to move she felt herself not only weak but oddly faint and giddy she lurched forward and to avoid falling instinctively clutched at her companions outstretched hand exactly what passed between the young man and young girl in that handclaspthe first contact they had had of one anotherit might seem farreached and fantastic to affirm yet that it steadied not only damaris trembling limbs but her trembling and overwrought spirit is beyond question for it was kind and more than kindtender and that with the tenderness of right and usage rather than of sentimental response to a passing sentimental appeal there there he said whats the use of working to keep up this little farce any longer just give inyou cant put off doing so in the end why not at once then accept defeat and spare both yourself and me pain you are no more fit to walk than you are fit to flyto fly away from methats what you want isnt it ah that flight will come no doubt all in good timebut meanwhile be sensible put your left arm round my necklike this yes thenjust a little hoist and if youll not worry but keep still nothings easier as he spoke faircloth stooped lightly and with no apparent exertion lifting her high so thatshe clasping his neck as instructedthe main weight of her body rested upon his shoulder with his right arm he held her just above the waist his left arm below her knees cradling her now rest quiet he said know you are safe and think only of comfortable thingsamong them this one if you care to that for once in my life i am content yet over such yielding and treacherous ground upward to the crown of the ridge and downward to the river progress could not be otherwise than slow twilight and that of the dreariest and least penetrable overtook them before faircloth still carrying the whiteclothed figure reached the jetty here at the bottom of the wooden steps he set damaris down led her up them and handed her into the boattied up to and the tide being at the flood now little below the level of the staging chapter v wherein damaris makes some acquaintance with the hidden ways of men throughout their singular journeysave for briefest question and answer about her wellbeing at the commencement of itthe two had kept silence as though conscious faircloths assertion of contentment struck a chord any resolution of which might imperil the simplicity of their relation thus far that relation showed a noble freedom from embarrassment it might have continued to do so but for a hazardous assumption on his part when first placing damaris in the stern of the boat the young man stripped off his jacket and regardless of her vaguely expressed protest wrapped it round her feet it held the living warmth of his body and chilled dazed and spent as damaris was that warmth curiously soothed her until the inkblack boat floating upon the brimming hardly less inky water faded from her knowledge and sight she drooped together passing into a state more comparable to coma than to natural slumber her will in abeyance thought and imagination borne under by the immensity of her fatigue as faircloth meanwhile pulled clear of the outstanding piles of the jetty he heard voices and saw lights moving down by the ferry on the opposite shore but these and any invitation they might imply he ignored if the hue and cry after damaris which he had prophesied were already afoot he intended to keep clear of it studiously to give it the slip to this end once in the fairway of the river he headed the boat downstream rowing strongly though cautiously for some minutes careful to avoid all plunge of the oars all swish of them or drip then the lights now hidden by the higher level and scrub of the warren he sat motionless letting the boat drift on the seaward setting current the fine rain fell without sound it shut out either bank creating a singular impression of solitude and isolation and of endlessness too there seemed no reason why it should ever cease and this delusion of permanence the enclosing softclinging darkness served to heighten the passage of time itself seemed arrestedtomorrow becoming an abstraction remote and improbable which could with impunity be left out of the count with this fantastic state of things faircloth had no quarrel though impatient of inaction as a rule definite and autocratic enough he really wasnt aware of having any particular use for tomorrow content still held sway he was satisfied profoundly yet dreamingly satisfied by an achievement long proposed long waited for the door upon which had opened today by the merest accidentif anything can justly be called accident which he inclined to believe it could not he had appointed it should be added a limit in respect of that achievement which he forbade himself to pass and it was his habit very rigidly to obey his own orders however little disposed he might be to obey those of other people he had received as he owned more than he could reasonably have expected good measure pressed down and running over the limit was now reached he should practise restraintleave the whole affair where it stood but the effect of this darkness and of drifting drifting over the black water in the fine soundless rain with its illusion of permanence and of the extinction of tomorrowand the retributions and adjustments in which tomorrow is so frequently and inconveniently fertileenervated him rendering him a comparatively easy prey to impulse should impulse chance to be stirred by some adventitious circumstance the devil it may be presumed is very much on the watch for such weakenings of moral fibre ready to pounce at the very shortest notice and make unholy play with them to faircloths ruminative eyes the paleness in the stern of the boat indicating damaris veritys drooping figure altered slightly in outline whereupon he shipped the oars skillfully and quietly and going aft knelt down in front of her her feet were stretched out as bowed together she sat on the low seat his jacket had slipped away exposing them to the weather and the young man laying his hands on them felt them cold as in death he held them chafed them trying to restore some degree of circulation finally moved by a great upwelling of tenderness and of pity and reckoning her since she gave no sign to be asleep he bent down and put his lips to them but immediately the girls hands were upon his shoulders what are you doing oh what are you doing she cried kissing your feet then the devil no doubt flicking him he let go restraint disobeyed his own orders raised his head and looking at her as in the enfolding obscurity she leaned over him said and if it comes to that who in all the round world has a better right than i your brother to kiss your feet for some to him intolerable and interminable seconds faircloth waited after he had shot his bolt the water whispered and chuckled against the boats sides in lazy undertones as it floated down the sluggish stream beyond this there was neither sound nor movement more than ever might time be figured to stand still his companions hands continued to rest upon his shoulders her ghostly dimly discerned face was so near his own that he could feel now and again her breath upon his forehead but she was silent as yet he did not repent of his cruelty the impulse which dictated it had not spent itself nevertheless this suspense tried him he grew impatient damaris he said at last speak to me how can i speak to you when i dont understand she answered gravely either you liewhich i should be sorry to accuse you of doingor you tell me a very terrible thing if that is i at all comprehend what you sayare you not the son of mrs faircloth who lives at the inn out by the black cottages yes lesbia faircloth is my mother and i ask for no better she has squandered love upon mesquandered money upon me too but wisely and cleverly with results still he pausedwell it takes two doesnt it to make a man one isnt ones mothers son only but mrs faircloth is a widow damaris reasoned in wondering directness i have heard people speak of her husband she was married but not to my father do you ask for proofsjust think a minute whom did you mistake me for when i called you and came down over the bar in the dusk nono she protested trembling exceedingly that is not possible how could such a thing happen as such things mostly do happen it is not the first case nor will it by a long way i reckon be the last they were young andmaynt we allowthey were beautiful thats often a good deal to do with these accidents they met and god help them they loved nono damaris cried again yet she kept her hands on faircloths shoulders clinging to him in the excessive travail of her innocent spiritthough he racked herfor sympathy and for help for whom after all did you take me he repeated if there wasnt considerable cause it would be incredible you should make such a mistake can you deny that i am hallmarked that the fact of my parentage is written large in my flesh he felt her eyes fixed on him painfully straining to see him through the rain and darkness and when she spoke again he knew she knew that he did not lie but wasnt it wrong she said i suppose so only as it gave me life and as i love life im hardly the person to deliver an unbiased opinion on that point then you are not sad you are not angry damaris presently and rather unexpectedly asked yesat times both but not often or for long together as i tell you i love lifelove it too well to torment myself much about the manner of my coming by it it might show more refinement of feeling perhaps to hang my head and let a certain ugly word blast my prospects but i dont happen to see the business that way on the contrary i hope to get every ounce of advantage out of it i canuse it as a spur rather than a hobble and i love my profession too it gives you room and opportunity i am waiting now for my first ship my first command thats a fine thing and a strong one for your first ship is as a bride to you and your first command makes you as a king among men oh on a small scale i grant but as far as it reaches your authority is absolute on board your own ship you are master with a vengeanceif you like and i do like faircloth said the last few words softly but with a weight of meaning not to be misunderstood he bent down once more chafed damaris feet and wrapped his jacket carefully round them and while you and i are alone together there is somethingas weve spoken so freelywhich i want to tell you so that there may be no misconception about me or about what i wantas men in my rank of life go i am well off richagain on a small scale but with means sufficient to meet all my needs im not a spendthrift by nature luckily and i have amply enough not only to hold my own in my profession and win through but to procure myself the pleasures and amusements i happen to fancy i want you to remember that please tell me is it quite clear to you yes damaris said you have made it quite clear yet for the first time he jarred on her as with a more than superficial difference of breeding and of class this mention of money offended her taste seeming to lower the level upon which their extraordinary andto herterrible conversation had thus far moved it hurt her with another kind of hurtingnot magnificent not absorbing but just common that in speaking of money he was protecting himself proudly selfguarding his own honour and that of his mother lesbia faircloth never in her innocence of what is mean and mercenary occurred to damaris so she took her hands off his shoulders and clasped them in her lap clasped them with all her poor strength striving even in this extreme to maintain some measure of calm and of dignity she must hold out she told herself just simply by force of will hold out till she was away from him after that chaosfor thoughts discoveries apprehensions of possibilities in human intercourse hitherto undreamed of were marshalled round her in close formation shoulder to shoulder they only waited an instants yielding on her part and they would be on to her crushing down and in making her brain reel her mind stagger under their stifling crowded assault go back and row she said at once imploring and imperious row quickly i am very tired i am cold i want to be at hometo be in my own place chapter vi recounting an astonishing deposition theresa bilson bustled upstairs barring the absence of the extra brake which had causedand for this she could not be sorry since didnt it justify her attitude towards her recalcitrant expupilsome inconvenient overcrowding in transit to and from the station and barring the rain which set in between five and six oclock the expedition to harchester passed off with considerable eclat such in any case was theresas opinion she herself having figured conspicuously in the foreground during the inspection of the cathedral the dean paid her quite marked attention thanks in part to her historical and archaeological knowledgeof which she made the most and to her connection with the verity familyof which she made the most also in precisely what that connection might consist the learned and timid old gentleman being very deaf and rather nearsighted failed to gather he determined however to be on the safe side our genial archdeacon he said and his distinguished kinsman sir charles ah yesyesindeedto be surewith the greatest pleasure and he motioned the blushing theresa to fall into step with him and with dr horniblow at the head of the deadham procession the afterglow of that triumphal progress irradiated her consciousness still whenafter depositing the miss minetts upon their own doorstep with playful last words recalling the days mild jokes and rallyingsshe drove on to the hard to find the household there in a state of sombre and most admired confusion thus to arrive home in possession of a fine bag of news only to discover an opposition and far finer bag ready awaiting you may well prove trying to the most highsouled and amiable of temper by this time between success and fatigue theresa could not be justly described as either highsouled or sweet tempered she was at once inflated and on edge and consequently hotly indignant as though the unfairest march possible had been stolen upon her she bustled upstairs and crossing the landing turned into the schoolroom passagea long lamplit vista hung with old chinese wallpaper the running pattern of buds and flowers large out of all proportion to the bridges palms pagodas and groups of little purple and blueclad men and women disposed in dwindling perspective upon its once white surface halfway along the passage their backs towards her mary and mrs cooper the cooka fair mild middleaged and cowlike person of ample proportionsstood conversing in smothered tones and its my belief hes been and told her or anyhow that she guesses pore dear young lady the latter with upraised hands lamented theresa just caught these strange words caught too marys hurried rejoinderfor mercys sake mrs cooper not a hint of that to any living soulbefore the two women sensible of the swish and patter of her selfimportant entry turned and moved forward to meet orcould it beto intercept her their faces bore a singular expression in mrs coopers case of sloppy in marys of stern yet vivid alarm deeply engaged though she was with her private grievance miss bilson could not but observe this it made her nervous what is the meaning she began her voice shrill with agitation of the extraordinary story about miss damaris which laura reports to me someone is evidently very much in fault please dont speak quite so loud miss mary firmly admonished her ive just got miss damaris quieted off to sleep and if shes roused up again i wont answer for what maynt happen but what has happened i insist upon knowing theresa declared in growing offence and agitation ah thats just what we should be thankful enough to have you tell us miss mrs cooper chimed in with heavy and reproachful emphasis upon the pronouns to even the mild and cowlike revenge is sweet though honestly distressed and scared the speaker entertained a most consoling conviction she was at this moment getting even with theresa bilson and cleverly paying off old scores the pore dear young ladys caught her death as likely as not out there across the river in the wet let alone some sneaking rascal making off with her stockings and shoes when i saw her little naked feet all blue with the cold it made my heart bleed regularly bleed it did i could only give thanks her nanna pore mrs watson who worshipped the very ground miss damaris trod on was spared living to see that afflicting sight then with a change of tone exasperatingas it was designed to beto one at least of her hearers she added ill have that soup ready against miss damaris wakes mary in case she should fancy it just touch the bell will you and ill bring it up myself its not suitable to give either of the girls a chance for prying theyre a deal too curious as it is and im only too pleased to watch with you turn and turn about as i told you whenever you feel to require a rest lizzie will have to see to the cooking anyhowexcept whats wanted for miss damaris i couldnt put my mind into kitchen work tonight not if you paid me ever so and on large flat feet she moved away towards the backstaircase leading down to the offices from the far end of the passage leaving an odour of pastry behind her and of cloves to think of what tomorrow may bring ah dear me she murmured as she went during the ten minutes or so which immediately followed theresa bilson boxed the compass in respect of sensations the needle as may be noted invariably quivering back to the same pointnamely righteous anger against damaris for was not that highspirited maidens imperviousness to influence and defiance of authorityher theresas influence and authoritythe mainspring of all this disastrous complication theresa found it convenient to believe so and whip herself up to almost frantic determination in that belief it was so perfectly clear all the more clear because her informant mary evidently did not share her belief marys account of todays most vexatious transactions betrayed partizanship and prejudice such as might be expected from an uneducated person offeringas theresa assured herselfa pertinent example of the workings of the servant mind nevertheless uneasy suspicion dogged her a haunting though unformulated dread that other personsone person above all othersmight endorse marys prejudices rather than her own so reasonably based conviction if only mr patch had been in thered have been somebody to depend on the woman told her recounting the anxious search after vanished damaris but hed driven into marychurch of course starting ever so early because of the parcels he had your orders to call for at the several shops before meeting the train and the gardeners had left work on account of the wet so wed nobody to send to make enquiries anywhere except tolling and that featherhead alfred who you cant trust half a minute out of your sight here she paused in her narrative and made a move adroitly driving theresa bilson before her out on to the landing thus putting a greater distance between that tormented spinster and the neighbourhood of damaris bedchamber her handsome brown eyes held the light of battle and her colour was high she straightened a chair standing against the wall at the stairhead with a neatly professional hand in passing mrs cooper and i were fairly wild waiting down on the seawall with the lantern thinking of drowning andworsewhenshe glanced sharply at her companion and lowering her eyes altered the position of the chair by a couple of incheswhen captain faircloths boat came up beside the breakwater and he carried miss damaris ashore and across the garden stoptheresa broke ini do not follow you faircloth captain faircloth you are not i earnestly hope speaking of the owner of that low publichouse on the island yeshim mary returned grimly her eyes still lowered and do you mean me to understand that this young man carried miss damarisactually carried hermiss bilson choked and cleared her throat with a foolish little crowing soundcarried her all the way into the housein his arms yes in his arms miss how else would you have had him carry herand as gentle and careful as any woman could toointo the house and right upstairs herepointing along the passage as if veritably beholding the scene once moreand into her own bedroom how shocking how extremely improper theresa beat her fat little hands hysterically together she credited herself with emotions of the most praiseworthy and purest ignorant that the picture conjured up before her provoked obscure physical jealousies obscure stirrings of latent unsatisfied passion more than ever surely did the needle quiver back to that fixed point of most righteous anger suchsuch a proceeding cannot have been necessary it ought not to have been permitted why did not miss damaris walk because she was in a dead faint and wed all the trouble in life to bring her round indeed she said and that rather nastily i am sorry but i cannot but believe miss damaris might have made an effort to walkwith your assistance and that of cooper had you offered it as i remarked at first someone is evidently very much to blame the whole matter must be thoroughly sifted out of course i am disappointed for i had great confidence in you and coopertwo old servants who might really have been expected to possess some idea of thethe respect due to their masters daughter what will sir charles say when he hears of this objectionable incident thats just what mrs cooper and i are wondering miss mary took her up with so much meaning that miss bilson inwardly quailed sensible of having committed a rather egregious blunder this she made efforts to repair by sheering off hurriedly on another tack not that i shall trouble sir charles with the matter unless circumstances arise which compel me to do soas a duty my great object of course is at all times to spare him any domestic annoyance she began pulling off her gloves a new pair and tight her hands were moist and the glovefingers stuck rendering their removal lengthy and difficult tomorrow i shall have a thorough explanation with miss damaris and decide what action it is my duty to take after hearing her version of the events of this afternoon i should prefer speaking to her tonight miss damaris isnt fit to talk about anything tonight theresa pulled at the righthand glovethe kid gave with a little shriek the thumb splitting out she was in a state of acute indecision could she retire from this contest without endangering her authority without loss of prestige or must she insist she had no real wish to hasten to her expupils bedside she would be glad to put off doing so glad to wait she was conscious of resentment rather than affection and she felt afraid unformulated suspicion unformulated dread again dogging her that damaris was really ill she did not believe for an instant damaris had excellent health the maids exaggerated they delighted in making mysteries uneducated persons are always absurdly greedy of disaster lugubriously credulousyes on the whole she concluded to maintain her original attitude the attitude of yesterday and this morning concluded it would be more telling to keep up the fiction of disgracebecausetheresa did not care to scrutinize her own motives or analyse her own thought too closely she was afraid and she was jealousjealous of damaris beauty of the great love borne her by her father jealous of the fact that a young manhadnt she theresa seen the young seacaptain once or twice in the village recently and been fluttered by his notable good lookshad rescued the girl and carried her home carried her up here across the landing and along the familiar schoolroom passage with its patterned chinese wallpaper gently and carefully in his arms and these qualifying termsgentle and carefulrankled to the point even of physical disturbance so that miss bilson again became guilty of inelegantly choking and clearing her throat for the second time with a foolish crowing sound i will postpone my interview with miss damaris until after breakfast tomorrow she said thus leaving mary fisher virtually if not admittedly master of the field but long before breakfast time in the grey and mournful autumn morning patch rattled the dogcart the seven miles into stourmouth as fast as the black horse could travel to fetch damaris old friend the retired indian civil surgeon dr mccabe for coming to herself in the intervals of distracted fever dreams she had asked for him going back by instinct to the comfort of his care of her in childish illnesses long ago since she was ill enough so mary said to need a doctor let it be him not mr cripps out of the village or dr risdon from marychurch i wont see them i will not see anyone from near here keep them away from me she commanded i know miss bilson will try to send for one or the other but i wont see either promise youll keep them away when after his visit theresa bilson considerably flustered and offended found mccabe breakfasting in the diningroom and offered profuse apologies for the inconvenience to which he must have been put by so early and unnecessary a call the tenderhearted and garrulous but choleric irishman cut her uncommonly short and would you be supposing then that if the dear blessed child should be desirous of consulting me i wouldnt have rejoiced to come to her a thousand times as early and from ten thousand times as far he enquired between large mouthfuls of kidney and fried bacon the scheming little puddingfaced governess creature with a cherry nose and an envious eye to herhe commented to himself but you do not apprehend anything serious theresa said stifflymerely a slight chill with a temperature dancing up and down like a mad thing between a hundred and one and a hundred and three im dashed if i like the looks of her at all at all miss bilson and i am well acquainted with her constitution and her temperament shes as delicate a piece of feminine mechanism as its ever been my fortune to handle and has been so from a child mind and body so finely interwoven that you cant touch the one without affecting the otherthat is where danger comes inand i am glad to find she has so competent a nurse as mary fishera wholesome woman and one to put faith in i have given my full instructions to her but itheresa began fussily her face crimson oh i dont doubt youre devotion itself only my first consideration is my patient and so i make free to use my own judgment in the selection of my assistants no disrespect to you my dear lady you are at home in more intellectual spheres than that of the sickroom and now he wiped his mouth with his napkin twinkling at her over the top of it with small bluegrey eyes at once merry faithful and cunningill be bidding you goodbye till the evening i have told mary fisher ill be glad to sleep here tonight and ill despatch a telegram to sir charles on my way through the village sir charles theresa cried yes he answered her i find the darling girls illness as serious as that chapter vii a soul at war with fact the deepest and most abiding demand of all sentient creatures strong and weak alike is for safety or that being unattainable for a sense of safety an illusion even of safety this so universal demand dictated in damaris case her prayer for dr mccabes attendance he belonged to the safeties of her childhood to the securely guarded and semiregal stateas looking back she recalled itof the years when her father held the appointment of chief commissioner at bhutpur dr mccabe was conversant with all that the sole person available at this juncture who had lot or part in it and as she had foreseenwhen drifting down the tideriver in the rain and darknessonce the supporting tension of faircloths presence removed chaos would close in on her it only waited due opportunity that granted as a tempestdriven sea it would submerge her in the welter of the present she clutched at the high dignities and distinctions of the past as at a lifebelt not vulgarly in a spirit of selfaggrandizement but in the simple interests of selfpreservation as a means of keeping endangered sanity afloat for the distinctions and dignities of that period were real too just as uncontrovertible a contribution to her knowledge of men and of things just as vital an element in her experience as chaos let loose on her now the one in no degree invalidated the truth or actuality of the other but to keep this in mind to remember it all the time while imagination galloped with fever brought on by chill and exposure and reason wandered losing touch with plain commonsense through the moral shock she had sustained was difficult to the point of impossibility she needed a witness visible and material to the fact of those former happier conditions and found it quaintly enough in the untidy person and humorous quarrelsome brickdust coloured faceas much of the said face that is as was discoverable under the thick stiff growth of sandy hair surrounding and invading itof the irish doctor as he sat by her bed ministered to and soothed her with reverent and whimsical delicacy as long as he was there her room retained its normal pleasant and dainty aspect all damaris little personal effects and treasures adorning dressing and writingtables the photographs and ornaments upon the mantelshelf her books the prints and pictures upon the wallseven the white dimity curtains and covers trellised with small faded pink and blue rosesseemed to smile upon her kindly and confiding they wanted to be nice to console and encourage hermccabe holding them in place and in active goodwill towards her somehow with his large freckled hairybacked hands but let him go from the room let him leave her and they turned wicked behaving as they had behaved throughout the past rather dreadful night and adding to the general chaos by tormenting tricks and distortions of their own the beloved photographs of her father in particular were cruel they grew inordinately large stepped out of their frames and stalked to and fro in troops and companies the charcoal drawing of himdone last year by that fine artist james colthurst as a study for the portrait he was to painthanging between the two western windows at right angles to her bed where she could always see it proved the worst offender it did not take the floor it is true but remained in its frame upon the wall yet it too came alive and looked full at her compelling her attention dominating commanding her while slowly deliberately it changed the features slightly losing their accentuation growing youthful softer in outline the long drooping moustache giving place to a closecut beard the eyes alone stayed the same steady luminous a living silence in them at once formidable and strangely sad finallyand this the poor child found indescribably agitating and even horribletheir silence was broken by a question for they asked what she damaris meant to say meant to do when heher father the allpowerful commissioner sahib of her babyhoods faith and devotioncame home here came back yet whose eyes after all were they which thus asked was it not rather the younger man the bearded one who claimed and of right an answer to that question and upon damaris it now dawned that these two distinct yet interchangeable personalitiesimprisoned as by some evil magic in one picturewere in opposition in violent and impious conflict which conflict she was called upon yet was powerless to avert or to assuage not once but many timessince the transformation was persistently recurrentthe girl turned her face to the wall to gain relief from the sight of it and the demand it so fearfully embodied pressing her dry lips together lest any word should escape them for the whole matter as she understood it was secret sacred too as it was agonizing no one must guess what lay at the root of her present sufferingnot even comfortable devoted mary nor that invaluable lifebelt dr mccabe she held the honour of both those conflicting interchangeable personalities in her hands and whether she were strong enough to adjust their differences or not she must in no wise betray either of them the latent motherhood in her cried out to protect and to shield them both to spare them both for in this stage of the affair while the hallucinations of deadly feverin a sense mercifullyconfused her its grosser aspects did not present themselves to her mind she wandered through mazes painful enough to tread but far removed from the ugliness of vulgar scandal that her sacred secret for instance might be no more than a secret de polichinelle suspected by many did not so far occur to her believing it to be her exclusive property therefore she inspired by tender cunning strove manfully to keep it so to that end she made play with the purely physical miseries of her indispositionwith shivering fits and scorching flushes cold aching limbs and burning aching head with the manifold distractions of errant blood which leaving her heart empty as a turneddown glass drummed in her ears and throbbed behind her eyeballs these discomforts were severely real enough in all conscience to excuse her for being selfoccupied and a trifle selfish to justify a blank refusal to receive theresa bilson or attempt to retail and discuss the events of yesterday all she craved was quiet to be left alone to lie silent in the quiet light of the covered grey day in the earlier hours of it silver rain showers travelled across the sea to spend themselves tearfully against the panes of her bedroom windows but towards evening the cloud lifted revealing a watery sunset spread in timid reds and yellows behind stone horse head and the curving coastline beyond away to stourmouth and barryport the faint tentative colours struck in long glinting shafts between the trunks and branches of the stone pines and scotch firs in the socalled wildernessa strip of uncultivated land within the confines of the grounds dividing the gardens from the open warren to the westand gleamed in at the windows faintly dyeing the dimity hangings and embroidered linen counterpane of damaris bed throughout the afternoon she had been less restless so that mary fisher judging her to be fairly asleep some five minutes earlier had folded her needlework together and leaving the chair where she sat sewing went softly from the room but that brightening of sunset disturbed damaris bringing her slowly awake for a time she lay watching though but half consciously the tinted radiance asthe trees now stirred by a little wind drawing out of the sunsetit shifted and flitted over the white surfaces at first it pleased her idle fancy but presently distressed her as too thin too chill too restlessly unsubstantial the veriest chippering ghost of colour and of light it affected her with a desolating sadness as of failure of great designs richly attempted but petering out into a pitiful nothingness of love which aped and mimicked being drained of all purpose and splendour of hot blood of partings whose sorrow had lost its savour yet which masqueraded in showy crape for a heartbreak long grown stale and obsolete her temperature rushed up and she threw off the bedclothes raising herself on her elbow while the shafts of thin brightness wavered fitfully through them she saw the photographs of her father step out of their frames again and growing very tall and spare stalk to and fro other figures joined themthose of women her poor dear nannie in the plain quakergrey cotton gown and black silk apron she used to wear even through the breathless hotweather days at the sultanibagh long ago and henrietta pereira too composed and delicately sprightly arrayed in full flounced muslins and fine laces with an exquisiteness of high feminine grace and refinement which had enthralled her baby soul and senses and which held her captive by their charm even yet a handsome highcoloured fullbreasted eurasian girl whom she but dimly recollected was there as well and with these anothercarrying very certainly no hint of things oriental about heran english woman and of the people in dull homely clothing grave of aspect and of bearing yet behind whose statuesque and sternly patient beauty a great flame seemed to quiver offering sharp enough contrast to the frail glintings of the rainwashed sunset amid which she just now moved at sight of the last comer damaris started up tense with wonder and excitement since she knewsomehowthis final visitant belonged not to the past so much as to the present that her power was unexhausted and would go forward to the shaping of the coming years which knowledge drew confirmation from what immediately followed for as by almost imperceptible degrees the brightness faded in the west the figures so mysteriously peopling the room faded out also until only the woman in homely garments was left by her side stood the charcoal drawing of sir charles verity from off the wallor seemed to do so for almost at once damaris saw that dreaded interchange of personality again take place saw the strongly marked features soften in outline the face grow bearded yet younger by full thirty years both the woman and the young man looked searchingly at her and in the eyes of both she read the same questionwhat did she mean to do what to say when her father the object of her adoration came home to her came back to deadham hard i will do right she cried out loud to them in answer only trust me i am so tired and it is all so difficult to believe and to understand but i am trying to understand i shall understand if you will give me time and not hurry me and when i understand indeed indeed you may trust me whatever it costs to do right just then mary opened the door entering quickly and behind her came dr mccabe to find damaris talking talking wildly sitting up parched and vivid with fever in the disordered bed chapter viii telling how two persons of very different moral calibre were compelled to wear the flower of humiliation in their respective buttonholes crosscountry connections by rail were not easy to make with the consequence that sir charles verityhordle guncases bags and portmanteaux in attendancedid not reach the hard until close upon midnight hearing the brougham at last drive up theresa bilson felt rapturously fluttered her course had been notably empty of situations and of adventure drama as in the case of so many ladies of her professionthe pages of fiction notwithstandingconspicuously coldshouldering and giving her the goby now drama and that of richest quality might perhapsfor she admitted the existence of awkward conjunctionsbe said to batter at her door she thought of the miss minetts her everwilling audience she thought alsoas so frequently during the last in some respects extremely unsatisfactory twentyfour hoursof mr rochester and of jane eyre not that she ranged herself with jane socially or as to scholastic attainments in both these as in natural refinement propriety and niceness of ideas she reckoned herself easily to surpass that much canvassed heroine the flavour of the evangelical charityschool adheredincontestably it adhered and that to janes disadvantage no extravagance of protestantism or of applied philanthropy thank heaven clouded theresas early record the genius of tractarianism had rocked her cradle and subsequently ruled her studies with a narrowly complacent pedantry all its own nevertheless in moments of expansion such as the present she felt the parallel between her own case and that of jane did in certain directions romantically hold fortified by thought of the miss minetts agitated interest in all which might befall her she indulged in imaginary conversations with that great proconsul her employerthe theme of which purged of lyrical redundancies reduced itself to the somewhat crude announcement that your daughter yes may alas not impossibly be taken from you but i theresa still remain when however a summons to the presence of the said employer actually reached her the bounce born of imaginary conversations showed a tendency as is its habit basely to desert her and soak clean away she had promised herself a little scene full of respectful solicitude of sympathy discreetly offered and graciously accepted a drawing together through the workings of mutual anxiety leading on to closer intercourse her own breast to put it pictorially that on which the stricken parent should eventually and gratefully lean but in all this she was disappointed for sir charles did not linger over preliminaries he came straight and unceremoniously to the point and that with so cold and lofty a manner that although flutterings remained they parted company with all and any emotions even remotely allied to rapture charles verity stood motionless before the fireplace in the long sittingroom he still wore a heavy frieze travelling coat the fronts of it hanging open his shoulders were a trifle humped up and his head bent as he looked down at the black and buff of the tiger skin at his feet when theresa approached with her jerky consequential little walkpinkly selfconscious behind her goldrimmed glasseshe glanced at her revealing a fiercely careworn countenance but made no movement to shake hands with or otherwise greet her this omission she hardly noticed already growing abject before his magnificencefor thus did his appearance impress herwhich while claiming her enthusiastic admiration enjoined humility rather than the sentimental expansions in which her imaginary conversations had so conspicuously abounded i have seen dr mccabe he began his report of damaris condition is very far from reassuring he tells me her illness presents peculiar symptoms and is grave out of all proportion to its apparent cause this makes me extremely uneasy it is impossible to question her at present she must be spared all exertion and agitation i have not attempted to see her yet he paused while anger towards her expupil waxed warm in theresa once again for the pause was eloquent as his voice had been when speaking about his daughter of a depth of underlying tenderness which filled his hearer with envy i must therefore ask you miss bilson he presently went on to give me a detailed account of all that took place yesterday it is important i should know exactly what occurred whereat theresa perceiving pitfalls alike in statement and in suppression of fact hesitated and gobbled to the near neighbourhood of positive incoherence while admitting and trying to avoid admitting how inconveniently ignorant of precise details she herself was perhaps i erred in not more firmly insisting upon an immediate enquiry she said but at the time alarm appeared so totally uncalled for i assumed from what was told me and from my knowledge of the strength of damaris constitution that a nights rest would fully restore her to her usual robust state of health and so deferred my enquiry the servants were excited and upset so i felt their account might be misleadingall they said was so confused so far from explicit my position was most difficult sir charles she assured him and incidentally also assured herself i encountered most trying opposition which made me feel it would be wiser to wait until this morning by then i hoped the maids would have had time to recollect themselves and recollect what is becoming towards their superiors in the way of obedience and respect charles verity threw back his head with a movement of impatience and looked down at her from under his eyelidsin effect weary and a little insolent we seem to be at cross purposes miss bilson he said you do not i think quite follow my question i did not ask for the servants account of the events of yesterdaywhatever those events may have beenbut for your own ah it is so unfortunate so exceedingly unfortunate theresa broke out literally wringing her hands but a contingency an accident which i could not possibly have foreseeni cannot but blame damaris sir charles indeed he said no truly i cannot but blame her for wilfulness if she had consentedas i so affectionately urgedto join the choir treat to harchester this painful incident would have been spared us am i to understand that you went to harchester leaving my daughter here alone her going would have given so much pleasure in the parish theresa pursued dodging the question with the ingenuity of one who scents mortal danger her refusal would i knew cause sincere disappointment i could not bring myself to accentuate that disappointment not that i of course am of any importance save as coming from this house asasin some degree your delegate sir charles indeed he said yes indeed theresa almost hysterically repeated for hereif anywherewas her chance as she recognized never again might she be thus near to him alone with himthe normal routine made it wholly improbableand at midnight too for the unaccustomed lateness of the hour undoubtedly added to her ferment provoking in her obscure and novel hopes and hungers hence she blindly andher action viewed from a certain anglequite heroically precipitated herself heroically because the odds were hopelessly adverse her equipment whether of natural or artificial being so conspicuously slender her attempt had no backing in play of feature felicity of gesture grace of diction the commonest little actress that ever daubed her skin with greasepaint would have the advantage of theresa in the thousand and one arts by which from everlasting woman has limed twigs for the catching of man her very virtuesrespectability learning all the proprieties of her narrowly virtuous little lifecounted for so much against her in the present supreme moment of her selfinvented romance you hardly i dare say she pursuedhow should you after the commanding positions you have occupiedappreciate the feelings of the inhabitants of this quiet country parish towards you but they have a lively sense believe me of the honour you confer upon them all and severallyi am speaking of the educated classes in particular of courseby residing among them they admire and reverence you so much so genuinely and they have extended great kindness to me as a member of your household how can i be indifferent to it i am thankful sir charles i am gratefulthe more so that i have the happiness of knowing i owe the consideration with which i am treated in deadham entirely to youyes yes she cried in rising exaltation i do not deny that i went to harchester yesterdaywentdr horniblow thus expressed it when inviting meas representing the hard i was away when damaris made this illjudged excursion across the river to the bar had she confided her intention to me i should have used my authority and forbade her but recently we have not been i grieve to say on altogether satisfactory terms and our parting yesterday was constrained i am afraid theresa blushed and swallowed fortunately her sense of humour was limited but even so she could not but be aware of a dangerous decline not only of bathos but of vulgar bathos from which gentility revolted must she be the exponent thanks to damaris indiscretion you require me to give you the details sir charles she resumed and although it is both embarrassing and repugnant to me to do so i obey i fear damaris so far forgot herselfforgot i mean what is due to her age and positionas to remove her shoes and stockings and paddle in the seaa most unsuitable and childish occupation while she was thus engaged her thingsher shoes and stockingsappear to have been stolen in any case she was unable to find them when tired of the amusement she came up on to the beach moreover she was caught in the rain and i deeply regret to tell youbut i merely repeat what i learned from mary fisher and mrs cooper when i returnedit was not till after dark when the maids had become so alarmed that they despatched tolling and alfred to search for her that damaris landed from a boat at the breakwater having been brought down the riverbyby throughout the earlier portion of her recital charles verity stood in the same place and same attitude staring down at the tiger skin twice or thrice only he raised his eyes looking at the speaker with a flash of arrogant interrogation upon one even but moderately versed in the secular arts of twigliming such flashes would have acted as an effective warning and deterrent not so upon theresa she barely noticed them as blindly heroic she pounded along leading her piteous forlorn hope her chanceher unique chance in nowise to be missedand still more those obscure hungers fed by the excitement of this midnight teteatete rushed her forward upon the abyss while at every sputtering sentence whether of adulation misplaced prudery or thinly veiled animosity towards damaris she became more tedious more frankly intolerable and ridiculous to him whose favour she so desperately sought under less anxious circumstances charles verity might have been contemptuously amused at this exhibition of futile ardour now it exasperated him yet he waited in rather cruel patience presently he would demolish her if to do so appeared worth the trouble meanwhile she should have her say since incidentally he might learn something from it bearing upon the cause of damaris illness but now when at the climax of her narrative theresaseized by a spasm of retrospective resentment and jealousy the picture of the young man carrying the girl tenderly in his arms across the dusky lawns arising before herchoked and her voice cracked up into a batlike squeaking charles veritys selfimposed forbearance ran dry i must remind you that neither my time nor capacity of listening are inexhaustible miss bilson he said to her may i ask you to be so good as to come to the point by whom was damaris rescued and brought home last night ah that is what i so deeply regret theresa quavered still obstinately dense and struggling with the after convulsion of her choke i felt so shocked and annoyed on your account sir charles when the maids told me knowing how you would disapprove such asuch an incident in connection with damarisshe was brought home carriedshe pausedcarried indoors by the owner of that objectionable publichouse on the island he holds some position in the mercantile marine i believe i have seen him recently once or twice myself in the villagehis name is faircloth theresa pursed up her lips as she finished speaking the glasses of her gold pincenez seemed to gleam aggressively in the lamplight the backs of the leatherbound volumes in the many bookcases gleamed also but unaggressively with the mellow sheenas might fancifully be figuredof the ripe and tolerant wisdom their pages enshrined the pearlgrey porcelain company of chinese monsters saints and godlings ranged above them placid mysteriously smiling gleamed as well for a time silence along with these various gleamings sensibly even a little uncannily held possession of the room then charles verity moved stiffly and for once awkwardly all of a piece backed against the mantelshelf throwing his right arm out along it sharply and heavilycareless of the safety of clock and of ornamentsas though overtaken by sudden weakness and seeking support faircloth of course his name is faircloth he repeated absently yes of course but whatever the nature of the weakness assailing him it soon apparently passed he stood upright his face perhaps a shade more colourless and lean but in expression fully as arrogant and formidably calm as before very well miss bilson he began you have now given me all the information i require so i need detain you no longersave to say thisyou will if you please consider your engagement as my daughters companion terminated concluded from tonight you are free to make such arrangements as may suit you and you will i trust pardon my adding that i shall be obliged by your making them without undue delay you do not mean theresa broke out after an interval of speechless amazementsir charles you cannot mean that you dismiss methat i am to leave the hardtoto go away i mean that i have no further occasion for your services theresa waved her arms as though playing some eccentric game of ball you forget the servants the conduct of the house damaris need of a chaperon her still unfinished educationall are dependent upon me hardly dependent he answered these things i have reason to think can safely be trusted to other hands or be equally safely be left to take care of themselves but why do you repudiate me she cried again rushing upon her fate in the bitterness of her distraction what have i done to deserve such harshness and humiliation i gave the most precious of my possessionsdamarisinto your keeping andandwellwe see the result is it not written large enough in all conscience for the most illiterate to readso you must depart my dear miss bilson and for everyones sake the sooner the better there can be no further discussion of the matter pray accept the fact that our interview is closed but theresa now sensible that her chance was in act of being finally ravished away from her fellor roseperhaps more truly the latterinto an extraordinary sincerity and primitiveness of emotion she cast aside nothing less than her whole personal legend cast aside every tradition and influence hitherto so strictly governing her conduct and her thought unluckily the physical envelope could not so readily be got rid of matter retained its original mould and that one neither seductive nor poetic she went down upon her fat little knees held her fat little hands aloft as in an impassioned spontaneity of worship sir charles she prayed while tears running down her full cheeks splashed upon her protuberant bosomsir charles he looked at the funny tubby jaunty wouldbe smart kneeling figure oh you inconceivably foolish woman he said and turned away did more than thatwalked out into the hall and to his own rooms opening off the corridor in the offices a bell tinkled theresa scrambled on to her feet just as hordle in response to its summons arrived at the sittingroom door did you ring miss he asked grudgingly less than ever was she in favour with the servants hall tonight past intelligible utterance theresa merely shook her head in reply made a return upon herselfbegan to instruct him to put out the lamps in the room remembered that now and henceforth the right to give orders in this house was no longer hers and broke into sobbing the sound of which her handkerchief pressed against her mouth quite failed to stifle about an hour later having bathed and changed sir charles verity made his way upstairs upon the landing dr mccabe met him better he said thank the heavenly powers decidedly better temperature appreciably lower and the pulse more even oh were on the road very handsomely to get top dog of the devil this bout believe me sir charles then go to bed my dear fellow the other answered i will take over the rest of the watch for you you need not be afraid i can be an admirable sicknurse on occasion and by the way mccabe something has come to my knowledge which in my opinion throws considerable light upon the symptoms that have puzzled you probably i shall be more sure of my facts before morning i will explain to you later if it should seem likely to be helpful to you in your treatment of the case just now as i see it the matter lies exclusively between mehe smiled looking at his companion full and steadilybetween mehe repeated and my only child all which upon the face of it might surely be voted encouraging enough yet should there be any that doubt the veritable existence of hell fire the doctor told himself as he subsequently and thankfully pulled on his nightshirt to recover them and in double quick time of their heresy let em but look in my friend veritys eyesand he rounded off the sentence with an oath chapter ix an experiment in bridgebuilding of which time alone can fix the values damaris lay on her side her face turned to the wall when charles verity quietly crossing the room sat down in an easy chair so placed at the head of the halftester bed as to be screened from it by the dimity curtains she sighed and slightly shifted her position leaning back he crossed his legs and let his chin drop on his breast he had barely glanced at her in passing receiving a vague impression of the outline of her cheek of her neck and shoulders of her head dark against the dim whiteness on which it rested and the long dark stream of her hair spread loose across the pillows he had no wish for recognitionnot yet awhile on the contrary it was a relief to have time in which silently to get accustomed to her presence to steep himself in the thought of her before speech should define the new element intruded as he believed into his and her relation though little enoughtoo little so said some of his criticshampered by fear in any department he consciously dreaded the smallest modification of that relation among the many dissatisfactions and bitternesses of life it shone forth with a steady light of purity and sweetness as a thing unspoiled unbreathed on even by what is ignoble or base and not the surface of it alone was thus free from all breath of defilement it showed clear right through as some gem of the purest water to keep it thus inviolate he had made sacrifices in the past neither easy nor inconsiderable to a man of his temperament and ambitions hence that its perfection should be now endangered was to him the more exquisitely hateful upon the altar of that hatred promptly without scruple he sacrificed the wretched theresa most of us are so constituted that at a certain pass pleasureof a sortis to be derived from witnessing the anguish of a fellow creature in all save the grossly degenerate that pleasure however is shortlived reflection follows in which we cut to ourselves but a sorry figure with charles verity reflection began to follow before he had spent many minutes in damaris sickroom for here the atmosphere was at once grave and tender beautifully honest in its innocence of the things of the fleshthe woman had been inconceivably foolish from every point of view if she had known good heavens if she had only known but he inclined now to the more merciful view that veritably she didnt know that her practical even her theoretic knowledge was insufficient for her to have had any clear design it was just a blind push of starved animal instinct of course she must go her remaining in the house was in every way unpermissible still he need not perhaps have been so coldbloodedly precipitate with her anyhow the thing was doneit was donehe raised his shoulders and making with his hands a graphic gesture of dismissal let his chin drop on to his breast again for the east had left its mark on his attitude towards women with one exceptionthat of his daughtercharles verity like most men not requiring of himself to be too rigidly consistent hence theresa and all which pertained to her even her follies appeared to him of contemptibly small moment compared with the developments for which those follies might be held accidentally responsible his mind returned to that main theme painfully he envisaged it in all its bearings not sparing himself suffered and looked on at his own suffering with a stoicism somewhat sardonic meanwhile damaris slept his nearness had not disturbed her indeed he might rather suppose its effect beneficent for her breathing grew even just sweetly and restfully audible in the intervals of other sounds reaching him from out of doors the wind drawing out of the sunset freshened during the night now it blew wet and gustily from southwest sighing through the pines and scotch firs in the wilderness a strand of the yellow banksia rose trained against the house wall breaking loose scratched and tapped at the windowpanes with anxious appealing little noises many years had elapsed since charles verity spent a night upstairs in this part of the house and by degrees those outdoor sounds attracted his attention as intimately familiar they carried him back to his boyhood to the spacious dreams and projects of adolescence he could remember just such gusty wet winds swishing through the trees such petulant fingering of errant creepers upon the windows when he stayed here during the holidays from school at harchester on furlough from his regiment and later on long leave from india during his wonderful little greatuncles lifetime and his thought took a lighter and friendlier vein recalling that polished polite encyclopedic minded and witty gentleman who had lived to within a few months of his full century with a maximum of interest and entertainment to himself and a minimum of injury or offence to others to the last he retained his freshness of intellectual outlook his insatiable yet discreet curiosity taking it as a whole should his life be judged a singularly futile or singularly enviable one nothing feminine save on strictly platonic lines was recorded to have entered it at any period did that argue remarkable wisdom or defective courage or some abnormal element in a composition otherwise deliciously mundane and human charles had debated this often even as a boy it had puzzled him as a young man he had held his own views on the subject not without lasting effect for one winter he had passed at the hard in the fine bodily health and vigour of his early thirties this very lack of womens society contributed by not unnatural reaction to force the idea of woman hauntingly upon himthereby making possible a strange and hidden love passage off the dead sea fruit of which he was in process of supping here tonight he moved bent forward setting his elbows on the two chair arms closing his eyes as he listened and leaning his forehead upon his raised hands for in the plaintive voice of the moist fitful southwesterly wind how to his bearing the buried halfforgotten drama relived and reenacted itself it dated far back to a period when his career was still undetermined hedged about by doubts and uncertaintiesbefore the magnificent and terrible years of the mutiny brought him not only fame and distinction but a power of selfexpression and of plain seeingbefore too his not conspicuously happy marriage before the bhutpur appointment tested and confirmed his reputation as a most able if most autocratic ruler before finally his term of service under the ameer in afghanistanthat extraordinary experience of alternate good and evil fortune in barbaric internecine warfare the methods and sentiments of which represented a swing back of three or four centuries christianity and the attitude of mind and conduct christianity inculcates no longer an even nominal factor mahomet sword in hand ruthlessly outriding christ he had done largely more than the average englishman of his age and station towards the making of contemporary history yet it occurred to him now sitting at damaris bedside those intervening years of strenuous public activity of soldiering and of administration along with the honours reaped in them had procured cynically less substantial result cynically less ostensible remainder than the brief and hidden intrigue which preceded them they sank away as water spilt on sandthus in his present pain he pictured itleaving barely a trace while that fugitive and unlawful indulgence of the flesh not only begot flesh but spirita living soul henceforth and eternally to be numbered among the imperishable generations of the tragic and marvellous children of men then aware something stirred close to him charles verity looked up sharply turning his head to find damarisraised on one elbow planted among the pillowsholding aside the dimity curtain and gazing wonderingly yet contentedly in his face commissioner sahib she said softly i didnt know youd come back ive had horrid bad dreams and seemed to see youmany of youwalking about the room was full of you you over and over again but not like yourself frightening not loving me busy about something or somebody else i didnt at all enjoy thatbut i am awake now arent i i neednt be frightened any more because you do love me dont youand this really is you your very ownself she put up her face to be kissed but he in obedience to an humility heretofore unfelt by and unknown to him leaning sideways kissed the hand holding aside the curtain rather than the proffered lips yes my darling very surely it is me he said any multiplication of specimens is quite superfluousa single example of the breed is enough conceivably more than enough but to his distress while he spoke he saw the content die out of damaris expression and her eyes grow distended and startled she glanced oddly at the hand he had just kissed and then at him again it seems to me something must have happened which i cant exactly remember she anxiously told him sitting upright and leaving go the curtain which slipped back into place shutting off the armchair and its occupant something real i mean not just bad dreams i know i had to ask you about it and yet i didnt want to ask you charles verity rose from his place slowly walked the length of the room and presently returning stood at the foot of the bed damaris still sat upright her hands clasped her hair hanging in a cloud about her to below the waist the light was low and the shadow cast by the bedcurtain covered her but through it he could still distinguish the startled anxiety of her great eyes as she pondered trying to seize and hold some memory which escaped her and he felt sick at heart assured it could be but a matter of time before she remembered convinced now moreover what she would to his shame and sorrow remember in the end the purity in which he delighted and to which he so frequently and almost superstitiously had turned for refreshment and the safeguarding of all the finest instincts of his own very complex nature would although she remembered remain essentially intact but even so the surface of it must be as he apprehended henceforth in some sort dimmed and that by the breath of his own long ago misdoing the revelation of passion and of sex being practically and thus intimately forced home on her the transparent innocence of childhood must inevitably pass away from her and through that same passing she would consciously go forward embracing the privileges and the manifold burdens the physical and emotional needs and aspirations of a grown woman the woman might wouldsuch was his firm beliefprove a glorious creature but it was not she whom he wanted her development in proportion as it was rich and complete led her away from and made her independent of himno it wasnt she but the child whom he wanted and standing at the foot of damaris bed he knew with a cruel certainty he was there just simply to watch the child die yes it was a mere matter of time sooner or later she would put a leading questionher methods being bravely candid and direct of course it was open to him to meet that question with blank denial open to him to lieas is the practice of the world when such damnably awkward situations come alonga solution having in the present case the specious argument behind it that in so doing he would spare her save her pain in addition to the obvious one that he would save his own skin moreover if he lied he could trust damaris loyalty whether she believed it or not she would accept his answer as final no further question upon the subject would ever pass her lips the temptation was definite and great for might not the lie if he could stomach his disgust at telling it even serve to prolong the life of the child should he not sell his honour to save his honourif it came to that thus he debated his nature battling with itself while at that battle he stoically for a time looked on but when at last the climax was reached and damaris commenced to speak stoicism dragged anchor for he could conquer neither his disgust nor his sorrow could find courage neither for his denial nor for watching the child die leaving the foot of the bed he went and sat down in the armchair where the dimity curtain screened damaris from his and him from damaris sight commissioner sahib she began her voice grave and low it has come back to methe thing i had to ask you but it is very hard to say if it makes you angry please try to forgive mebecause it does hurt me to ask you it hurts me through and through only i cant speak of it i oughtnt just to leave it to leave it would be wrongwrong by you very well my darling ask me then he said a little hoarsely you have heard about my being out on the bar andand all that yes he said i have heard captain faircloth who found me and brought me home told me something damaris voice broke into tones of imploring tenderness i love you commissioner sahib you know how i love youbutbut is what captain faircloth told me true whereupon temptation surged up anew inviting inciting charles verity to liedressing up that lie in the cloak of most excellent charity of veritable duty towards damaris fine courage and her precious innocence and he hedged keeping open if only for a few minutes longer the way of escape how can i answer until i know what he did tell you he took her up at last almost coldly that he is your sonis my brother damaris said even at this pass charles verity waited before finally committing himself thereby unwittingly giving sentimentin the shape of the powers of the airthe chance to take a rather unfairly extensive hand in the game for while he thus waited he could not but be aware through the tense silence otherwise reigning in the room of the tap and scratch of the rosespray upon the windowpanes of the swish of the moist gusty wind sweeping from across the saltmarsh and mudflats of the havenfrom the black cottages too beyond the warren gathered as somewhat sinister boon companions about the bleak grey stonebuilt inn and this served to transfix his consciousness with visions of what once had beenhe knowing so exactly how it would all sound all look out there the wistful desolation the penetrating appeal bred of the inherent sadness of the place on a wild autumn night such as this yes he said at last and putting a great constraint upon himself he spoke calmly without sign of emotion what the young man told is true damaris perfectly true ii thought so she answered back gravely though i didnt understandand after a moments pause with a certain hopelessness of resignationthough i dont understand even now in her utterance charles verity so distinctly heard the last words of theto himdying child that smitten with raging bitterness of grief and of regret he said nevertheless it is in my opinion disgraceful abominable that he should have made the occasion or to put the matter at its best have taken advantage of the occasion when you were alone and in a sense at his mercy to tell you this most unhappy thing no no damaris cried in her generous eagerness catching back the curtain and looking at him nobly unselfconscious nobly zealous to defend and to set right you mustnt think that he didnt start with any intention of telling me he fancied i might have lost my way among the sandhills that i might be frightened or get some harm and so came straight to look for me and take care of me he was very beautifully kind and i felt beautifully safe with himsafe in the same way i feel safe with you almost her mouth was soft her eyes alightdangerously alight now for her pulse had quickened as she pleaded and protested her temperature raced up it happened later she went on when we were in the boat and it was partly my fault he wrapped my feet up in his coat they were very cold and he believed i was asleep because i didnt speak or thank him i was so tired and everything seemed so strange i couldnt rouse myself somehow to speak and as he wrapped them in his coat he kissed my feet thinking i shouldnt know but i wasnt asleep and it displeased me i felt angry just as you felt when you condemned him just now ah as i felt just now he commented closing his eyes and just perceptibly bowing his head yes commissioner sahib as you felt just nowbut as please you mustnt go on feelingwhat he had done seemed to me treacherous and it pained as well as displeased me but in all that i was unjust and mistakenand it was then because he saw hed pained me displeased and made me angry that he told me in selfdefencetold me to show he wasnt treacherous but had the righta right no one else in all the world has over me except yourself and you believed this young man you forgave his audacity and admitted his right sir charles said he leaned back in the angle of the chair away from her smiling as he spokea smile which both bade farewell and mocked at the sharpness and futility of the grief which that farewell brought with it for this was a grown woman who pleaded with him surely acting as advocate a child compelled to treat such controversial such debatable matters at all would have done so to a different rhythm in a different spirit forgave him but after just the first when i had time to at all think of it damaris answered with rather desperate bravery i couldnt see there was anything for me to forgive it was the other way about for havent i so much which he might very well feel belonged or should have belonged to him you cut deep my dear sir charles said quietly still holding back the curtain with one hand damaris flung herself over upon her face she would not give way she would not cry but her soul was in travail these words as coming from her father were anguish to her she could look at him no longer and lying outstretched thus the lines of her gracious body moulded by the embroidered linen quilt quivered from head to heel still that travail of soul should bring forth fruit she would not give in cost what anguish it might till all was said i only want to do what is right she cried her voice half stifled by the pillows you know surely you know how i love you commissioner sahib from morning till night and round till morning again always and above all ever since i can first remember but this is different to anything that has ever happened to me before and it wouldnt be right not to speak about it it would be there all the time and it would creep in between usbetween you and meand interfere in all my thinking about you it may very well do that in any case my dear he said nono damaris answered hotly not if i do right nowright by both for you must not entertain wrong ideas about himabout captain faircloth i mean you must not suppose he said a word about my having what might or ought to be his he couldnt do so he isnt the least that sort of person he took pains to make me understandi couldnt think why at first it seemed a little like boastingthat he is quite well off and that hes very proud of his profession he doesnt want anything fromfrom us oh no she cried no and in her excitement damaris raised herself from the small of her back resting on her elbows sphinxlike in posture her hands and armsfrom the elbowsstretched out in front of her across the pillows her face was flushed her eyes blazed there was storm and vehemence in her young beauty nohes too much like you you yourself commissioner sahib to want anything to accept anything from other people he means to act for himself and make people and things obey him just as you yourself do and she went on with a daring surely not a little magnificent under the circumstanceshe told me he loved life too well to care very much how he came by it to begin with damaris folded her arms let her head sink on them as she finished speaking and lay flat thus her face hidden while she breathed short and raspingly struggling to control the after violence of her emotion the curtain hung straight the wind took up its desolate chant again and sir charles verity sat back in the angle of the armchair motionless and for the present speechless in truth he was greatly moved stirred to the deep places of perception and of conscience also for this death of childhood and birth of womanhood undoubtedly presented a rare and telling spectacle which even while it rent him in some aspects enraged and mortified him he still appreciated he found indeed a strangely vital if somewhat cruel satisfaction in looking on at ita satisfaction fed on its more humane and human side by the testimony to the worth of the unknown son by the so wellbeloved daughter respecting himself he might have cause for shame but respecting these two beings for whose existencewhether born in wedlock or out of ithe was responsible he had no cause for shame in his first knowledge of them as seen together they showed strong generous sure of purpose a glamour of high romance in their adventitious meeting and companionship this was the first the unworldly and perhaps deepest view of the matter in it charles verity allowed himself to rest inactive for a space that there were not one but many other views of the said matter very differently attuned and coloured he was perfectly well aware soon these would leap on him and that with an ugly clamour which he consciously turned from in repulsion and weary disgust for he was very tired as he now realized the anxiety endured during his tedious crosscountry journey the distasteful tragiccomedy of the scene de seduction so artlessly made him by unlucky theresa bilsen followed by this prolonged vigil lastly the very real tragedyfor such it in great measure remained and must remainof his interview with damaris and the reliving of long buried drama that interview entailed left him mentally and physically spent he fell away into meditation mournful as it was indefinite while the classic lament of another age and race formed itself silently upon his lips comprehenderunt me iniquitates meae et non potui ut viderem multiplicatae sunt super capillos capitis mei et cor meum dereliquit me he quoted in the plenitude of his existing discouragement at his time of life he told himself earth held no future and in heavenas the churches figure itnamely an adjustment of the balance on the other side death his belief was of the smallest a sea of uncertainty vast limitless laps the shores of the meagre island of the presentwhich is all we actually have to our count faith is a giftyou possess it or you possess it not yet without it but here his attention was caught and brought home to that very present by a movement upon the bed and damaris voice asking tremulously commissioner sahib are you angry too angry to speak to me whereupon charles verity got up gathered back the curtain stuffing it in between the head board and the wall and stood tall spare yet graceful looking down at her whether from fatigue or from emotion his expression was softer his face less keen than usual and the likeness between him and darcy faircloth proportionately and notably great no my dear he said why should i be angry what conceivable right have i to be angry as a man sows so does he reap i only reap today what i sowed eight or nineandtwenty years agoa crop largely composed of tares though among those tares i do find some modicum of wheat upon that modest provision of wheat i must make shift to subsist with the best grace i may no dont cry my darling it is useless tears never yet altered facts you will only do yourself harm and put a crown to my selfreproach he sat down on the side of the bed taking her hand holding and coaxing it only let there be no doubt or suspicion on your part my dear he went on as you have travelled so far along this dolorous way take courage and travel a little farther to stop to turn back is only to leave your mind open to all manner of imaginations worse very likely than the truth i will be quite plain with you this episodewhich i do not attempt to explain or excusetook place and ended several years before i first met your mother and it ended absolutely never by either written or spoken word have i held any communication with lesbia faircloth since never have i attempted to see herthis in the interests of her reputation every bit as much as in those of my own for her station in life she was a woman of remarkable qualities and character she had made an ugly a repulsive marriage and she was childlessmore than this it is not seemly i should tell you charles verity waited a minute or so he still coaxed damaris hand calmly soothingly and she lay very still watching him but with halfclosed eyes striving to prevent the tears which asked so persistently to be shed for her heart went out to him in a new and overflowing tenderness in an exalted pity almost maternal never had she felt him more attractive more in a sense royally lovable than in this hour of weariness of moral nakedness and humiliation not until i had rejoined my regiment in india he presently continued in the same low even tones did i hear of the birth of her son i have never seen himor made enquiries regarding him i meant to let the dead bury its dead in this matter for everyone concerned it seemed best and wisest so therefore all you have told me tonight comes as news to meand in some respects as good news for i gather i have no reason to be ashamed of this young manwhich on your account even more than on my own is so much clear gainbut i oughtnt to have brought you here to live at deadham i ought to have taken the possibility of some accidental revelation such as the present one into serious account and saved you from that to expose you however remotely to the risk was both callous and stupid on my part i own i have a strong sentiment for this house it seemed natural and restful to return to itthe only house to call a home i have ever had and so much has happened during the last eight or nineandtwenty years to occupy my mind that i had grown indifferent and had practically forgotten the risks this was selfish selfindulgent lacking in consideration and reverence towards you towards your peace of mind your innocenceand for it my darling i beg your forgiveness damaris sat up in the bed raised her face to be kissed nono she implored him dont say that i cant bear to have you say itto have you speak as if you had been could ever be anything but beautiful and perfect towards me i cant have you not even for a little minute step down from the high place which is your own and talk of forgiveness it hurts mei begin to understand that your world a mans world is different to my worldthe world i mean in which i have been brought up i know what is right for myselfbut it would be silly to believe mine is the only rightness ah charles verity murmured under his breath alas for the child that is dead and leaning forward he kissed her lips chapter x telling how miss felicia verity unsuccessfully attempted a rescue with the assistance of the miss minetts reinforced by a bribe of five shillings theresa bilson procured a boy on a bicycle early the following morning to convey a note the twelve miles to paulton lacymr augustus cowdens fine georgian mansion situate just within the southern boundaries of arnewood forest miss felicia verity to whom the note was addressed still enjoyed the hospitality of her sister and brotherinlaw but this as mrs cowden gave her roundly to understand must not be taken to include erratic demands upon the stables if she required unexpectedly to visit her brother or her niece at deadham hard she must contrive to do so by train and by such hired conveyances as the wayside station of paulton halt at this end of her journey and of marychurch at the other might be equal to supplying in my opinion felicia it is quite ridiculous you should attempt to go there at all today mrs cowden giving over for the moment her study of the morning post commandingly told her if damaris has got a cold in her head through some imprudence and if charles has called miss bilson over the coals for not being more strict with her that really is no reason why augustus and my plans for the afternoon should be set aside or why you should be out in the rain for hours with your rheumatism i shall not even mention the subject to augustus we arranged to drive over to napworth for tea and i never let anything interfere with my engagements to the bulparcs as you know i encourage augustus to see as much as possible of his own peoplei have no doubt in my own mind that the account of damaris illness is absurdly exaggerated you know how charles spoils her she has very much too much freedom and little miss bilson though wellmeaning is incapable of coping with a headstrong girl like damaris she oughtdamaris ought i meanto have been sent to a finishing school for another year at least she might then have found her level if charles had consulted me or shown the least willingness to accept my advice i should have insisted upon the finishing school it would have been immensely to damaris advantage i have known all along that the haphazard methods of her education were bound to have deplorable resultsbut look here felicia if you really intend to go on this wildgoosechase notwithstanding the rain let the boy who brought the note order davis fly for you on his way back he passes paulton halt i shall not expect you before dinner tonight now that is settled with which she returned to her interrupted study of the morning post the above pronouncement while rendering felicia verity somewhat uneasy in nowise turned her from her purpose her powers of sympathy were as unlimited as they were confused and too often ineffective forever she ran after the tribulations of her fellow creatures pouring forth on them treasures of eager sympathy but without discrimination as to whether the said tribulations were in fact trivial or profound deserving or deserved that anyone under any circumstances should suffer be uncomfortable or unhappy filled her with solicitude the loss of an eyelash the loss of a fortune the loss of the hope of a lifetime equally ranked illness and disease appealed to her in hardly less degree than unfortunate affairs of the heart she practised the detection of extenuating circumstances as one might practise a fine art she wallowed in sentiment in short but that with such native goodbreeding and singleness of mind as went far to redeem the said wallowings from morbidity or other offence her friends and acquaintances loved her quite unconscionably made use of her secretly laughed at her grew weary of her declared that of such are the kingdom of heaven and having successfully exploited her turned with relief to the society of persons frankly belonging to the kingdoms of earth men petted but did not propose to her affected to confide in her but carefully withheld the heart of their confessions tall thin gently hurried and birdlike she yet bore a quaint almost mirthful resemblance to her brother sir charles verity such was the lady who responded in a spirit of liveliest charity to theresas wildly waved flag of distress by the time miss verity reached marychurch the rain amounted to a veritable downpour driven by the southwesterly wind it swept in sheets over the lowlying country the pallid waters drab mudflats dingy greygreen saltmarsh and rusty brown reedbeds of the estuary the dusty road running alongside this last through the hamlets of horny cross and lampit grew hourly deeper in gritty mud beyond question summer and all its dear delights were departed and the chill mournfulness of autumn reigned in their stead with the surrounding mournfulness miss veritys simple yet devious mind played not ungratefully for it seemed to her to harmonize with the true inwardness of her mission offering a sympathetic background to the news of her nieces indisposition and the signals of distress flown by her little protegee theresa bilson the note addressed to her by the latter was couched in mysterious and ambiguous phrases the purport of which she failed to grasp theresas handwriting usually so neat and precise was wobbly bearing unmistakable traces of severe agitation and haste she hinted at nothing short of catastrophe though whether in relation to herself to her expupil or to sir charles miss verity couldnt for the life of her discover it was clear in any case however that affairs at the hard had for cause unknown gone quite startlingly astray and that theresa found herself entirely unequal to righting themhence her outcry under these circumstances it struck miss verity as only tasteful and tactful that her approach to the distracted dwelling should take place unheralded by rumble of wheels or beat of horsehoofs should be pitched in a so to speak strictly modest and minor key on arriving at the front gate she therefore alighted and bidding her grumpy and streaming flyman take himself and his frousty landau to the bell and horns in deadham village there to await her further orders proceeded to walk up the carriagedrive under the swaying dripping trees about fifty yards from the gate the drive turns sharply to the left and just at the turn miss verity suddenly beheld a tall figure clad in a seamans oilskins and souwester coming towards her from the direction of the house youth and good looksmore especially perhaps masculine oneswhatever rank of life might exhibit them acted as a sure passport to miss veritys gentle heart and the youth and good looks of the man approaching her became momentarily more incontestable his bearing too notwithstanding the clumsiness of his shiny black overgarment had a slightly ruffling gallantly insolent air to it eminently calculated to impress her swift and indulgent fancy the young man on his part calmly took stock of her appearance as she beat up against the wind her flapping waterproof cloak giving very inefficient protection to the rather girlish dovegrey cashmere dress picked out with pink embroidery beneath it at first his eyes challenged hers in slightly defiant and amused enquiry but as she smiled back at him sweetly eager ingenuously benignant his glance softened and his hand went up to his souwester with a courteous gesture what weather she exclaimed how fearfully wetwhile her expression testified to a flattering interest and admiration yes its a wild day he said in answer i expect weve seen the last of the sun anyhow for this week the incident though of the most casual and briefest gave a new direction to miss veritys thought it pleased and intrigued her bringing a pretty blush to her thin cheeks who and what can he be she said to herself where can i have seen him before and the blush deepened i must really describe him to charles and find out who he is this monologue brought her as far as the front door at which it may be added shethough by no means impatientdid in point of fact ring twice before the manservant answered it although mr hordle had the reputation of being fond of his joke in private life in his official capacity his manner offered a model of middleaged sedateness and restraint today neither humour nor reserve were in evidence but a harassed and hunted look altogether surprising to miss verity he stared at her stared past her along the drive before attempting to usher her into the hall and relieve her of her umbrella and her cloak sir charles doesnt expect me hordle she said but hearing miss damaris was unwell i came over from paulton lacy at once quite so maam sir charles has not left his room yet he did not reach home till late and he sat up with miss damaris the rest of the night oh deardid he then of course i wouldnt disturb him on any account hordle i had better see miss bilson first will you tell her i am here i can send laura to enquire maam but i doubt if miss bilson will care to come downstairs at present she is with miss damaris no maam miss bilson is not with miss damaris hordle paused impressively sucking in his under lip if i might presume to advise maam i think it would be wise you should see miss bilson in the schoolroomand go up by the back staircase maam if you dont object so as to avoid passing miss damaris bedroom door i should not presume to suggest it maam but that our orders as to quiet are very strict in this somewhat ignominious method of reaching her objective miss verity although more and more mystified amiably acquiescedto be greeted when hordle throwing open the schoolroom door formally announced her by a sound closely resembling a shriek entrenched behind a couple of yawning trunks a litter of feminine apparel and of personal effectsthe accumulation of a long term of years for she was an inveterate hoarderencumbering every available surface the carpet included theresa bilson stood as at bay my dear friend miss verity exclaimed advancing with kindly outstretched handswhat is the meaning of thisshe looked at the miscellaneous turnout of cupboards and chests of drawers at the display of garments not usually submitted to the public gaze are you preparing a rummage sale or are youbut no surely notare you packing i cannot describe how anxious i am to hear what has occurred my sister mrs cowden was extremely adverse to my facing the bad weather but i felt your note could only be answered in person let me hear everything she drew theresa from behind the luggage entrenchments and putting aside an assortment of derelict hats and artificial flowers strewn in most admired confusion on the sofa made her sit down upon the said piece of furniture beside her whereupon in the pensive rainwashed midday light which served to heighten rather than mitigate the prevailing very unattractive and rather stuffy disorder obtaining in the room theresa bilson not without chokings and lamentations gave forth the story of herto herself quite spectaculardeposition from the command of the hard and its household she had sufficiently recovered her normal attitude by this time to pose to herself now as a heroine of one of charlotte brontes novels now as a milder and more refined sample of injured innocence culled from the pages of charlotte yonge a narrow purely personal view inevitably embodies an order of logic calculated to carry conviction and theresa even in defeat retained a degree of selfopinionated astuteness she presented her case effectively to be discharged and that in disgrace to be rendered homeless cast upon the world at a moments notice for that whichwith but trifling almost unconscious manipulation of factcould be made to appear as nothing worse than a venial error of judgment did really sound and seem most unduly drastic punishment miss veritys first instinct was to fling herself into the breech and directly her brother emerged from his room demand for her protegee redress and reinstatement her second instinct wasshe didnt in truth quite know whatfor she grew sadly perplexed as she listened her sympathy in fact split into three inconveniently distinct and separate streams of these theresas woes still claimed the widest and deepest since with theresa she was in immediate and intimate contact yet the other two began to show a quite respectable volume and current as she pictured damaris marooned on the bar and sir charles ravished away from the seasonable obligation of partridge shooting to take his place at his daughters bedside but this young captain faircloth of whom you speak she presently said her mind taking one of its many inconsequent skippitswho so providentially came to the dearest childs assistancecould he i wonder be the same really very interestinglooking young man i met in the drive just now when i came here and miss verity described him while a pretty stain of colour illuminated her cheek once more you think quite possibly yeshow i wish i had known that at the time i would certainly have stopped and expressed my gratitude to him such a mercy he was at handpoor dearest damaris i hope his good offices have already been acknowledged do you know if my brother has seen and thanked him the expression of theresas round little face still puffy and blotched from her last nights weeping held a world of reproachful remindings ah no the other cried consciencestrickenno of course not how thoughtless of me to ask you andanother mental skippitand that you should be forbidden the sickroom too not permitted to nurse damaris my poor friend indeed i do feel for you i so well understand that must have caused you more pain than anything a remark her hearer found it not altogether easy to counter with advantage to her own cause so wisely let it pass in silence i knowi know you can hardly trust yourself to speak of it i am so grievedso very grieved but one must be practical i think you are wise to yield without further protest i will sound my brotherjust find out if he shows any signs of relenting of course you can understand i ought to hear his view of the matter toonot that i question your account dear friend for one instant meanwhile make all your arrangements the villagetheresa put in with a note of despair this time perfectly genuine ah yesthe village but if i take you away in my fly i mean that will give you a position a standing it will go far to prevent unpleasant gossip miss veritys soul looked out of her candid eyes with a positive effulgence of charity oh i can enter so fully into your shrinking from all that we will treat your going as temporary merely temporaryin speaking of it both here and at paulton lacy of course you might stay with your friends the good miss minetts but i cant honestly counsel your doing so i am afraid sir charles might not quite like your remaining in deadham directly after leaving his house it might be awkward and give rise to tiresome enquiries and comment one has to consider those thingsnoi think it would be a far better plan that you should spend a week at stourmouth that would give us time to see our way more clearly i know of some quite nice rooms kept by a former maid of lady bulparcs you would be quite comfortable thereand as dinner at paulton lacy isnt till eight i could quite well go into stourmouth with you myself this afternoon and my dear friend you will wont you forgive my speaking of this miss veritywhose income be it added was anything but princelygave an engagingly apologetic little laugh pray dont worry yourself on the score of expense the week in stourmouth must cost you nothing as i recommend the rooms i naturally am responsibleyou go to them as my guest of coursestill ill sound my brother at luncheon and just see how the land lies but dont build too much on any change of front i dont expect itnot yet later who knows meanwhile couragedo try not to fret and miss verity descended the backstairs again poor creaturenow her mind will be more at rest i do trust i am afraid charles has been rather severe i never think he does quite understand women but how should he after only being married for threeor four years was itsuch a very limited experienceit is a pity he didnt marry again while damaris was still quite smallsome really nice woman who one knows about but i suppose charles has never cared about that side of things his public work has absorbed him i doubt if he has ever really been in lovemiss verity sighedyes hordle thanks ill wait in the long sittingroom please let sir charles know i am there that i came over to enquire for miss damaris he is getting upyesi shall be here to luncheon thanks but during the course of luncheon that aforementioned split in miss veritys sympathies was fated to declare itself with ever growing distinctness the stream consecrated to theresas woestheresa herself being no longer materially presentdeclined in volume and in force while that commanded by felicias affection for her brother soon rushed down in spate perhaps as she told herself it was partly owing to the lightwhich if pensive upstairs in the whitewalled schoolroom might without exaggeration be called quite dismally gloomy in the lowceilinged diningroom looking out on the black mass of the ilex trees over a havoc of stormbeaten flowerbedsbut sir charles struck her as so worn so aged so singularly and pathetically sad he was still so evidently oppressed by anxiety concerning damaris that to hint at harsh action on his part or plead theresas cause with convincing earnestness and warmth became out of the question miss verity hadnt the heart for it be true to your profession of good samaritan my dear felicia he begged her with a certain rueful humour and take the poor foolish woman off my hands plant her where you like so long as it is well out of my neighbourhood she has made an egregious fiasco of her position here as you love me just remove her from my sightlet this land have rest and enjoy its sabbaths in respect of her at least ill give you a cheque for her salary something in excess of the actual amount if you like for heaven forbid you should be out of pocket yourself as a consequence of your good officesnow let us please talk of some less unprofitable subject brightly sweetly eager miss verity hastened to obey as she believed his concluding request ah yes she said that reminds me of something about which i do so want you to enlighten methis young captain faircloth who so opportunely appeared on the scene and rescued darling damaris i believe i met him this morning as i walked up from the front gate i wondered who he was his appearance interested me so did his voice it struck me as being so quaintly like some voice i know quite welland i stupidly cannot remember whose the coffeecups chattered upon the silver tray as hordle handed it to miss verity you spoke to him then sir charles presently said oh just in passing you know about the weatherwhich was phenomenally bad raining and blowing too wildly at the moment i supposed you had seen him he seemed to be coming away from the house charles verity turned sideways to the table bending down a little over the tray as he helped him the coffee splashed over into the saucer yet it was not the hand holding the coffeepot but those holding the tray that shook whereupon charles verity glanced up into the manservants face calmly arrogant pray be careful hordle he said and thenis miss verity right in supposing captain faircloth called here this morning i beg your pardon sir charles yes sir charles he did what did he want he came to enquire after miss damaris sir charles i understood him to say he was going away to sea shortly did he ask for me no sir charles rather hurriedly and later with visible effort to recapture the perfection of welltrained nullityhe only asked after miss damaris when he calls again let me know miss damaris wishes to see him if she is sufficiently well to do so very good sir charles and during this conversation felicia felt keenly distressed and perplexed it made her miserable to think evil of anyoneparticularly an old and trusted servant but from the moment of her arrival hordles manner had seemed so very strange of course it was horrid even to suspect such a thing but was it possible that he overindulged sometimes that he in plain english drank poor dear charlesif he knew it what an additional worry it really was too deplorableanyway she could alleviate his worries to a certain extent by carrying theresa off she would do so at oncewas there an evening train from stourmouth which stopped at paulton halt wellif there wasnt she must get out at marychurch and drive from there she only trusted she would be in time to dress for dinner harriet was such a stickler for etiquette from all which it may be deduced that the confessions made to miss verity today had this in common with those habitually heard by herthat the point of the story had been rather carefully left out chapter xi in which damaris receives information of the lost shoes and stockingsassumption of the godhead as darcy faircloth prophesied the wild weather lasted throughout that week then the rain having rained itself out the wind backed and the skies cleared but all to a different mode and rhythm a cold white sun shone out of a cold blue sky diapered to the north above the indigo and umber moorland and forest with perspectives of tenuous silkenwhite cloud land and sky were alike washed clean to a starkness and nakedness calling for warm clothing out of doors and wellstoked fires within at the beginning of the next week invited by that thin glinting sunshinebeneath which the sea still ran high in long hollowbacked waves brokenly foamcapped and swirlingdamaris came forth from her retreat sufficiently convalescent to take up the ordinary routine of life again but this also to a changed mode and rhythm having its source in causes more recondite and subtle than any matter of fair or foul weather to begin with she had in the past week crossed a certain bridge there is no going back over for whoso of her sex is handicapped or favouredin midnineteenth century the handicap rather than the favour counted even more heavily than it does today though even today as some of us know to our cost it still counts not a littleby possession of rarer intelligence more lively moral and spiritual perceptions than those possessed by the great average of her countrymen or countrywomen damaris crossing of that bridgeto carry on the figureaffected her thought of and relation to everyone and everything with which she now came in contact she had crossed other bridges on her eighteen years journey from infancy upwards but compared with this last they had been but airy fantastic structures fashioned of hardly more substantial stuff than dreams are made ofthus anyhow it appeared to her as she lay resting in her pinkandwhite curtained bed watching the loose rosesprays tremble against the rainspattered windowpanesfor this last bridge was built of the living stones of fact of deeds actually done and just because it was so built for one of her perceptions and temperament no recrossing of it could be possible so much to begin withto go on with even before dr mccabe granted her permission to emerge from retirement all manner of practical matters claimed her attention and that not unwholesomely as it proved in the sequel for with the incontinent vanishing of theresa bilson into space ormore accuratelyinto the very comfortable lodgings provided for her by miss verity in stourmouth the mantle of the exgovernesscompanions domestic responsibilities automatically descended upon her expupil the said vanishing was reported to damaris by mary on the day subsequent to its occurrence not without signs of hardly repressed jubilation for egypt in this case represented by the deadham hard servants hall was unfeignedly glad at her departing a good riddance i call itand we all know the rest of that saying mrs cooper remarked to an audience of hordle and mary fisher reinforced by the napoleonic patch and his wifewho happened to have looked in from the stables after suppersome freedom of speech being permissible thanks to the underservants relegation to the kitchen i never could see she was any class myself but the airs and graces shed give herself youll never persuade me she wasnt sweet on the master that was at the back of all her dressings up and flouncings and fidgetings the impidence of ityou may well say so mrs patch but the conceit of some people passes understanding to be lady verity if you please that was what she was after to my dying day i shall believe it dont tell me marys announcement of the event was couched in sober terms shorn of such fine flowers of suggestion and comment yet it breathed an unmistakable satisfaction which to damaris contrition found instant echo in her own heart she ought she knew to feel distressed at poor theresas vanishingonly she didnt and couldnt as an inherent consequence of the aforechronicled bridgecrossing theresa was more than ever out of the picture to listen to her chatterings to evade her questionings would under existing circumstances amount to a daily trial from which the young girl felt thankful to escape for damaris entertained a conviction the circumstances in question would call for fortitude and resource of an order unknown alike in their sternness and their liberality of idea to theresas narrowly high anglican and academic standards of thought and conduct she therefore ascertained from her informant that miss verity had been as actively instrumental in the vanishinghad to be explicit taken miss bilson and all her luggage such a collection except two disgraceful old tin boxes which were to be forwarded by the carrier away with her in her own marychurch flyand at this damaris left the business willingly enough secure that if tenderhearted aunt felicia was party to the removal it would very surely be effected with due regard to appearances and as slight damage to feelings as could well be later sir charles referred briefly to the subject adding when you require another ladyinwaiting we will choose her ourselves i think rather than accept a nominee of my sister felicias she is certain to have some more or less unsuitable and incapable person on hand upon whom she ardently desires to confer benefits but must i have another ladyinwaiting damaris meaningly and pleadingly asked charles verity drew his hand down slowly over his flowing moustache and smiled at her in tender amusement as she sat up in a much lace and ribbon befrilled jacket her hair hanging down in a heavy plait on either side the white column of her warmly white throat her face was refined to a transparency of colouring even as it seemed of texture from confinement to the house and from lassitude following upon fever which while he recognized its loveliness caused him a pretty sharp pang still she looked content as he told himself her glance was frank and calm without suggestion of lurking anxiety nor was she unoccupied and broodingwitness the counterpane strewn with books with balls of wool a sock in leisurely process of knitting and in a hollow of it mustapha the brindled cat luxuriously sleeping curled round against her feet heaven knows ive no special craving your ladyinwaiting should find a speedy successor he said but to do without one altogether might appear a rather daring experiment your aunts would be loud in protest what matters isnt the aunts is it but ourselves damaris quite gaily took him up but wouldnt you be lonely my dear and would you not find it burdensome to run the house yourself nono she cried not one bit anyway let me try commissioner sahib let us be by ourselves togetherbeautifully by ourselves for a time at least so be it then charles verity said and perhaps although hardly acknowledged in the mind of each the same consideration operated for there remained a thing still to be done before the new order could be reckoned as fully initiated still more fully establisheda thing which as each knew could be best done without witnesses a thing which both intended should very surely be done yet concerning which neither proposed to speak until the hour of accomplishment actually struck that hour in point of fact struck sooner than damaris anticipated the sound and sight of it reaching her without prelude or opportunity of preparation for early in the afternoon of the second day she spent downstairs as sitting at the writing table in the long drawingroom she raised her eyes from contemplation of the housekeeping books spread out before her she saw her father walking slowly up from the seawall across the lawn and seeing him for the moment her mind carried back to that miracle of interchangeable personalities so distressingly haunting her at the beginning of her illness when james colthursts charcoal sketch of her father played cruel jugglers tricks upon her for beside him now walked a man so strangely resembling him in height in bearing and in build that but for the difference of clothing and the bearded face it might be himself had the clock of his life been set back by thirty years damaris first instinct was of flight just as when out on the bar with her cousin tom verity now nearly a month ago overcome by a foreboding of farreaching danger she hadto the subsequent bitter wounding of her selfrespect and prideshown the white feather ignominiously turned tail and run away was she tempted to run away now for it seemed too much it came too close laying rough hands not only upon the deepest of her love and reverence for her father but upon that still mysterious depth of her own nature namely her apprehension of passion and of sex a sacred shame an awe as at the commission of some covert act of impiety overcame her as she looked at the two men walking side by side across the moist vividly green carpet of turf in the chill white sunshine the plain of an uneasy grey sea behind them she wanted to hide herself to close eyes and ears against further knowledge yesit came too close and at the same time made her feel as never before isolated and desolateas though a great gulf yawned between her and what she had always counted preeminently her own most securely her property because most beloved she had spoken valiantly on faircloths behalf had generously acted as his advocate yet now beholding him thus in open converse with her father the wings of love were scorched by the flame of jealousynot so much of the young man himself as of a past which he stood for and in which she had no part therefore to runyes run and hide from further knowledge further experience and revelation to claim the privileges since she was called on to endure the smart of isolationyet to run as she almost directly began to reason was not only cowardly but useless fact remains fact and if she refused to accept it range herself in line with it today she in nowise negatived but merely postponed the event if not today then tomorrow she was bound to empty the cup and she laughed at the specious halftruth which had appeared so splendid and exhilarating a discoverythe halftruth that nothing is really inevitable unless you yourself will it to be so for this was inevitable sooner or later unescapable fight against it fly from it as she might therefore she must stay whether she liked it or notstay because to do otherwise was purposeless because she couldnt help herself because there was nowhere to run to in short she heard footsteps upon the flags outside the garden door speech calm and restrained of which she could not distinguish the import mechanically damaris gathered the scattered housekeeping books lying before her upon the tablebakers butchers grocers cornchandlers coalmerchantsinto a tight little heap and folding her hands on the top of them prayed simply almost wordlessly for courage to hold the balance even to seek not her own good but the good of those two others to do right then she waited the door opened closed and after a minutes pause one of the two mendamaris did not know which she could not bring herself to lookcoming from between the stumpy pillars walked towards her down the halflength of the room and bent over her resting one hand on the back of her chair the other on the leather inlay of the writingtable just beside the little pile of housebooks the hand was young sunburnt wellshaped the finger nails well kept across the back of it a smallbodied widewinged seabird in apparent act of flight and the letters dvf were tattooed in blue and crimson a gold bangle the surface of it dented in places and engraved with japanese characters encircled the fine lean wrist these damaris saw and they worked upon her strangely awakening an emotion of almost painful tenderness as at sight of decorations pathetically fond playfully childlike and ingenuous while as he bent over her she also became aware of a freshness a salt sweetness as of the ocean and the great vacant spaces where all the winds of the world blow keen and free sir charles wrote to me faircloth said a little huskily he told me i might come and see you again and talk to you and bid you goodbye before i go to sea and i should have been here sooner but that i was away at southampton docks and the letter only reached me this morning i telegraphed and started on at once and hesir charleswalked out over the warren to meet me and brought me up here right to the door and on the way we talked a littleif he chose he could make the very stones speak i thinkand he said one or two things for whichiwelli thank first almighty god and next to god youdamaris this last imperatively you did ask for me you did wish to have me come to you yes i did wish it she answered but i never knew how much until now when he has brought you for that is the right the beautiful safe way of having you come to me and to this house yet as she spoke she lightly laid her hand over the tattooed image of the flying seabird concealing it for it moved her to the point of active suffering in its quaint prettiness fixed thus indelibly up in the warm live flesh at the touch of her hand faircloth drew in his breath sharply seeming to wince then at last damaris looked up at him her eyes full of questioning and startled concern i didnt hurt you she asked a vague idea of suffering attached to that fanciful stigmata troubling her hurt megood lord how could you of all people hurt me he gently laughed at her unless you turned me down gave me to understand that on second thoughts you didnt find me up to your requirements or some mean class devilry of that kindof which by the way had i judged you capable you may be sure i should have been uncommonly careful never to come near you againno it isnt that you hurt me but that you delight me a little overmuch so that it isnt easy to keep quite levelheaded theres so much to hear and to tell and such scanty time to hear or tell it in worse luck you are obliged to go so soon the flames of jealousy had effectually it may be noted died down in damaris yeswere taking on cargo for all were worth we are booked to sail by noon the day after tomorrow i stretched a point in leaving at all which wont put me in the best odour with my officers and crew orsupposing they come to hear of itwith my owners either i am giving my plain duty the slip but in this singular ease it seemed to me a greater duty stood back of and outweighed the plain obvious onesince it mounted to a reconstruction a peacemaking ridding the souls of four persons of an ugly burden i wanted the affair all settled up and straightened out before this my maiden voyage in command of a ship of my own for me it is a great event a great step forward and perhaps im oversuperstitiousmost men of my trade are supposed to be touched that waybut i admit i rather cling to the notion of this private peacemaking this straightening out of an ancient crookedness as a thing of good augury a favourable omen as suchlet alone other reasonsand he looked down at damaris with a fine and delicate admirationi desired it and out of my heart i prize itdo you see yesindeed a thing of good auguryshe affirmed yet in speaking her lips shook for in truth poor child she was hardpressed this intimate intercourse alike in its simple directness and its novelty began to wear on her to the point of physical distress she felt tremulous and faint not that faircloth jarred upon or was distasteful to her far from that his youth and health the unspoiled vigour and force of him captivated her imagination even the dash of roughness the lapses from conventional forms of speech and manner she now and again observed in him caught her fancy heightening his attraction for her nor was she any longer tormented by a sense of isolation for as she recognized he stole nothing away which heretofore belonged to her rather did he add his own by no means inconsiderable self to the sum of her possessionsand in that last fact she probably touched the real crux the real strain of the present to her disintegrating situation for in him and in his relation to her a wonderful and very precious gift was bestowed upon her namely another human life to love and live forbestowed on her moreover without asking or choice of her own arbitrarily through the claim of his and her common ancestry and the profound moral and spiritual obligations the mysterious affinities which a common ancestry creates had she possessed this gift from childhood had it taken its natural place in her experience through the linked and orderly progress of the years it would have been wholly welcome wholly profitable and sweet but it was sprung upon her from the outside quite astoundingly readymade it bore down on her and at a double foot horse and siege guns complete small discredit to her if she staggered under its onset trembled and turned faint for as she now perceived it was exactly this relation of brother and sister of which she had some prescience some dim intuition from her first sight of faircloth as he stood among the skeleton lobsterpots on board timothy prouds old boat it was this call of a common blood which begot in her unreasoning panic which she had run from and so wildly tried to escape and yet it remained a gift of great price a crown of gold but oh so very heavyjust at this moment anyhowfor her poor proud young head lifting her hand off faircloths she made a motion to rise change of attitude and place might bring her relief serve to steady her nerves and restore her endangered composure brooding over the whole singular matter in the peace and security of her room upstairs her course had appeared a comparatively easy one granted reasonable courage and address but the young mans bodily presence as now close beside her exercised an emotional influence quite unforeseen and unreckoned with under it her will wavered she ceased to see her way clearly to be sure of herself she grew timid bewildered unready both of purpose and of speech faircloth meanwhile being closely observant of her was quick to detect her agitation he drew aside her chair and backed away leaving her free to pass i am afraid we have talked too long he said youre tired i ought to have been more careful of you remembered how ill you have beenand that partly through my doing too so now i had better bid you goodbye i think and leave you to rest but damaris contriving to smile tremulous lips notwithstanding shook her head for in lifting her hand from his she caught sight of the tattooed blueandcrimson seabird and the initials below it and again her heart contracted with a spasm of tenderness while those three letters more fully arresting her attention aroused in her a fascinated halfshrinking curiosity what did they mean what could they stand for she longed intensely to knowsure they were in some sort a symbol a token not without special significance for herself but shyness and a quaint disposition dating from her childhood to pause and hover on the threshold of discovery thus prolonging a period of entrancing distracting suspense withheld her she dared not askin any case dared not ask just yet and therefore took up his words in their literal application indeed you havent talked too long she assured him as she went over to the tiger skin before the fireplace and standing there looked down into the core of the burning logs we have only just begun to talk so it isnt that which has tried me butif you wont misunderstandpray dontthe thought ofof you and of all that which lies between us is still very new to me i havent quite found you or myself in my relation to you yet give me time and indeed i wont disappoint you faircloth who had followed her put his elbows on the mantelshelf and sinking his head somewhat between his shoulders stared down at the burning logs too ah when you take that tone im a little scared lest i should turn out to be the disappointment the failure in this high adventure of ours he said under his breath so stay please the young girl went on touched by yet ignoring his interjected comment let me get as accustomed as i can now so that i may feel settled that is the way to prevent my being tiredthe way to rest me because it will help to get all my thinkings about you into placeyes please staythat is she added with a pretty touch of ceremonyif you have time and dont yourself wish to go i wish it what in heavens name could well be further from any wish of mine faircloth broke out almost roughly without raising his eyes do you suppose when a mans gone thirsty many days he is in haste to forego the first draught of pure water offered to himand that after just putting his lips to the dear comfort of it ah you care too much damaris cried smitten by swift shrinking and dread faircloth lifted his head and looked at her his face keen brilliant with a far from ignoble emotion it is not and never will be possibleso i fancyhe said to care too much about you and he fell into contemplation of the glowing logs again but damaris seeing his transfigured countenance hearing his rejoinder penetrated moreover by the conviction of his entire sincerity felt the weight of a certain golden crown more than ever heavy upon her devoted young head she stepped aside groping with outstretched hands behind her until she found and held on to the arm of the big sofa stationed at right angles to the hearth and she waited morally taking breath to slip presently on to the wide low seat of it and lean thankfully against its solidly cushioned back for support neither for you or for my shipfaircloth went on speaking as it seemed more to himself than to his now pale companion i dare couple you and her together though she is no longer in the dew of her youth oh i cant defend her looks poor dear she has seen service is only a battered travelweary old coupleofthousandton cargo boat which has hugged and nuzzled the foulsmelling quays of half the seaports of southern europe and asia all the samenext to youshes the best and finest thing life up to now has brought me and i love hermy affection for her though he went on is safe to be transitory she is safe to have rivals and successors in plentyunless of course by some ugly turn of luck she and i go to the bottom in company faircloth broke off a little sound a little gesture of protest and distress making him straighten himself up and turn quickly his eyes alight with enquiry and laughter may i take that to mean im not quite alone in my caring he asked but that you damaris care perhaps just a trifling amount too he went across to the sofa sat down sideways laying his right arm along the back of it and placing his left handinscribed with the fanciful deviceover the girls two hands clasped in her lap the strong lean fingers exercised a quiet steady pressure for a minute after which he leaned back no longer attempting to touch her studiously indeed keeping his distance while he said the other affection is stable for eversafe from all rivals or successors that is another reason why i jumped at the chance sir charless letter gave me of coming here today and seeing you with this roomas i hopedin which so much of your time must be spent for background i wanted to stamp a picture of you upon my memory burn it right into the very tissue of my brain so that i shall always have it with me wherever i go and however rarely we meetbecause as i see it we shall rarely meet we ought to be clear on that pointleave no frayed edges there is a bar between us which for the sake of others as well as for your sake it is only right and decent i should respect a wall of partition through which i shouldnt attempt to break i knowbut it troubles me damaris murmured it is sad yes of course it is sad but its just the penalty that is bound to be paid and which it is useless to ignore or lie to ourselves aboutso i shall never come unless hesir charlessends for me as he did today or unless you send only remember your picture will never leave me i have it safe and soundfaircloth smiled at herit will be with me just as actually and ineffaceably as this is with me he patted the back of his left hand nothing short of death can rub either out i have pretty thoroughly banked against that you see so youve only to send when and if you want me i shall turn upoh never fear i shall turn up and i shall sendwe shall both send damaris answered gravely even a little brokenly the crown might be heavy but she had strangely ceased to desire to be rid of it beginning indeed to find its weight oddly satisfying even it may be asserted trenching on the exquisite and with this altered attitude a freedom of spirit greater than she had enjoyed since the commencement of the whole astonishing episode since before her cousin tom veritys visit in fact came upon her it lightened her heart it dispelled her fatiguewhich throughout the afternoon had been probably more of the moral than bodily sort her soul no longer beat its wings against iron bars fluttered in the meshes of a net but looked forth shy yet serene accepting the position in which it found itself for faircloth inspired her with deepening faith he needed no guiding as she told herself but was strong enough as his words convincingly testified clearsighted and quickwitted enough to play his part in the complicated drama without prompting hadnt he done just what she askedstayed until by operation of some quality in himself orcould it besimply through the mysterious draw of his and her brother and sisterhood she had already grown accustomed settled in her thought of him untormented by the closeness of his presence and unabashed and having reached this vantagepoint discovering the weight of the crown dear now rather than irksome damaris permitted herself a closer observation of her companion than ever before impressions of his appearance she had received in plentybut received them in flashes confusing from their very vividness confusing also because each one of them was doubled by a haunting consciousness of his likeness to her father the traits common to both men rather than those individually characteristic of the younger had been in evidence and in her present happier mood damaris also desired a picture to set in the storehouse of memory but it must represent this brother of hers in and by himself divorced as far as might be from that pursuing and to her singularly agitating likeness her design and her scrutiny were easier of prosecution that during the last few minutes faircloth had retired into silence and an attitude of abstraction sitting rather forward upon the sofa his legs crossed nursing one blue serge trousered knee with locked hands his glance travelled thoughtfully over the quiet lowtoned room and its varied contents later sought the window opposite and ranged across the garden and terrace walk with its incident of small ancient cannon to the long ridge of the barrising bleached windswept and notably deserted under the colourless sunshine beyond the dark waters of the tide river which raced tumultuously seaward in flood seen thus in reposeand repose is a terrible telltalethe lines of the young mans face and figure remained firm gracefully angular and definite no hint of slackness or sloppiness marred their effect the same might be said of his clothes which though of ordinary regulation colour and cutplus neat black tie and stifffronted white shirt collar and wristbandspossessed style and that farthest from the cheap or flashy only the gold bangle challenged damaris taste as touching on florid but its existence she condoned in face of its wearers hazardous and inherently romantic calling for the sailor may surely be here and there permitted a turn and a flourish justly denied to the safe entrenched landsman if outward aspects were thus calculated to engage her approval and agreeably fill in her projected picture that which glimmered through themdivined by her rather than stated all being necessarily more an affair of intuition than of knowledgegave her pleasure of richer quality hightempered she unquestionably read him arrogant and on occasion not inconceivably remorseless but neither mean nor ungenerous his energy unwasted his mind untainted by selfindulgence if he were capable of cruelty to others he was at least equally capable of turning the knife on himself cutting off or plucking out an offending member this appealed to the heroic in her while over her vision as she thus considered him hung the glamour of youth which to youth displays such royal enchantmentsuntrodden fields of hope and promise inviting the tread of eager feet the rush of glorious goings forward towards conquests towards wonders well assured yet to be the personality of this man clearly admitted no denial as little bragged as it apologized since his candour matched his force of will taking stock of him thus from the corner of the sofa imagination intelligence affections alike actively in play damaris colour rose her pulse quickened and her great eyes grew wide finely and softly gay faircloth moved turned his head met her eyes and looking into them his face blanched perceptibly under its couche of sunburn damaris he said damaris what has happenedstop though you neednt tell me i know weve found one anotherhavent wefound one another more in the silence than in the talkingqueer things should work that way but it puts a seal on fact for they couldnt so work unless the same stuff the same inclination were embedded right in the very innermost substance of both of us you look rested you look gladbless youisnt that so yes she simply told him faircloth set his elbows on his knees his chin on his two hands wrist against wrist and his glance ranged out over the garden again to the pale strip of the bar spread between river and sea then i can go he said but not because ive tired you i shall never be tired any more fromfrom being with you i dont fancy you will all the same i must go because my times up my train leaves marychurch at six and i have to call at the inn to bid my mother goodbye on my way to the station was the perfect harmony the perfect adjustment of spirit to spirit a wee bit jarred did a mist come up over the heavenly bright sky faircloth asked himself and answered doggedly that if it were so he could not help it for since by all ruling of loyalty and dignity the wall of partition was ordained to stand wasnt it safer to remind both himself and damaris at times of its presence he must keep his feet on the floor good godkeep them very squarely on the floorfor otherwise wasnt it possible to conceive of their skirting the edge of unnamable abysses in furtherance of that so necessary soberness of outlook he now went on speaking but before i go i want to hark back to a matter of quite ancient historyyour lost shoes and stockingsfor thereby hangs a tale and he proceeded to tell her how about a week ago being caught by a wild flurry of rain in an outlying part of the island behind the black cottages and inn he took shelter in a disused ruinous boathouse opening on the great reedbeds which here rim the shore a melancholy forsaken place from which at low tide you can walk across the mudflats to lampit with a pleasing chance of being sucked under by quicksands abram sclanders unhappy halfwitted son haunted this boathouse it seemed storing his shrimping nets there any other things as well a venerable magpies hoard of scraps and lumber using it as a runhole too when the other lads hunted and tormented him according to their healthy brutal youthful way a regular josshouse hed made of it and set up in one corner white and ghostlymaking you stare a minute when you first came insidea ships figurehead a threefoot odd britannia puddingbasin bosomed and eaglefeatured with castellated headgear clasping a trident in her hand she as presiding deity and in front of her faircloth said his chin still in his hands and eyes gazing away to the barearth and pebbles banked up into a flattopped mound upon which stood your shoes filled with sprays of hedge fruit and yellow buttonchrysanthemumsstolen too i suppose from one of the gardens at lampit they grow freely there your silk stockings hung round her neck a posy of flowers twisted into themwhen i came on this exhibition i cant quite tell you how i felt it raised cain in me to think of that degraded misbegotten creature pawing over and playing about with anything which had belonged to you i was for making sclanders his father bring him over and give him the thrashing of his life right there before the proofs of his sins but you didnt damaris cried you didnt what do my shoes and stockings matter i oughtnt to have left them on the shore it was putting temptation in his way faircloth looked at her smiling no i didnt and for two reasons one that i kneweven thenyou would find excuses plead for mercy as you have just now another those flowers if i had foundwellwhat i might have found oh he should have had the stick or the dogwhip without stint but one doesnt practise devilworship with flowers it seemed to me some craving after beauty was there as if the poor germ of a soul groped out of the darkness towards what is fair and sweet i dared not hound it back into the darkness close down any dim aspiration after god it might have so i left its pitiful josshouse inviolate the moan of the wind and sighing of the great reedbeds making music for such strange rites of worship as have been or may be practised within any god is better than nonethats my creed at least and to defile any mans godhowever trumperyunless youre amazingly sure youve a better one to offer him in place of it is to sin against the holy ghost faircloth rose to his feet times uphe said i must go here is farewell to the most beautiful day of my lifebut see damaris and he knelt down in front of her leave your shoes and stockings cast away on the bar and thereby open the doorfor some peopleon to the kingdom of heaven if you like but dont dont if youve the smallest mercy for my peace of mind ever wander about there again alone ive a superstition against it something unhappy will come of it it isnt right it isnt safe whenwhen i called you and you answered me through the mist i had a horrible fear i was too late you see i careand the caring after today very certainly will not grow less take somebody one of your women always with you promise me never to be out by yourself wondering inexpressibly touched damaris put her hands on his shoulders his hands sprang to cover them of course i promise she said and closing her eyes put up her lips to be kissed then the rattle of the glass door on to the garden as it shut in the room a listening stillness a great allinvading emptiness finally hordle with the teatray and mrs cooper if it isnt troubling you miss would be glad to have the housebooks to pay as shes walking up the village after tea chapter xii concerning a sermon which never was preached and other matters of local interest before passing on to more dignified matters that period of nine days demands to be noted during which the inhabitants of deadham all very much agog celebrated the wonder of miss bilsons indisputable disappearance and damaris veritys reported adventure concerning the former dr horniblow good man took himself seriously to task deploring his past action and debating his present duty it is no use jane he lamented to his wife the two had retired for the night darkness and the bedclothes covering them i am very much worried about my share in the matter but my dear james you really are overscrupulous what share had you the clerical wife does not always see eye to eye with her spouse in respect of his female parishioners more particularly perhaps the unmarried ones mrs horniblow loved honoured andwithin reasonable limitsobeyed her james but this neither prevented her being shrewd nor knowing her james after all to be human remembrance of theresa heading the deadham procession during the inspection of harchester cathedral sandwiched in between him and the dean still rankled in her wifely bosom i overpersuaded miss bilson to accompany us on the choir treat i forgot she must not be regarded as an entirely free agent she has shown interest in parish work and really proved very useful and obliging her acquaintance with architecturethe technical terms toois unusually accurate for a member of your sex her business is teaching said the lady and i cant but fear i have been instrumental in her loss of an excellent position if her learning is as remarkable as you consider it she will doubtless soon secure another ah youre prejudiced my love one cannot but be struck at times by the harshness with which even women of high principle like yourself judge other women possibly the highness of my principles may be accountable for my judgmentsin some cases argument is very unrestful the vicar remarked turning over on his side but there would be an end of conversation if i always agreed with you tuttut he murmured then with renewed plaintivenessi cannot make up my mind whether it is not my duty my chivalrous duty to seek an interview with sir charles verity and explainput the aspects of the case to him as i see them call on him by all means ill go with you we ought in common civility to enquire for damaris after this illness of hers but dont explain or attempt to enlarge on the case from your own point of view sir charles will consider it an impertinence it wont advantage miss bilson and will embroil you with the most important of your parishioners the wisdom of the serpent is permitted on occasion even recommended a most dangerous doctrine jane most dangerous save under authority what authority can be superior to that under which the recommendation was originally given my love you become slightly profanei implore you dont argueand at this hour when a woman touches on exegesis on theology all i know upon those subjects you dear have taught me ah wellah wellthe good man returned at once mollified and suspicious for might not the compliment be regarded as something of a backhander we can defer our decision till tomorrow perhaps we had better as you propose call together i need not go straight to the point but watch my opportunity and slip in a word edgeways he audibly yawnedthe hint like the yawn a broad one the lady did not take it however so far she had held her own morehad nicely secured her ends but further communications trembled upon her tongue the word is justliterally trembled for they might cause anger and james angerit happened rarelyshe held in quite to herself uncomfortable respect i fear there is a good deal of objectionable gossip going about the village just now she tentatively commenced then pray dont repeat it to me my loveanother yawn and an irritable one gossip as you know is abhorrent to me and to mebut one needs to be forearmed with the truth if one is to rebut it conclusively only upon such grounds should i think of mentioning this to you she made a dash james have you by chance ever heard peculiar rumours about young darcy faircloths parentage in mercy janewhat a questionand from you i am inexpressibly shocked so was i wheni wont mention nameswhen such rumours were hinted to me i assured the person with whom i was talking that i had never heard a word on the subject but she said one cant help having eyes or some of you noses for carrion here he gave her the advantage she was not slow to make play with it now it is my turn to be shocked she saidand not i think james without good cause yes i apologize the excellent man answered immediately i apologize but to have so foul a suggestion of parochial scandal let loose on me suddenly flung in my teeth as i may sayand by you i was taken off my guard and expressed myself coarsely yes jane i apologize then i have you authority for contradicting these rumours the vicar of deadham groaned in the darkness and rustled under the bedclothes his perplexity was great on being thus confronted by the timehonoured question as to how far in the interests of public morality it is justifiable for the private individual roundly to lie finally he banked on compromise that permanently presiding genius of the church of england as by law established you have me on the hip my love he told his wife quite meekly but as she began rather eagerly to speak he stopped her let be my dear jane he bade her let be i neither deny or confirm the rumours to which i imagine you allude silence is most becoming for us both continue to assure any persons illadvised and evilminded enough to approach youi trust they may prove but fewthat you have never heard a word of this subject you will neveri can confidently promise youhear one from mei shall make it my duty to preach on the iniquity of backbiting talebearing scandalmongering next sunday and put some to the blush as i trust st paul will furnish me with more than one text eminently appositelet me thinklet me seehumah yes and he fell to quoting from the pauline epistles in greekto the lively annoyance of his auditor whose education though solid did not include a knowledge of those languages vulgarly known as dead she naturally sought means to round on him might you not compromise yourself rather by such a sermon james she presently said compromise myself certainly notpray jane how by laying yourself open to the suspicion of a larger acquaintance with the origin of those rumours than you are willing to admit the shaft went home this is a mere attempt to draw me you are disingenuous nothing of the sort the lady declared my one object is to protect you from criticism and preaching upon gossip must invite rather than allay interest thus giving this particular gossip a new lease of life the application would be too obvious clearly james it would be wiser to wait the serpent again the serpentand one ive warmed in my bosom toothen aloudi will think it over my love possibly your view may be the right one it is worth considerationthat must be sufficient and now jane i do implore you give over discussion and let us say good night it may be registered as among the consequences of these nocturnal exercises that dr horniblow abstained from tickling the ears of his congregation on the following sunday with a homily founded upon the sin talebearing and that he duly called next day at the hard accompanied by his wife the visitnot inconceivably to his inward thanksgivingproved unfruitful of opportunity for excusing miss bilson to her former employer by accusing himself sir charles veritys courtesy being of an order calculated to discourage any approach to personal topics unfruitful also of enlightenment to mrs horniblow respecting matters whichas the good lady ashamedly confessed to herselfalthough forbidden by her lord still intrigued her while of course they most suitably shocked for the life of her she could not help looking out for signs of disturbance and upheaval but found none unlessand that presented a conundrum difficult of solutiondamaris pretty social readiness and grace in the reception of her guests might be in some way referable to lately reported events that and the fact the young girl wasas the saying isall eyeseyes calm fathomless reflective which yet when you happened to enter their sphere of vision covered you with a newborn gentleness mrs horniblow caught herself growing lyricalthinking of stars of twin mountain lakes the bluepurple of ocean a girl in love is blessed with just such eyessometimes whereupon remembering her own two girls may and dorisgood as gold bless them yet her shrewdness pronounced when compared with damaris but homely piecesthe excellent woman sighed what did it all then amount to mrs horniblows logic failed all eyesand very lovely ones at thatdamaris might be yet her tranquillity and serenity appeared beyond question must thrilling mystery be voted no more than a maresnestonly did not the fact remain that james had refused to commit himself either way thereby naturally landing himself in affirmation up to the neck she gave it up but even in the giving up could not resist probing just a little the two gentlemen were out of earshot standing near the glass doorhow james black bowwindowed figure and the fixed red in his cleanshaven slightly pendulous cheeks did show up to be sure in the lightunprofitable gift of observation for possession of which she so frequently had cause to reproach herself you still look a little run down and pale my dear she said it isnt for me to advise but wouldnt a change of air and scene be good dont you think damaris assured her notin any case not yet later after christmas she and her father might very likely go abroad but till then they had a full programme of guests colonel carteret comes to us next week and my aunt felicia always likes to be here in november she enjoys that month at the seaside finding it she says so poetic damaris smiled her eyes at once and more than ever eloquent and unfathomable and i learned only this morning an old angloindian friend of ours mrs mackinder whom i should be quite dreadfully sorry to miss is spending the autumn at stourmouth mrs horniblow permitted herself a dash at stourmouthyes she ventured that reminds me i hearhow far the information is correct i cannot pretend to saythat kind little person miss bilson has been there with miss verity this last week i observed we had not met her in the village just lately i hope you have good news of her when is she expected back without hesitation or agitation came the counterstroke i dont know damaris answered her plans i believe are uncertain at present you and dr horniblow will stay to tea with us wont youthis charmingly it will be here in a very few minutesi can ring for it at once and the lady laughed to herself goodtemperedly accepting the rebuff for it was neatly delivered and she could admire clever fencing even though she herself were pinkedas to tea she protested positive shame at prolonging her visitfor didnt it already amount rather to a visitationyet retained her seat with every appearance of satisfactionif the truth must be told mrs coopers cakes were renowned throughout society at deadham as of the richest the most melting in the mouth and jameshence not improbably the tendency to abdominal protuberancepossessed an inordinate fondness for cakes he had shown himself so docile in respect of projected inflammatory sermons and of morning calls personally conducted by his wife that the latter could not find it in her heart to ravish him away from these approaching very toothsome delights naylet him stay and eatfor was not such staying good policy she further reflected advertising the fact she bore no shadow of malice towards her youthful hostess for that neatly delivered rebuff after this sort therefore was gossip for the time being at all events scotched if not actually killed parochial excitement flagged the sooner no doubt because of the four persons chiefly responsible for its creation two were invisible and the remaining two apparently quite unconscious of its ever having existedmrs lesbia faircloth at the inn the vicars wife left out of the countif sir charles verity and damaris had hurried away gossip would have run after them with liveliest yelpings but this practise of masterly inactivity routed criticism how far was it studied cynical on the part of the father or innocent upon that of the daughter she could not tell one bit but that practically it carried success along with it she saw to be indubitable face the music and the band stops playingso she put it to herself as she walked down the drive to the front gate her jameswas he just a trifle crestfallen good manstrolling umbrella in

an episode in the emotional experience of the man with the blue eyes thus far for the surer basing of our argument it has appeared advisable to proceed step by step but the foundations being now well and truly laid the pace of our narrative may with advantage quicken a twelve month be rounded up in a page a decade should convenience so dictate in a chapter to the furthering of which advance let it be stated that the close of the year still in question marked the date for damaris of two matters of cardinal importance for it was then sir charles verity commenced writing his history of the reign of shere ali covering the eleven years following the latters accession to the very turbulent throne of afghanistan in colonel carteret may be held mainly responsible for the inception of this literary enterprise now generally acclaimed a classic had not sir william napier so he argued made the soldier as historian for ever famous and why should not charles verity with his unique knowledge of court intrigues of the people and the country do for the campaigns of the semibarbarous eastern ruler that which sir william had done for wellingtons campaign in the spanish peninsular carteret prophesiedand truly as the event richly proveda finely fascinating book would eventually come of it meanwhilethough this argument in favour of the scheme he kept to himselfthe preparation of the said book would supply occupation and interest of which his old friend appeared to him to stand rather gravely in need for that something was just now amiss with charles verity carteret could not disguise from himself he was changed in a way a little brokenso at least the younger mans kindly keenly observant blue eyes regretfully judged him he fell into long silences seeming to sink away into some abyss of cheerless thought while his speech had too often a bitter edge to it carteret mourned these indications of an unhappy frame of mind did moresought by all means in his power to conjure them away we must make your father fight his battles over again dear witch he told damaris pacing the terrace walk topping the seawall beside her one evening in the early november dusk his record is a very brilliant one and he ought to get more comfort out of the remembrance of it lets conspire you and i to make him sun himself in the achievements and activities of those earlier years what do you say oh do it do it she answered fervently he is sadand i am so afraid that it is partly my fault your fault why what wicked practises have you been up to since i was here last he asked teasing her a question evoking in damaris sharp inward debate for her fathers melancholy humour weighed on her causing her perplexity and a measure of selfreproach she would have given immensely much to unburden herself to this wise and faithful counsellor and confide to him theto herstrangely moving fact of darcy faircloths existence yet notwithstanding her conviction of colonel carterets absolute loyalty she hesitated restrained in part by modesty in part by the fear of being treacherous would it be altogether honourable to give away the secret places of charles veritys lifeof any mans life if it came to thateven to so honourable and trusted a friend she felt handicapped by her own ignorance moreover having neither standards nor precedents for guidance she had no ideahow should shein what way most men regard such affairs how far they accept and condone how far condemn them she could not tell whether she was dealing with a case original and extraordinary or one of pretty frequent occurrence in the experience of those who as the phrase has it know their world these considerations kept her timid and tonguetied though old habit combined with carterets delightful personality and the soothing influence of the dusky evening quiet inclined her to confidences its not anything ive done she presently took him up gravely but quite by chance i learned something which i think the commissioner sahib would rather not have had me hear i had to be quite truthful with him about it but i was bewildered and ill i blurted things out rather im afraid and hurt him more than i need have done i was so taken by surprise you see yes i see carteret said regardless of strict veracity for he didnt see though he believed himself on the road to seeing and that some matter of singular moment he was beautiful to mebeautiful about everythingeverybody she asserted and we love one another not less but more he and iof that i am sure only its differentdifferent we cant either of us quite go back to the time beforeand that has helped to make him sad carteret listened in increasing interest aware that he sounded unlookedfor depths apprehensive lest those depths should harbour disastrous occurrences he walked the length of the terrace before again speaking then no longer teasing but gently and seriously he asked her do you feel free to tell me openly about this and let me try to help youif its a case for help damaris shook her head looking up at him through the soft enclosing murk and smiling rather ruefully i wish i knewi do so wish i knew she said but i dontnot yet anyway help me without my telling you please the book is a splendid idea and then do you think you could persuade him to let us go away abroad for a time everything here must remind himas it does meof what happened it was quite right she went on judiciallyfor everyones sake we should stay here just the same at first people with a scornful lift of the head carteret noted and admiredmight have mistaken our reason for going away they had to be made to understand we were perfectly indifferenti knew all that though we never discussed it one does things sometimes just because its right they should be done without any sort of planningjust by instinct still i know we cant be quite natural here what happened comes between us were each anxious about the other and feel a constraint though we never speak of it that cant be avoided i suppose for we both suffered a good deal at the timebut he most much the most because damaris paused because why i suppose because im young and then once i got accustomed to the idea i saw it meant what was very wonderful in some waysa wonderfulness which for me would go on and ona whole new country for me to explore and travel in quite my ownandandwhich i couldnt help loving heigh ho heigh ho carteret put in softly this becomes exciting dear witch you know i dont want to be tantalizing she answered him still pacing in the growing dimness of land and sea the dead black mass of the great ilex trees looked to touch the low hanging sky a grey gleam here and there lit the surface of the swirling tideriver the boom of the slow plunging waves came from the back of the bar and now and again wildfowl cried faint and distant out on the mudflats of the haven listen damaris said it is mournful here it tells you the same things over and over again it sort of insists on them the place seems so peaceful but it never lets you alone really and now after what happened it never leaves himthe commissioner sahibalone it repeats the same story to him over and over again it wears him as dropping water wears away stone and there is no longer the same reason for staying there was at first persuade him to go away to take me abroad and come with uscouldnt youfor a little while at least is it selfish to ask you to leave your hunting and shooting so early in the season i dont want to be selfish but he isnt well whether he isnt well in his body or only in his thinkings i cant tell but it troubles me he sleeps badly i am afraid the nights must be very long and lonely when one cant sleepif you would come it would be so lovely i should feel so safe about him you and the book should cure him between you im perfectly sure of that to have you would make us both so happy and in her innocent importunity damaris slipped her hand within colonel carterets arm sweetly coaxing him he started slightly threw back his head standing straight and tall in the mysterious twilight beside her raised his deerstalker cap for a moment letting the moist chill of the november evening dwell on his hair and forehead though very popular with women carteret had never married making a home for his elder sister mrs dreydelwidow of a friend and fellow officer in the then famous guidesand her four sturdy goodlooking boys at the norfolk manorhouse which had witnessed his own birth and those of a long line of his ancestors to bring up a family of his own in addition to his sisters would have been too costly and debt he abhorred therefore such devoirs as he paid the great goddess aphrodite were but few and fugitivehe being by nature and temperament an idealist and a notably clean liver by his abstention however sentiment was finetrained rather than extinguished his heart remained young capable of being thrilled in instant response to any appeal of high and delicate quality it thrilled very sensibly now in response to the appeal of damaris hand emphasizing her tender pleading regarding her father she touched she charmed him to an extent which obliged him rather sharply to call his senses to order hadnt he known her ever since she was a babe a span long wasnt she according to all reason a babe still in as far as any decently minded male being of his mature age could be concerned he told himself at once humorously and sternly he ought to feel so think sowhether he did or not and ought in his case was a word not to be played fast and loose with once uttered it must be obeyed wherefore thus conclusively selfadmonished he put his cap on his head again and bending a little over damaris patted her hand affectionately as it rested upon his arm very goodill hold myself and my future at your disposition he gaily said to her as much hunting and shooting as i care for will very well keep dont bother your pretty head about them during the christmas holidays my nephews will be ready enough in all conscience to let fly with my guns and ride my horses so neither will be wasted ill go along with you gladly for no man living is dearer to me than your father and no business could be more to my taste than scotching and killing the demons which plague him they plague all of us in some form or other at times as life goes on very gently he disengaged his arm from her hand take me indoors he said and give me my teaover which well further discuss plots for kidnapping verity and carrying him off south the french riviera for preferencehullowhat the deuce is that for as he spoke the two cats appearing with miraculous suddenness out of nowhereas is the custom of their priceless triberushed wildly past fierce sinuous infinitely graceful shapes leaping high in air making strange noises chirrupings and squeakings thudding of quick little paws as they chased one another round the antiquated seawardtrained cannon and pyramid of ball for a minute or so damaris watched them softly laughing then in the content bred of carterets promise and the joy of coming travel something of their frisky spirit caught her tooa spirit which for all young creatures magically haunts the dusk and as they presently fled away up the lawn damaris fled after them circling over the moist grass darting hither and thither alternately pursuing and pursued colonel carteret following soberly revolving many thoughts did not overtake her until the garden door was reached there upon the threshold the light from within covering and revealing her she awaited him her bosom rose and fell her breathing being a little hurried her face a little flushed her grave eyes sparkled and danced oh youve made me so glad so dreadfully glad she said and i never properly thanked you forgive me i never can resist themi went mad with the cats her young beauty appeared to carteret very notable and yesalthough she might disport herself in this childishly frolic fashionit was idle to call her or pretend her any longer a babe for cause to him unknown through force of some experience of which he remained ignorant she had undeniably come into the charm and mystery of her womanhooda very fair and noble blossoming before which reverently if wistfully he bowed his head its good to have you declare yourself glad dear witch in that case im glad too he answered her but as to forgiveness im inclined to hold it over until you leave off being tantalizingand upon my word i find you uncommonly far from leaving off just now you mean until i tell you what happened carteret nodded searching her face with wise fearless smiling eyes ah yes he said we can put it that way if you please damaris hesitated detecting some undercurrent of meaning which puzzled her i may never have to tell you my father may speak of itor you may just see for yourself only then thenshe with a moving earnestness prayed himbe kind be lenient dont judge harshlypromise me you wont and as she spoke her expression softened to a great and unconscious tenderness for she beheld in thought a widewinged seabird above certain letters tattooed in indigo and crimson upon the back of a lean shapely brown hand i promise you carteret said and passed in at the door marvelling somewhat sadly is it that he asked himself if so it comes early has she gone the way of all flesh and fallen in love and this conversation as shall presently be set forth ushered in that second matter of cardinal importance already referred to which for damaris marked the close of this eventful year chapter ii telling how damaris renewed her acquaintance with the beloved lady of her infancy the windows of the sittingroomupon the first floor of the long threestoried yellowpainted hotelcommanded a vast and glittering panorama of indented coastline and purple sea here and there in the middle distance little towns palewalled and glistering climbed upward amid gardens and olive yards from the rocky shore heathlands and pine groves covered the intervening headlands and steep valleys save where meadows marked the course of some descending stream to the northeast above dark wooded foothills the flushed whiteness of snowsummits cut delicately into the solid blue of the sky stretched upon the sunfaded once scarlet cushions of the windowseat damaris absorbed her fill of light and warmth and colour pleading imperative feminine mendings she stayed at home this afternoon she felt disposed to resthere in the middle of her pasture so to sayand resting both count her blessings and dream offering hospitality to all and any pleasant visions which might elect to visit her and indeed those blessings appeared a goodly company worthy of congratulation and of gratitude she let the black silk stocking the toe of which she affected to darn slip neglected on to the floor while she added up the pleasant column of them the journey might be counted as a successthat to start with for her father was certainly better readier of speech and of interest in outside things oh the dear man with the blue eyes had a marvellous hand on himtactful able devoted always serene often even gay never could there be another so perfect because so sane and comfortable a friend her debt to him was of old standing and still for ever grew how she could ever pay it she didnt know which consideration for an instant clouded her content not that she felt the obligation irksome but that out of pure affection she wanted to make him some return some acknowledgment wanted to give since to her he had so lavishly given then the bookof all carterets clever manipulations the cleverest for hadnt it begun to grip her father and that quite divertingly much he was occupied with it to the point of really being a tiny bit selfconscious and shy keen on it transparently eagerthough contemptuous in high mighty sort of course of his own eagerness when he remembered only more than half the time he so deliciously failed to rememberand with that damaris thought took another turn a more private and personal one for in truth the book gripped her too in most intimate and novel fashion revealing to her the enchantments of an art in process of being actively realized in living constructive effort herein she found not the amazement of a new thing but of a thing so natural that it appeared just a part of her very self though until now an undiscovered one to read other peoples books is a joyous employment as she well knew but to make a book all ones own self to watch and compel its growth into coherent form and purpose isso she began to suspectamong the rarest delights granted to mortal man her own share of such making in the present case was of the humblest it is true mere spade labour and hodbearingnamely writing from charles veritys dictation verifying names and dates checking references and quotations still each arresting phrase each felicitous expression the dramatic ring of some virile word the broad onward sweep of stately prose in narrative or sustained description not only charmed her ear but challenged her creative faculty she put herself to school in respect of it all learning day by day a lessonthis was the way it should be done ambition prodded her onfor mightnt she aspire to do it too some day mightnt granted patience and application the writing of books prove to be her business her vocation the idea floated before her vague as yet though infinitely beguiling whereupon the whole world took on a new significance and splendour as it needs must when nascent talent claims its own asserts its dawning right to dominion and to freedom and there the pathos of her fathers position touched her nearly for wasnt it a little cruel this remarkable gift of his should so long have lain dormant unsuspected by his friends unknown to the reading public only to disclose itself and that by the merest hazard as a last resourceit did not seem fair that he had not earlier found and enjoyed his literary birthright damaris propounded this view to colonel carteret with some heat but he smilingly discounted her fondly indignant lament better late than never anyhow my dear witch he said and just picture the satisfaction of this brilliant rally when as wed reason to believe he himself reckoned the game was up oh there are points about a tardy harvest such as this by no means to be despised thrice blessed the man who like your father finding such a harvest also finds it to be of a sort he can without scruple reap of which cryptic utterance damaris at the time couldto quote her own phrasemake no sensenor could she make sense of it now when counting her blessings she rested in happy idleness upon the faded scarlet cushions of the windowseat she remembered the occasion quite well on which carteret thus expressed himself one afternoon during their stay in paris on the southward journey she had worn a new myrtlegreen blackbraided furtrimmed cloth pelisse and hat to match as she also remembered bought the day before at a fascinating shop in the rue castiglione agreeably conscious her clothes were not only very much the right thing but decidedly becoming she had gone with him to pay a visit of ceremony at the convent schoolnear the church of st germainlespreswhere as a little girl of six fresh from india and the high dignities of the bhutpur sultanibagh she had been deposited by her fathers old friend mrs john pereira who had brought her and sarah watson her nurse back to europe the sojourn at the conventonce the surprise of translation from east to west from reigning princess to little scholar was surmountedproved fertile in gentle memories the visit of today not only revived these memories but added to their number for it passed off charmingly carteret seemed by no means out of place among the nunswellbred and gracious women of hidden consecrated lives they indeed appeared instinctively drawn to him and fluttered round him in the sweetest fashion imaginable he meanwhile bearing himself towards them with an exquisite and simple courtesy beyond all praise never had damaris admired the man with the blue eyes more never felt a more perfect trust in him than when beholding him as mousquetaire au couvent thus as they emerged again into the clear atmosphere and resonance of the paris streets and made their way back by the rue du bac the pont royal and the gardens of the tuileries to their hotel in the rue de rivoli carteret spoke reverently of the religious life and the marvellous adaptability of the catholic system to every need every attitude of the human heart and conscience he spoke further of the loss those inevitably sustain whofrom whatever causestand outside the creeds unable to set their spiritual godward hopes and aspirations within a definite external framework of doctrine and practice hallowed by tradition i could almost wish those dear holy women had gathered your little soul into the fold when they had you in their keeping and made a good catholic of you dearest witch he told her it would have been a rather flagrant case of cradlesnatching i own but i cant help thinking it would have simplified many difficulties for you and raised a good many too damaris gaily answered him for aunt harriet cowden would have been furious and aunt felicia distressed and distracted and poor nanniethough she really got quite tame with the sisters and came to respect them in the endwould have broken her heart at my being taught to worship images and have believed hell yawned to devour me oh i think it was more fair to waitall the same i loved their religioni love it still go on loving it he bade herand at once turned the conversation to other themesthat of her father charles verity among them and the book on afghanistan the fair copy of the opening chapters of which was just completed then the stimulating insistent vivacity of paris going a little to damaris headsince urging as always to fullness of enterprise fullness of endeavour giving as always immense joy and value to the very fact of livingshe lamented the late development of her fathers literary genius a lament which called forth carterets consolatory rejoinder along with thisto hercryptic assertion as to the thrice blessed state of the man whose harvest when tardy is of a description he need not scruple to reap why she asked herself should he have said that unless with reference to himself reference to some private harvest which he himself scrupled to reap damaris slipped her feet from the cushioned windowseat to the floor and stooping down recovered her fallen black silk stocking she felt disturbed slightly consciencestricken for it had never occurred to her strong able serene of humour and of countenance as he was that the man with the blue eyes could have personal worries thingsas she put ithe wanted yet doubted whether he ought to have surely his unfailing helpfulness and sympathy gave him the right in feesimple to anything and everything he might happen to covet that he should covet what was wrong what was selfish detrimental to others seemed incredible and the generous pity of her youthful tenderness her impatience of all privation all disappointment or denial for those she held in affection overflowed in her she longed to do whatever would greatly please him to procure for him whatever he wanted wouldnt it be delicious to do thatif she could only find out but this last brought her up against a disquieting lesson lately learnednamely against recognition of how very far the lives of meneven those we know most dearly and closelyand the lives of us women are really apart she thought of her father and darcy faircloth and their entirely unsuspected relation this dulled the edge of her enthusiasm for wasnt it only too probably the same with them all loyalty compelled the question had not every man a secret or secrets only penetrable both for his peace of mind and for your own at considerable risk damaris planted her elbows on the windowsill her chin in the hollow of her hands her eyes were solemn her face grave with thoughtverily the increase of knowledge is the increase of perplexity if not of actual sorrow even the apparently safest and straightest paths are beset with pitfall and with gin for whoso studies to pursue truth and refuse subscription to illusion your charity should be wide as the world towards others towards yourself narrow as a hair lest you condone your own weakness greed or error of temptation to any save very venial sins damaris had in her own person little conception as yetstill to a maiden of eighteen though she may have a generous proportion of health and beauty sufficient fortune and by no means contemptible intelligence noble instincts complications and distresses both of the practical and theoretic order may and do at times occur damaris suffered the shock of such now and into what further jungles of cheerless speculation she might have been projected it is impossible to say had not persons and events close at hand claimed her attention the grand hotel at st augustin is situated upon a long narrow promontory which juts out into the sea at right angles to the main trend of the coastline it faces east turning its back upon the little townbuilt on the site of a roman colonial city originally named in honour of the pagan emperor rather than the christian confessor and ascetic mediaeval piety bestowed on it the saintly prefix along with a roundarched cathedral church of no great size but massive proportions and somewhat gloomy aspect from the terrace garden and carriage drive immediately in front of the hotel the ground drops sharply beneath scattered pines with undergrowth of heather wild lavender gumcistus juniper mastic and myrtle to the narrow white beach a hundred feet below little paths traverse the rough descent and up one of these halting to rest now and then on a conveniently placed bench in the shade of some spreading umbrella pine to discourse to the company of gentlemen following in her wake or contemplate the view came a notably graceful and telling figure as the lady advanced with leisurely composure damaris gazing down from her point of vantage in the first floor window received the impression of a person almost extravagantly finished and feminine in which all irregularities and originalities of nature had suffered obliteration by the action of art not art of the grosser sort dependent on dyes paint and cosmetics the obliteration was not superficial merely and must have been achieved by processes at once subtle and profound the result obtained however showed unquestionably charmingif in a line slightly finical and exoticas she picked her way through the fragrant undergrowth of the pine wood slanting sunshine playing on her dark blue raiment widebrimmed white hat and floating veil coming completely into view at last when stepping from the path on to the level carriage drive a gold chain she wore from which dangled a little bunch of trinkets and a longhandled lorgnette glinted catching the light damaris gave an exclamation of sudden and rapturous recognition so far she had had eyes for the lady only but now she took a rapid scrutiny of the latters attendants with two of them she was unacquainted the other two were her father and carteret whereupon rapture gave place to a pang of jealous alarm and resentment for they belonged to her those dear two and to see them even thus temporarily appropriated by someone else caused her surprising agitation they had been so good so apparently content alone with her upon this journey it would be too trying too really intolerable to have outsiders interfere and break up their delightful solitude a trois their delightful intercourse yet almost immediately the girl flushed going hot all over with shame scolding herself for even passing entertainment of such unworthy and selfish emotions for it is henrietta pereira she said half aloud my own darling longago henrietta who used to be so beautifully kind to me and give me presents i loved above everything and after a pause the note of alarm sounding again though modified to wistfulness will she care for me still and shall i still care for herbut i must carei mustnow im grown up to set which disturbing questions finally at rest being a valiant young creature damaris permitted herself no second thoughts no vacillation or delay but went straight downstairs and crossing the strip of terrace garden bareheaded as she was waited at the head of the steps leading up from the carriage drive to greet the idol of her guileless infancy to colonel carteret who bringing up the rear of the little procession was the first to notice her advent she made a touching and gallant picture her face had gone very pale and he saw or fancied he saw her lips tremble but her solemn eyes shone with a steady light and whatever the excitement affecting her she held it bravely in check noting all which he could not but speculate as to whether she had any knowledge of a certain romantic attachmentculminating on the one hand in an act of virtuous treachery on the other in an act of renunciationwhich had overshadowed and wrenched from its natural sequence so large a portion of her fathers life he earnestly hoped she was ignorant of all that although the act of renunciation made for her damaris sake represented a magnificent gesture if an exaggerated and almost fanatical one on charles veritys part it gave the measure of the mans fortitude the measure of his paternal devotion still knowledge of it might only too readily prove a heavy burden to a young girls imaginative and tender conscience yeshe hoped she had been spared that knowledge if she had escaped it thus faras he reflected not without amusementthe other actor in that rather tragic drama now so unexpectedly and arrestingly present in the flesh could be trusted not to enlighten her he knew henrietta pereira of old bless her hard little heart not only did she detest tragedy but positively revelled in any situation where clever avoidance of everything even remotely approaching it was open to her she ruled the sublime and the ridiculous alike impartially out of the social relation and that with so light though determined a touch so convincing yet astute a tact and delicacy you were constrained not only to submit to but applaud her strategy had she not within the very last hour given a masterly example of her powers in this line for when he carteret and charles verity strolling in all innocence along the shore path back from st augustin had to their infinite astonishment met her and her attendant swains face to face she hadnt turned a hair her nerve was invincible after clasping the hand of each in turn with the prettiest enthusiasm she had introducedmy husband general fraylingmr marshall wace his cousin with the utmost composure thus making over to them any awkwardness which might be going and effectually ridding herself of it carteret felt his jaw drop for the momenthe had heard of john pereiras death two years ago and welcomed the news on her account since if report said true that dashing cavalry officer had taken to evil courses gambling and liquor made him a nuisance not to say disgrace to his regiment and how much greater a one to his wife poor thing she must have had a lot to endure and that of the most sordid it wasnt nice to think about clearly pereiras removal afforded matter for thankfulness but of this speedy reconstruction on her part in the shape of a third matrimonial venture he had heard never a word how would verity take itapparently with a composure as complete as her ownand then the inherent humour of the position and her immense skill and coolness in the treatment of it came uppermost carteret felt bound to support her and help her out by accepting her little old generalleanshanked and livery with pompously outstanding chest aggressive white moustache and mild appealing eyeas a matter of course bound to buck him up and encourage him in the belief he struck a stranger as the terrible fellow he would so like to be and so very much feared that he wasnt carterets large charity came into play in respect of the superannuated warrior who presented a pathetically inadequate effect specially when seen as now alongside charles verity surely the contrast must hit the fair henrietta rather hard carteret expended himself in kindly civilities therefore going so far as to say sir once or twice in addressing frayling whereat the latters timorous step grew almost jaunty and his chest more than ever inflated if henrietta carried things off to admiration in the first amazement of impact she carried them off equally to admiration in her meeting with damaris it was the prettiest little scene in the world for reaching up and placing her hands on the girls shoulders her chiselled facedistinct yet fragile in outline as some rare cameosuffused for once with transparent shelllike pink she kissed damaris on either cheek ah precious child most precious child she fondly murmured what an enchanting surprise how little i imagined such a joy was in store for me when i came out this afternoon and louder for the benefit of the assistants yeshere are my husband general frayling and mr wace his cousinhe shall sing to you some daythat by the waywho is travelling with us but they must talk to you later i cant spare you to them now i am greedy after our long separation and want to have you all to myself and including the four gentlemen in a gesture of friendly farewell she put her arm round damaris waist gently compelling her in the direction of a group of buffpainted iron chairs placed in a semicircle in the shade of ilex and pine trees at the end of the terrace i have so much to hear she said so many dropped threads to pick up and it is impossible to talk comfortably and confidentially in a crowd our men must really contrive to play about by themselves for a little while and leave me to enjoy you in peace but wont they mind damaris asked upon whom the spell of the elder womans personality began sensibly to work let them mind let them mind she threw off airily in answer so much the better it will do them good it is excellent discipline for men to find they cant always have exactly their own way which assertion served to dissipate any last remnant of jealous alarm damaris mind may have unconsciously harboured in its place shy curiosity blossomed and quick intimate pleasure in so perfectly fashioned and furnished a creature for wasnt her childish adoration fully justified wasnt her darling henrietta a being altogether captivating and unique damaris loved the feeling of that arm and hand lightly clasping her waist loved the faint fragrancehadnt it intoxicated her baby sensespervading henriettas hair her clothes her whole pretty person loved the tinkle of the bunch of trinkets dangling from the long chain which reached below her waist she had feared disappointment that as she now perceived was altogether superfluous henrietta enthralled her eyes enthralled her affection she longed to protect to serve her to stand between her and every rough wind which blew because she was so pretty so extraordinarily and completely civilized from head to foot no doubt in the generosity of her youthful inexperience damaris exaggerated the ladys personal charm yet the dozen years interveningsince their last meetinghad in truth dealt mercifully with the latters good looks a trifle pinched a trifle faded she might be as compared with the henrietta of twelve years ago but immediately such damage such wear and tear of the fleshly garment showed at its least conspicuous she negotiated the double encounter as carteret had noted with admirable sangfroid but not as to the first one in any case without considerably greater inward commotion than he gave her credit for she was in fact keyed up by it excited taken out of herself to an unprecedented extent her native optimism and egoism in singular disarray yet thereby through that very excitement she recaptured for the time being the physical loveliness of an earlier period beauty is very much a matter of circulation and the blood cantered not to say galloped through henriettas veins the sight of charles verity did indeed put back the clock for her in most astounding sort henrietta was no victim of impulse each of her three marriages had been dictated by convenience carefully thought out and calculated over neither husband had she for ever so brief a period lost her head but over charles verity she had come perilously near losing itonce that it is not too much to say constituted the greatest sensation the greatest emotion of her experience as a rule the most trying and embarrassing part of encountering a former lover is that you wonder what under heaven induced you to like him so well here the position was reversed so that henrietta wonderedwith a sickening little contraction of the heartwhat under heaven had prevented her liking him much more why under heaven she ever let him go of course as things turned out it was all for the best since her insensibility made for righteousness or anyhow for respectabilityin the opinion of the world the same if not an even superior article she ought to congratulate herself ought to feel thankful only just now she didnt on the contrary she was shakenconsciously and most uncomfortably shaken to the very deepest of such depths as her shallow soul could boastsitting here on a buffpainted chair in the shade of the pines and ilex trees in company with damaris holding the girls hand in both her own with a clinging slightly insistent pressure as it rested upon her lap dearest child i believe though you have grown so tall i should have recognized you anywhere she said and i you damaris echoed i did i did after just the first little minute ah youve a memory for faces too her glance wandered to the group of men gathered before the hotel porticosir charles and general frayling side by side engaged in civil if not particularly animated conversation the two voices reached her with a singular difference of timbre and of tone carteret spoke apparently making some proposition some invitation in response to which the four passed into the house henrietta settled herself in her chair with a movement of sensible relief while they remained there she must look and it was not quite healthy to lookher good little old general who only asked respectfully to adore and follow in her wakea man of few demands and quite tidy fortuneand after poor besotted blustering gambling squashily sentimental and tearful johnnie pereira wasnt he a haven of restoh positively a haven of rest all the same she preferred his not standing there in juxtaposition to charles verity she much preferred their all going indoorscarteret along with the rest if it came to that she turned and smiled upon damaris however good your memory for faces may be i find it very sweet you should have recognized mine after just the first little minute she said with a coaxing touch of mimicry you havent quite parted company with the baby i remember so well even yet i used to call you my downy owl with solemn saucer eyes and fierce little beak you were extraordinarily really perplexingly like your father then a miniature edition but so faithful to the original it used sometimes to give me the quaintest jump henrietta mused raising one hand and fingering the lace at her throat as seeking to loosen it damaris watched fascinated in a way troubled by her extreme prettiness every point every detail was so engagingly complete you are like sir charles still but i see something which is not himthe personal equation i suppose developing in you the element which is individual exclusively your own and yourself i should enjoy exploring that she looked at damaris very brightly for an instant then looked down i want to hear more about sir charles she said of all the distinguished men i have been fortunate enough to know whowho have let me be their friend no one has ever interested me more than he we have known one another ever since i was a girl and his career meant so much to me i followed it closely rejoiced in his promotion his successes felt indignantand said sowhen he met with adverse criticism i am speaking of his indian career when he accepted that afghan command it made a break we lost touch which i regretted immensely from that time onward i only knew what any and everybody might know from the newspapersexcept occasionally when i happened to meet colonel carteret the explanation was lengthy laboured not altogether spontaneous damaris vaguely mystified by it made no comment henrietta raised her head glancing round from under lowered eyelids you appreciate the everfaithful carteret she asked an edge of eagerness in her voice the dear man with the blue eyes of course i love him we both love him almost better than anybody in the world damaris warmly declared and he manifestly returns your affection but dearest child why almost is that reservation intentional or merely accidental then seeing the girls colour rise perhaps its hardly a fair question forgive me i forgot how long it is since we met forgot im not after all talking to the precious little downy owl who had no more serious secrets than such as might concern her large family of dolls i am not sure the almost was quite true damaris put in hastily her cheeks more than ever aflame yes it was most delicious childi protest it was and im not sure im altogether sorry slightly daintily she kissed the flaming cheek but i do love colonel carteret damaris repeated with much wideeyed earnestness i trust him and depend on him as i do on nobody else almost nobody else damaris shook her head she felt a wee bit disappointed in henrietta this persistence displeased her as trivial as lacking in perfection of breeding and taste quite nobody she said and without permitting time for rejoinder launched forth into the subject of the book on the campaigns of shere ali which as she explained had been undertaken at carterets suggestion and with such encouraging result she waxed eloquent regarding the progress of the volume and its high literary worth but i was a little nervous lest my father should lose his interest and grow slack when we were alone and hed only me to talk things over with and to consult so i begged colonel carteret to come abroad with us ah i seequite so henrietta murmured it was at your request yes he was beautifully kind as he always is he agreed at once gave up all his own plans and came and stayshenrietta said yes for the present but to tell the truth im worried about his staying whyagain with a just perceptible edge of eagerness because of course i have no right to trade on his kindness even for my fathers sake or the sake of the book and that is your only reason isnt it more than reason enough there must be other people who want him and things of his own he wants to do it would be odiously selfish of me to interfere by keeping him tied here i have wondered lately whether i oughtnt to speak to him about it and urge his going home i was worrying rather over that when you arrived this afternoon and then the gladness of seeing you put it out of my head but how i wish you would advise me henrietta if its not troubling you too much you and they have been friends so long and you must know so much better than i can whats right tell me what is my dutyabout his staying i meanto to them both do you think henrietta frayling did not answer at once her delicate features perceptibly sharpened and hardened her lips becoming thin as a thread youre not vexed with me i havent been tiresome and asked you something i shouldnt damaris softly exclaimed smitten with alarm of unintended and unconscious offence nonobut you put a difficult question since i have only impressions and those of the most fugitive to guide me personally i am always inclined to leave well alone but is this welltheres just the point you are very anxious yes i am very anxious you see i care dreadfully much henrietta bent down giving her attention to an inch of kilted silk petticoat showing where it should not beneath the hem of her blue skirt i hesitate to give you advice but i can give you my impressionsfor what they may be worth seeing colonel carteret this afternoon he struck me as being in excellent caseenviably young for his years and content you thought so yet thats just what has worried me once or twice lately i have not been sure he was quite content oh you put it too high henrietta threw off can one ever be sure anyoneeven ones own poor selfis quite content and she looked round bringing the whole artillery of her still great if waning loveliness suddenly to bear upon damaris dazzling charming confusing her as she said my precious child has it never occurred to you colonel carteret may stay on not against has will but very much with it or occurred to you further not only that the pleasures of your fathers society are by no means to be despised but that you yourself are a rather remarkable productas quaintly engagingly clever as you arewellshall we sayhandsome damaris i am deputed to enquire whether you propose to take tea indoors miss verity or have it brought to you here and in the latter case whether we have leave to join you the speaker marshall wacea young man of about thirty years of agemay be described as soft in make in colouring slightly hectic in manner a subtle cross between the theatrical and the parsonic which let it be added is by no means to condemn him wholesale laugh him off the stage or out of the pulpit in certain circles indeed these traits this blend won for him unstinted sympathy and approval he possessed talents in plenty and these of an order peculiarly attractive to the amateur because tentative rather than commanding among his intimates he was seen and spoken of as one cloaked with the pathos of thwarted aspirations better health less meagre private means and a backing of influence what might he not have done his star might have flamed to the zenith meanwhile it was a privilege to help him to such extent as his extreme delicacy of feeling permitted that it really permitted a good deal one way or another displaying considerable docility under the infliction of benefits would have been coarse to perceive and unpardonably brutal to mentionsuch anyhow was the opinion held by his cousin general frayling at whose expense he now enjoyed a recuperative sojourn upon the french riviera some people in short have a gift of imposing themselves and marshall wace may be counted among that conveniently endowed band he imposed himself now upon one at least of his hearers for though the address might seem studied the voice delivering it was agreeable causing damaris for the first time consciously to notice this member of mrs fraylings retinue she felt amiably disposed towards him since his intrusion closed a conversation causing her no little disturbance of mind henriettas last speech in particular set her nerves tingling with most conflicting emotions if henrietta so praised her that praise must be deserved for who could be better qualified to give judgment on such a subject than the perfectly equipped henrietta yet she shrank in distaste touched in her maiden modesty and pride from so frank an exposition of her own charms it made her feel unclothed stripped in the marketplaceso to speakand shamed secretly she had always hoped she was pretty rather than plain she loved beauty and therefore naturally desired to possess it but to have the fact of that possession thus baldly stated was another matter it made her feel unnatural as though joined to a creature with whom she was insufficiently acquainted whose ways might not be her ways or its thoughts her thoughts therefore the young man marshall wace coming as a seasonable diversion from these extremely personal piercings and probings found greater favour in her eyes than he otherwise might and this with results for damaris gratitude once engaged disdained to criticize invariably tending to err on the supergenerous side yes they would all have tea out here if henrietta was willing and if henrietta would for the moment excuse her she would go and order hordleher fathers manto see to the preparation of it himself foreign waiters whatever their ability in other departments have no natural understanding of a teapot and are liable to the weirdest ideas of cutting bread and butter with which conscious she was guilty of somewhat incoherent chatter damaris sprang up and swung away along the terrace through the clear tonic radiance buoyant as a caged bird set free go with her marshall go with her mrs frayling imperatively bade him and leave you cousin henrietta she rose with a petulant gesture yes go at once or you wont overtake her i am tired really wretchedly tiredand am best left alone chapter iii which concerns itself incidentally with the grief of a victim of circumstance and the reception of a belated christmas greeting henrietta frayling left the grand hotel that afternoon in a chastened frame of mind misgivings oppressed her she doubtedand even more than doubtedwhether she had risen to the full height of her own reputation whether she had not allowed opportunity to elude her whether she had not lost ground difficult to regain the affair was so astonishingly sprung upon her the initial impact she withstood unbrokenand from this she derived a measure of consolation but afterwards she weakened she had felt too muchand that proved her undoing it is foolish because disabling to feel her treatment of damaris she condemned as mistaken admitting a point of temper it is hard to forgive the younger generation their youth the infinite attraction of their ingenuous freshness the fact that they have the ball at their feet hence she avoided the society of the young of her own sexas a rule girls are trying when pretty and intelligent hardly less tryingthough for other reasonswhen the reverse boys she tolerated in the eyes of young men she sunned herself taking her ease since these are slow to criticize swift to believebetween eighteen and eightandtwenty that iswe speak of the midvictorian era and then obtaining masculine strain misgivings continued to pursue her during the ensuing evening and even interfered with her slumbers during the night thismost unusual occurrencerendered her fretful she reproached her tractable and distressed little general with having encouraged her to walk much too far in future he swore to insist on the carriage however confidently she might assert the need of active exertion she pointed out the fallacy of rushing to extremes which rather cruelly floored him since rushing in any shape or form had conspicuously passed out of his programme some considerable time ago my wife is not at all herself he told marshall wace at breakfast next morningquite overdone i am sorry to say and upset i blame myself i must keep a tight hand on her and forbid over exertion with a small spoon savagely daringly he beat in the top of his boiled egg i must be more watchful he added her nervous energy is deceptive i must refuse to let it override my better judgment and take me in by luncheon time however henrietta was altogether herself save for a pretty pensiveness and emerged with all her accustomed amiability from this temporary eclipse the fraylings occupied a small detached villa built in the grounds of the hotel de la plagea rival and venerably senior establishment to the grand hotelsituate just within the confines of st augustin where the town curves along the glistering shore to the western horn of the little bay at the back of it runs the historic high road from marseilles to the italian frontier passing through cannes and nice behind it too runs the railway with its many tunnels following the same though a somewhat less serpentine course along the gracious coast to the exangloindian woman society is as imperative a necessity as water to a fish she must foregather or life loses all its savour must entertain be entertained rub shoulders generally or she is lost henrietta frayling suffered the accustomed fate though to speak of rubbing shoulders in connection with her is to express oneself incorrectly to the verge of grossness her shoulders were of an order far too refined to rub or be rubbed nevertheless after the shortest interval consistent with selfrespect such society as st augustin and its neighbourhood afforded found itself enmeshed in her dainty net mrs fraylings villa became a centre where all englishspeaking persons met there she queened it with her general as loyal henchman and marshall wace as a professor of drawingroom talents of most varied sort discovery of the party at the grand hotel took the gilt off the gingerbread of such queenings to a marked extent making them look makeshifty lamentably secondrate and cheap hence henriettas fretfulness in part for with the exception of lady hermione twellswidow of a once colonial governorand the honourable mrs callowgas nee de brett relict of a former bishop of harchester they were but scratch pack these local guests of hers soon however a scheme of putting that discovery to use broke in on her musings the old friendship must she feared be counted dead general fraylings existence in the capacity of husband rendered any resurrection of it impracticable she recognized that yet exhibition of its tombstone were such exhibition compassable could not fail to bring her honour and respect she would shine by a reflected light her glory all the greater that the witnesses of it were themselves obscurelady hermione and mrs callowgas excepted of course carterets goodnature could be counted on to bring him to the villa and damaris must be annexed assuming the role and attitude of a vicarious motherhood henrietta herself could hardly fail to gain distinction it was a touching partspecially when played by a childless woman only a littleyes really only quite a littlepast her prime here indeed was a great idea as she came to grasp the possibilities and scope of it as chaperon to damaris how many desirable doors would be open to her delicately henrietta hugged herself perceiving that other things being equal her own career was by no means ended yet through damaris might she not very well enter upon a fresh and effective phase of it how often and how ruefully had she revolved the problem of advancing age questioning how gracefully to confront that dreaded enemy and endure its rather terrible imposition of hands without too glaring a loss of prestige and popularity might not damaris childish infatuation offer a solution of that haunting problem always supposing the infatuation could be revived be recreated ah what a doubledyed idiot she had been yesterday in permitting feeling to outrun judgmentwith the liveliest satisfaction henrietta could have boxed her own pretty ears in punishment of her passing weaknessyet surely time still remained wherein to retrieve her error and restore her ascendency damaris might be unusually clever but she was also finely inexperienced malleable open to influence as yet let henrietta then see to it and that without delay or hesitation bringing to bear every ingenious social art andif necessaryartifice in which long practice had made her proficient to begin with she would humble herself by writing a sweet little letter to damaris in it she would both accuse and excuse her maladroitness of yesterday pleading the shock of so unlookedfor a coming together and the host of memories evoked by itwould urge how deeply it affected her overcame her in fact rendering her incapable of saying half the affectionate things it was in her heart to say she might touch on the subject of damaris personal appearance again which by literally taking her breath away had contributed to her general undoingon second thoughts however she decided it would be politic to avoid that particular topic since damaris was evidently a little shy in respect of her own beautyhenrietta smiled to herselfthat is a form of shyness exceedingly juvenile shortlived enough marshall should act as her messenger she beingas she could truthfully avereager her missive might reach its destination with all possible despatch a letter moreover delivered by hand takes on an importance makes a claim on the attention greater than that of one received by post there is a personal gesture in the former mode of transmission by no means to be despised in delicate operations such as the presenti want to set myself right with you at once dearest child in case as i fear you may have a little misunderstood me yesterday accident having so strangely restored us to one another i long to hold you closely if you will let me do soyes it should run thus the theme embroidered with highflashing colour of eastern reminiscencethe great subtropic garden of the sultanibagh for example its palms orange grove and lotus tank the call of the green parrots chant of the wellcoollie and creak of the primitive wooden gearing as the yoke of cream white oxen trotted down and laboriously backed up the walled slope to the wellhead mrs frayling set herself to produce a very pretty piece of sentiment nicely turned decorated worded and succeeded to her own satisfaction might not she too at this rate claim possession of the literary giftunder stress of circumstance the idea was a new one it amused her and what if damaris elected to show this precious effusion to her father sir charles well if the girl did she did it might just conceivably work on him also to the restoration of pastinfatuationhenrietta left the exact term in doubt but her hope of such result was of the smallest exhibition of a tombstone was the most she could count uponmore probably he would regard it critically cynically putting his finger through her specious phrases she doubted his forgiveness of a certain act of virtuous treachery even yet although he had in a measure condoned her commission of it by making use of her on one occasion since namely that of her bringing damaris back twelve years ago to europe but whether his attitude were cynical or not he would hold his peace such cogent reasons existed for silence on his part that if he did slightly distrust her hold her a little cheap he would hardly venture to say as much least of all to damarisventure or condescendagain mrs frayling left the term in doubt and went forward with her schemes which did unquestionably just now add a pleasing zest to life the innocent subject of these machinations received both the note and its bearer in a friendly spirit though she was already as it happened rich in letters today the biweekly packet from deadhamaddressed in mary fishers careful copybook handarrived at luncheon time and contained among much of apparently lesser interest a diverting chronicle of tom veritys impressions and experiences during the first six weeks of his indian sojourn the young mans gaily selfconfident humour had survived his transplantation he wrote in high feather quite unabashed by the novelty of his surroundings yet not forgetting to pay honour where honour was due it has been roses roses all the way thanks to sir charless introductions for which i can never be sufficiently grateful he told her they have procured me no end of delightful hospitality from the great ones of the local earth and really priceless opportunities of getting into touch with questions of ruling importance over here i am letting my people at home know how very much i owe and always shall owe to his kindness in using his influence on my behalf at the start damaris glowed responsive to this fine flourish of a tone and passed the letter across the small round dinner table to her father opened a fat packet enclosed in an envelope of exaggerated tenuity from miss felicia only to put it aside in favour of another letter bearing an italian stamp and directed in a to her unfamiliar hand this was modest in bulk as compared with miss felicias but while examining it while touching it even damaris became aware of an inward excitement of a movement of tenderness not to be ignored or denied startled by her own prescience and the agitation accompanying it she looked up quickly to find carteret watching her whereupon mutely instinctively her eyes besought him to ask no questions make no comment for an appreciable space he kept her in suspense his glance holding and challenging hers in close observation then as though not without a measure of struggle granting her request he smiled at her and turning his attention to the contents of his plate quietly went on with the business of luncheon damaris meanwhile consciencestrickenshe couldnt tell whyby this silent interchange of intelligence this silent demand on his forbearance on his connivance in her secrecy laid the letter face downwards on the white tablecloth unopened later sir charles verity being busy with his english correspondence and carteret having disappearedgone for a solitary walk as she divined being as she feared not quite pleased with hershe read it in the security of her bedroom seated for greater ease upon the polished parquet floor just inside an open southwardfacing french window where the breeze coming up off the sea gently fanned her face the letter began without preamble we made this portgenoalast night all day we have been discharging cargo half my crew has gone ashore set on liquoring and wenching after the manner of unregenerate sailormen all the world over the other half follows their bad example tomorrow as we shall be lying idle in honour of the christmas festival on board discipline is as strict as i know how to make it but ashore my hand is lifted off them so long as they turn up on time they are free to follow their fancy even though it lead them to smutty places my own fancies dont happen to lie that way for which i in nowise praise myself it is an affair of absence of inclination rather than overmuch active virtue i am really no better than they seeing i yield to the only temptation which takes methe temptation to write to you i have resisted it times out of number since i bade you goodbye at the hard but christmasnight turns one a bit soft and craving for sight and touch of those who belong to one so much i dare say though i go back on nothing i said to you then about the keeping up of decent barriers only being christmasnightsoft i give myself the licence of a holidayfor once the night is clear as glass and the city rises in a great semicircle pierced by and outlined in twinkling lights right up to the ring of forts crowning the hills where the sky beginsa sky smothered in stars i have been out on deck looking at it all at the black masts and funnels of the ships ranging to right and left against the glare of the town and at the oily black water thick with floating filth and garbage and with wandering reflections like jewels and precious metals on the surface of itthe rummiest mixture of fair and foul and then all that faded out somehowand i saw black water again but clean this time and with no reflections under a closedrawn veil of falling rain and i felt to lift you out of the boat and carry you in across the lawn and up to your room and then i could not hold out against temptation any longer but came here into my cabin and sat down to write to you the picture of you wet and limp and helpless in my arms is always with me stamped on the very substance of my brain as is the other picture of you in the drawingroom lined with bookcases where we found one another for the second time found one another in spirit i mean an almost terribly greater finding than the first one because it can go on for ever as it belongs to the part of us which does not die that is my faith anyhow tomorrow morning i will go ashore and into one of those big tawdry genoa churches and listen to the music standing in some quiet corner and think about you and renew my vows to you it wont be half bad to keep christmas that way i dont pretend to be a great letterwriter so if this one has funny fashions to it you must forgive both them and me i write as i feel and must leave it so the voyage has been good and my poor old tub has behaved herself kept afloat and done her best bravely if a bit wheezingly in some rather nasty seas when we are through here i take her across to tripoli and back along the african coast to algiers then across to marseilles i reckon to reach there in six weeks or two months from now you might perhaps be willing to write a line to me thereto the care of my owners messrs denniver holland co their office is in the cannebiere i dont ask you to do this but only tell you i should value it more than you can quite knownow my holiday is over and i will close down till next christmasnightunless miracles happen meanwhileso goodbyehere is a boatload of my lads coining alongside roaring with song and as drunk as lordsgod bless you in spirit i once again kiss your dear feet your brother till death and after darcy faircloth dazed enchanted held captive by the secular magic pertaining to those who go down to the sea in ships and ply their calling in the great waters held captive too by the mysterious prenatal sympathies which unite those who come of the same blood damaris stayed very still sitting childlike upon the bare polished floor while the wind murmured through the spreading pines shading the terrace below and gently fanned her throat and temples for faircloths letter seemed to her very wonderful alike in its vigour its simplicity andher lips quiveredits revelation of lovinghow he caredand how he went on caringthere were coarse words in it the meaning of which she neither knew nor sought to know but she did not resent them the letter indeed would have lost some of its living force its convincing reality had they been omitted they rang true to her ear and just because they rang true the rest rang blessedly true as well she gloried in the whole therefore breathing through it a larger air of faith and hope and confident fortitude the kindred qualities of her own heart and intelligence the flush of her fine enthusiasm sprang to meet and join with the fineness of it its richness of promise and of good omen for a time mind and emotion remained thus in stable and exalted equilibrium then as enchantment reached its necessary term and her apprehensions and thought began to work more normally she badly wanted someone to speak to she wanted to bear witness to testify to pour forth both the moving tale and her own sensations into the ear of some indulgent and friendly listener sheshewanted to tell colonel carteret about it to enlist his interest to read him in part at least darcy faircloths letter and hear his confirmation of the noble spirit she discerned in it its poetry its charm for the dear man with the blue eyes would understand of that she felt confident understand fullyand it would set her right with him if as she suspected he was not somehow quite pleased with her she caressed the idea while so doing silence and concealment grew increasingly irksome to her oh she wanted to speakand to her father she could not speak with that both damaris attitude and expression changed the glory abruptly departing she got up off the floor left the window and sat down very soberly in a redvelvet covered armchair placed before the flat stone hearth piled with wood ashes there truly was the fly in the ointment the abiding smirch on the otherwise radiant surfaceas she now hailed itof this strangely moving fraternal relation the fact of it did come and as she feared would inevitably continue to come between her and her father marring to an appreciable degree their mutual confidence and sympathy at deadham he had braced himself to deal with the subject in a spirit of rather magnificent selfabnegation but the effort had cost him more than she quite cared to estimate in lowered pride and moral suffering it had told on not only his mental but his physical health now that he was in great measure restored his humour no longer saturnine he no longer remote sunk in himself and inaccessible it would be not only injudicious but selfish to the verge of active cruelty to press the subject again upon his notice to propose further concessions or further recognition of its existence she couldnt ask that of himten thousand times no she couldnt ask itthough not to ask it was to let the breach in sympathy and confidence widen silently and grow so much was sadly clear to her she unfolded faircloths letter and read it through a second time in vain hope of discovering some middle way some leading read it feeling the first enchantment but all crosshatched now and seamed with perplexity and regret for decent barriers must stand he declared which meant concealment indefinitely prolonged the love of brother and sister wasted starved to the mean proportions of an occasional furtive letter sacrificed with all its possibilities of present joy and future comfort to hide the passage of longago wrongdoing in which it had its source her hesitation went a step behind this presently arguing as to how that could be sin which produced so gracious a result it wasnt logical an evil tree should bear such conspicuously good fruit yet conscience and instinct assured her the tree was indeed evila thing of license of unruly passion upon which she might not look had it not been her first thoughtwhen faircloth told her drifting down the tideriver in the chill and darkthat he must feel sad feel angry having been wronged by the manner of his birth he had answered yes thereby admitting the inherent evil of the tree of which his existence was the fruitadding but not often and not for long since he esteemed the gift of life too highly to be overnice as to the exact method by which he became possessed of it he palliated therefore he excused but he did not deny by this time damaris mind wheeled in a vicious circle perpetually swinging round to the original startingpoint the moral puzzle proved too complicated for her the practical one equally hard of solution she stood between them her father and her brother their interests conflicted as did the duty she owed each and her heart her judgment her piety were torn two ways at once would it always be thusor would the pull of one prove conclusively the stronger would she be compelled finally to choose between them not that either openly did or ever would strive to coerce her both were honourable both magnanimous and out of her heart she desired to serve both justly and equallyonlyonlyupon youth the pull of youth is very great she put her hands over her eyes shrinking frightened was it possible she loved darcy faircloth best a knocking damaris slipped the letter into the pocket of her dress and rising crossed the room and opened the door hordle stood in the pale spacious corridor without he presented marshall waces card the gentleman he said rather huffily had called bringing a message from mrs frayling as hordle understood which he requested to deliver to miss damaris in person he begged her to believe he was in no hurry if she was engaged he could perfectly well waithe would do so in the hotel drawingroom until it was convenient to her to allow him a few minutes conversation so for the second time this young mans intrusion proved by no means unwelcome as offering damaris timely escape she went down willingly to receive him yesterday he struck her as a pleasant and agreeable personand of a type with which she was unacquainted it would be interesting to talk to himshe felt anxious moreover to learn what henrietta lovely if not entirely satisfactory henrietta could possibly want chapter iv blowing of ones own trumpet practised as a fine art the slender little corsican horses redchestnut in colour and active as cats trotted with a tinkle of bells through the barred sunshine and shadow of the fragrant pine and cork woods the road turning inland climbed steadily the air growing lighter and fresher as the elevation increaseda nip in it testifying that january was barely yet out and that nip justified the wearing of certain aforementioned myrtlegreen furtrimmed pelisse upon which damaris minor affections were at this period much set though agreeably warm and thick it moulded her bosom neatly shaped her waist and that without any defacing wrinkle the broad fur band at the throat compelled her to carry her chin high with a not unbecoming effect her cheeks bloomed her eyes shone bright as she sat beside mrs frayling in the open victoria relishing the fine air the varying prospect her own good clothes her companions extreme prettiness and lively talk this drive the prelude to henriettas campaign presented that lady at her best the advantage of beingas henriettaessentially artificial is that you can never save by forgetful lapse into sincerity be untrue to yourself hence what a saving of scruples of selfaccusation of selftorment her plans once fixed she proceeded to carry them out with unswerving ease and spontaneity she refused to hurry her only criterion of personal conduct being success and success so she believed if sound being a plant of gradual growth therefore she gave both herself and others time once fairly in the saddle she never strained never fussed her cue today was to offer information rather than to require it curious about many things she might be but gratification of her curiosity must wait damaris on her part listened eagerly asking nothing better than to be kept amused kept busy helped to forgetnot faircloths lettervery very far from thatbut the inward conflict of opposing loves opposing duties which meditation upon his letter so distractingly produced relatively all outside that conflict and the dear cause of it was of small momentmere play stuff at best but her brain and conscience were tired she would be so glad for a time only to think about play stuff i want you to go on being kind to marshall wace henrietta in the course of conversation presently said he told me how charmingly you received him yesterday when he called with my note he was so pleased he is exaggeratedly sensitive owing to unfortunate family complications in the past damaris pricked up her ears family complications having latterly acquired a rather painful interest for her poor manim sorry she said his mother a favourite cousin of my husband general frayling married an impossible personeloped with him to tell the truth her people not without reason were dreadfully put out the children were brought up rather anyhow marshall did not go to a public school which he imagines places him at a disadvantage with other men perhaps it does men always strike me as being quaintly narrowminded on that subject later he was sent to cambridge with the idea of his taking orders and going into the church my husbands elder brother leonard frayling is patron of several livings he would have presented marshall to the first which fell vacant and thus his future would have been secured but just as he was going up for deacons orders marshall rather i cant help feeling like a goose developed theological difficulties they were perfectly genuine i dont doubt but they were also singularly illtimeda little earlier a little later or not at all would have been infinitely more convenient so there he was poor fellow thrown on the world at threeandtwenty with no profession and no prospects for my brotherinlaw washed his hands of him when the theological difficulties were announced marshall tried bearleading but people are not particularly anxious to entrust their boys to a nonpublic school man afflicted by religious doubts he thought of making use of his really exquisite voice and becoming a public singer but the training is fearfully expensive and so somehow that plan also fell through for a time i am afraid he was really reduced to great straits with the consequence that he broke down in health through friends my husband got to hear of marshalls miserable circumstancesshortly after our marriage it wasand felt it incumbent upon him to go to the rescue henrietta paused thereby giving extra point to what was to follow and pulled the fur rug up absently about her waist for the last eighteen months she said marshall has practically made his home with us the arrangement has its drawbacks of course for one thing the general and i are never alone and that is a trial to us both twos company and threes none when a husband and wife are really devoted they dont want always to have a third wheel to the domestic cart then as if checking further and very natural inclination to repining she looked round at damaris smiling from behind her thick white net veil with most disarming sweetness nonoim not naughty i dont mean to complain about it she prettily protested for i do so strongly feel if one sets out to do good it shouldnt be by driblets with your name in full printed in subscription lists against every small donation you should plump for your protege and that with the least ostentation possible the general and i are careful not to let people know marshall stays with us as a guest it is rather a slip speaking of it even to you but i can trust you not to repeat what i say i am sure of that damaris laid a hand fondly impulsively upon the elder womans knee for certain you can trust me for certain anything you say to me is just between our two selves i should never dream of repeating it there speaks the precious downy owl of long ago mrs frayling brightly cried bustling up in defence of its own loyalty and honour ah damaris how very delicious it is to have you with me for her main point having been made she now adroitly discarded pathos another word regarding her philanthropic harbourage of the young man marshall wace remained to be spokenbut not yet let it come in later naturally and without hint of insistence we must be together as much as possible during the next few weeks she went onas often as sir charles can be persuaded to spare you to me whether the general and i shall ever make up our minds to settle down in a home of our own where i could ask you to stay with us i dont know im afraid we are hopelessly nomadic therefore i am extra anxious to make the most of the happy accident which has thrown us together anxious to get every ounce possible of intercourse out of itwe quite understand you have luncheon with me on thursday dont weand that you stay and help me through the afternoon i am always at home on thursdays to the neighbours they arent all of them conspicuously wellbred or exciting but i have learnt to take the rough with the smooth the boring along with the gifted and brilliant india is a good school in which to learn hospitality the practise of that virtue becomes a habit and i for one quite refuse to excuse myself from further exercise of it on coming back to europe the general feels with me and we have laid ourselves out to be civil to our compatriots here at st augustin this winter a few people were vexatiously stiff and starched at first but each one of them has given in in turn they really do i believe appreciate our little social efforts who wouldnt give in to you henrietta damaris murmured whereupon mrs frayling delicately beamed on her and agreeable unanimity of sentiment being thus established conversation between the two ladies for a while fell silent the little chestnut horses meantime encouraged with oh hes and oh las by their driver trotted and climbed climbed and trotted until the woodland lay below and the signal de la palu was reached a wide level space on a crest of the foothillswith flag staff bearing the valorous tricolor and rustic logbuilt restaurant offering refreshmentopening upon the full splendour of the maritime alps damaris stepped out of the carriage and patting the near horse on the neck in passing went forward across the sparse turf starred with tiny clear coloured flowers to the edge of the platform the provencal coachman from his perch on the boxseat of the victoria his roughcaste crumpled countenance sunbaked to the solid ruddy brown of the soil of his own vineyard followed her movements with approving glancesfor she was fresh as an opening rose the young english mees and though most elegant how agile how evidently strong innocent of the admiration she excited damaris stood absorbed awed even by the grandeur of the scene many hundred feet below the rent chasm down which it took its course steeped in violet gloom the milkwhite waters of an icefed river impetuously journeyed to the fertile lowlands and the sea opposite across the gorge amazingly distinct in the pellucid atmosphere rose the high mountains the undefiled untrodden and eternal snows azure shadow transparent ethereal haunted them bringing into evidence enormous rounded shoulder cirque crinkled glacier knifeedge of underlying rock they belonged to the deepest the most superb of life this rent gorge these mountainslike faircloths letter would beautiful and noble sights such as these always in future give her an ache of longing for the writer of that letter for the romance the poetry of the unacknowledged relation he bore to her tears smarted hot in damaris eyes and resolutely if rather piteously she essayed to wink them away for to her it just now seemed the deepest the most superb of life was also in great measure the forbidden the ache must be endured then the longing go unsatisfied since she could only stay the pain of them by doing violence to plain and heretofore fondly cherished duties but her tears defied the primitive process of winking not so cheaply could she rid herself of their smart and the blurred distorted vision they occasioned she pulled out her handkerchief petulantly and wiped them then schooled herself to a colder more moderate and reasonable temper and so doing her thought turned gratefully to mrs frayling for mercifully henrietta was here to help fill the void to in a manner break her fall henrietta didnt belong to the depths or the heights that she regretfully admitted with the eternal snows she possessed little or nothing in common but at a lower more everyday level had not she a vast amount to offer what with her personal loveliness her social cleverness her knowledge of the world and its ways she might not amount to the phoenix of damaris childhoods adoration but she was very friendly very diverting delightfully kind damaris honestly believed all these excellent things of hershe had been stupidly fastidious three days ago and failed to do henrietta justice what she had learnedby chancethis afternoon of henriettas unselfishness and generous treatment of marshall wace bore effectively convincing witness to the sweetness of her disposition and kindness of her heart damaris felt bound to make amends for that unspoken injustice of which she now repented how better could she do so than by giving herself warmly without reserve or restraint in response to the interest and attention henrietta lavished upon herat eighteen to be wooed by so finished and popular a person was no mean complimentshe wouldnt hold back suspicious and grudging but enjoy all henrietta so delightfully offered to the uttermost and there as though clenching the conclusion thus arrived at mrs fraylings voice gaily hailed her calling damaris damaris here is our teaor rather our coffee come darling child and partake before it gets cold so after a brief pause spent in determined looking the girl bowed her head in mute farewell and turned her back perhaps courageously perhaps unwisely and somewhat faithlessly upon the mountains and the rare mysteries of their untrodden snows she went across the sparse turf starred with tiny clear coloured flowers her face stern for all its youthful bloom and softness her eyes meditative and profound the owner of the logbuilt restaurant a thickset grizzled veteran of the francoprussian war the breast of his rusty velveteen jacket proudly bearing a row of medals stood talking to mrs frayling hat in hand his right foot had suffered amputation some inches above the ankle and he walked with the ungainly support of a crutchtopped pegleg strapped to the flexed knee as damaris approached the carriage he swept back the fur rug in gallantly respectful invitation and so soon as she ensconced herself on the seat beside henrietta bending down he firmly and comfortably tucked it round her he declared further as she thanked him it an honour in any capacity to serve her since had not madame but this moment so gracefully informed him of the commanding military career of the mademoiselles father possessor of that unique distinction the victoria crossa person animated moreover as madame reported by sincere sympathy for the tragic sorrows of wellbeloved and so now cruelly dismembered france damaris heard in this singing of her fathers praises a grateful reconciling strain she found it profitable just now to recall the heroic deeds the notable achievements which marked his record her coffee tasted the more fragrant for it the butter the fresher the honey the sweeter wherewith she spread the clean coarse homebaked bread she ate indeed with a capital appetite the long drive and stimulating air making her hungry possibly even her recent emotion contributed to that result for in youth heartache by no means connotes a disposition towards fasting rather does diet generous in quantity materially assist to soothe its anguish this meal in fact partaken of in the open alone with henrietta object of her childhoods idolatrythe first they had shared since those remote and guileless yearsassumed to damaris a sacramental character though of the earthly and mundane rather than transcendental kind its communion was one of good fellowship of agreement in cultivation of the lighter social side which upon our maidens part implied tacit consent to conform to easier standards than those until now regulating her thought and action implied tacit acceptance of henrietta as example and as guide whether the latter would have found cause for selfcongratulation could she have fathomed the precise cause of this apparently speedy conquest and speedy surrender is doubtful since it in fact took its rise less in the fascination of devotion given than in that of devotion denied she happened to be here on the spot at a critical juncture and thus to catch the young girls heart on the rebound that was allthat joined with damaris instinctive necessity to play fair and pay in honest coin for every benefit received so much must be said in extenuation of our nymphlike damsels apparent subjection to levitya declension which in the sequel and in certain quarters went neither unnoticed nor undeplored but to labour this point is to forestall history immediately her change of attitude announced its existence innocently enough for the sacramental meal once consumed and courteous parting words bestowed upon the valiant soldier broken in his countrys wars the coachman mounted the box and gathering up the reins with ho hes and ho las swung his horses half round the level and plunged them over the hillside along a steep woodland track leading by serpentine twists and curves down to join the corniche roada blonde ribbon rimming the indentations of the fivemile distant coast damaris steadied herself well back on the seat of the carriage as it swayed and bumped over ruts and treeroots to the lively menace of its springs she studiously kept her face turned towards her companion a myrtlegreen shoulder as studiously turned towards the view for she found it wiser not even to glance in that direction lest rebellious regrets and longings should leap on her across the violetblotted abyss from out those shining alpine citadels while to strengthen herself in allegiance to mrs frayling and to what may be called the lighter side she pushed one hand into that ladys muff and coaxed the slender pointedfingers hiding in the comfortable pussywarmth within tell me stories henrietta please she entreated about all the people whom youve asked to your party on thursday dress them up for me and put them through their paces so that i may know who they all are when i see them and make no mistakes but behave to them just as you would wish me to gradate your attentions and not pet the wrong ones mrs frayling gave gentle squeeze for squeeze in the pussywarmth laughing a trifle impishly you sinful child she saidgracious what joltsmy spine will soon be driven through the top of my skull at this rateyes sinful in tempting me to gibbet my acquaintances for your amusement but why gibbet them arent they nice dont you care for them prodigiously of course yet would you find it in the least interesting or illuminating if i indexed their modest virtues only i think the old soldier found it both interesting and illuminating when you indexed my fathers virtues just now sir charless virtues hardly come under the head of modest ones mrs frayling threw off almost sharply give me someone as well worth acclaiming and ill shout with the best but you scarcely quote your father as among the average do youthe people whom youll meet on thursday compared to him im afraid are as molehills to the mountains yonder if i described them by their amiable qualities alone theyd be as indistinguishable and as insipid as a row of dolls only through their aberrations their unconscious perfidies iniquities do they develop definiteness of outline and begin to live oh nothing could be unkinder than to whitewash them take mrs callowgas for instance with one eye on the church the other on the world the permanent inconsistency of her attitude as i may say her permanent squint gives her a certain cachet without which shed be a positive blankshe is most anxious to meet you by the way and sir charlesalways supposing he is selfsacrificing enough to comebecause she knows connections of his and yours at harchester a genial pillar of the church in the form of an archdeacon in whom as i gather her dear dead lord bishop very much put his trust tom veritys father i suppose damaris murmured her colour rising the hint of a cloud too upon her brow and who may tom verity be mrs frayling noting both colour and cloud alertly asked a distant cousin he stayed with us in the autumn just before he went out to india he passed into the indian civil service from oxford at the top of the list praiseworthy young man oh but you would like him henrietta the girl declared he is very clever and very entertaining too when when well when he doesnt tease too much he has an immense amount to talk about and very good manners also when he does not tease too muchand you like him i dont quite know damaris slowly said he did not stay with us long enough for me to make up my mind and then other things happened which rather put him out of my head he was a little conceited perhaps i thought not unnaturally being at the top of the pass list but though other things put him out of your head he writes to you in the pussywarmth within her muff mrs frayling became sensible that damaris hand grew unresponsive at once curiously stiff and curiously limp he has written twice once on the voyage out and again soon after he arrived thethe second letter reached me this week notwithstanding sunshine the eager air and lively bumping of the descent henrietta observed the flush fade leaving the girl white as milk her eyes looked positively enormous set in the pallor of her face they were veiled telling nothing and therebyto mrs fraylings thinkingbetraying much she scented a situationsome girlish attachment budding affair of the heart my father gave tom verity letters of introduction and he wanted us to know how kindly he had been received in consequence most proper on his part mrs frayling said she debated discreet questioning probingthe establishment of herself in the character of sympathetic confidante but decided against that it might be impolitic dangerous even to press the pace moreover the young man whatever his attractions might be held a negligible quantity in as far as any little schemes of her own were concerned at present long leave and reappearance upon the home scene being almost certainly years distantand just there the hand within the muff became responsive once more even urgent in its seeking and pressure as though appealing for attention and tenderness henrietta i dont want to be selfish but wont you go on telling me stories about your thursday party peoplei interrupted youbut its all new you see and it interests me so much damaris rather plaintively said mrs frayling needed no further inducement to exercise her really considerable powers of verbal delineation charging her palette with lively colours she sprang to the taskand that with a sprightly composure and deftness of touch which went far to cloak malice and rob flippancy of offence listening damaris brightenedas the adroit performer intended she shouldunder the gay cascade of talk laughed at length letting finer instincts of charity go by the wall in her enjoyment of neatly turned mockeries and the sense of personal superiority they provoked for henriettas dissection of the weaknesses of absent friends inevitably amounted to indirect flattery of the friend for whose diversion that process of dissection was carried out she passed the whole troop in reviewto begin with miss maud callowgas in permanent waiting upon her exsemiepiscopal widowed motherin age a real thirtyfive though nominal twentyeight her muddy complexion prominent teeth and all too long backher designs real or imagined upon marshall wace designs foredoomed to failure since whatever his intentionshenrietta smiled wiselythey certainly did not include maud callowgass matrimonial future in their purview herbert binning followed nextthe chaplain who served the rather staring little anglican church at le vandou a suburb of st augustin much patronized by the english in the winter season and a chapel somewhere in the bernese oberland during the summer months energetic athletic a great talker and squire of damesin all honesty and correctness this last well understood for there wasnt a word to be breathed against the good clerics morals but just a wee bit impressionable and flirtatious as who might not very well be with such a whineypiney wife as mrs binning always ailing what mind she might by stretch of charity be supposed to possess exclusively fixed upon the chronic irregularities of her internal organs recumbency was a mania with her and she had a disconcerting habit of wanting to lie down on the most inconveniently unsuitable occasionsto mitigate his overflowing energies which cried aloud for work mr binning took pupils he had two exceptionably nice boys with him this winter in the interval between leaving eton and going up to oxford namely peregrine ditton lord pambers younger son and harry ellice a nephew of lady hermione twells they were very wellbred their high spirits were highly infectious they played tennis to perfection and harry ellice danced quite tidily into the bargaindamaris must make friends with them they were her contemporaries and delightfully fresh and ingenuous lady hermione herselfhere henriettas tone conveyed restraint even comparative reverencewho never for an instant forgot she once had reigned over some microscopic court out in the far colonial wilderness nor allowed you to forget it either her glance half demanded your curtsy still she was the real thing and in that eminently satisfactorygenuine grande dame by right both of birth and of training she wont condescend to tell me so being resolved to keep me very much in my proper place henrietta continued but i learned yesterday from mary elliceharrys sister who lives with herthat she is intensely desirous to meet sir charles she wants to talk to him about afghanistan and northwest frontier policy a brother of hers it appears was at one time in the guides and she is under the impression your father and colonel carteret would have known himby the way dearest child they do mean to honour me those two dont they with their presence on thursday of course they will since you asked them why they love to come and see you do they mrs frayling saidanyhow let us hope so i can trust carterets general benevolence but i am afraid your father will be unutterably bored with my rubbishing little assembly but of course hell be nice to everybody tooas tame and gentle as possible with them all to please you dont you see henrietta ah no doubt all to please me she repeated and fell to musing while the carriage quitting at last the rough forest track rattled out on to the metalled high road white in dust here the late afternoon sun still lay hot the booming plunge of the tideless sea breaking upon the rocks below quivered in the quiet air henrietta frayling withdrew her hands from her muff unfastened the collar of her sable cape the change from the shadowed woods to this glaring sheltered stretch of road was oppressive she felt strangely tired and spent she trusted damaris would not perceive her uncomfortable state and proffer sympathy and damaris in fact did nothing of the sort being very fully occupied with her own concerns at present half a mile ahead pasteltinted greenshuttered housesa village of a single straggling streetdetached themselves in broken perspective from the purple of pinecrowned cliff and headland beyond behind them the western sky began to grow golden with the approach of sunset the road lead straight towards that softly golden lightto st augustin it led further deeper into the gold deeper as one might fancy into the heart of the coming sunset namely to the worldfamous seaport of marseilles damaris sought to stifle remembrance of this alluring fact as soon as it occurred to her she must not dally with itno she mustnt to in anywise encourage or dwell on it was weak and unworthy she having accepted the claims of clearly apprehended duty she could not go back on her decision her choice since in face of the everlasting hills she had pledged herself so she let her eyes no longer rest on the highroad but looked out to seawhere as tormenting chance would have it the black hull of a big cargo boat steaming slowly westward cut into the vast expanse of blue long pennons of rusty grey smoke trailing away from its twin rustyred painted funnels hardpressed the girl turned to her companion asking abruptly inconsequentlyis that every one whom you expect on thursday henrietta for some seconds mrs frayling regarded her with a curious lack of intelligent interest or comprehension her thoughts also had run forward into the gold of the approaching sunset and she had some difficulty in overtaking or restraining them although they went no further than the grand hotel andso to speaksat down there all of a piece on a buffcoloured iron chair which commanded an uninterrupted view of four gentlemen standing talking before the front door on thursday she repeatedwhy thursdayand her usually skilful hands fumbled with the fastening of her sable cape their helpless ineffectual movements served to bring her to her senses bring her to herself really you possess an insatiable thirst for information regarding my probable guests precious child she exclaimed allof course not i have only portrayed the heads of tribes as yet for your delectation we shall number many othersmale and femaleof the usual selfexpatriated british rank and filederelicts mostly lightly and coldly henrietta laughed like for example the general and myself wanderers possessed of a singularly barren species of freedom without ties without any sheetanchor of family or of profession to embarrass our movements without call to live in one place rather than another all along this sunblessed riviera you will find them swarming thick as flies displaying the trumpery spites and rivalries through which as i started by pointing out to you they can alone maintain a degree of individuality and persuade themselves and others they still are actually alive shocked at this sudden bitterness touched to the quick by generous pity regardless of possible onlookershere in the village street where the hoofbeats of the trotting horses echoed loud from the housewalls on either sidedamaris put her arms round henrietta frayling clasping kissing her ah dont henrietta she cried dont dare to say such ugly lying things about your dear self they arent true theyre absurdly scandalously untrueyou who are so brilliant so greatly admired who have everyone at your feet you who are so kind toothink of all the pleasure you have given me today for instanceand then think how beautifully good youve been and all the time are being to poor mr wace whether mrs fraylings surprising lapse into sincerity and bald selfcriticism were intentional calculated or not she was undoubtedly quick to see and profit by the opening which damaris concluding words afforded her how sweet you are darling child how very dear of you to scold me thus she murmured gently disengaging herself and preening her feathers somewhat disarranged by the said darling childs impetuous onset i know it is wrong to grumble yet sometimesas one grows olderone gets a dreadful sense that the delights of life are past and that perhaps one has been overscrupulous overtimid and so missed the bestthat is one reason why i find it so infinitely pleasing to have you with meyet pathetic too perhapswhy well i dont know that i am quite at liberty to explain exactly why henrietta smiled at her long wistfully and oh so sagely and indirectly that reminds me i am most anxious you should not exaggerate or run off with any mistaken ideas about my dealings with poor marshall wace i dont deny i did find his constantly being with us a trial at first but i am reconciled to it a trifle of discipline though screamingly disagreeable is no doubt sometimes usefulgood for ones character i mean and i really have grown quite attached to him he has charming qualities his want of selfconfidence is really his worst faultand what a trivial one if youve had experience of the horrid things men can do gamble for example and drink henrietta paused sighed the yellow facade of the grand hotel came into sight a pale spot amid dark trees in the distance and marshall poor fellow she continued is more grateful to me that i know than words can say so do like him and encourage him a littleit would be such a help and happiness to me as well as to him dearest damaris chapter v in which henrietta pulls the strings mrs fraylings afternoon party passed off to admiration but this by no means exhausted her social activities rather did it stimulate them so that with damaris amusement as their ostensible object and excuse they multiplied exceedingly henrietta was in her native element not for years had she enjoyed herself so much this chaperonage this vicarious motherhood was rich in opportunity she flung wide her nets even to the enmeshing of recruits from other larger centres cannes antibes and nice this more ambitious phase developed later immediately our chronicle may address itself to the initial thursday which for our nymphlike maiden saw the birth of certain illusions destined to all too lengthy a span of life luncheon at the villaor as henrietta preferred it called the pavilionset in the grounds of the hotel de la plage and dependent for service upon that housewas served at midday this left a considerable interval before the advent of the expected guests mrs frayling refused to dedicate it to continuous conversation as unduly tiring both for damaris and for herself they must reserve their energies must keep fresh marshall wace was therefore bidden to provide peaceful entertainment read aloudpresently perhaps sing to them at such time as digestionbad for the voice when in processmight be supposed complete the young man obeyed armed with tennysons maud and a volume of selected lyrics his performance fairly started general frayling furtively vanished in search of a mild siesta it inflated his uxorious breast with pride to have his henrietta shine in hospitality thus but his lean shanks wearied keeping time to the giddy music wistfully he feared he must be going downhill wasnt altogether the man he used to be since he found the business of pleasure so exhaustingly strenuous and that was beastly unfair to his lovely wifewouldnt do would not do at all by gad therefore did he vanish into a diminutive and rather stuffy smokingroom under the stairs unfasten his nankeen waistcoat unfasten his collarstud doze and finally a little anxiously sleep whatever marshall waces diffidence in ordinary intercourse it effectually disappeared so soon as he began to declaim or to recite the histrionic in him declared itself rising dominant given a character to impersonate big swelling words to say fine sentiments to enunciate he changed to the required colour chameleonlike you forgotat least the feminine portion of his audience almost without exception forgotthat his round lightbrown eyes stared uncomfortably much that his nose thin at the root and starting with handsome aquiline promise ended in a foolish buttontip forgot that his lips were straight and compressed wanting in generous curves and in tendernessan actors mouth constructed merely for speech forgot the harsh quality of the triangular redness on either cheek fixed and feverish ceased to remark how the angle of the jaw stood away from and beyond the sinewy meagre neck or note the rise and fall of adams apple so prominent in his throatno longer were annoyed by the effeminate character of the hands their retracted nails and pink upturned fingertips offering so queer a contrast to the rather inordinate size of his feet for the voice rarely failed to influence its hearers to carry you indeed a little out of yourself by its variety of intonation its fire and fervour its languishing modulations broken pauses yearning melancholy of effect the part of the neurotic hero of thethenlaureates poem that somewhat pinchbeck victorian hamlet suited our young friend moreover down to the ground it offered sympathetic expression to his own nature and temperament so that he wooed scoffed blasphemed orated drowned in salt seas of envy and selfpity with a simulation of sincerity as convincing to others as consolatory to himself and damaris being unlearned in the curious arts of the theatre listened wideeyed spellbound until flicked by the swishing skirts of fictitious emotion into genuine yet covert excitement as the reading progressed henrietta fraylings presence increasingly sank into unimportance more and more did the poem assume a personal character of which if the reader were hero shedamarisbecame heroine marshall wace seemed to read not to but definitely at her so that during more than one ardent passage she felt herself go hot all over as though alone with him an acknowledged object of his adoring despairing declarations this she shrank from yetit must be ownedfound stirring strangely and not altogether unpleasantly agitating for was not this protege of henriettaswhom the latter implored her to encourage and treat kindlysomething of a genius capable of sudden and amazing transformation talking to you with a modesty and deference agreeably greater than that of most young men of his age then on an instant changing at will and extraordinarily voicing the accumulated wrongs joys and sorrows of universal humanity could henrietta who usually spoke of him in tones of commiseration not to say of patronage be aware how remarkable he really was damaris wondered regarding him meanwhile with innocent respect and admiration for how tremendously much he must have experienced how greatly he must have suffered to be able to portray drama express profound emotion thus that the actors art is but glorified makebelieve the actor himself too often hollow as a drum though loud sounding as one never for an instant occurred to her how should it therefore when mrs fraylingrecollecting certain mysteries of the toilet which required attention before the arrival of her expected guestsbrought the performance to an abrupt termination damaris felt a little taken aback a little put about as though someone should be guilty of talking millinery in church forsplendid my dear marshall splendid the lady softly yet emphatically interrupted him today you really surpass yourself i never heard you read better and i hate to be compelled to call a halt but time has flownlook and she pointed to the blue and gold sevres clock upon the mantelpiece miss verity is an inspiring auditor he said none best pleased at being thus arbitrarily arrested in midcourse for whatever merit my reading may have possessed your thanks are due to her rather than to me cousin henrietta he spoke to the elder woman he looked at the younger with a nervous yet ponderous movementit was marshall waces misfortune always to take up more room than by rights belonged to his height and bulkhe got on to his feet inattentively let drop the volume of poems upon a neighbouring table to the lively danger of two empty coffee cups the cups rattled pray be careful mrs frayling admonished him with some sharpness the performance had been prolonged not without intention had she effaced herself but by both performance and effacement she had been not a little bored having a natural liking for the limelight she therefore hit outto regret her indiscretion the next moment nothingnothing she prettily added i beg your pardon marshall but i quite thought those cups would fall off the tableso stupid of me the fixed red widened painfully inundating the young mans countenance he was infuriated by his own awkwardness humiliated by mrs fraylings warning of which her subsequent apology failed to mitigate the disgrace and that this should occur just in the hour of satisfied vanity of agreeable successand before damaris in her eyes he must be miserably disqualified henceforth but his misfortunes worked to quite other ends than he anticipated for damaris came nearer her expression gravely earnest as appealing to him not to mind not to let these things vex him i have never heard anyone read so beautifully she told him you make the words come alive so that one sees the whole story happening it is wonderful i shall always remember this afternoon because of your readingand shall long to hear you againoften i know long for that wace bowed this innocent enthusiasm was extremely assuaging to his wounded selfesteem you have but to ask me miss verity i shall be only too honoured too happy to read to you whenever you have leisure and inclination to listen but here mrs frayling put her arm round damaris waist affectionately laughingly and drew her towards the door come come darling childdont be too complimentary or marshall will grow unbearably conceitedyoull put on flannels by the way marshall wont you she added as an afterthought i shall not play tennis this afternoon he answered his nose in the air there will be plenty for a change of setts without me i am not good enough for binning and his two young aristocrats and i dont choose to make sport for the philistines by an exhibition of my ineptitude i have no pretentious to being an athlete nonsense marshall nonsense she took him up quickly conscious his reply was not in the best taste you wilfully underrate yourself then later as still entwined she conducted damaris upstairs to her bedchamber there you have the position in a nutshell she said still am i not right for hasnt he charm poor dear fellow so very much clevernessso really gifted isnt he and as the girl warmly agreed ah i am so very glad you appreciate himand you have yet to hear him sing that takes one by storm i confessunhappy maud callowgasbut you see how frightfully on edge he ishow he turns off for no valid reason imagines himself a failure imagines himself out of it in point of fact he plays a quite passable game of tennisand you heard what he said these fits of depression and selfdepreciation amount to being tragic one requires endless tact to manage him and save him from himself henrietta paused sighed sitting on the stool before her toilette table neatly placing tortoiseshell hairpins patting and adjusting her bright brown hair i could have bitten my tongue out for making that wretched slip about the coffee cups but i was off my guard for once and like all artistic people marshall is a little absentmindedabsorbed to the point of not seeing exactly what he is doingpoor young man i sometimes tremble for his future such a highly strung sensitive nature amounts almost to a curse if he got into wrong hands what mightnt the end becatastrophe for he is capable of fatal desperation and i must own menwith the exception of my husband who is simply an angel to himdo not always understand and are not quite kind to him he needs a wise loving woman to develop the best in himthere is so very much which is goodand to guide him well damaris said and that without suspicion of irony dearest henrietta hasnt he you mrs frayling took up the ivory handglass and sitting sideways on the dressingstool turned her graceful head hither and thither to obtain the fuller view of her back hair me but you forget i have other claims to satisfy i cant look after him for ever i must find him a wife i suppose though i really shall be rather loath to give him up his gratitude and loneliness touch me so much she said looking up and smiling with a little twist in her mouth as of playful and unwilling resignation captivating to see by which cajoleries and expression of praiseworthy sentiment henrietta raised herself notably in damaris estimationas she fully intended to do our maiden kissed her with silent favour and mysteries of the toilette completed more closely united than ever beforethat is since the date of the elders second adventthe two ladies presenting the prettiest picture imaginable went downstairs again gaily hand in hand chapter vi carnivaland after tall and slim in the black and white of his evening clothes colonel carteret leaned his shoulder against an iron pillar of the verandah of the hotel de la plage and smoked looking meditatively down into the moonlit garden through the range of brightly lighted open windows behind him came the sound of a piano and stringed instruments a subdued babble of voices the whisper of womens skirts and the sliding rush of valsing feet tonight marked the culmination and apex of henrietta fraylings social effort it was midmarch midlentwhich last fact she made an excuseafter taking ecclesiastical opinion on the subject namely that of herbert binning the anglican chaplainfor issuing invitations to a cinderella dance damaris verity it appeared had never really properly and ceremoniously come outa neglect which henrietta protested should be repaired positively but very charmingly she told sir charles it must she only wished the affair could be on a larger more worthy scale this was after all but a makeshiftthe modest best she could arrange under the circumstances but hesir charlesmust not refuse it would give her such intense pleasure to have the darling child make her official debut under her henriettas auspices the hours would of necessity be early to avoid disturbance of the nondancing residents in the hotel but if the entertainment were bound to end at midnight it could begin at a proportionately unfashionable hour for once table dhote might surely be timed for six oclock and the diningroomsince it offered larger space than any other apartmentbe cleared aired and ready for dancing by a quarterpast eighthenrietta unquestionably had a way with her proprietors managers servants alike hastening obedient to her cajoling nodthanks to importations by road and rail from other coast resorts she reckoned to muster sixteen to twenty couplesa rubbishing apology at best in the matter of a coming out ball for a girl of damaris position and desertsno one could know that better than she henrietta herself did a poor thing but mine own she quoted when enlarging upon the scheme to charles verity but as at easter we are fated to scatter i suppose and go our several roads with small promise of reunion you must really be gracious dear friend and for old sakes sake give in to my desires its my last chance for heaven knows how longnot impossibly for ever carteret happened to be present during the above conversation had he not it may be doubted whether it would ever have taken placewith this dash of affecting reminiscence in any case allusions to a common past were barred for excellent reasons as between these two persons save strictly in public even so it struck him as a humorous piece of audacity on the ladys part her effrontery touched on the colossal but it succeeded always had done soin his judgment of henrietta carteret never failed to remember being compact of chivalry and of truthfulness that he had once on a time been a good half in love with her himselfall the same he was not sure her close association with damaris met with his approval that association had grown jonahs gourdlike during the last six weeks until as he rather uneasily noted the two were hardly ever apart luncheons teas picnics excursions succeeded one another afternoons of tennis in the hotel grounds the athletic gregarious binning and his two pupils peregrine ditton and harry ellice in attendance sometimes the latters sister mary ellice joined the companywhen lady hermione condescended to spare heror the longbacked miss maud callowgas afternoons of reading and song too supplied by marshall wacecarteret felt selfreproachful yet knew his charity too often threatened to stop short of the young man wacethough the beggar had a voice to draw tears from a stone plague himat intervals allday expeditions were undertaken to monte carlo or shopping raids upon cannes or nice yes verilyas he reflectedhenrietta frayling did keep the ball rolling with truly angloindian frivolity and persistence here in the heart of europe and was that altogether wholesome for damaris he delighted to have the beautiful young creature enjoy herself spread her wings take her place among the courted and acclaimed but he prized her too highly not to be ambitious for her and would have preferred her social education to be conducted on more dignified and authorized lines in the great world of london namely or paris when all came to all this was hardly good enough no one he honestly admitted trumpeted that last truth more loudly than henriettaat times nevertheless she went on and on making the business of this rather secondrate pleasureseeking daily of greater importance how could damaris be expected to discriminate to retain her sense of relative values in the perpetual scrimmage the unceasing rush instinct and nobility of nature go an immensely long way as preservativesthank god for thatstill where you have unsophistication inexperience a holy ignorance to deal with it is unwise to trust exclusively to their saving grace even the finest character is the saferso he supposedfor some moulding and direction in its first contact with the world if it is to come through the ordeal unscathed and unbesmirched and to ask such moulding and direction of henrietta frayling was about as useful as asking a hummingbird to draw a watercart he was still fond of henrietta and derived much silent entertainment from witnessing her manoeuvres but he was under no delusion regarding her he considered her quite the most selfish woman of his acquaintance though also one of the most superficially attractive hers was a cold not a hot selfishness refined to a sort of exquisiteness and never for an instant fleshly or gross but that selfishness in its singleness of purpose made her curiously powerful curiously capable of influencing persons of larger and finer spirit than herselfwitness her ascendency over charles verity during a long period of years and that without ever giving or even seriously compromising herself into whoever she fixed her dainty little claws she did it with an eye to some personal advantage and here carteret owned himself puzzledfor what advantage could she gain from this close association with damaris the girls freshness went rather mercilessly to show up her fading at times it is true watching her pretty alacrity of manner hearing her caressing speech he inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt believe her selfforgetful her affection genuine guiltless of design or afterthought if so so very much the better he was far from grudging her redemption specially at the hands of damarisonly were things in point of fact working to this commendable issue with the best will in the world to think so he failed to rid himself of some prickings of anxiety and distrust and from such prickings he sensibly suffered tonight as he leaned his shoulder against the iron pillar of the verandah at the hotel de la plage and looked down into the claire obscure of the moonlit gardens while over the polished floor of the big room at his back the rhythmical tread of the dancers feet kept time to the music of piano and sweet wailing stringsfor that a change showed increasingly evident in damaris he could not disguise from himself in precisely what that change consisted it was not easy to say he discovered it more in an attitude of mind and atmosphere than in outward action or even in words said but she was not quite the same as the grave and steadfast young creature who had asked his help for her father and indirectly for herself in the moist chill of the november twilight at the hardand who receiving promise of such help had darted away over the drenched lawn in company with the wildly gambolling cats alternately pursuing and pursued nor was she quite the same as when he had walked with her through the resounding paris streets to pay her devoirs to her former guardians and teachers at the convent school and later returning had spoken to her of the safety of religion the high worth of the doctrine and practice of a definite historic creed her relation to her father appearedand this pained carteretto lack its old intimacy its intensity of consideration and tenderness her interest in the child of his brain his belated literary experiment was less sustained and spontaneous how could it flourish in its former proportions when she was so much away so often absent from morning till nightnot without leave though for she scrupulously asked permission before answering henriettas gay call and taking part in that ladys junketings and jaunts sir charles never refused the requested permission but while granting it did he not tend to retreat into his former sardonic humour fall into long silences become inaccessible again and remote the book went forward yet more than once recently carteret had questioned whether his friend would ever get himself fairly delivered of the admirable volume were not hecarteretpermanently at hand to act midwife an unpleasant idea pursued him that sir charles went in some strange fashion in fear of damaris of her criticism her judgment yet fear seemed a hatefully strong and ugly word to employ as between a father and daughter so straitly heretofore bound to one another in love and thenthere lay the heart of the worry proving him only too likely a graceless jealous middleage curmudgeon a senile sentimentalist thus did he upbraidingly mock himselfwere there not signs of damaris developing into a rather thorough paced coquette she accepted the homage offered her with avidity with many small airs and gracesa la henriettaof a quite novel sort old general fraylingpoor pathetic old warriorwas her slave peregrine ditton harry ellice even the cleric binninglet alone the permanently selfconscious attitudinizing wacewith other newer acquaintances english and foreign ran at her heels and she let them run bless her even encouraged their running by turns of naughty disdain and waywardness she was fatal to boysthat was in the natural course of things and fatal to those considerably older than boysperhaps the music flew faster and fasterstopped with a shriek and a crash laughing talking the dancers streamed out of the hot brightly lighted room into the soft peace the delicate phantasy of the colourless moonlight carteret drew back flattening himself against the iron pillar in the shadow as they passed down the steps into the garden below the womens pale airy forms and the mens dark ones pacing the shining paths in groups and couples between the flowerbeds under the flatheaded pines the shaggystemmed palms and towering eucalyptus in and out massed banks of blossoming shrubs and dwarf hedges of monthly roses midway in the lighthearted procession came damaris peregrine ditton on one side of her harry ellice on the other leaving the main alley the trio turned along a path running parallel to the verandah which opened into a circle surrounding the stone basin of a tinkling fountain immediately below colonel carterets post of solitary observation damaris carried the demitrain of her white satin gown over her arm thereby revealing a wealth of lace frilled petticoat from beneath which the toes of her highheeled white satin shoes stepped with a pretty measured tread the two boys leaning a little towards one another talked across her their voices slightly raised in argument not to say dispute i call it rotten mean to bag my dance like that i tell yougo awayno i swear i wont go away wont budge one blessed inch unless miss verity actually orders me to if my dance was stolen all the more reason i should have her to talk to now as a sort of makeup so you just clear out if you please my good chap and leave the field to your elders and betters remove your superfluous carcass till further noticevamoose my son do you hear this excitedly from peregrine ditton they reached the fountain damaris stayed her measured walk and stood gazing at the jet of water in its uprush and myriad sparkling fall ellice answered chaffingly yet with an underlying growl and the dispute threatened to wax warm but the girl heeded neither disputant her attention rapt in watching the play of the falling water throughout the evening she had easily been chief centre of attraction besieged by partners and those not only her present rival attendants or marshall wace but by mrs fraylings various importations plus mr alban titheragea fat smart and very forthcoming young london stockbroker lately established in company of a pretty silly phthisisstricken wife at the grand hotel very much mistress of herself damaris had danced straight through the programme with an air of almost defiant vivacity now as it seemed her mood had changed and sobered for presently colonel carteret saw her bosom heave while she fetched a long sigh and raising her head glanced upwards her great eyes searching the shadowed space of the verandah the cool lunar brightness flooded her upturned face her bare neck and arms the glittering folds of her satin gown she was exceedingly fair to look upon just now for an appreciable length of time her glance met carterets and held it giving himthough the least neurotic of men calm of body and of minda strange sensation as of contact with an electric current which tingled through every nerve and vein and this although he perceived that dazzled by the moonlight she either did not see or quite failed to recognize him an expression of disappointment akin so he read it to hope defeated crossed her face she lowered her eyes and moved slowly forward along the path the boys on either side her again peregrine ditton took up his talein softened accents though still as one sorely injured and whose temper consequently inclines not unjustly to the volcanic upon my honour i think you might have given me just a minutes law miss verity he protested it was no fault of mine being late maud callowgas kept me toddling to the most unconscionable extent first she wanted an ice and then a tumbler of lemon squash and then she lost her fan or pretended she did and expected me to hunt for the beastly thing i give you my word i was as rude as sin in hope of shaking her off but she didnt or wouldnt see what i was driving at there was no getting away from her i tell you she sticks like a burr that girl once she lays hold of you octopuses arent in it her power of adhesion is something utterly frantic here ellice cut in with a doubtless scathing though to carteret inaudible remark at which damaris laughed outright and the fresh young voices trailed away in the distance alternately mocking and remonstrant as he listened still conscious of contact with that surprising electric current carteret found himself taking stock of his own fortynine years with swift and lively repugnance to accept the sum of them and the limitations and restrictions that sum is currently supposed to entail proved just now astonishingly difficult damaris as beheld in the fantastic loveliness of the moonlight her searching unseeing eyes meeting and dwelling upon his own the look of disappointment and defeat crossing her sweetly serious countenance wrought upon him begetting a dangerous madness in his blood that it was dangerous and a madness and therefore promptly to be mastered and ejected he would not permit himself an instants doubt yet it very shrewdly plagued him daring even to advance specious arguments upon its own behalf for when he came to consider matters was he not in perfect health more sound and fit than many a man but half his age and were not his fortunes just now at a specially happy turn his sister mrs dreydel having lately been blessed with a windfall in the shape of yearly income whichdid he so chooserelieved him of much expenditure on her account her eldest son had received his commission the three younger boys had done well as to scholarships thereby materially reducing the cost of their education never had he carteret been so free to consult his private desires and never as he knew too profoundly well had his desires taken so definite and delicious a form nevertheless it remained a madness to be mastered to be ejectedhis last thought as his first pronounced it that unconsciously pushed by this stress of rather turbulent sensations carteret walked the length of the verandah and drew up in the full glare of the moonlight from here he could see the curve of the shore and beyond the quay and esplanade and last scattered houses of the little town the lighthouse marking the tip of the western horn of the bay he could hear the soft stealthy plunge and following rush of the sea up the white shelving beach could hear alsoless soothing soundthrough the open windows of the drawingroom of the pavilion just across the garden marshall wace singing with all the impassioned fervour of his rich and welltrained baritone a ballad then much in vogue entitled the lost chord the words to carterets thinking were futile meaning anything everything or nothing according to your private interpretation of them but as to the fine quality and emotional appeal of the voice there could not be two opinions as it palpitated thus in the mild night air was damaris verity a member of the singers devout audience were her hands among those which now enthusiastically applauded the conclusion of the song under his breath slowly gently but most comprehensively carteret swore and felt all the better for that impious exercise even amused at this primitive expression of his moral and sentimental disturbance and so on the highroad as he fondly imagined to capture his habitual attitude of charity and tolerance once again but heaven had further trial of his fortitude and magnanimity not to say his good honest horse sense in store tonight for as the clapping of hands died down the whisper of a womans dress upon the asphalt of the verandah just behind him caught his ear and damaris came rapidly towards him so you are here after all dear colonel sahib she cried i felt you were when i was down there looking at the fountain it sort of pulled at me with remindings of you ages and ages ago in the gardens of the club at bhutpurwhen you brought me a presenta darling little green jade elephant in a sandalwood box as a birthday gift from henrietta later there was a terrible tragedy an odious little boy broke my elephant on purpose and broke my heart along with it carteret made a determined effort over himself taking her up lightly but not altogether past mending dear witchjudging by existing appearances ah im none so sure of that damaris answered him back with a pretty quicknessif it hadnt been for you for i was very ill when you came again to the sultanibaghdont you rememberthe night of the riots and great fires in the civil lines and cantonments just at the breaking of the monsoon yes i remember he said and wondered to himselfthereby gaining ease and a measure of tranquillity inasmuch as he thought of another mans plight rather than of his ownwhether damaris had knowledge of other occurrences not unallied to tragedy which had marked that same night of threatened mutiny and massacre and of bellowing tempest not least among them a vow made by her father charles verity and made for her sake the whole story comes back in pictures she went on whenever i look at fountains playing because of the waterjets in the canal in the bhutpur club garden where you gave me henriettas present you see it all dates from then and it came back to me specially clearly just now partly because i felt lonely lonelyhow lonely he smilingly interjected with a goodly youth as a protector on either hand yeslonely damaris repeated ignoring the allusion to her devoted if irascible escort dance music always makes one rather saddont you think so it seems to ache with everything one wants and hasnt got and the ache goes oni turned homesick forfor india and for my green jade elephant i used to love so dreadfully muchive all that is left of him still wrapped in the same rice paper in the same sandalwood box you brought him in put away with my best treasures in my own room at the hard she came nearer stood beside him bending down a little as she rested her hands on the top of the iron balustrade of the verandah while her eyes followed the curve of the bay to where the lighthouse rose a black column with flashing headpiece above the soft glitter of the moonlit sea and homesick colonel sahib for you she said for me he exclaimed almost involuntarily roughly startled out of his partially recovered tranquillity and ease yesshe said looking up at him isnt that quite natural since you have stepped in so often to help me when things have gone rather wrongi knew you must be somewhere quite close by i sort of felt you were there and you were therewerent you why did you hide yourself away carteret could not bring himself immediately to answer he was perplexed infinitely charmed distrustful all at oncedistrustful though for very different reasons both of himself and of her are things then going rather wrong now he asked presently for he judged it wise to accept her enigmatic speech according to its most simple and obvious interpretation by so doing he stood moreover to gain time and time in his existing perplexity appeared to him of cardinal importance thats just what im not sure about damaris spoke slowly gravely her glance again fixed upon the beacon light set for the safety of passing ships on the further horn of the bay if i could be sure i should know what to doknow whether it is right to keep on asas i am do you see but what at this juncture carteret did in point of fact most consciously see was the return of henrietta fraylings scattered guests from the pavilion and other less fully illuminated quarters towards the main building of the hotel from the improvised ballroom within chords struck on the piano and answering tuning of strings invited to the renewal of united and active festivity in the face of consequently impending interruption he hazarded a trifle of admonition dearest witch you elect to speak in riddles he gently told her i am in the dark as to your meaning so if i am guilty of uttering foolishness you must pardon me but i own i could wishjust a bitthat in some particulars you wouldnt keep oni quote your own wordsas you are or rather have been just lately why she asked without moving because to be quite honest with you i am not altogether satisfied about your father i am afraid he is getting back into the habit of mind we set out to cure him of you and i last november damaris sprang to attention and i havent noticed it i wouldnt stop to notice it i have been too busy about my own concerns and have neglected him arrayed in her spotless virgin finery her head carried proudly though her eyes were sombre with selfreproach selfaccusation and her lips quivered she confronted carteret and his clean loyal soul went out to her in a poignant an exquisite agony of tenderness and of desire he would have given his right hand to save her pain given his life gladly just then to secure her welfare and happiness yet he had struck herfor her own good possiblypossibly just blindly instinctively in selfdefence he tried to shut down the emotion which threatened to betray him and steady on to the playfully affectionate tone of their customary intercourse but it is to be feared the effort lacked convincingness of quality nono he said you take it altogether too hard you exaggerate dear witch to the point of extravagance you have been less constantly with your father than usualyoure the delight of his life after all as you must very well knowand inevitably he has missed you nothing worse than that the damage such as it is can easily be repaired ah but the damage as you call it starts behind all that in something elsesomething older much deeper down of which i doubt whether any lasting reparation is possible i did try to repair it all my going out with henrietta and this rushing about lately began in that tryingtruly it did colonel sahib and then i suppose i got above myselfas poor nannie used to sayand came to care for the rushing about just for its own sake my dance i believe miss verity the speaker mr alban titheragewellgroomed rosy and selfcomplacentpulled down the fronts of his white waistcoat he inclined to distinct rotundity of person and the garment in question though admirable in cut showed what with the exertions of dancing a damnable tendency as he expressed it to ride up and my dance next afterwards miss veritythis from peregrine ditton his youthful wellbred if somewhat choleric countenance presenting itself over the top of the stockbrokers smooth and not conspicuously intelligent head damaris looked from one to the other of these claimants for her favour with instant and very becoming composure im dreadfully sorry she told them collectively but surely there is some mistake both those next dancesthey are the last im afraid too arent theybelong to colonel carteret the deuce they do ditton exploded turning scarlet with a cocked eye and a jaunty movement of the head mr titherage shot out his right shirt cuff and pointed a stout forefinger at certain hieroglyphics inscribed on its glossy surface your name miss verity and written with an indelible pencil to the permanent embellishment of my best partygoing linen and witness to your infidelity i can only repeat i am dreadfully sorry damaris said with a becoming air of concern if the confusion has arisen through my fault but she appealed to carteret they always were your dances werent they without doubt he affirmed amusedly and very kindly he smiled upon the angry boy and portly young man although the beat of his pulse was accelerated and his throat felt queerly dry i am sure you understand how impossible it is for me to release miss verity from her promise he said courteously would you willingly do so yourselves were the positions reversed and either of you happy enough to stand in my shoes at this moment titherage gave a fat goodtempered laugh by george you have me there colonel under such a circumstances catch me making way for a stranger not if i know it with which he attempted jovially to put his arm through that of his companion in misfortune and lead ditton away but the latter flung off from him with a petulant halfsmothered oath and his back very straight his walk very deliberate pushed through the cheerfully discoursing throng into the ballroom damaris turned about resting her hands on the top of the iron balustrade again and gazed out to sea her breath came with a catch in it colonel sahib she said proudly if just a trifle brokenly are you angry angrygood lord then recovering control of senses and of sensebut dear witch he asked hersince when if i may venture to enquire have you become an adept in the fine art ofwelllying damaris looked around her face irradiated by laughter and you played up oh so beautifully quick i was a teeny bit afraid you might fail me for the idea came all of a minute there wasnt time to warn you and that was fortunate perhapsfor me you might have had scruples and i was obliged to do it after talking about the things which really matter i couldnt dance with that vulgar little man againor with those jealous boys they had an idiotic quarrel actual quarrel down in the garden it displeased me i told them so and left them and came here to find youbecause of the fountain and the sort of homesickness it gave me between laughing and crying damaris held out her hands the white moonlight covering her oh i am tired of rushing about she said come and dance with meits nonsense to tell me you cant dance and that youve forgotten how because you have danced once this evening alreadywith henrietta i watched you and you dance better than anybody with henriettathats rather a different matter i should hope it was damaris took him up naughtily but dance with me and then then please take me home yes as he tried to speak i know i had arranged to stay the night at the pavilion but ill find some excuse to make to henriettahavent you just told me im proficient in lyingyou were going to walk back why shouldnt i walk with you i wont be five minutes changing into my day clothes it would be so fascinating down on the shore road at night and i should get quiet all inside of me i am tired of rushing about colonel sahib it hasnt been a success she stopped breathless her hands pressed over her lace and satin swathed bosom now come and danceoh so beautifully please come and dance chapter vii telling how damaris discovered the true nature of a certain secret to the dear man with the blue eyes the beat of a tideless sea upon the shore is at once unrestful and monotonous in this only too closely resembling the beat of the human heart when the glory of youth has departed the splendid energy of the flow and grateful easing of the ebb alike are denied it foul or fair shine or storm it pounds and poundsas a thing chainedwithout relief of advance or of recession always at the same level always in the same place suspicion of this cheerless truth was borne in upon carteret asbareheaded his overcoat upon his arm the night being singularly mild and clementhe walked with damaris through the streets of the silent town the dwellers in st augustin both virtuous or otherwise had very effectually retired to their beds behind drawn curtains closed shutters locked doors and gave no sign vacancy reigned bringing in its train an effect of suspense and eeriness causing both our friends involuntarily to listen with slightly strained hearing for sounds which did not come once a cat nimble and thin streaked out of a cavernous sidealley across the pallor of the pavement and cobbled roadway to be swallowed up in a black splitknife narrow as it seemedbetween the blank house fronts opposite and once as they turned into the open space of the grand placeunreal and stark with its spidery framework of stalls set up ready for tomorrows market under the budding plane treesthey encountered a tired gendarme making his round picturesque of aspect in kepi and flowing cloak his footsteps brisked up as he met and treated them to a discreetly sympathetic and intelligent observation only to lag again wearily as soon as they had passed these were the sole creatures in st augustin save themselves visibly alive and awake yet whether other beings other presences unmaterial imponderable intangible did not walk the streets along with them is open to doubt more than once damaris shrank close to carteret startled by and apprehensive of she knew not what for who dare say in such a place what leavingsover there may not be from times prechristian and remote when mighty rome ruled and the ancient gods bore sway over that radiant coast on the outskirts of st augustin you may visit a fine amphitheatre still perfect save for some ruin along the upper tier of seats and in the centre of the town within a stones throw of the somewhat gloomy cathedral church may trace the airy columns and portions of the sculptured architrave of a reputed temple of venus worked into the facade of the municipal buildings turning out of the grande place by an avenue on the right damaris and carteret gained the esplanade following the curve of the bay here a freshness of the sea pleasantly accosted them along with that unrestful monotonous trample of waves upon the beach not until they reached this stage of the homeward journey and setting their faces eastward paced the pale level asphalt of this wide promenade did any sustained effort of conversation arise thus far they had proffered fugitive remarks only lapsing speedily into somewhat constrained silence for a coldness or shyness might appear to have sprung up between them oddly holding them asunder in thought and moral attitude after the close association of the dancea reaction from its contact so surprisingly more intimate than any they had yet experienced from that harmonious rhythmic unity of purpose and of movement which in dancing alike excites emotion quasiphysical and so alluringly serves to soothe and allay the emotion it excites these aspects of their association affected damaris but dimly since speaking a language of which she barely knew the alphabet carteret they took in a different measure he read their direction and potency with clear understanding the insidious provocations and satisfactions of them printed in large type with a rush his youth returned and troubled him or was it the phantom of youth merely his heartbeats but the beat of a tideless sea he feared as muchoh these tardy harvests these tardy harvestsare they not to most men a plague rather than a benison since in honour and fine feeling so abominably perilous to reap for the greater promotion of calm and of sanity he welcomed the young girls change of dress the powderblue walking suit with belted jacket and kilted skirt brought her more within the terms of their ordinary intercourse but the impression of the fair young body lately so close against his own clothed in bridelike raiment fresh as an opening flower and vaguely fragrant could not easily be dispelled strive as he might to put it from him the impression remained recurrent therefore it must not be held to carterets discredit if his senses took part with his nobler affections just now against his considered judgment or that he fared badly at the hands of the seaborn goddessworshipped hero in her temple in ancient days with music with dance and with nameless rites of sex when the moon rode high heaven at the full even as tonight her influence was still abroad and in his flesh carteret shrewdly suffered it yet neither basely nor bestially being clean of life and of spirit he whipped himself even with rather sorry humour seeing in damaris willingness to entrust herself thus to his sole care in the midnight loneliness a handsomer compliment to his morals than to his manhood how little bless her she knew what stuff men are made oftherein underrating her acquaintance with fact as her conversation presently and surprisingly proved to him the revelation began in all apparent innocencefor im not ungrateful to henrietta damaris said breaking silence softly yet abruptly as speaking to herself rather than addressing him in apology and argument and im dreadfully sorry to have vexed herfor she was vexed with me for not staying at the pavilion tonight as i promised she was really quite cross she will get over thatnever fear carteret answered off the surface still it troubles me to have vexed her i must have seemed so unreasonable making silly sounding excusesbecause i could not explain to her why i really wanted so much to go home you find a limit to the dear ladys powers of comprehension or of sympathy he asked again off the surface i suppose i must do so because there are things it never occurs to one to speak of to henrietta whole cartloads of them carteret comprehensively agreed and yet i dont know why dont you well i think i do perhaps know why and knowing i must confess to being not altogether sorry your confidences are restricted dear witch in that particular direction the use of the pet name though involuntarypossibly on that very accounteased his fever clearly he must get back to their former relation rejoice in her beauty in her sweet faith and dependence love heryeshe admitted the wordbut for gods sake keep the physical side out of the business damaris easilyaroused loyalty meanwhile caught alight oh but weve just been henriettas guests she said with a pretty mingling of appeal and rebukeand it seems hardly kind does it to find faults in her she has been beautifully good to me all this time ending up with this dance which she gave on purpose to please me and herself also carteret returned yes decidedly he felt better steadier to the point of now trusting himself to look at his companion notwithstanding the strange influences abroad in the magical moonlight with his accustomed smiling halfamused indulgence the unremitting trample of the waves there on the right made for levelheadedness actually if a little mercilesslyso he thought i dont wish to be guilty of taking mrs fraylings name in vain a second time he went onyouve pulled me up and quite rightly for doing so once alreadybut depend upon it she enjoyed her ball every morsel as much as you did in respect of the minor delights of existence she slumbers not nor sleeps our perenially charming and skilful henrietta you think she enjoyed it too i am glad then after an interval of silence her whole figure alert her speech eager see theresee there colonel sahibyes far far out to seaarent those the lights of a ship yes he answeredcreeping westwardbound for toulon most likely or possibly for marseilles and he would have moved forward but damaris unaccountably lingered carteret waited a good three to four minutes to suit her convenience but the delay told on him the night and hour down here by the shore on the confines of the silent town were too full of poetry too full of suggestion of the finedrawn excitement of things which had been and might not impossibly again be it was dangerous to loiter and in such company though waves might beat out a constant reminder with merciless pertinacity upon the beach come dear witch come he at last urged her we still have more than a mile to go and a pretty stiff hill to climb it grows late you will be abominably tired tomorrow why this fascination for a passing steamer probably some unromantic villainously dirty old tramp too you would not condescend to look at by daylight becausedamaris began she came nearer to him her expression strangely agitatedoh colonel sahib if i could only be sure it wasnt treacherous to tell you tell me what one of the many things it would never occur to you to confide to mrs frayling he said trying to treat her evident emotion lightly to laugh it off to henrietta of course not it would be unpardonable hateful to tell henrietta she flushed her face looking for the moment dark from excess of colour you are the only person i could possibly tell carteret moved aside a few steps he too felt strangely agitated wild ideas ideas of unholy aspect presented themselves to himideas again beyond words entrancing and sweet he fought with both alike honestly manfully returned and took damaris hand quietly gently in both his look here dear witch he said all this evening ato meunknown spirit has possessed you you havent been like yourself you have made me a little anxious a little alarmed on your account oh it isnt only this evening she caught him up it has been going on for weeks so i have seenand that is not good for you isnt for your happiness so if i amas you saythe only person you care to acquaint with this matter had not you better tell me here and now better worry yourself no more with mysteries about it but let us once and for all have the thing out i should be thankful damaris said simply looking him in the eyesif i could be sure i wasnt sacrificing some one elsetheir pride i meantheirtheir honour for a few seconds carteret paused meeting her grave and luminous glance then i think you may risk it he said i promise you this someoneelses honour shall be sacred to me as my own without your direct request no word of what you choose to tell me will ever pass my lips ah im very sure of thather smile her voice bore transparent testimony to a faith which went somewhat giddily not only to her hearers heart but to his head it isnt a question of your repeating anything but of your thinking differently of some one you care for very muchand who is almost as dependent on you colonel sahib as i am myself at least i fear you mightoh i am so perplexed im in such a maze she said ive nothing to go on in all this and i turn it over and over in my mind to no purpose till my head aches you see i cant make out whether thisthe thing which began it all and happened oh long agois extraordinaryone which youand most people like youin your position i meanwould consider very wrong and disgraceful or whether it often happens and is just accepted taken for granted only not talked about carteret felt cold all down his spine for what in gods name could this supremely dear andas he watched her grave and sweetly troubled countenancesupremely lovely child be driving at and i care so dreadfully much she went on it is the story of the darling little green jade elephant over againlike its being broken and spoilt only now im grown up i dont give in and let it make me ill there was a time even of thatof illness i meanat first just before you came to the hard last autumn but i wouldnt suffer it i would not let the illness go on i got over that but then a second crisis occurred soon after we came here and i thought henriettas kindness opened a way out so i rushed about whenever and wherever she invited me to rush but as i told you this eveningjust before we had our two dances you remember am i likely to forget carteret murmured under his breath the rushing about has not proved a success i thought it would help to stifle certain longings and keep me nearer to my fathermore at one with him but it didnt it made me neglect him you seeyou seethe words were dragged from her as by active suffering and distress of mindi had to choose between him and another person one cannot serve two masters i choose him his claim was the strongest in duty and i love to see him satisfied and peaceful he always ranked first in everything i felt and did ever since i can remember and i so want him to stay first but i have been pulled two ways and seem to have got all astray somehow lately i havent been really true to myself any more than to himonly frivolous and busy about silly pleasures dont let the frivolity burden your precious conscience carteret comfortably told her touched by the pathos of her selfreproach for her sincerity was surely just now unimpeachable and she a rare creature indeed love he could less than ever banish but surely he might utterly banish distrust and fearas frivolity goes dear witch and greed of pleasure yours have been innocent enough both in amount and in quality heaven knows i should like to believe sobut all thats relative isnt it the real wrongness of what you do depends upon the level of rightness you start from i mean insatiable casuist carteret tenderly laughed at her and with that by common though unspoken consent they walked onward again even while so doing however both were sensible that this resumption of their homeward journey marked a period in rather than the conclusion of their conversation some outside compelling forceso in any case it appeared to carteretencompassed them it was useless to turn and double indulge in gently playful digression that force would inevitably make them face the innermost of their own thought their own emotion in the end in obedience to which unwelcome conviction carteret presently brought himself to ask her and about this other personfor we have wandered a bit from the point at issue havent wewhose interests as i gather clash for some reason with those of your father and whose pride and honour you are so jealously anxious to safeguard his pride yes damaris said quickly her head high a warmth in her tone his honour is perfectly secure in my opinion whose honour is in danger thendear witch forgive me but dont you see the implication damaris looked around at him with unfathomable eyes her lips parted yet she made no answer after a pause carteret spoke again and to his own hearing his voice sounded hoarse as that of the tideless sea upon the beach yonder do you mean me to understand that the conflict between your fathers interests and those of this other personthis other mansarise from the fact that you love him yes damaris calmly declared love himhaving gone thus far carteret refused to spare himself he turned the knife in the woundlove him to the point of marriage there the word was said almost unconsciously he walked onward without giving time for her replyhe moistened his lips werent they dry as a cinder he measured the height to which hope had borne him tonight by the shock the positive agony of his existing fall at the young girl svelte and graceful beside him he could not look but kept his eyes fixed on the mass of the wooded promontory dark and solid against the more luminous tones of water and of sky some halfmile distant set high upon the further slope of it from here invisible the grand hotel frontedas he knewthe eastward trending coast carteret wished the distance less since he craved the shelter of that friendly yellowwashed caravanserai he would be mortally thankful to find himself back there and alone the door of his bachelor quarters shutaway from the beat of the waves away from the subtle glory of this venusridden moon now drawing down to her setting away above all from damarisdelivered from the enchantments and perturbations both physical and moral her delicious neighbourhood provoked but from that fond neighbourhood as he suddenly became aware he was in some sort delivered already for she stopped dead with a strange choking cry and stood solitary as it even seemed forsaken upon the wide grey whiteness of the asphalt of the esplanade behind her a line of lampspale burning under the moonlightcurved in perspective with the curving of the bay right away to the lighthouse on her left the crowded houses of the sleeping town slashed here and there with sharp edged shadows receded growing indistinct among gardens and groves the scene as setting to this single figure affected him profoundly taken in conjunction with that singular cry he retraced the few steps dividing him from her marriage she almost wailed putting out her hands as though to prevent his approach nononever in life colonel sahib you quite dreadfully misunderstand do i carteret said greatly taken aback while whether he would or no unholy ideas again flitted through his mind maliciously assailing him it has nothing to do with that sort of loving it belongs to something much more beautifully part of oneselfsomething of ones very very own right from the very beginning indeed he said sullenly even roughly his habitual mansuetude giving way before thisfor so he could not but take itcontemptuous flinging of his immense tenderness his patient unswerving devotion back in his face then very certainly i must plead guilty to not understanding or if you prefer itfor we neednt add to our other discomforts by quarrelling about the extra syllableof misunderstanding in my ignorance i confess i imagined the love which finds its crown and seal of sanctity in marriage can beand sometimes quite magnificently isthe most beautiful thing a man has to give or a woman to receive damaris stared at him her face blank with wonder set at regular intervals between the tall bluegrey painted lamp standards for the greater enjoyment of visitors and natives stone benches of a fine antique pattern adorn st augustins esplanade our muchperplexed maiden turned away wearily and sat down upon the nearest of these she held up her head bravely essaying to maintain an air of composure and dignity but her shoulders soon not imperceptibly quivered while try hard as she might setting her teeth and holding her breath small plaintive noises threatened betrayal of her tearful state carteret quite irrespective of the prescience common to all true lovers where the beloved objects welfare is concerned possessed unusually quick and observant hearing those small plaintive noises speedily reached him and pierced him as he stood staring gloomily out to sea whereupon he bottled up his pain shut down his natural and admirably infrequent anger and came over to the stone bench youre not crying dearest witch are you he asked her yes i am damaris said what else is there left for me to doeveryone i care for i seem to make unhappy everything i do goes wrong everything i touch gets broken and spoilt somehow endless tragedies of little green jade elephants he gently bantered her yesendless for now i have hurt you you are trying to be good and like your usual self to me but that doesnt take me in i know all through me i have hurt youquite dreadfully badlythough i never never meant to and havent an idea how or why this was hardly comforting news to carteret he attempted no disclaimer while she after fumbling rather helplessly at the breastpocket of her jacket at last produced a folded letter and held it out to him whether its treacherous or not i am obliged to tell you she said with pathetic desperation for i cant bear any more i cant but try my best to keep you colonel sahib and now you are hurt i can only keep you by making you understandjust everything you may still think me wrong but anyhow my wrongness will be towards somebody else not towards youso please read this and dont skip because every word helps to explain read it right through before you ask me any questionsthats more fair all roundif you go across thereunder the lamp i meanthere still is light enough i think for you to be able to see and carteret thus admonishedpartly to pacify her partly to satisfy a very vital curiosity which stirred in him to compass the length breadth and height of this queer business learn the truth and so set certain vague and agitating fears at restdid as damaris bade him standing in the conflicting gaslight and moonlight the haunted quiet of the small hours broken only by the trample and wash of the sea he read darcy faircloths letter from its unconventional opening to its equally unconventional closing paragraph now my holiday is over and i will close down till next christmas nightunless miracles happen meanwhileso goodbyehere is a boatload of my lads coming alongside roaring with song and as drunk as lordsgod bless you in spirit i once again kiss your dear feet carteret straightened himself up with a jerk looked at damaris sitting very still a little sunk together as in weariness or dejection upon the stone bench his eyes blazed fierce for once with questions he burned yet dreaded to ask but on second thoughtsthey arrived to him swiftlyhe restrained his impatience and his tongue mastering his heat he looked down at the sheet of notepaper again he would obey damaris absorb the contents of this extraordinary document the facts it conveyed both explicitly and implicitly to the last word before he spoke happily the remaining words were few your brother he read till death and afterfollowed by a name and date at the name he stared fairly confounded it meant nothing whatever to himthat is at first then rising as a vision from out some subconscious drift of memory he saw the cold lowtoned colouring of wide smooth and lonely waters of saltmarsh of mudflat and reedbed in the lowering light of a late autumn afternoona grey stonebuilt tavern moreover above the open door of which painted upon a board that same name of faircloth figured above information concerning divers liquors obtainable within yesremembrance grew more precise and stable he recalled the circumstances quite clearly now he had seen it on his way back from a solitary afternoons wild fowl shooting on marychurch haven during his last visit to deadham hard so much was certain but the name in its present connection carterets imagination shied for to have the existence of an illegitimate son of your oldest and dearest friend thus suddenly thrust upon you and that by a young lady of the dearest friends family is to say the least of it a considerable poser for any man it may be noted as characteristic of carteret that without hesitation he recognized the sincerity and fine spirit of faircloths letter characteristic also that having seized the main bearings of it his feeling was neither of cynical acquiescence or of covert and cynical amusement but of vicarious humiliation of apology and noble pitying shame he came over and sat down upon the stone bench beside damaris dear witch he said slowly this if i apprehend it aright is a little staggering forgive mei did altogether and i am afraid rather crassly misunderstand but that i could hardly help since no remotest hint of this matter has ever reached me until now damaris let her hand drop palm upwards upon the cool slightly rough surface of the seat carteret placed the folded letter in it and so doing let his hand quietly close down over hersnot in any sense as a caress but as assurance of a sympathy it was forbidden him in decency and loyalty to speak for a while they both remained silent damaris was first to move she put the letter back into the breastpocket of her jacket i am glad you know colonel sahib she gravely said you see how difficult it has all been i seeyes after a pause the girl spoke again i only came to know it myself at the end of last summer quite by accident i was frightened and tried not to believe but there was no way of not believing i had lost my way in the mist out on the bar i mistook the one for the othermy brother i mean for damaris broke off her voice failing her yes carteret put in gently supportingly he leaned back his arms crossed upon his breast his head carried slightly forward slightly bent as he watched the softly sparkling line of surf marking the edge of the plunging waves upon the sloping shore vicarious shame claimed him still he weighed mans knowledge mans freedom of action mans standards of the permissible and unpermissible as against those of this maiden whose heart was at once so much and so little awake for my father she presently went on but still i wanted to deny the truth i was frightened at it for if that was true so much elsethings i had never dreamed of until thenmight also be true i wanted to get away somehow but later after i had been ill and my father let him come and say goodbye to me before he went to sea i saw it all differently and far from wanting to get away i only longed that we might always be together as other brothers and sisters are but i knew that wasnt possible i was quite happy especially after you came with us colonel sahib out here then i had this letter and the longing grew worse than ever i did try to school myself into not wanting not longingdid silly thingsfrivolous things as i told you but i cant stop wanting it all came to a head somehow tonight with the dancing and music and those foolish boys quarrelling over meand then your showing me thatinstead of being faithful to my father i have neglected him ah you poor sweet dear carteret said greatly moved and turning to her in response she leaned towards him her face wan in the expiring moonlight yet very lovely in its pleading and guileless affection and my brother is beautiful colonel sahib she declared not only to look at but in his ideas you would like him and be friends with him though he doesnt belong to the same world as youindeed you would and he is not afraidyou know what i meannot afraid of being alive and having adventures he means to do big thingsnot that he has talked boastfully to me or been showy please dont imagine that he knows where he comes in and doesnt pretend to be anybody or anything beyond what he is only it seems to me there is a streak of something original in himalmost of genius he makes me feel sure he will never bungle any chance which comes in his way and he has time to do so much if chances do comethis with a note of exultation his life is all before him you see he is so beautifully young yet chapter viii fidus achates in which final pronouncement of damaris fond tirade carteret heard the death knell of his own fairest hopes he could not mistake the set of the girls mind not only did brother call to sister but youth called to youth whereat the goad of his fortynine years pricked him shrewdly he must accept the disabilities of the three decades plus one year which divided him in age from damaris as final and range himself with the elder generationher fathers generation in short how after all could he in decency go to his old friend and say give me your daughter the thing viewed thus became outrageous offensive not only to his sense of fitness but of the finer and more delicate moralities for cradlesnatching is not it must be conceded a graceful occupation nor is a middleaged man with a wife still in her teens a graceful spectacle sentimentalists may maunder over it in pinkly blushing perversity but the naughty world thinks otherwise putting if not openly its finger to its nose at least secretly its tongue in its cheek and rightly as he acknowledged the implication may be coarse libidinous but the instinct producing it is a sound one both healthy and just therefore he had best sit no longer upon stone benches by the sounding shore in this thrice delicious proximity and thrice provocative magic of the serene southern night all the more had best not do so because damaris proved even more rare in spirit exquisite in moral and imaginative qualityso he perhaps overfondly put itthan ever before carteret got on his feet and walked away a few paces continuing to heckle himself with merciless honesty and rather unprintable humourinvoking even the historic name of abishag virgin and martyr and generally letting himself have it hot a selfchastisement which may be accounted salutary since as he administered it his thought again turned to a case other than his own namely that of charles verity to pronounce judgment on his friends past relations with women whether virtuous or otherwise was no business of his whatever irregularities of conduct that friends earlier career may have counted had brought their own punishmentwere indeed actually bringing it still witness current events it wasnt for him carteret by the smallest fraction to add to that punishment but rather surely to do all in his power to lighten the weight of it here he found safe foothold let him invite longstanding friendship with the father to help him endure the smart of unrequited love for the daughter to pretend these two emotions moved on the same plane and could counterbalance one another was manifestly absurd but that did not affect the essence of the question ignoring desire which tonight so sensibly and disconcertingly gnawed at his vitals let him work to restore the former harmony and sweet strength of their relation if in the process he could obtain for damariswithout unseemly revelation or invidious commentthat on which her innocent soul was set he would have his rewarda reward a bit chilly and meagre it is true as compared withcomparisons be damnedcarteret left his pacing and came back to the stone bench well i have formed my own conclusions in respect of the whole matter now tell me what you actually want me to do and i will see how far it can be compassed dear witch he said damaris had risen too but she was troubled ah i still spoil things she wailed i was so happy telling you aboutabout faircloth and yet somehow ive hurt you again i know i have carteret took her by the elbow lightly gently carrying her onward beside him over the wide pallor of the asphalt hurt me you vanitatious creature against babes of your tender age i long ago became hurtproofhe gaily lied to her what do you take me fora fledgling like the ditton boy or poor harry ellice with whose adolescent affections you so heartlessly played chuckfarthing at our incomparable henriettas party tonightno nobut joking apart what exactly is it you want me to do for you take you to marseilles for the day perhaps to meet this remarkable young seacaptain and go over his ship he is remarkable damaris chimed in repeating the epithet with eager and happier emphasis unquestionablyif im to judge both by your account of him and by the tenor of his letter and you would take me oh dear colonel sahib how beautifully good you are to me of course ill take youif if what if sir charles gives his consent he slipped damaris hand within his arm still bearing her onward the last of the long line of gaslamps upon the esplanade marking the curve of the bay was now left behind a little further and the road forkedthe main one followed the shore the othera footpathmounted to the left through the delicate gloom and semidarkness of the wood clothing the promontory carteret did not regret that impending obscurity apprehending it would be less embarrassing under cover of it to embark on certain themes which must be embarked upon were he to bring his purpose to full circle listen my dear he told her while i expound certain laws of friendship exist between men which are imperative they must be respected to evade them still worse wilfully break them is to be guilty of unpardonably bad taste and bad feelingto put it no higher had your father chosen to speak to me of this matter well and good i should have felt honoured by his confidence have welcomed itfor he is dearer to me than any man living and always must bebut the initiative has to come from him till he speaks i am dumb for me to approach the subject first is not possible then the whole beautiful plan falls through she said brokenly no not at all very far from that he comforted her i gather you have already discussed it with your father you must lay hold of your courage and discuss it again i know that wont be easy but you owe it to him to be straightforward owe it to his peculiar devotion to you some day perhaps when you are older and more ripe in experience i may tell you in plain language of a vow he once made for your sakewhen he was in his prime too his life strong in him his powers at their height some persons might consider his action exaggerated and fanatical but such accusations can be brought against most actions really heroic and that this action specially in a man of his temperament may claim to be heroic there can be in my opinion no manner of doubt the path climbed steeply through the pine wood damaris hand grew heavy on carterets arm once she stumbled and clung to him in recovering her footing thereby sending an electric current tingling through his nerves again he did what was painful you mean and for my sake say rather gave up something very much the reverse of painful carteret answered his voice not altogether under control so that it struck away loud and jarring between the still ranks of the treetrunks to right and left which is harder which is much harderimmeasurably incalculably harder dearest witch after a space of silence wherein the pines lightly stirred by some fugitive updraught off the sea murmured dusky secrets in the vault of interlacing branches overhead carteret spoke again he had his voice under control now yet to damaris hearing his utterance was permeated by an urgency and gravity almost aweinspiring here in the loneliness and obscurity of the wood she went in sudden questioning incomprehensible fear of the dear man with the blue eyes his arm was steady beneath her hand supporting her his care and protection sensibly encircled her yet he seemed to her thousands of miles away speaking from out some depth of knowledge and of reality which hopelessly transcended her experience she felt strangely diffident strangely ignorant felt though she had no name for it the mystical empire mystical terror of sex as sex the night of the breaking of the monsoon of those riotings and fires at bhutpur your father bartered his birthright in a certain particular against your restoration to health the exact nature of that renunciation i cannot explain to you the whole transaction lies beyond the range of ordinary endeavour and savours of the transcendentalor the superstitious if you please to take it that way but call it by what name you will his extravagant gamble with the lords of life and death worked apparently for you got well and you have stayed well dear witchthanks to those same lords of life and death whose favour your father attempted to buy with this act of personal sacrifice he was willing to pay a price most men would consider prohibitive to secure your recovery and with an unswerving sense of honour he has gone on paying until that which at the start must have amounted to pretty severe discipline has crystallized into habit what you tell me of this young man darcy faircloths history goes indirectly to strengthen my admiration for your fathers selfdenying ordinance both in proposing and in maintaining this strange payment thereit was finished his special pleading carteret felt unfeignedly glad he was unaccustomed to put forth such elaborate expositions more particularly of a delicate nature and therefore offering much to avoid as well as much to state so you are bound to play a straight game with himdear child believe me he deserves it is finely worthy of it be open with him show him your letter ask his permissionif you have sufficient courage your courage is the measure of the sincerity of your desire in this business do you follow me yesbut i shall distress him damaris mournfully argued she was bewildered and in her bewilderment held to the immediate and obvious less than by shutting him out from your confidence by keeping him at arms length neglecting him ah so that rankles still does it yes neglecting him just a trifle perhaps but the neglect is overindeed it is over and utterly done with and in the ardour of her disclaimer damaris pressed against carteret her face upturned and since she too was tall very close to his just because it is over and done with i begged you to bring me back with you tonight i wanted to make a clean break with all the frivolities while everything was quite clear to me i wanted while i still belonged to you colonel sahib through our so beautifully dancing together twice god in heaven carteret said under his breath for what a pastmaster in the art of the torturer is your white souled maiden at moments to go right away from all that rushing about worldlinessi dont blame henriettashe has been sweet to mebut it is worldliness rather isnt itand to be true to him again and true to myself i wanted to return to my allegiance you believe me dont you you made me see colonel sahib you brought my foolishness home to meoh yes i owe you endless gratitude and thanks but i was uneasy already i needed a wholesome shove and you gave it and now you deliver a muchneeded supplementary shoveone to my courage i obey you colonel sahib without question or reservationnot on the chance of getting what i long for but because you have convinced me of what is right i will tell himtell my fatherall about everythingtomorrow it is now tomorrowand with the night many dreams have packed up their traps and fled but we neednt be sorry for that damaris declared in prettily rising confidence the truth is going to be better than the dreams isnt it for you yeswith all my heart i hope but for youwhy not for you she cried smitten by anxiety regarding him and by swift tenderness they had reached the end of the upward climbing path and stepped from the semidarkness of the wood into the greater clarity of the gravel terrace in front of the hotel far below unseen waves again beat upon the beach the sound reached them faintly the dome of the sky thick sown with stars appeared prodigious in expanse and in height it dwarfed the block of hotel buildings upon the right dwarfed all visible things the whole earth indeed which it so sensibly enclosed dwarfed also and that to the point of desolation the purposes and activities of individual human lives how could these count what could they matter in presence of the countless worlds swinging there through the illimitable fields of space to carteret this thought or rather this sensation of human insignificance brought a measure of stoic consolation he lifted damaris hand off his arm and held it while he said smiling at her for meyes of course why not for me too dearest witch truth is assuredly the most profitable bedfellow then as she shrank drawing away a little startled by the crudeness of the expression i enjoyed our two dances he told her and i shall enjoy taking you to marseilles and making faircloths acquaintance if our little scheme works out successfullyif it is sanctioned permitted after thatother things being equali think i ought to break camp and journey back to england to look after my property and my sisters affairs i have gadded long enough it is time to get into harnesssuch harness as claims me in these all too easygoing days and now you must really go indoors without further delay and go to bed may the four angels of pious tradition stand at the four corners of it to keep you safe in body soul and spirit sleep the sleep of innocence and wake radiant and refreshed ah but youre sadyou are sad damaris cried her lips quivering cant i do anythingi would do so much would love so muchbeyond anythingto make you unsad the man with the blue eyes shook his head impossible alas your intervention in this case is finally ruled out my sweet lamb he affectionately but conclusively said chapter ix which features various persons with whom the reader is already acquainted some are born great some attain greatness and some have it thrust upon them to the lively embarrassment of their humble and retiring little souls to his own notable surprise general frayling on the morning following his wifes cinderella dance awoke to find himself the centre of interest in the life of the pretty pavilion situated in the grounds of the hotel de la plage he owed this unaccustomed ascendency to physical rather than moral or intellectual causes being possessed of a temperature the complexion of the proverbial guinea and violent pains in his loins and his back these anxious symptoms developedone cannot but feel rather unjustlyas the consequence of his own politeness his amenity of manner and the patient attentions he paid on the previous evening to one of his wifes guests he had sat altogether too long for personal comfort in a draughty corner of the hotel garden with mrs callowgas affected by the poetic influences of moon stars and sea affected also conceivably by pagan amorous influences naughtily emanating from the neighbouring venus templewhose elegant tapering columns adorn the facade of the local mairiemrs callowgas became extensively reminiscent of her dear dead lord bishop protracted anecdotes of visitations and confirmation tours excerpts from his sermons speeches and charges arch revelations of his diurnal and nocturnal conversation and habitsthe latter tedious to the point of tears when not slightly immodestpoured from her widowed lips the good lady overflowed she frankly babbled general frayling listened outwardly interested and civil inwardly deploring that he had omitted to put on a waistcoat backlined with flannelwaxing momentarily more conscious also that the ironof the hard cold slats composing the seat of his garden chairif not entering into his soul was actively entering a less august and more material portion of his being through the slack of his thin evening trousers he endured both tedium and bodily suffering with the fortitude of a saint and martyr but next morning revealed him victim of a violent chill demanding medical aid the native local practitioner was reported monolingual and of small scientific reputation while our general though fluent in vituperative hindustani and fairly articulate in arabic could lay no claim to proficiency in the french language hence probable deadlock between doctor and patient henrietta acted promptly foreseeing danger of jaundice or worse and bade marshall wace telegraph to cannes for an english physician as a nurse she was capable if somewhat unsympatheticillness and death being foreign to her personal programme she attended upon her small sick warrior assiduously thereby earning the admiration of the outsiders and abject apologies for being such a confounded nuisance to you my love from himself her maid a eurasianby name serafina lousada whom she had brought with her from bombay a couple of years earlier prematurelywrinkled of skin and shrunken of figure yet whose lustrous black eyes still held the embers of licentious fireswould readily have shared her labours but henrietta was at some trouble to eliminate serafina from the sickchamber holding her tendencies suspect as insidiously and quite superfluously sentimental where any male creature might be concerned carteret and sir charles verity on the other hand she encouraged with the sweetest dignity imaginable to take turns at the bedsideand to look in upon her drawingroom also on their way back and forth thither a common object and that a philanthropic one gives unimpeachable occasions of intimacy these henrietta did not neglect though touching them with a disarming pensiveness of demeanour the invalid was the thing the thought of him wholly paramount with her her anxiety might be lightened perhaps but by no means deleted by the attentions of these friends of former yearsa pretty enough play throughout as the two gentlemen silently noted the one with kindly the other with sardonic humour her henchman marshall wace meanwhile henrietta kept on the run until the triangular patch of colour straining either prominent cheekbone was more than ever accentuated there was method we may however take it in the direction of these apparently mad runnings since they so incessantly landed the runner in the salon of the grand hotel crowning the wooded headland damaris she refused to have with her noshe couldnt consent to any clouding of the darling childs bright spirit by her private worries trouble heaven knows is bound to overtake each one of us more than soon enough shehenriettacould endure her allotted portion of universal tribulation best in the absence of youthful witnesses but let marshall carry damaris news dailytwice daily if needs be let him read with her sing to her so that she charming child should miss her poor henrietta and their happy meetings at the little pavilion the less especially let him seek the young girl and strive to entertain her when sir charles and colonel carteret were engaged on their good samaritan visits to general frayling this break in our cherished intercourse henrietta wrote in one of those many waceborne bulletins grieves me more than i can express permit marshall to do all in his power to make up for this hospital incarceration of mine poor dear fellow it is such a boon to him i really crave to procure him any pleasure i canabove all the pleasure of being with you which he values so very highly all his best qualities show in this time of trial he is only too faithful and wears himself to positive fiddlestrings in my service and that of the general i send him to you darling child for a little change and recreationrelaxation from the strain of my husbands illness marshall is so sympathetic and feels for others so deeply his is indeed a rare nature but one which does not alas always quite do itself justice i attribute this to an unfortunate upbringing rather than to any real fault in himself so be good to him damaris in being good to himas i have said all alongyou are being good to your fondly loving and just now sorely tried henrietta frayling all which sounded a note designed to find an echo in damaris generous heart which it didthis the more readily because still penitent for her recent trifle of wildoats sowing our beloved maiden was particularly emulous of good works the missionary spirit all agog in her she was out to comfort to sympathize and to sustain hence she doubly welcomed that highcoloured hybrid waceactor cleric vocalist in one guilelessly she indulged and mothered him overlooking his egoism his touchiness and peevishness his occasional defects of breeding and of taste she permitted him moreover to talk without restraint upon his favourite subjectthat of himself to retail the despairs of an ailing and unhappy childhood the thwarted aspirations of a romantic and sensitive boyhood the doubts and disappointments of a young manhood conspicuously rich in promise had the fates and his fellow creatures but shown themselves more intelligently sensible of his merits and his needs for this was the burden of his recurrent lament throughout life he had been misunderstood but you miss verity do understand me he almost passionately declared waving white effeminate hands ah a pure influence such as yours here rather to damaris thankfulness words appeared to fail him he moved to the piano and exhaled his remaining emotion in song affairs had reached the above point about ten days after henriettas party and damaris midnight walk with colonel carteret by the shore of the sounding sea general frayling though mending was still possessed of a golden complexion and a temperature slightly above the normal while his dutiful wife still selfimmured was in close attendance when an event occurred which occasioned her considerable speculation and perplexity it came about thus at her request marshall wace walked up to the station early that morning to secure the english papers on their arrival by the mail train from paris after a quite unnecessarily long interval in henriettas opinion he returned with an irritable expression and flustered manner such at least was the impression she received on his joining her in the wide airy corridor outside the generals sickchamber i thought you were never coming back she greeted him what has detained you the paris train was late he returned andwait an instant cousin henrietta i want to speak to you yes i am hot and tired and i am put outi dont deny it why henrietta asked him indifferently her own temper was not at its brightest and best the office of ministering angel had begun most woefully to pall on her what if this illness betokened a break up of health on the part of general frayling bath chairs hot bottles aircushions paplike meals and such kindred unlovelinesses loomed large ahead that was the worst of marrying an old or anyhow an oldish man you never could tell how soon the natural order of things might be reversed and you obliged to wait hand and foot on him instead of his waiting hand and foot on you henrietta felt fretful her lookingglass presented a depressing reflection of fine lines and sharpened features if she should wilt under this prolonged obligation of nursing her years openly advertise their number and she grow faded passee a woman who visibly has outlived her prime she could have shaken the insufficiently dying general in his bed yes insufficiently dyingfor in heavens name let him make up his mind and that speedilyget well and make himself useful or veritably and finally depart before for the preservation of her good looks it was too late i met sir charles verity at the station wace went on he was coming out of the first class salle dattente he stopped and spoke to me enquired for cousin fred but his manner was peculiar autocratic to a degree he made me feel in the way feel that he was annoyed at my being there and wanted to get rid of me imagination my dear marshall in all probability he wasnt thinking about you one way or the other but merely about his own affairs his ownas carteret reportsremarkably clever bookbut why i wonder was he at the station so early henrietta stood turning the folded newspaper about and idly scanning the headlines while the wind entering by the open casements at the end of the corridor lifted and fluttered the light blue gauze scarf she wore round her shoulders over her white frilled morning gown he didnt tell me the large soft very hot young man said you may call it imagination cousin henrietta but i cant i am positive his manner was intentional he meant to snub me by intimating of how slight account i am in his estimation it was exceedingly galling i do not want to employ a vulgar expressionbut he looked down his nose at me as if i was beneath contempt you know that insolent arrogant way of his oh lala henrietta cried dont be so childishthough she did in point of fact know the said way perfectly well and admired it once upon a time hadnt sir charles indeed rather superbly practised it in herhenriettasdefence she sighed while her temper took a nasty turn towards her yellowfaced apologetic little general waiting patiently for sight of the english newspapers under the veil of mosquito netting in his little bed even in his roaring fortieshad his forties ever roared thoughshe doubted itnot to save his life could he ever have looked down his nose at an offending fellowman like thatah charles veritycharles verityher heart misgave her that she had been too precipitate in this third marriage if she had waited of course with my wretchedly short sight i may have been mistaken wace continued pointedly ignoring her interruption but i am almost convinced i recognized colonel carteret and miss veritydamaristhrough the open door on the other side of the salle dattente in the crowd on the platform about to take their places in the train from cannes which had just come in henrietta ceased to scan the headlines or deplore her matrimonial precipitation carteret and damaris alone and together she exclaimed with raised eyebrows yes and it occurred to me that i there touched upon the explanation in part at least of sir charles veritys offensive manner he had been to see them off and was for some reason unwilling that weyou and i cousin henriettashould know of their journey even in private life at the very headwaters and source of her intrigues and her scheming henrietta cleverly maintained an effect of secrecy she showed herself an adept in the fine art of outflanking incautious intruders never did she wholly reveal herself or her purposes but reserved for her own use convenient runholes down which she could escape from even the most intimate of her coadjutors and employees if masterly in advance she showed even more masterly in retreat and that too often at the expense of her fellow intriguers without scruple she deserted them when personal safety or personal reputation suggested the wisdom of so doing though herself perplexed and suspicious she now rounded on wace taking a high tone with him but why my dear marshall why she enquired should sir charles object to ouras you put itknowing that seems to me an entirely gratuitous assumption on your part in all probability mary ellice and the boys were on the platform too only you didnt happen to catch sight of them and in any case our friends at the grand hotel are not accountable to us for their comings and goings they are free agents and it does really strike me as just a little gossipy to keep such a very sharp eye upon their movementsdont be furious with me henrietta permitted herself to reach up and pat the young man on the shoulder playfully restrainingly an extraordinarily familiar proceeding on her part marking the strength of her determination to avoid any approach to a quarrel since she openly denounced and detested all those demonstrations as between friends and relations which come under the generic title of pawing no pray dont be furious with me she repeated i quite appreciate how sensitive you naturally must be upon the subject of damaris you have given me encouragement cousin henriettathis resentfully and why not dont be disingenuous my dear marshall i have given you something much more solid than mere encouragement namely active help opportunity in the right direction to the right person i have repeatedly praised you but the prize in this case is to him who has address and perseverance to win it you possess signal advantages through your artistic tastes your music your reciting but i have never disguised from younow honestly have ithere were obstacles and even prejudices to be overcome sir charles despises me but his daughter gives ample proof that she does not andyou dont propose to marry sir charles do you henrietta laughed a trifle shrilly the tone of that laugh pierced her hearers armour of egoism he stared at her in interrogative surpriseobserving which she hastened to retreat down a runhole ah she cried it is really a little too bad to tease you marshall but one cant but be tempted to do so at moments you take everything so terribly au grand serieux my young friend you mean to convey that i am ponderous wellperhapsjust a shade she archly agreed and of ponderosity you must make an effort to cure yourselfmind though a fault i consider it one on the right sidein the connection that is which we have just now been discussing when a girl has as much intelligence aswe neednt name names need weshe resents perpetual chaff and piffle they bore herseem to her a flagrant waste of time her mind tends to scorn delights and live laborious daysa tendency which rectifies itself later as a rule all the same in avoiding frivolity one must not rush to the other extreme and be heavy in hand a happy mien in this as in all things my dear marshall i cannot so far degrade myself as to be an opportunist he returned sententiously yet the opportunist arrives and to arrive is the main thing after allat least i imagine sonow i really cannot stay here any longer giving you priceless advice but must take the general his newspapersby the way did sir charles say anything about coming to see him this afternoon as she asked the question henrietta ran her eye down over the announcements in the court circular marshall replied in the negative she made no comment hardly appearing to notice his answer but as she stepped lightly and delicately away down the airy corridor to the door of the sickroom over her blue gauze draped shoulder she flung back at him this confinement to the house is getting quite on my nerves i must really allow myself a little holidaytake a drive tomorrow if frederic is no worse i will call at the grand hotel i think and see darling damaris just for a few minutes myself information which went far to restore her hearers equanimity his affairs as he recognized were in actively astute safekeeping marshall wace spent the rest of the morning in the drawingroom of the villa at the piano composing a by no means despicable setting of shelleys two marvellous stanzas which commence rarely rarely comest thou spirit of delight wherefore hast thou left me now many a day and night the rich baritone voice vibrant with apparent passion swept out through the open windows across the glittering garden miss maud callowgas walking along that portion of the esplanade immediately in front of the hotel paused in the grilling sunshine to listen heaven upon earth seemed to open before her pale whitelashed eyes if she could only ascertain what fortune she might eventually count on possessingbut mama was so dreadfully close about everything to do with money the harchester bishopric was a fat one worth from ten to fifteen thousand a year that she knew from the odious impudent questions asked about it by some horrible nonconformist member in the house of commons just after her fathers death surely mama must have saved a considerable amount out of so princely an income she had always kept down expenses at the palace the servants left so often because they declared they had not enough to eat then through the open window of the villa embowered in roses there amid the palms and pinesand in a falling cadence too how shall ever one like me win thee back again but maud callowgas needed no winning being very effectually won already so it was superfluous thus movingly to ask the question the midday sun striking through her blackandwhite parasol made her feel dizzy and faintif only she could learn the amount of her fortune she could

beast sweating in the splendid glare rattle of cranes scream of winches grind of wheels and the bellowing of a big steamer working her way cautiously through the packed shipping of the basin to the blue freedom of the open seasuch was the scene which the boatswain and whitejacketed steward leaning their folded arms on the bulwarks and smoking lazily watched the forest queen rode high at the quayside having discharged much and taken on but a moderate amount of cargo for her homeward voyage this was already stowed she had coaled and was bound to clear by dawn now she rested in idleness most of her crew taking their pleasure ashore a sabbath calm pervading her amid the strident activities going forward on every hand the ships dog a curlyhaired black retriever lay on the clean deck in

docks as quitted this fond old floating earse of ours and took themselves back to their ereditary marble alls to roost on the other side of the quay meanwhile in the brave dancing breeze and the sunshine darcy faircloth stepped down on to the uneven paving just opposite to where the forest queen lay colonel carteret followed and stood aside leaving him to hand damaris out of the open carriage for this was the younger mans day and as the elder ungrudgingly acknowledged he played the part of host with a nice sense of taste his hospitality erring neither in the direction of vulgar lavishness nor of overmodesty and economy breeding tells is fertile in social intuitions as carteret reflected even when deformed by an ugly bar sinister during the past hours he had been observanteven above his wontjealous both for his friend charles verity and his dear charge damaris in this peculiar association the position was a far from easy one so many slips of sorts possible but the young merchant seacaptain had carried it off with an excellent simplicity and unconscious gracein respect of a conveyance to begin with he eschewed hiring a hack and met his arriving guests at the station with the best which the stables of the hotel du louvre et de la paix could produce had offered a quiet wellserved luncheon at that same stately hostelry moreover in preference to the more flashy and popular restaurants of the town afterwards he had driven them in the early hours of the afternoon up to the church of notre dame de la garde which perched aloft on its eminence godspeeds the outward bound and welcomes the homecoming voyager while commanding so noble a prospect of port and city of islands sacred to worldfamous romance and wide horizons of rich country and historic sea and now before parting faircloth brought them to his ship to this private kingdom of his and all it impliedand denied tooof social privilege social distinction implied further of administrative and personal powerall it set forth of the somewhat rugged facts of his profession and daily environment of this small world he was undisputed autocrat grand cham of this miniature tartaryof this ironwalled twothousandton empire the great white czar so far carteret had lent himself to the extensive days outing in a spirit of very sweettempered philosophy he had been delightful unfailing in courtesy and tactful address now having analysed his hosts character to his own satisfaction he felt justified in giving himself a holiday from the office of chaperon and watchdog he had fulfilled his promise royally done his duty by damaris in that quasiavuncular relation which he had assumed in place of a closer andhow profoundly morecoveted one thereby earning temporary release from her somewhat overmoving neighbourhood not but what he had been keenly almost painfully interested in watching this drama of brother and sister and gauging the impulses the currents of action and of emotion which lay behind it gauging too the difficulties even dangers inherent in it the glamour and the clouding of shamewhether conventional or real he did not pretend exactly to determinewhich so strangely wrapped it about to use damaris favourite word they were very beautiful both in themselves and in their almost mystic affection these two young creatures and just on that very account he would be glad to get away from them to be no longer onlooker orto put it vulgarlygooseberry fifth wheel to the cart he went with them as far as the shoreward end of the upsloping gangwaya tall greyclad figure with an equally tall blueclad figure on the other side of the young girls also tall biscuitcoloured onea dash of pink showing in her burntstraw hat pink too at her throat and waist seen between the open fronts of her dustcoatbut at the gangway he stopped dear witch he said i have some telegrams i should be glad to send off and another small matter of business to transact in the town so here i will leave you if you permit in our friends safekeepinghe smiled upon faircloth at the station at fivethirty we meet au revoir then and without waiting for any reply he sauntered away along the sunflooded quay between piled up bales of merchandize wine barrels heaps of sand heaps too of evilly smelling hides towering cases and crates his shadowclear violet upon the grey of the granitefrom his feet onwards travelled before him as he walked and this leading by this following of his own shadow casual accident of light and of direction though in all common sense he must account it troubled the peace of the man with the blue eyes making him feel wistful feel past the zenith of his allotted earthly achievement queerly out of the running aged and consequently depressed upon damaris the suddenness of his exit reacted in a sensation of constraint carteret had been very exquisite to her throughout this delicate adventure throughout these hours of restrained yet exalted emotion left thus to her own resources she grew anxious consciously diffident the in a sense abnormal element in her relation to faircloth darted down on her so that she could not but remember how slight after all was her actual acquaintance with him how seldomonly thrice in point of facthad he and she had speech of one another upon faircloth carterets withdrawal also reacted though with different effect for an instant he watched the tall retreating form of this as he perceived very perfect gentleman then he turned to damaris looking her over from head to heel in keen somewhat possessive fashion and as meeting his eyes bravely if shyly her colour deepened you are happy he affirmed rather than asked as the day is long she answered him steadily but the days not been overlong by chance has it not half long enough alls well then still he pressed heryou arent weary of me yet damaris reassuringly shook her head nevertheless she was very sensible of change in the tenor of their intercourse sensible of a just perceptible hardness in his bearing and aspect for some cause the nature of which she failed to divine though she registered the fact of its existence he no longer had complete faith in her was no longer wholly at one with her in sympathy and in belief he needed wooing handling and had she the knowledge and the art successfully to handle this sunbrowned goldenbearded rather magnificent young master marinerout here in the open too the shout of the great port in her ears the dazzle of the water and the push of the warm wind upon her face ah why waste precious time in putting questions to which you surely already know the answer with a touch of reproach she took him up show me rather where you livewhere you eat and sleep where you walk up and down walk quarterdeck when you are far away there out at sea does all that really interest you damaris lips quivered the least bit why have you turned perverse and doubting isnt it because they interest me above and beyond anything beautifully interest me that i am hereit would have been very easy to stay away if i hadnt wantedas i do wantto be able to fancy you from morning until night to know where you sit know just what you first see when in the grey of the morning you first wake faircloth continued to look at her but his expression softened gaining a certain spirituality i have questioned more than once today whether i had not been foolhardy in letting you come herewhether distance wasnt safest and the hunger of absence sweeter than the full meal of your presence forfor both of us things being between us as they actually are what if the bubble bursti have had scareshideous scareslest you should be disappointed in me or you in me damaris said no only your being disappointed in me could disappoint me in youand hardly that because youd have prejudice facts even natural and obvious enough ones upon your side faircloths inn on marychurch haven and your indian palace as basis to two childrens memories and outlook are too widely divergent when one comes to think of it when listening to you and colonel carteret talking at luncheon i caught very plain sight of that not that he talked of set purpose to read me a wholesome lesson in humilitynever in life hes not that sort but the lesson went home all the more directly for that very reasonpatience one little minute he quickly admonished her as she essayed to speakpatience you ask with those dear wonderful eyes of yours what im driving atthis beloved oneyou see the waiting carriage over there hadnt we best get into it turn the horses heads citywards again and drink our tea you and i on the way up to the station somewhere very much else than on board this roughandtumble rather foulbreathed cargo boatim so beastly afraid you may be disgusted and shocked by the interval between what youre accustomed to and what i am to let you down faircloths handsome face worked whereat damaris diffidence took to itself wings and flew away her heart grew light let me down she said you cant let me down oh really really youre a little slow of comprehension we are in thisin everything that has happened since i first knew who you are and everything which is going to happen from now onwardsin it together what joins us goes miles miles deeper and wider than any petty surface things must i tell you how much i care cant you feel it for yourself and she stepped before him on to the upward sloping gangway plank chapter xi wherein damaris meets herself under a novel aspect damaris threw back the bedclothes her eyes still dim with slumber and gathered herself into a sitting position clasping her knees with both hands she had a vague impression that something very pleasant awaited her attention but in the soft confusion of first awakening could not remember exactly what it was to induce clearer consciousness she instinctively parted the mosquito curtains slipped her feet down over the side of the bed and a little crouched together and fumblybabyfashionbeing still under the comfortable empire of sleep crossed the room and set back the inward opening casements of the south window thereupon the outdoor freshness fluttering her hair and the lace and nainsook of her nightdress brought her on the instant into full possession of her wandering wits she remembered the nature of that charmingly pleasant something yet paused before yielding it attention held captive by the spectacle of returning day it was early the disc of the sun still below the horizon but shafts of light striking up from it patterned the underside of a vast dapple of fleecy cloudheliotrope upon the backcloth of blue etherwith fringes and bosses of scarlet flame against this occupying the foreground the pine trees which sheltered the terrace showed up a deep greenish purple bordering upon black leaning out over the polished wooden barwhich topped the ironwork of the windowguarddamaris sought and gained sight of the sea this darker even than the tufted foliation of the pinessince still untouched by sunlightspread dense and compact as molten metal with here and there a sheen like that of the ravens wing upon its corrugated surface to damaris it appeared curiously forbidding seeing it thus she felt indeed to have taken nature unawares surprised her without disguise so that for once she displayed her veritable facea face not yet made up and camouflaged to conceal the fact of its indwelling terror from puny and defenceless man with that the girls thoughts flew in longing and solicitude to faircloth whose business so perpetually brought him into contact with nature thus naked and untamedby now and over as sinister a seasince westward the dawn would barely yet have brokethe forest queen must be steaming along the andalusian coast making for gibraltar and the straits upon her homeward voyage and by some psychic alchemy an influence more potent and tangible than that of ordinary thought her apprehension fled out annihilating distance bridging intervening space for just as certainly as damaris fair body leaned from the open window so certainly did her fair soul orto try a closer and more scientific definitionher living consciousness stand in the captains cabin of the oceanbound tramp making darcy faircloth turn smiling in his sleep he having vision and glad sense of herwhich stayed by him tempering his humour to a peculiar serenity throughout the ensuing day that their correspondence was no fictitious one a freak of disordered nerves or imagination but sane and actual both brother and sister could convincingly have affirmed and this although timeas time is usually figuredhad neither lot nor part in it such projections of personality are best comparable in this respect to the dreams which seize us in the very act of wakingvivid coherent and complete yet ended by the selfsame sound or touch by which they are evoked in damaris case before the scarlet dyeing the cloud dapple warmed to rose or the dense metallic sea caught reflections of the sunrise broadening incandescence her errant consciousness was again cognizant of subjected to her immediate surroundings she was aware moreover that the morning sharpness began to take a too unwarrantable liberty with her thinly clad person for comfort she hastily locked the casements together and then waited somewhat dazed by the breathless pace of her strange and tender excursion looking about her in happy amazement and so doing her eyes lighted upon a certain oblong parcel lying on her dressingtable there was the charmingly pleasant something which awaited her attention a present and the most costly the most enchanting one save possibly the green jade elephant of her childish adoration she had ever received she picked up not only the precious parcel but a handmirror lying near it and thus armed bestowed herself once more in her still warm bed the last fortyeight hours had been fertile in experiences and in events among which the arrival of this gift could by no means be accounted the least excitinghordle had brought the packet here to her last night about an hour after she and her fatherstanding under the porticowaved reluctant farewells to colonel carteret as the hotel omnibus bore him and his baggage away to the station to catch the mail train through to paris this parting when it actually came about proved more distressing than she had by any means prefigured she had no notion beforehand what a really dreadful business she would find it after these months of close association to say goodbye to the man with the blue eyes we shall miss you at every turn dear dear colonel sahib she almost tearfully assured him how we are going ever to live without you i dont know and impulsively driven by the excess of her emotion to the point of forgetting accustomed habits and restraints she put up her lips for a kiss which thus invited kiss carteret taking her face in both hands for the minute bestowed upon her forehead rather than upon those proffered lips then his glance met charles veritys held it in silent interchange of friendship needing no words to declare its quality or depth and he turned away abruptly making for the inside of the waiting omnibuscavernous in the semidarknessdistributing largesse to all and sundry as he went damaris was aware of her fathers arm passed through hers holding her against his side with a steadying pressure as they went together across the hall on their way to the first floor sittingroom aware of poor pretty coughing little mrs titherages raised eyebrows and enquiring stare as they passed her with her coffee cigarette and fat florid stockbroker husbandwho by the way had the grace to keep his eyes glued to the patience cards ranged upon the small table before him until father and daughter were a good halfway up the flight of stairs later when outwardly mistress of herself the inclination to tears successfully conquered and her normal halfplayful gravity regained she went to her bedroom hordle had brought her this beguiling packet inside the silver paper wrappings she found a red leather jewel case and a note in carterets singularly definite hand character rather than script the severe yet decorative quality of arabic about it to the dear witch it read in memory of our incomparable henriettas dance and of the midnight walk which followed it and of our hours of pleasant sightseeing at marseilles no signature followed only the date now sitting up in bed while the day came into full and joyous being natures face duly decked and painted by the greatly reconciling sun damaris read the exquisitely written note again the writing in itself moved her with a certain homesickness for the east which it seemed in some sort to embody and from which to hail then meanings she detected behind the apparently lighthearted words filled her with gratitude they reminded her gently of duties accepted promises made they gathered in faircloth too by implication thus assuring her of sympathy and approval where she needed them most she opened the case and taking out the string of pearls it contained turned them about and about examining counting admiring their lustre and ethereal loveliness they were graduated from the size of a hempseed so she illustrated it on either side the diamond clasp to that of a marrowfat pea not all of themand this charmed her fancy as giving them individuality and separate lifewere faultlessly perfect but had minute irregularities of shape tiny dimples in which a special radiance hovered she clasped the necklace round her throat and holding up the handmirror turned her head from side to sidewith pardonable vanityto judge and enjoy the effect damaris was unlearned in the commercial value of such treasures nor did money seem exactly a graceful or pretty thingin some respects our maiden was possessed of a very unworldly innocenceto think of in connection with a present still she found it impossible not to regard these jewels with a certain awe what the dear colonel sahib must have spent on them a small fortune she feared in the buying of this alltoocostlygift then consisted that business transaction he had made the excuse for leaving her alone with faircloth upon the quay alongside which lay the forest queen oh he surpassed himself was too indulgent too munificent to heras on a former occasion she totted up the sum of his good deeds hadnt he given up his winters sport for her sake didnt sheand wouldnt an admiring english reading public presentlyowe to his suggestion her fathers noble book when she had run wild for a space and sold herself to unworthy frivolities hadnt he led her back into the right road and that with the lightest courtliest hand imaginable making all harmonious and sweetly perfect once more between her father and herself lastly hadnt he procured her her hearts desire in the meeting with darcy fairclothand incidentally given her the relief of free speech now and whenever she might desire to claim it concerning the strange and secret relationship which dominated her imagination and so enriched the hidden places of her daily life and thought damaris held up the handmirror contemplating his gift this necklace of pearls and from that by unconscious transition fell to contemplating her own face it interested her she looked at it critically as at some face other than her own some portrait appraising and studying it it was young and fresh surely as the mornin its softness of contour and fine clear bloom yet grave to the verge of austerity owing partly to the brown hair which parted in the middle and drawn down in a plain full sweep over the ears hung thence in thick loose plait on either side to below her waist she looked long and curiously into her own eyes dear wonderful eyes as faircloth her brother so deliciously called them and with that her mouth curved into a smile sight of which brought recognition new and very moving of her own by no means inconsiderable beauty she went red and then white almost as her white nightdress and the white pillows behind her laid the mirror hastily down and held her face in both hands asas carteret had held it last night at the moment of parting when he had kissed not her lips but her forehead yet very differently since she now held it with strained clinging fingers which hurt making marks upon the fleshfor could it be thatthe other kind of love such as men bear the woman of their choice which dictated carterets unfailing goodness to herthe love that he had bitterly and almost roughly defended when she praised the love of brother and sister as dearest purest and therefore above all best was it conceivable this hero of a hundred almost fabulous adventures of hairbreath escapes and cunningly defied dangers in oriental semibarbarous wholly gorgeous camps courts and cities this philosopher of gently humorous equanimity who appeared to weigh all things in an equal balance and whom she had regarded as belonging to an age and order superior to her own had set his affections upon her singling her out from among all possible others that he wanted her for his own wanted her exclusively and as his inseparable companion the object of a sentence from the english marriage service flashed across her mindwith my body i thee worship it ran and with all my worldly goods i thee endow with my body i thee worshiphe her fathers elect and beloved friend in whom she had always so beautifully trusted who had never failed her the dear man with the blue eyesand she damaris her womanhood revealed to itself at once shrank back bewildered panicstricken and passionstricken called to her aloud for here carterets grace of bearing and of person his clean health physical distinction and charm arose and confronted her the visible tangible attributes of the manas manpresented themselves in fine relief delighting her stirring her heretofore dormant senses begetting in her needs and desires undreamed of until now and even now in substance incomprehensible she was enchanted fevered triumphant and thenalso incomprehensiblyashamed as the minutes passed though the triumph continued to subsist the shame subsisted also so that the two jostled one another striving for the mastery damaris took her hands from her face again clasped them about her drawnup knees and sat looking straight in front of her with sombre meditative eyes to use a phrase of her childhood she was busy with her thinkings her will consciously hailing emotion to the judgmentseat of intelligence for examination and for sentence if this was what people commonly understand when they speak of love if this was the love concerning which novelists write and poets singthis riot of the blood and heady rapture this conflict of shame and triumph in which the animal part of one has so loud a word to sayshe didnt like it it was upsetting to the confines of what she supposed drunkenness must be it spoilt things heretofore exquisite by giving them too high a colour too violent a flavour noshe didnt like it neither did she like herself in relation to itlike this unknown stormswept damaris norfor he alas couldnt escape inclusionthis new unfamiliar presentment of the man with the blue eyes yetand here was a puzzle difficult of solutioneven while this new presentment of him and conception of his sentiment towards her pulled him down from his accustomed pedestal in her regard it erected for him another pedestal more richly sculptured and of more costly materialsince had not his manifold achievements the whole fine legend as well as the whole physical perfection of him manifested themselves to and worked upon her as never beforedid this thing love then as between man and woman spring from the power of beauty while soiling and lowering beautybestow on it an hour of extravagant effulgence of royal blossoming only to degrade it in the endthe puzzle is old as humanity old one may say as sex little wonder if damaris sitting up in her maidenly bedchamber in the unsullied brightness of the early morning hour failed to find any satisfactory answer to it her thoughts ranged out to the other members of her little local courtto peregrine ditton and harry ellice to marshall wace had they personal experience of this disquieting matter was it conceivable the boys silly rivalries and jealousies concerning her took their rise in this did it inspire the fervour of marshall waces singing his flattering dependence on her sympathysuspicion widened everywhere she seemed to find hint and suggestion of thisno she wouldnt too distinctly define it let it remain namelesseverywhere except in respect of her father and of her brother there she could spend her heart in peace she sighed with a sweetness of relief unclasping her hands raising her fixed bowed head the hotel meanwhile was sensibly in act of coming awake doors opened voices called from the other side of the corridor sounded poor little mrs titherages hacking cough increasing to a convulsive struggle before the fit at last passing off it sunk into temporary quiescence andre the stout middleaged valet de chambre hummed snatches of gay melody as he rubbed and polished the parquet flooring without these noises whether cheerful or the contrary were at least ordinary enough by degrees they gained damaris ear drawing her mind from speculation regarding the nature origin prevalence and ethics of love soon pauline the chambermaid would bring her breakfasttray coffee and rolls those pale waferlike pats of butter which taste so good and thin squares of beetroot sugar which are never half as sweet as one would like would bring hot water and her bath too and pay her some nicely turned little compliment as to the becoming effect of her nights sleepeverything would pick itself up in short and go on naturally and comfortably just as before before what damaris straightened the hem of the sheet over the billowing edge of flowered down quilt and while so doing her hand came in contact both with the mirror and the open jewelcase she looked at this last with an expression bordering on reproach unfastened the pearls from her throat and laid them on the wadded creamcoloured velvet lining she delighted to possess them and deplored possessing them in the same breath they spoke to her too freely and conclusively told her too much she would rather not have acquired this knowledge either of carteret or of herselfif it really were knowledgeagain she repeated the question arising from the increasing normality of surrounding thingsbefore what for when all was said and done the dear man with the blue eyes had veritably and very really departed throughout the night his train had been rushing northnorthwestward to paris to england to that norfolk manorhouse of his where his sister his nephews all his home interests and occupations awaited him what proof had she that more intimate and romantic affairs did not await him there or thereabouts also had not she once and for all learned the lesson that a mans ways are different and contain many unadvertised occupations and interests if he had wished to say something anything special to her before going away how easilythus she saw the businesshow easily he might have said it but he hadnt spoken rather conspicuously indeed had avoided speaking perhaps it was all a silly conceited mistake of her owna delusion and one not particularly creditable either to her intelligence or her modesty damaris shut up the jewelcase the pearls were entrancing but somehow she did not seem to think she cared to look at them any morejust now when her breakfast arrived she ate it in a pensive frame of mind in a like frame of mind she went through the routine of her toilette she felt oddly tired oddly shy moreover of her lookingglass miss felicia verity had made a tentative proposal about a week before of joining her niece and her brother upon the riviera she reported much discomfort from rheumatism during the past winter her doctor advised a change of climate damaris while brushing and doing up her hair discovered in herself a warm desire for miss felicias company she craved for a womannot to confide in but to somehow shelter behind and aunt felicia was so perfect in that way she took what you gave in a spirit of gratitude almost pathetic and never asked for what you didnt give never seemed even to for an instant imagine there was anything you withheld from her it would be a resta really tremendous rest to have aunt felicia shedamariswould propound the plan to her father as soon as she went downstairs after luncheon and a walk with sir charles her courage being higher she repented in respect of the pearl necklace put it onand with results for that afternoon henrietta fraylinghungry for activity hungry for prey after her prolonged abstention from societyvery effectively floated into the forefront of the local scene chapter xii concerning itself with a gathering up op fragments an unheralded invasion on the part of the physician from cannes had delayed by a day henriettas promised descent upon or rather ascent to the grand hotel that gentleman whose avaricious pale grey eye belied the extreme silkiness of his mannerhaving been called to minister to lady hermione twells in respect of some minor ailmentelected to put in the overtime between two trains in a visit to general frayling for the date drew near of his yearly removal from the riviera to cotteretlesbains in the ardennes where during the summer season he exploited the physical infelicities and mental credulities of his more wealthy fellowcreatures the etablissement at cotteret was run by a syndicate in which dr stewartwalker heldin the name of an obliging friend and solicitora preponderating number of shares at this period of the spring he always became anxious to clear up not to say clear out his southern clienetle lest any leftover members of it should fall into the clutches of one of his numerous local rivals and in this connection it may be noted as remarkable to how many of the said clientele a cure at cotteretlesbains offered assurance of permanent restoration to health among that happy band as it now appeared general frayling might be counted the dry exciting climate of st augustin and its near neighbourhood to the sea were calculated to aggravate the gastric complications from which that polite little warrior so distressingly suffered this i fear we must recognize my dear madam is a critical period with your husband and treatment for the next six months or so is of cardinal importance i consider high inland air if possible forest air indispensable what i should like you to do is to take our patient north by slow stages and i earnestly counsel a course of waters before the return to england is attempted thereupon agreeable visions of festive toilettes and festive casinos flitting through henriettas mind she named homburg and other german spas of worldwide popularity but at such ultrafashionable resorts as dr stewartwalker with a suitable air of regret reminded her the season did not open until too late to meet existing requirements let me think let me think he repeated head sagely bent and forefinger on lip he ran through a number of latin terms to her in the main incomprehensible then looked up relieved and encouraging yes we might i believe safely try it the medical properties of the springsparticularly those of la nonnettemeet our patients case excellently and i should not lose sight of hima point i own with me for your husbands condition presents features of peculiar interest cotteretlesbains my dear madamin his case i can confidently recommend it lady hermione talks of taking the cure at cotteret this spring but about that we shall seewe shall see the question demands consideration as you know lady hermione is charmingly outspoken emphatic but i should be false to my professional honour were i to allow her wishes to colour my judgmentmeanwhile i have reason to know that other agreeable people are going to cotteret shortly not the rank and file for such the place does not pretend to cater there the lucrative stockbroker or lucrative jew is still a rara avis long may he continue to be so and cotteret continue to pride itself on its exclusivenessin that particular it will admirably suit you mrs frayling to a compliment so nicely turned henrietta could not remain insensible before the destined train bore dr stewartwalker back to his more legitimate zone of practise she saw herself committed to an early striking of camp with this obscure if select ville deaux as her destination in some respects the prospect did not smile on her yet as next day emancipated at length from monotonies of the sickchamber she drove behind the freemoving little chestnut horses through the streets of the townsleepy in the hot afternoon quietand along the white glaring esplanade henrietta admitted the existence of compensations in the brilliant setting of some worldfamous german spa though sheas she believedwould have been perfectly at her ease what about her companions for in such scenes of high fashion her own good clothes are not sufficient lifebelt to keep a pretty woman quite complacently afloat your male associates must render you support be capable of looking the part and playing up generally if your enjoyment is to be complete and for all that marshall wace frankly couldnt be depended on not only was he too unmistakably english and of the middleclass but the clerical profession although he had so unfortunately failed it or it so unkindly rejected him still seemed to soak through somehow when you saw him in public a whiff of the vestry queerly clung to his coats and his trousers thus meanly giving away his relinquished ambitions unless and that was worse still essaying to be extra smart a taint of the footlights declared itself in the over florid curl of a hatbrim or sample of neckwear to head a domestic procession in eminently cosmopolitan circles composed of a small elderly very palpable invalid and a probable curate in mufti demanded an order of courage to which henrietta felt herself entirely unequal preferable the obscurity of cotteretlesbainsgracious heaven ten thousand times preferable did not dr stewartwalker moreover hold out hopes that by following his advice the generals strength might be renewed if not precisely like that of the eagle yet in the more modest likeness of some good biddable burdenbearing animalthe patient ass if one might so put it without too obvious irony as handyman aidedecamp and on occasion her groom of the chambers the general had deserved very well of henrietta he had earned her sincere commendation to restore him to that level of convenient activity was naturally her main object and if a sojourn at some rather dull spot in the ardennes promised to secure this desired end let it be accepted without hesitation for the proverbial creaking yet longhanging gatehere henrietta had the delicacy to take refuge in hyperboleshe had no liking whatever she could not remember the time when darby and joan had struck her as an otherwise than preposterous couple offspring of a positively degraded sentimentality but there since it threatened depressing conclusions henrietta agreed with herself to pursue the line of reflection no furthersufficient unto the dayto look beyond is the thirties once passed to raise superfluous spectres and this day in itself supplied food for reflections of a quite other character ones which set both her curiosity and partiality for intrigue quite legitimately afire the morning post had brought her a missive from colonel carteret announcing his recall to england and deploring the imposed haste of it as preventing him from making his adieux to her in person the letter contained a number of flattering tributes to her own charms and to old times in india the pleasures of whichunforgettable by himhe had had the happiness of sharing with her yetto her reading of itthis friendly communication remained enigmatic its kindly sentences punctuated by more than one interjectional enquiry namely what was the cause of this sudden recall and what was his reason for not coming to say goodbye to her haste she held an excuse of almost childish transparency it went deeper than that simply he had wanted not to see her since the night of the dance no opportunity had occurred for observing carteret and damaris when togetherreally how general fraylings tiresome illness shipwrecked her private plansand from the beginning she had entertained an uneasy suspicion regarding carterets attitude men can be so extraordinarily feebleminded where young girls are concerned had anything happened during her withdrawal from society in the light or rather the obscurity of carterets letter a visit to damaris became more than ever imperative her own competence to extract the truth from that guileless maiden henrietta in nowise questioned the child she complacently told herself when preparing to set forth on her mission is like wax in my hands the above conviction she repeated now as the horses swept the victoria along the shore road while from beneath her white umbrella she absently watched the alternate lift and plunge of the dazzling ultramarine and tyrian purple sea upon the polished rocks and pebbles of the shelving beach to henrietta nature save as decoration to the human drama meant nothing but the day was hot for the time of year royally so and this rejoiced her she basked in the sunshine with a catlike luxury of content her hands never grew moist in the heat nor her hair untidy her skin unbecomingly red nor her general appearance in the least degree blousy she remained enchantingly intact unaffected except for an added glint an added refinement todays temperature justified the adoption of summer attire of those thin clearcoloured silk and muslin fabrics so deliciously to her taste she wore a lavender dress it was new every pleat and frill inviolate at their crispest and most uncrumpled in this she found a fund of permanent satisfaction steeling her to intrepid enterprise hence she scorned all ceremonies of introduction she dared to pounce having ascertained the number of sir charles veritys sittingroom she refused obsequious escort tripped straight upstairs unattended rapped lightly opened the door andwith swift reconnoitering of the scene withinannounced her advent thus damaris are you there ah yes darling child at last during that reconnoitering she inventoried impressions of the room and its contentscool firstblue walls blue carpet blue upholstering of sofa and of chairs not worn or shabby but so graciously faded by sun and air that thisdecoratively speakingmost perilous of colours became innocuous in a way studious in keeping with a large writingtable occupying the centre of the picture laden with manuscripts and with books the wooden outside shutters of two of the three windows were closed which enhanced the prevailing coolness and studiousness of effect red cushions also agreeably faded upon the windowseats alone echoed in some degree the hot radiance obtaining out of doorsthese and a red enamelled vase holding sprays of yellow and orangecopper roses placed upon a smaller table before which damaris sat her back towards the invader at the sound of the latters voice the girl started raised her head and in the act of looking round swept together some scattered sheets of notepaper and shut her blottingbook henrietta she cried and thereupon sprang up the lady meanwhile advancing towards her with outstretched arms which enclosed her in a fragrant embrace yesnothing less than henriettaimprinting light kisses on either cheek but i see you are busy writing letters dearest child i am in the wayi interrupt you and as damaris hastily denied that such was the case ah but i do she repeated i have no right to dart in on you thus a limproviste it is hardly treating such an impressive young personabsolutely i believe you have grown since i saw you lastyes you are taller darling childhandsomer than ever and a tiny bit alarming toowhat have you been doing with or to or by yourselftreating herthe impressive young person i meanwith proper respect but it was such a chance i learnt that you were alonea fib alas on henriettas partand i couldnt resist coming i so longed to have you like this all to myself what an eternity since we metfor me a wearing ageing eternity the duties of a sickroom are so horribly anxious yet so deadening in their repetition of ignoble details i could not go through with them honestly i could notthough i realize it is a damning admission for a woman to makeif it wasnt that i am rather absurdly attached to what good dr stewartwalker persists in calling our patient is not that enough in itselfto fall from all normal titles and dignities and become merely a patient no joking apart only affection makes nursing in any degree endurable to me without its saving grace the whole business would be too unpardonably sordid she pursed up her lips and shivered her graceful shoulders with the neatest exposition of delicate distaste and too gross but one must face and accept the pathetic risk of being eventually converted in garde malade thus if one chooses to marry a man considerably older than oneself it is a mistake i say so though i committed it with my eyes open i was betrayed by my affection as she finished speaking henrietta stepped across to the sofa and sat down the airy perfection of her appearance lent point to the plaintive character of this concluding sentence the hot day the summer costumepossibly the shaded room alsocombined to strip away a good ten years from her record any hardness any faint sense of annoyance which damaris experienced at the abruptness of her guests intrusion melted henrietta in her existing aspect her existing mood proved irresistible our tenderhearted maiden was charmed by her and coerced but general frayling is better isnt he she asked also taking her place upon the sofa you are not any longer in any serious anxiety about him darling henrietta all danger is past oh yeshe is better of course or how could i be here but i have received a shock that makes me dread the future which was true though in a sense other than that in which her hearer comprehended it for the studious atmosphere of the room reacted upon henrietta as did its many silent testimonies to sir charles veritys constant habitation this was his workshop she felt acutely conscious of him here nearer to him in idea and in sentiment than for many years past the fact that he did still work sought new fields to conquer excited both her admiration and her regrets he disdained to be laid on the shelf got calmly and forcefully down off the shelf and spent his energies in fresh undertakings once upon a time she posed as his egeria fancying herself vastly in the part during the egerian period she lived at a higher intellectual and emotional level than ever before or since exerting every particle of brain she possessed to maintain that level the petty interests of her present existence still more perhaps the poor odd and end of a yellow little general in his infinitely futile sickbed shrank to a desolating insufficiency surely she was worthyhad anyway once been worthyof better things than that the lavender dress notwithstanding its still radiantly uncrumpled condition came near losing its spell no longer did she trust in it as in shining armour her humour soured she instinctively inclined to revenge herself upon the nearest sentient object availablenamely to stick pins into damaris sweetest child she said you cant imagine how much this room means to me through its association with your fathers wonderful bookoh yes i know a lot about the book colonel carteret has not failed to advertise his acquaintance with it but what have i said for at mention of that gentlemans name damaris so she fancied changed colour the bloom fading upon her cheeks while her glance became reserved at once proud and slightly anxious is it forbidden to mention the wonderful book at this stage of its development though even if it were she added with a rather impish laugh looking down at and fingering the little bunch of trinkets attached to a long gold chain which rested in her lapcarteret would hardly succeed in holding his peace speak of everything sooner or later he must she felt rather than saw damaris figure grow rigid have you ever detected that small weakness in him but probably not he keeps overflowings for the elder members of his acquaintance and in the case of the younger ones does exercise some caution ah yes ive no doubt he seems to you a model of discretion yet in point of fact when youve known him as long as i you will have discovered he is a more than sufficiently extensive sieve then fearing she had gone rather far since damaris remained rigid and silent not a malicious sieve the lady hastened to add raising her eyes i dont imply that for a single instant on the contrary i incline to believe that his attitude of universal benevolence is to blame for this inclination to gossip it is so great so allenclosing that i cant help feeling it blunts his sense of right and wrong to some extent he is the least censorious of men and thereforethough it may sound cynical to say soi dont entirely trust his judgment he is too ready to make excuses for everyonebut my precious child whats the matter what makes you look so terrifically solemn and severe and playfully she put her hand under the girls chin drawing the grave face towards her smilingly studying then lightly and daintily kissing it in the course of this affectionate interlude the string of pearls round damaris throat until now hidden by the vshaped collar of her soft lawn shirt caught henriettas eye their size lustre and worth came near extracting a veritable shriek of enquiry and jealous admiration from her but with praiseworthy promptitude she stifled her astonishment and now really rampant curiosity damaris but half yielded to her blandishments she must cajole more successfully before venturing to request explanation therefore she cried soothingly coaxfully theretheredescend from those imposing heights of solemnity or upon my word you will make me think my poor little visit displeases and bores you that would be peculiarly grievous to me since it is in all probability my last your last damaris exclaimed yes darling child the fiat alas has gone forth we are ordered away and start for cotteretlesbains in a day or two dr stewartwalker considers the move imperative on account of general fraylings health this was only settled yesterday marshall would have rushed here to tell you but i forbade him i felt i must tell you myself i confess it is a blow to me our tenancy of the pavilion expires at the end of the month but i proposed asking for an extension and if that failed taking up our abode at the hotel for a while to me dr stewartwalkers orders come as a bitter disappointment for i counted on remaining until easterremaining just as long as you and sir charles and carteret remained in fact here the bloom far from further extinction warmed to a lovely blush henriettas curiosity craned its naughty neck standing on tiptoe but the blush notwithstanding damaris looked at her with such sincerity of quickening affection and of sympathy that she again postponed crossexamination for over this piece of news our maiden couldin its superficial aspects at all eventslament in perfect good faith she proceeded to do so eagerly embracing the opportunity to offer thanks and praise all henriettas merits sprang into convincing evidence had not her hospitality been unstintedthe whole english colony had cause to mourn but for you theyd still be staring at one another bristling like so many strange dogs damaris said and you smoothed them all down so divertingly oh you were beautifully clever in that it was a lesson in the art of the complete hostess while as for me henrietta youve simply spoiled me i can never thank you enough think of the amusements past counting you planned for me the excursions youve let me share with youour delicious drives and above all my comingout dance whereat mrs frayling disclaimingly shook her very pretty head in pleasing you i have merely pleased myself dearest so in that theres no meritthough i do plead guilty to but languid enthusiasm for girls of your age as a rule their conversation and opinions are liable to set my teeth a good deal on edge i have small patience im afraid at the disposal of feminine beings at once so omniscient and so alarmingly unripebut you see a certain downy owl with saucer eyes and fierce little beak won my heart by its beguiling ways a dozen years ago darling henrietta damaris softly murmured and transported by sentiment to that earlier date when the said darling henrietta commanded her unqualified adoration began playing with the wellremembered bunch of trinkets depending from the long gold chain the lady wore about her neck watching her mrs frayling sighed ah my child the thought of you is inextricably joined to other thoughts upon which i should be far wiser not to dwellfar wiser to put from me and forgetonly they are stronger than i amand i cant there was a ring of honest human feeling in henrietta fraylings voice for once no noi am more justly an object of commiseration than anyone i leave behind me at st augustin and again she laughed not impishly but with a hardness altogether astonishing to her auditor think she cried of my sorry fatenot only a wretchedly ailing husband on my hands needing attention day and night but a wretchedly disconsolate young lover as well for poor marshall will be inconsolableonly too clearly do i foresee thatpicture what a pair for ones portion week in and week outwhereas you enviable being are sure of the most inspiring society everything in this quiet room she indicated the laden writingtable with a quick flitting gesture so refreshingly removed from the ordinary banal hotel salonis eloquent of the absorbing farreaching pursuits and interests amongst which you live who could ask a higher privilege than to share your fathers work to be his companion and amanuensisshe paused as emphasising the point and then mockingly threw offplus the smart beau sabreur carteret as devoted bodyguard and escort whenever you are not on duty to few women of your age or indeed of any age is fortune so indulgent a fairy godmother as that astonished and slightly resentful at the sharpness of her guests unprovoked onslaught damaris had dropped the little bunch of trinkets and backed into her corner of the sofa colonel carteret has gone she said coldly rather irrelevantly the statement drawn from her by a vague instinct of selfdefence gone henrietta echoed with equal irrelevance for she was singularly discomposed yes he started for england last night but you must know that already henrietta he wrote to youhe told me so himself but having once committed herself by use of a word implying ignorance mrs frayling could hardly do otherwise than continue the deception explanation would be too awkward a business the chances of detection moreover were infinitesimal there were things she meant to say which would sound far more unstudied and obvious could she keep up the fiction of ignorance this quickly realizing she again and more flagrantly fibbed the voluntary lie acts as a tonic giving youfor the moment at leastmost comforting conceit of your own courage and perspicacity and henrietta just now stood in need of a tonic she had been strangely overcome by the force of her own emotionan accident which rarely happened to her and which she very cordially detested when it did someone must have omitted to post the letter then she said with a suitable air of annoyance how exceedingly carelessunless it has not been sent over from the hotel to the pavilion i have been obliged more than once to complain of the hall porters very casual delivery of my letters i will make enquiries directly if i dont find it on my return but this is all by the way tell me dearest child what is the reason of colonel carterets leaving so suddenly is it not surprisingly unexpected he was wanted at home on business of some sort damaris replied as she felt a little lamely she was displeased worried by henrietta it was difficult to choose her words he has been away for a long time you see i think he has been beautifully unselfish in giving up so much of his time to us do you henrietta enquired with meaning if i remember right we discussed that point once before i can repeat now what i then told you with even firmer assurance namely that he struck me as remarkably well pleased with himself and his surroundings and generally content of course he loves being with my father damaris hastened to put in having no wish to enlarge on the topic suggested by the above speech of course who doesnt or rather who wouldnt were they sufficiently fortunate to have the chance but cometo be honestje me demande is it exclusively sir charles whom carteret loves to be with and as she spoke henrietta bent forward from the waist her dainty lavender skirts spread out on the faded blue of the sofa mattress the contours of her dainty lavender bodice in fine relief against the faded blue cushions her whole person in the subdued light bright and apparently fragile as some delicate toy of spun glass she put out her hand and lightly mischievously touched the string of pearls encircling the girls throat and what is the meaning of these then she asked you sweetly deceiving little puss it was cleverly done she flattered herself she asserted nothing implied much putting the onus of admission or denial upon damaris the answer came with grave and unhesitating directness colonel carteret gave them to me so i imagined they are the exquisite fruit arent they of the little expedition by train of two days ago damaris temper rose but so did her protective instinct for that journey to marseilles connected as it was with the dear secret of darcy faircloth did not admit of investigation by henrietta about where and when colonel carteret may have got them for me i know nothing she returned he left them to be given to me last night after he went she unclasped the necklace they are very lovely pearls arent they pray look at them if you care to henrietta she said thus at once invited and repulsedfor that it amounted to a repulse she could not but acknowledgemrs frayling advised herself a temporary retreat might be advisable she therefore discoursed brightly concerning pearls and suchlike costly frivolities inwardly covetousness consumed her since she possessed no personal ornament of even approximate value the conversation drifted she learned the fact of miss felicias projected arrival and deplored her own approaching exile the less only once long ago had she encountered miss verity the memory afforded her no satisfaction for that ladys peculiar brand of good breeding andas she qualified itimbecility did not appeal to her in the least there was matter of thankfulness therefore she had not elected to join sir charles and damaris sooner she would undoubtedly have proved a most tiresome and impeding element unlesshere henriettas mind dartedunless she happened to take a fancy to marshall blameless spinsters of her uncertain age and of many enthusiasms did not infrequently very warmly take to himin plain english fell over head and ears in love with him poor things though without knowing it their critical faculty being conspicuous by its absence where their own hearts were concernedby the way that was an ideaswiftly henrietta reviewed the possibilities it suggestedas an ally an auxiliary miss felicia might be well worth cultivation would it not be diplomatic to let marshall stay on at the hotel de la plage by himself for a week or so the conquest of miss felicia might facilitate another conquest on which herhenriettasmind was set for such mature enamoured virgins as she reflected are almost ludicrously selfless to ensure the happiness of the beloved object they will even donate to him their rivalyesdistinctly an idea but before attempting to reduce it to practice she must make more sure of her ground in another direction during the above meditation henrietta continued to talk off the surface her mind working on two distinct planes damaris off the surface continued to answer her our maiden felt tired both in body and in spirit she felt all rubbed up the wrong waydisturbed confused the many moral turns and twists of henriettas conversation had been difficult to follow but from amid the curious maze of them one thing stood out arrestingly conspicuoushenrietta believed it then also believed carteret cared for her in that waythus with a turning aside of the eyes and shrinking she phrased it it wasnt any mistaken conceited imagination of her own since henrietta so evidently shared it and henrietta must be reckoned an expert in that line having a triad of husbands to her credita liberality of allowance in matrimony which had always appeared to damaris as slightly excessive she had avoided dwelling upon this so outstanding feature of her friends career but that it gave assurance of the latters ability to pronounce upon caring in that way was she now admitted incontestable whether she really felt glad or sorry henriettas expert opinion confirmed her own suspicions damaris could not tell it certainly tended to complicate the future and for that she was sorry she would have liked to see the road clear before heranyhow for a timecomplications having been over numerous lately they were worrying they made her feel unsettled unnatural in any case she trusted she shouldnt suffer again from those odious yet alluring feelings which put her to such shame this morningbutunpleasant thoughtwerent they perhaps an integral part of the whole agitating business of caring in that way her eyes rested in wide meditative enquiry upon henrietta henrietta sitting up in all her finished elegance upon the faded blue sofa and so diligently making company conversation somehow thus viewing her it was extremely difficult to suppose henrietta had ever experienced excited feelings yetthe wonder of itshed actually been married three times then wearily damaris made a return upon herself yesshe was glad although it might seem ungrateful disloyal the man with the blue eyes had gone away for his going put off the necessity of knowing her own mind excused her from making out exactly how she regarded him thus relegating the day of fateful decision to a dim distance henrietta accused him of being a sievedamaris grew heated in strenuous denial that was a calumny which she didnt and wouldnt credit still you could never be quite sure about menso she went back on the old sad disquieting lesson their way of looking at things their angle of admitted obligation is so bewilderingly differentoh how thankful she was aunt felicia would soon be here everything would grow simpler easier to understand and to manage more as it used to be with dear aunt felicia here on the spot at this point she realized that mrs frayling was finishing a sentence to the beginning of which she had not paid the smallest attention that was disgracefully rude so i am to go home then dearest child and break it to marshall that he stands no chancemy poor marshall who has no delightful presents with which to plead his cause mr waceplead his cause what cause i am so sorry henriettaforgive me its too dreadful but i am afraid i wasnt quite listeningthis with most engaging confusion yeshis cause i should have supposed his state of mind had been transparently evident for many a long day but indeedhenrietta you must be mistaken i dont know what you meanthe other interposed smitten by the liveliest distress and alarm the elder lady waved aside her outcry with admirable playfulness and determination oh i quite realize how crazy it must appear on his part poor dear fellow seeing he has so little to offer from the worldly and commercial standpoint as he himself saysthe desire of the moth for the star of the night for the morrow still money and position are not everything in life are they talent is an asset and so i humbly believe is the pure devotion of a good mans heart these count for something or used to do so when i was your age but then the women of my generation were educated in a less sophisticated school you modern young persons are wiser than we were no doubt in that you are less romantic less easily touchedi have not ventured to give marshall much encouragement it would have been on my conscience to foster hopes which might be dashed and yet i own darling child your manner not once nor twice during our happy meetings at the pavilion when he read aloud to us or sang gave me the impression you were not entirely indifferent he i know has thought so toofor i have not been able to resist letting him pour out his hopes and fears to me now and then i could not refuse either him or myself that indulgence because mrs frayling rose and bending over our much tried and now positively flabbergasted damsel brushed her hair with a butterfly kiss because my own hopes were also not a little engaged she said your manner to my poor marshall your willingness to let him so often be with you made meperhaps foolishlybelieve not only that his sad life might be crowned by a signal blessing but you might be given to me some day as a daughter of whom i could be intensely proud i have grown to look upon marshall in the light of a son and his wife would damaris had risen also she stood at bay white strained her lips quivering dodo you mean that i have behaved badly to mr wace henrietta that i have flirted with him mrs frayling drew her mouth into a naughty little knot there were awkward corners to be negotiated in these questions she avoided them by boldly striking for the open oh it is natural perfectly natural at your rather thoughtless time of life only marshalls admiration for you is very deep he has the poetic temperament which makes for suffering for despair as well as for rapture and his disillusionments poor boy have been so grievously manybut colonel carteretyesdearest child i do quite followits an old story he has always had des bonnes fortunes since her return to europe mrs frayling had become much addicted to embellishing her conversation with such foreign tags not invariably it may be added quite correctly applied or quoted women could never resist him in former days in india they went down before his charms like a row of ninepins before a ball i dont deny a passing tendresse for him myself though i was married and very happily married so i can well comprehend how he may take a girls fancy by storm sans peur et sans reproche he must seem to herand so in the main i dare say he is at worst a little easygoing owing to his cultivation of the universally benevolent attitude charity has a habit of beginning at home you know and a man usually views his own delinquencies at least as leniently as he views those of others but that leniency is part of his charmwhich i admit is greatheaven forbid i should undermine your faith in it if there is anything settled between you and him but there isnt there isnt damaris broke in distressed beyond all calmness of demeanour you go too fast henrietta you assume too much nothing is settled ofof that sort nothing of that sort has ever been said mrs frayling raised her eyebrows cast down her eyes and fingered the bunch of trinkets hanging from her gold chain in silence for a few seconds the ring of sincerity was unquestionableonly where did that land her had not she in point of fact very really gone too fast in defeat henrietta became unscrupulous merely another flirtation damaris she said darling child i am just a wee bit disappointed in you which among her many fibs may rank amongst her most impudent and fullfed though by no means her last here the door opened behind her henrietta turned alertly hailing any interruption whichher bolt being shotmight facilitate her retreat from a now most embarrassing situation after all she had planted more than one seed which might fruitfully grow so at that she could leave mattersthe interruption however took a form for which she was unprepared to her intense disgust her nerves played her false she gave the oddest little stifled squeak as she met charles veritys glance fixed upon her in cool slightly ironic scrutiny some persons very sensibly bring their mental atmosphere along with them you are compelled to breathe it whether you like or not the atmosphere charles verity brought with him at this juncture was too masculine intellectually too abstract yet too keenly critical for comfortable absorption by henriettas lungs her selfcomplacency shrivelled in it she felt but a mean and pitiful creature especially in her recent treatment of damaris it was a nasty moment the more difficult to surmount because of that wretchedly betraying squeak fury against herself gingered her up to action she must be the first to speak ah how delightful to see you she said a little overplaying the partthough only for an instant i was in the act of bidding damaris farewell as it is i have scandalously outstayed my leave but we had a thousand and one things hadnt we to say to one another she smiled upon both father and daughter with graceful deprecation au revoir darling childwe must manage to meet somehow just once more before i take my family north and still talking new lavender dress trinkets faint fragrance and all she passed out on to the corridor accompanied by sir charles verity chapter xiii which recounts a taking of sanctuary left alone damaris sat down on the windowseat within the shelter of the wooden shutters which interposed a green barred coolness between her and the brilliant world without that those two her father and henrietta frayling should thus step off together the small softly crisp feminine figure beside the tall finedrawn andin a waymagnificent masculine one troubled her yet she made no attempt to accompany or to follow them her head ached her mind and soul ached too she felt spent and giddy as from chasing round and round in an evershifting circle some tormenting cleverly lovely thing which perpetually eluded her which thing finally floated out of the door there drawing a personage unmeasurably its superior away with it and leaving herdamarisdeserted leaving moreover every subject on which its nimble tongue had lighted damaged by that contactat loose ends frayed and ravelled its inwove pattern just slightly discoloured and defaced the patterned fabric of damaris thought and inner life had not been spared but suffered disfigurement along with the rest she felt humiliated felt unworthy the ingenious torments of a false conscience gnawed her her better judgment pronounced that conscience veritably false or would as she believed so pronounce later when she had time to get a true perspective but just now she could only lamentably childishly cry out against injustice for wasnt henrietta mainly responsible for the character of her intercourse with marshall wace hadnt henrietta repeatedly entreated her to see much of him be kind to himwishing even in her present rebellion to be quite fair she acknowledged that she had enjoyed his singing and reading that she had felt pleased at his eagerness to confide his troubles to her and talk confidentially about himself she not unwillingly accepted a mission towards him stimulated thereto by henriettas plaudits and thanks andand colonel carteret for now somehow she no longer even in thought could call him by her old name for him the dear man with the blue eyescould it be true as henrietta intimated that he went through life throwing the handkerchief first to one woman and then to another that there was no real constancy or security in his affections but all was lightly come and lightly go with him how her poor head ached she held it in both hands and closed her eyesshe would not think any more about colonel carteret to do so made her temples throb and raised the lump which is a precursor of tears in her throat noshe couldnt follow henriettas statements and arguments either way they were selfcontradictory still whose ever the fault that the young man wace should be unhappy on her account should think shedamarishad behaved heartlessly to him was quite dreadful humiliating toofalse conscience again gnawing had she really contracted a debt towards him which shein his opinion and henriettastried to repudiate she seemed to hear it the rich impassioned voice and hear it with a new comprehension was caring in that way what it had striven to tell her and had she incomparably dense in missing its meaning appeared to sanction the message and to draw him on other people understoodso at least henrietta implied while she remaining deaf had rather cruelly misled him ought she not to do something to make up yet what could she doit had never occurred to her thatthat she held her head tight held it on as with piteous humour she told herself since she seemed in high danger of altogether losing itmust she believe herself inordinately stupid or was she made differently to everybody else for as she now suspected most people are constantly occupied are quite immensely busy about caring in that way and she shrank from it actively and angrily disliked it she felt smirched felt all dealings as between men and women made suspect rendered ugly almost degraded by the factif fact it wasof that kind of caring and excited feelings it induces lurking just below the surface ready to dart outand this not quite honestly either the whole matter savoured of hypocrisy since the feelings disguised themselves in beautiful sounds beautiful words clothing their unseemliness with the noble panoply of poetry and art masquerading in wholesome garments of innocent goodcomradeship a grind of wheels on the gravel below henriettas neat limpid accents and charles veritys grave ones the flourish and crack of a whip and scrambling start of the little chestnut horses the rhythmical beat of their quick even trot and thin tinkle of their collar bells receding into the distance these sounds to our sorrowfully perplexed maiden opened fresh fields of uneasy speculation for those diverse accentsthe speakers being unseenheard thus in conjunction seized on and laboured her imagination throughout the past months of frequent meeting damaris had never quite understood her fathers attitude towards henrietta frayling it was marked by reserve yet a reserve based as she somehow divined upon an uncommon degree of former intimacy judging from remarks let drop now and again by henrietta they knew or rather had known one another very well indeed this bore out damaris own childhoods recollections though in these last she was aware of lacunae of gaps of spaces unbridged by any coherent sequence of remembered events a dazzling and delicious image the idol of her baby adorationthus did memory paint that earlier henrietta surrounding circumstances remained shadowy she could not recall them even in respect of herself still less in respect of her father so that question as to the past ruled the present what had parted them and how did they today envisage one another she could not make out had never indeed attempted seriously to make out shying from such investigation as disloyal and in a way irreverent now investigation was forced on her her mind worked independent of her will so that she could neither prevent or arrest it sir charles showed himself scrupulously attentive and courteous to general frayling he offered no spoken objection to her association with henrietta yet an unexplained element did remain subtlely but perceptibly it permeated both her fathers and henriettas speech and bearing she damaris was always conscious of a certain constraint beneath their calm and apparently easy talk was their relation one of friendship or of covert enmityor did these just perceptible peculiarities of it betoken something deeper and closer still suspicion once kindled spreads like a conflagrationdamaris hands dropped a dead weight into her lap she sat strained yet inert as though listening to catch the inner significance of her own unformulated question her eyes wide and troubled her lips apart for might it not be that they had oncelong agoin the princely eastern pleasure palace of her childhoodcared in that way then the tears which what with tiredness and the labour pains of her many conflicting emotions had threatened more than once today came into their own she wept quietly noiselessly the tears running down her cheeks unchecked and unheeded for there was no escape turn where she would join hands with whom she would in all good faith and innocence this thing reared its head and evilly alluring looked at her now it set its claim upon her wellbeloved sultanibaghand what scene could in truth be more sympathetic to its display she felt the breath of high romance imagination played strange tricks with her she could feel she could picture a drama of rare quality with those two figures as protagonists it dazzled while wounding her she remembered faircloths words spoken on that evening of fateful disclosure when knowledge of things as they are first raped her happy ignorance while the boat drifted through the shrouding darkness of rain upon the inky waters of the tideriverthey were young he had said and maynt we allow they were beautiful they met and god help them they loved the statement covered this case also to a nicety it explained everything but what an explanation leaving her damaris doubly orphaned and desolate for the first case that of which faircloth actually had spoken brought her royal if secret compensation in the brotherhood and sisterhood it made known but this second case brought nothing save a sense of being tricked and defrauded the victim of a conspiracy of silence for nothing as it now appeared was really her own nor had really belonged to her some one so she phrased it in the incoherence of her pain had always been there before her what she supposed her exclusive property was only secondhand had been already owned by others they let her play at being first in the field original and sole proprietress because it saved them trouble by keeping her quiet and amused but all the while they knew better and must have smiled at her possessive antics once her silly back was turned and here damaris lost sight of reasonable proportion and measure exaggerating wildly her pride and selfrespect cut to the quick it was thus in the full flood of mystification and resentment charles verity found her when presently he returned sensible of something very much amiss since she stayed within the shadow of the closed shutters silent and motionless he crossed the room and stood before her looking down searchingly into her upturned face stubborn in her misery she met his glance with mutinous and hard if misty eyes weeping my dear is the occasion worth it has mrs frayling then taken so profound a hold he asked his tone mocking chiding her yet very gently damaris hedged to expose the root of her trouble became impossible under the coercion of that gently bantering tone its not henriettas going but that i no longer mind her going a lost illusionyes he said i cant trust her sheshe isnt kind eh he said so you too have made that illuminating little discovery i supposed it would be only a matter of time but you read character my dear more quickly than i do what it has taken you months to discover took me years his frankness the unqualified directness of his response though startling stimulated her daring thenthen you dont really like henrietta she found audacity enough to say ah there you rush too headlong to conclusions he reasoned still with that same frankness of tone she is an ingenious unique creature towards whom ones sentiments are ingenious and unique in their turn i admire her althoughfor you are right thereshe is neither invariably trustworthy nor invariably kind admire her ungrudgingly now i no longer ask of her what she hasnt it in her to give limit your demand and you limit the risks of disappointmenta piece of wisdom easier to enunciate than to apply lean graceful commanding under the cloak of his present gentle humour charles verity sat down on the faded red cushion beside damaris and laid one arm along the windowledge behind her he did not touch her being careful in the matter of caresses reverent of her person chary of claiming parental privileges unasked in the making of henrietta frayling he went on by some accident soul was left out she hasnt any she does not know it let us hope she never will know it for it is too late now for the omission to be rectified are you laughing at me damaris asked still stubborn though his presence enclosed her with an at once assuaging and authoritative charm not in the least i speak that which i soberly believe just as some illstarred human creatures are born physically or mentally defectivedeformed or idiotsso may they be born spiritually defective why not my reason offers no scientific or moral objection to such a belief in other respects she is conspicuously perfect but verily she has no soul and the qualities whichfor happiness or miserydraw their life from the soul she does not possess therefore she sparkles lovely and chill as frost is as astute as she is cold at heart and can when it suits her purpose be both false and cruel without any subsequent prickings of remorse but this very coldness and astuteness save her from misdeeds of the coarser kind treacherous she has been and for aught i know may on occasions still be but though temptation has pretty freely crossed her path she has never been other than virtuous she is a good womanin the accepted the popular sense of the word silence stole down upon the room damaris remained motionless leaning forward gathered close into herself her hands still heavy in her lap could she accept this statement as comfort or must she bow under it as rebuke why she asked at last huskilythe tears were no longer upon her cheeks but queerly in her throat impeding utterance do you tell me these things to prevent you beholding lying visions my dear or dreaming lying dreams of what might very well have been butgod be thankednever has beennever wasthink a minuterememberlook and once more damaris felt the breath of high romance and touched drama of rare quality with those same two figures as protagonists and that same indian pleasure palace as their stage but this time with a notable difference of sentiment and of result for she visualized another going of henrietta a flight before the dawn saw through a thick scentdrenched atmosphere between the expiring lamplight and broadening day a deserted child beating its little hands in the extremity of its impotent anguish upon the pillows of a disordered unmade bed saw a man too worn and travelstained from long riding throughout the night lost to all decent dignities of selfcontrol savage with the animalism of frustrated passion rage to and fro amidst the litter of a smart womans hurried packing a trail of pale blue ribbon plucking at and tripping him entangled in the rowels of his spurs all this she saw and knew that her fathersitting on the cushioned windowseat beside her his legs crossed his chin sunk on his breastsaw it also that he indeed voluntarily and of set purpose made her see transferring the living picture from his consciousness to her own and as she watched each detail growing in poignancy and significance shenot all at once but gropingly rebelliously and only by degreescomprehended that purpose and the abounding love both of herself and of justice which dictated it divining the root of her trouble and the nature of her suspicion he took this strange means to dissipate them setting aside his natural pride he caused her to look upon his hour of defeat and debasement careless of himself if thereby he might mend her hurt and win her peace of mind damaris was conquered her stubbornness went down before his sacrifice all the generosity in her leapt forth to meet and to acclaim the signal generosity in hima generosity extended not only towards herself but to henrietta frayling as well this last damaris recognized as superbhe bade her remember and seeing in part through her own eyes in part through his she penetrated more deeply into his mind into the rich diversity and now mastered violence of his character than could otherwise have been possible she learnt him from within as well as from without he had been terribleso she rememberedyet beautiful in his fallen godhead she had greatly feared him under that aspect later she more than ever loved him and that with a provenant protective and baby though she was a mothering love he was beautiful now but no longer terrible no longer fallenif not the godhead yet the fine flower of his manhood royally and very sweetly disclosed her whole being yearned towards him but humbly a note of lowliness in her appreciation as towards something exalted far above her in experience in selfknowledge and selfdiscipline she was indeed somewhat overwhelmed both by realization of his distinction and of her own presumption in judging him to the point of being unable as yet to look him in the face so she silently laid hold of his hand drew it down from the windowledge and round her waist slipping along the cushioned seat until she rested against him she laid her head back upon his shoulder testimony in words seemed superfluous after that shared consciousness seemed impertinent even an anticlimax from which both taste and insight recoiled for a while charles verity let the silent communion continue then lest it should grow enervating to either or to both he spoke of ordinary subjectsof poor little general fraylings illness of miss felicias plans of his own book it was wiser for her better also for himself to step back into the normal thus quietly closing the door upon their dual act of retrospective clairvoyance damaris catching his intention responded and if rather languidly yet loyally played up but before the spell was wholly broken and frankness gave place to their habitual reserve there was one further question she must ask if the gnawings of that false conscience begotten in her by henriettas strictures were wholly to cease do you mind if we go back just a little minute she said still unsatisfied my dear not unsatisfiednever again that as between us two commissioner sahib you have made everything beautifully everlastingly smooth and clear then why tempt providence or rather human incertitude by going back becausecan i say it quite plainly as plainly as you will because henrietta tells me i havehave flirtedhave played fast and loose withwith more than one person a pause and the question came from above herher head still lying against his breastwith a trace of severity or was it anxiety and have you not intentionallynot knowingly damaris said if that is so is it not sufficient nobecause she implies that i have raised false hopes and so entangled myselfand that i ought to go further that as i understand her i ought to be ready to marrythat it is not quite honourable to withdraw charles verity moved slightly yet held her close she felt the rise and fall of his ribs as he breathed slow and deep do you want to marry he at last asked her no she said simply id much rather not if i can keep out of it without acting unfairly by anyoneif you dont agree with henrietta and dont think i need you dont want me to marry do you god in heaven no charles verity answered he put her from him rose and moved about the room to me the thought of giving you in marriage to any man is little short of abhorrent he said hoarsely for fear clutched him by the throat the gift of pearls the little scene of last night and damaris emotion in bidding carteret farewell confronted him the idea had never occurred to him before now it glared at him or rather he glared at it it would be torment to say yes and yet very difficult to say his best friend nay anger kindled against henrietta frayling must this be regarded as her handiwork yet he could hardly credit it or had she some other candidateperegrine ditton young harry ellicebut they were mere boysof marshall wace he never thought the young man being altogether outside his field of vision in this connection long habit of personal chastity made charles verity turn with a greater stabbing and rending of repulsion from the thought of marriage for damaris she asserted she had no wish to marry that shebless her sweet simplicitywould rather not but this bare broaching of the subject threw him into so strange a tumult that only too evidently he was no competent observer he laboured under too violent a prejudice he had no right to demand from others the abstinence he chose himself to practise carteret in desiring her was within his rights damaris within hers were she moved by his suit marriage is natural wholesome the godordained law and sanction of human increase since man first drew breath here upon earth to condemn obedience to that law by placing any parental embargo upon damaris marriage would be both a defiance of nature and act of grossest selfishness he sat down on the windowseat again and forced himself to put his arm around that fair maiden body destined to be the prize one day of some mans love the preyfor he disdained to mince matters turning the knife in the wound ratherthe prey of some mans lust he schooled himself while damaris heart beat a little tempestuously under his hand to invite a conclusion which through every nerve and fibre he loathed my dear he said i spoke unadvisedly with my lips just now letting crude male jealousy get the mastery of reason and common sense put my words out of your mind they were unjustifiable spoken in foolish heat if you are in love with anyone damaris nestled against him only with you dearest i think she said charles verity hesitated unable to speak through the exquisite blow she delivered and his swift thankfulness let us put the question differently thentranslating it into the language of ordinary social convention tell me has anyone proposed to you damaris still nestling shook her head nono one and i hope now no one will i escaped that partly thanks to my own densenessit is not an easy thing commissioner sahib to explain or talk about but i have come rather close to it lately andwith a hint of vehemencei dont like it there is something in it which pulls at me but not at the best part of me so that i am divided against myself though it does pull i still want to push it all away with both hands i dont understand myself and i dont understand it i would rather be without itforget itif you think i am free to do so if you are satisfied that i havent intentionally hurt anyone or contracted aa kind of debt of honour i am altogether satisfied he said until the strange and ancient malady attacks you in a very much more virulent form you are free to cast henrietta fraylings insinuations to the winds to ignore them and their existence book iv through shadows towards the dawn chapter i which carries over a tale of years and carries on the last sentence was written his work finished and looking upon his completed creation charles verity saw that it was good yet as he put the pen back in the pentray and laying the last page of manuscript face downwards upon the blottingpaper passed his hand over it he was less sensible of exultation than of a pathetic emptiness the book had come to be so much part of him that he felt a nasty wrench when he thus finally rid himself of it he had kept the personal pronoun out of it strictly and austerely desiring neither selfglorification nor selfadvertisement yet his mind and attitude towards life seasoned and tempered the whole giving it vitality and force this was neither a drumandtrumpet history designed to tickle the vulgar ear nor a blank fourwall depository of dry facts names dates statistics such as pedants mustily adore but a living thing seen and felt not his subconscious but that much finer andas one trustsmore permanent element in our human constitution his superconscious self found expression in its pages and travelled freely fruitfully through them amid luminous and masterful ideas at times the intellectual sweep threatened to be overdaring and overwide so that in the interests of symmetry and balance of construction he had been forced to clip the wings of thought lest they should bear him to regions too remotely high and rare race religion customs and the modifications of these both by climate and physical conformation of the land on the face of which they operate went to swell the interest and suggestion of his theme in handling such varied and coloured material the intellectual exercise had been to him delicious as he fashioned and put a fine edge to passages of admirable prose coined the just yet startling epithet perfected the flow of some graceful period and ransacked the english language for fearless words in which to portray the mingled splendour and vileness of a barbaric oriental court the naked terrors of tribal feuds and internecine war the occupation had indeed proved at once so refreshing and so absorbing that he went leisurely lengthening out the process of production until it came nearer covering the thirty months of elephantine gestation than the normal human nine with but two brief sojourns to england for the consultation of certain authorities and of his publishers the said near on thirty months were passed in wandering through southern france central italy and taking ship from naples to malaga finally through eastern and northern spain charles verity was too practised a campaigner for his power of concentration to depend on the stability or familiarity of his surroundings he could detach himself go out into and be alone with his work at will but the last chapter like the first he elected to write in the study at the hard a pious offering of incense this to the pleasant memory of that excellent scholar and devoted amateur of letters his greatuncle thomas clarkson verity whose society and conversation awakened the literary sense in him as a schoolboy on holiday from harchester now nearly five decades ago he judged it a matter of good omen moreovertoying for the moment with kindly superstitionthat the book should issue from a house redeemed by his kinsman from base and brutal uses and dedicated to the worship of knowledge and of the printed word that fat softbodied mercurialminded little gentlemanto whom no record of human endeavour of human speculation mental or moral experiment came amisswould surely relish the compliment if his curious and genial ghost still in any sort had cognizance of this his former dwellingplace the hard just now showed a remarkably engaging countenance the year standing on the threshold of maymild softly bright weather made amends

saw tipping about the branches of the fir trees in the wilderness along with the linnets tits and goldfinches such out of doors was the home world which received damaris after those many months of continental travel on the eve of her twentyfirst birthday to pass from the dynamic to the static mode must be always something of an embarrassment and trial especially to the young with whom sensation is almost disconcertingly direct and lively damaris suffered the change of conditions not without a measure or doubt and wonder for they made demands to which she had become unaccustomed and to which she found it difficult to submit quite naturally and simply a whole social and domestic order bristling with petty obligations closed down upon her within the bounds of which she felt to move awkwardly at first conscious of constraint sympathetic mrs cooper comely and comfortable mary and the napoleonic patch still reigned in house and stable laura had returned to her former allegiance on the announcement of the familys arrival and other underlings had been engaged by the upper servants in conclave to these latter entered that ulysses mr hordle so rendering the establishment once again complete the neighbours duly calleddr and mrs horniblow conscious of notable preferment since high ecclesiastical powers had seen fit to present the former to a vacant canonry at harchester for three months yearly he would in future be resident in the cathedral city this would necessitate the employment of a curate at deadham for the spiritual life of its inhabitants must by no means suffer through its vicars promotion at the moment of sir charles and damaris return the curate excitement was at its height it swept through the spinsterranks of the congregation like an epidemic they thrilled with unacknowledgeable hopes the miss minetts though mature grew pink and quivered confessing themselves not averse to offering board and lodging to a suitable a wellconnected wellconducted paying guest to outpourings on the enthralling subject of the curate damaris found herself condemned to listen from every feminine visitor in turn it held the floor to the exclusion of all other topics her own long absence long journeys let alone the affairs of the world at large were of no moment to these very local souls so our young lady retired within herself deploring the existence of curates in general and the projected individual deadham curate in particular with a heartiness she was destined later to remember had it been propheticnot impossibly so granted the somewhat strange prescience by which she was at times possessed for the psychic quality that from a child now and again had manifested itself in herthough happily unattended by morbid or hysteric tendencies thanks to her radiant healthgrew with her growth to her in certain moods and under certain conditions the barrier between things seen and unseen material and transcendental was pervious it yielded before the push of her apprehension sense of what it guards what it withholds within an ace of breaking through affairs of the heart would so far seem to have begun and ended with the winter spent at st augustin now and again damaris met an englishman or foreigner who stirred her slightly but if one accident of travel brought them together another accident of travel speedily swept them apart the impression was fugitive superficial fading out and causing but momentary regret colonel carteret she only saw in london during those two brief visits to england he had been captivating treating her with playful indulgence teasing a little but far away somehowso she felt himthough infinitely kind and the dear man with the blue eyesfor she could use her old name for him again now though she couldnt quite tell whylooked older the sentimental passage at st augustin assumed improbabilitya fact over which she should in all reason have rejoiced yet over which she in point of fact when safe from observation just a little wept from henrietta some few letters reached her one of them contained the news that marshall wace surmounting his religious doubts and scruplesby precisely what process remained undeclaredhad at last taken holy orders concerning this joyful consummation henrietta waxed positively unctuous he had gone through so muchthe old cryto which now was added conviction that his own trials fitted him to minister the more successfully to his brethren among the sorely tried his preaching will i feel certain be quite extraordinarily original and sympatheticfull of poetry and i need hardly tell you what an immense relief it is both to the general and to myself to feel he is settled in life and that his future is provided forthough not alas in the way i fondly hoped and whichfor his happiness sake and my owni should have chosen she insidiously and even rather cynically wrote but if in respect of the affections our maiden during these two years made no special progress and gained no further experimental knowledge of the perilous workings of sex her advance in other departments was ample for faith now called to her with no uncertain note the great spiritual forces laid hold of her intelligence and imagination drawing moulding enlightening her in the library of a somewhat grim hotel at avila in old castile she lighted upon an english translation of the life of st theresathat woman of countless practical activities seer and sybil mystic and wit the amazing biography set her within the magic circle of christian feminine beatitude and opened before her gaze mighty perspectives of spiritual increase leading upward through unnumbered ranks of prophets martyrs saints angelic powers to the feet of the virgin mother with the divine child on her armhe this last as gateway intermediary between the human soul and the mystery of god almighty by whom and in whom all things visible and invisible subsist for the first time some dim and halting perception some faintest hint and echo reached damaris of the awful majesty the awful beauty of the fount of universal being and caught with a great trembling she worshipped this culminating perception in terms of time amounted to no more than a single flash the fraction of an instants contact an hour or so later being very young and very human the things of everyday resumed their sway a new dress engaged her fancy a railway journey throughto heruntrodden country excited her a picturesque street scene held her delighted interest nevertheless that had taken place within hercall it conversion evocation the spiritual receiving of sight as you pleaseupon which for those who have once experienced it there is no going back while life and reason last obscured overlaid buried beneath the dust of the trivial and immediate the mark of revelation upon the forehead and the heart can never be obliterated quite its resurrection is not only possible but certain if not on the near side then surely on the farther side of death and not only did faith thus call her at this period but art in its many forms called her likewise the two indeed according to her present understanding of them movedthough at different levelsside by side singularly conjoined art translating faith into terms of sound form and colour faith consecrating and supplementing art all of which as she pondered appeared to her only fitting and reasonablethe object of art being to capture beauty and touch reality the substance of faith being nothing less than beauty and reality absolute with sir charles sometimes but more often with her aunt miss feliciamost enthusiastic diligent and ingenuous of sightseersshe visited buildings of historic interest galleries of statuary and of pictures for here too in architecture in marble god or hero upon painted panel or canvas she caught at moments some flickering shadow of the everlasting light touched at moments both by its abiding terror and the ecstasy of its everlasting youth but this appreciation of the height and grandeur of mans endeavour was new in her to nature she had from childhood been curiously near she sought expression and confirmation of it with silent ardour her mind aflame with the joy of recognition and as daily hourly background to these her many experiments and excursions was the stable interest of her fathers book for in the pages of that too she caught sight of beauty and reality of no mean order held nobly to ransom through the medium of words and while this high humour still possessed her alive at every point her thoughtsoften by day still oftener in dreams or wakeful intervals by nightrapt away beyond the stars she was called upon as already noted to pass abruptly from the dynamic to the static mode called on to embrace domestic duties and meet local social obligations including polite endurance of longdrawn disquisitions regarding canon horniblows impending curate the drop proved disconcerting or would have eminently done so had not another elementdisquieting yet very dearcome into play meantime the change from the stimulating continental atmosphere to the particularly soft and humid not to say stagnant english one acted as a drop too she drooped during the process of acclimatization the fetid sweet reek off the mudflats of the haven oppressed and strangely pursued her so that she asked for the horses to take her to the freshness of the high lying inland moors for a boat to carry her across the tideriver to the less confined air and outlook of the bar sight and sense of the black wooden houses upon the forbidden island hanging like disreputable boon companions about the grey stonebuilt inn oppressed and strangely pursued her too she could see them from her bedroom between the red trunks of the birdhaunted scotch firs in the wilderness first thing on clear mornings the sunlight glittered on the glass of their small windows last thing at night the dim glow of lamplight showed through open doorway or flimsy curtain from within they stood alone but curiously united and selfsufficing upon the treeless inhospitable piece of land ringed by the rivers the great whispering reedbeds and the tide their life was strangely apart from defiant of that of the mainland and the village it yielded obedience to traditions and customs of an earlier wilder age and in so much was sinister a little frightening yet out of precisely this rather primitive and archaic environment came darcy faircloth her halfbrother the human being closest to her by every tie of blood and sentiment in the world save onethe father of them both the situation was startling alike in its incongruities and in its claims during those two years of continental wanderingfollowing upon her meeting with him at marseillesthe whole sweet and perplexing matter of faircloth had fallen more or less into line taking on a measure of simplicity and of ease she thought of him with freedom wrote to him when he could advise her of his next port of callto him at deadham by his request he being very careful for her she never wroteand therefore all the more perhaps being here at deadham his home and all the suggestive accessories of it so constantly before her eyes did her relation to him suffer a painful transformation in remembrance she had come to picture him on board his ship governing his little floating kingdom with no feeble or hesitating sway but here every impeding fact of class and education every worldly obstacle to his and her intercourse above all the hidden scandal of his birth sprang into high relief all the dividing alienating influences of his antecedents his social position and her own swung in upon her with aggravated intensity and pathos away she felt sweetly secure of him sure his and her bond remained inviolate sure his affection never wavered or paled but stood always at the flood a constant quantity upon which she could draw at need orto change the metaphora steady foundation upon which her heart could safely build he would not could not ever fail her this had been sufficient to stay her longing for sight and speech of him her longing for his bodily presence but now in face of the very concrete facts of the island the inn which bore his name and where his mother lived and ruled of the property he owned the place and people to whichby half at least of his nature and much more than half his memoryhe belonged the comfort of this spiritual esoteric relation became but a meagre evasive thing it was too unsubstantial doubts and fears encircled it she grew heartsick for some fresh testimony some clear immediate assurance that time and absence had not staled or undermined the romance if only she could speak of it but that was forbidden by every obligation of filial piety never had her relation to her father been more tender more happy yet only through sudden pressure of outward circumstance could she speak to him of faircloth to do so without serious necessity would be as she saw it a wanton endangering of his peaceif only the dear man with the blue eyes hadnt removed himself she had counted upon his permanent support and counsel on his smoothing away difficulties from the path of her dealings with faircloth but he appeared to have given her altogether the goby to have passed altogether out of her orbit and meditating in the softly bright may weather beneath those high forgetmenot blue skies upon his defection our maiden felt quite desperately experienced and grown up thrown back upon her own resources thrown in upon her rather solitary life throughout the summer visitors came

of serious importance occurred directly affecting our maiden throughout spring summer and the first weeks of autumn she marked time merely her activities and emotionsin as far that is as outward expression of these last wentwere vicarious those of others she glowed over and gloried in the triumph of her fathers book it is true but it was his adventure after all rather than her own then suddenly as is the way with life events crowded on one another the drama thickened sensation was tuned to a higher pitch and it all began not unludicrously through the praiseworthy if rather illtimed moral indignation of canon horniblows newly installed curate reginald sawyer chapter ii recalling in some particulars the easiest recorded theft in human history he was short neat spectacled in manner prompt and perky in age under thirty a townsman by birth and education hailing from midlandshire further a strong advocate of organization and imbued with the deepest respect for the obligations and prerogatives of his profession upon the ethical side he took himself very seriously and so took also the decalogue as delivered to mankind amid the thunders of sinai keep the ten commandments according to the letter and you may confidently expect all things spiritual and temporal to be added unto yousuch was the basis of his teaching and of his private creed he came to deadham ardent for the reformation of that remote benighted spot so disgracefully as he fearedand rather hopedbehind the times he suspected its canonvicar of being very much too easygoing and its population in respect of moral conduct of being lamentably lax in neither of which suppositions it must be admitted was he altogether incorrect but he intended to alter all thatregarding himself thus in the light of a providentially selected new broom he applied himself diligently to sweep a highminded and earnest if not conspicuously wellbred young man he might in a suburban parish have done excellent work but upon deadham with its enervating amorous climate and queer inheritance of forest and seafaringin other words poaching and smugglingblood he was wasted out of his element and out of touch the slow moving south saxon cocked a shrewd sceptical eye at him sized him up and down and sucked in its cheek refusing to be impressed while by untoward accident his misfortune rather than his fault the earliest of his moral sweepings brought him into collision with the most reactionary element in the community namely the inhabitants of the black cottages upon the island the event fell out thus the days shortened the evenings lengthened growing misty and secret as october advanced the roads became plashy and rutted the sides of them silent with fallen leaves under foot an odd sense of excitement flickers through such autumn twilights boys herded in little troops on wickedness intent whooping and whistling to disarm their elders suspicion until the evil deed should be fairly within reach then mum as mice stealthily vanishing becoming part and parcel of the earth the hedge the harsh dusky grasses of the sandhills the foreshore lumber on the beach late one afternoon the hour of a hidden sunset reginald sawyer called at the hard and to his eminent satisfactionfor social aspirations were by no means foreign to himwas invited to remain to tea the ladiesdamaris and miss feliciawere kind the cakes and cream superlative he left in high feather and at damaris suggestion took a short cut through the wilderness and by a path crossing the warren to the lane leading up from the causeway which joins the highroad just opposite the post office and mrs doubledays shop by following this route he would save quite half a mile on his homeward journey since the grey house where he enjoyed the miss minetts assiduous and genteel hospitality is situate at the extreme end of deadham village on the road to lampit out on the warren notwithstanding the hour and the mist it was still fairly light the zigzagging sandy path plainly visible between the heath furze brakes stunted firs and thorn bushes the young clergyman although more familiar with crowded pavements and flare of gaslamps than open moorland in the deepening dusk pursued his way without difficulty what a wild region it was though he thought of the sober luxury of the library at the hard the warmth the shaded lights the wealth of books of the grace of damaris clothing and her person and wondered how people of position and education could be content to live in so out of the way and savage a spot it was melancholy to a degree in his opinionoh well he must do his best to wake it up infuse a spirit of progress into it more in keeping with nineteenthcentury ideas everyone would be grateful to him a little questioning pauseassurance in momentary eclipse then with renewed cheerfulnessof course they wouldthe upper classes that is for they must feel the disadvantages of living in such a backwater he gave them credit for the wish to advance could they but find the way all they needed was leadership which canon horniblowevidently past his workwas powerless to supply he sawyer came as a pioneer once they grasped that fact they would rally to him the good miss minetts were rallying hard so to speak already oh there was excellent material in deadham among the gentlefolk it merely needed working needed bringing out from the lower the wageearning class sunk as it was in ignorance he must he supposed expect but a poor response opposition not impossibly opposition would not daunt him you must be prepared to do people good if not with then against their will he was here to make them rebel against and shake off the remnants of the dark ages amid which they so extraordinarily appeared still to live he had no conception so low a state of civilization could exist within little over a hundred miles of the metropolisit was a mans work anyhow and he must put his back into it must organizeword of powerorganize night classes lectures with lantern slides social evenings a lads club above all was there room and necessity for this last the deadham lads were very rowdy very unruly they gathered at corners in an objectionable manner hung about the publichouse he must undersell the publichouse by offering counter attractions amongst the men he suspected a sad amount of drinking their speech too was so reprehensibly coarse he had heard horrible language in the village street he reproved the offenders openly as was his duty and his admonitions were greeted with a laugh an insolent offensive jeering laugh sawyer cut at the dark straggling furzes bordering the path with his walkingstick recollection of that laugh made him go red about the ears made his skin tingle and his eyes smart it represented an insult not only to himself but to his cloth yet hed not lost control of himself he was glad to remember though the provocation was rank he cut at the furze again being by nature combative andstopped short with a start a tremor running through him something rustled scuttled away amongst the bushes and something flapped upward behind him into the thick lowering sky above a wailing crywhether human or of bird or beast he was uncomfortably ignorantcame out of the mist ahead to be answered by a like and nearer cry from a spot which he failed in his agitation to locate under ordinary conditions the young cleric was neither troubled by imagination nor lacking in pluck his habitual outlook was sensible literal and direct but it must be owned this wide indistinct landscape over which pale vapours trailed and brooded the immense loneliness of the felt rather than seen expanse of water marsh and mudflat of the haventhe tide being lowalong with the goblin whispering chuckle of the river speeding seaward away there on his left made him oddly jumpy and nervous no human being was in sight neither did any human dwelling show signs of habitation he wished he had gone round by the road and through the length of the village he registered a vow against short cutssave in broad daylightfor his present surroundings inspired him with the liveliest distrust they were to him positively nightmarish he suffered the nastiest little fears of what might follow him what might even now peer and lurk heretofore he had considered the earth as so much dead matter to be usefully and profitably exploited by alldominant manspecially by men of his own creed and race but now the power of the earth laid hands on him she lived and mankind dwindled to the proportions of parasitic insects at most irritating some small portions of her skin her vast indifferent surface such ideas had never occurred to him before he resented themessayed to put them from him as trenching on blasphemy starting on again angry alike with himself for entertaining and with the unknown for engendering such subversive notions his pace unconsciously quickened to a run but the line of some halfdozen ragged scotch firs which here topped the low cliff bordering the river to his disordered vision seemed most uncomfortably to run alongside him stretching gaunt arms through the encircling mist to arrest his flight he regarded them with an emotion of the liveliest antipathy consciously longing meanwhile for the humming thoroughfares of his native industrial town for the rattle and grind of the horsetrams the brightly lighted shopfronts the push all about him of human labour of booming trade and vociferous politics even the glare of a gin palace flooding out across the crowded pavement at some street corner would have just now been fraught with solace convinced prohibitionist though he was for he would at least have been in no doubt how to feel towards that stronghold of satanrighteously thanking god he was not as those reprehensible others who passed in and out of its everswinging doors while towards this earth dominance this dwarfing of human life by the life of things he had hitherto called inanimate he did not know how to feel at all it attacked some unarmoured unprotected part of him against its assault he was defenceless with a sense of escape from actual danger whether physical or moral he did not stay to enquire he stumbled a few minutes later through a gap in the earthbank into the wet side lane arrived he gave himself a moments breathing space it was darker here than out upon the warren but anyhow this was a lane it had direction and meaning men had constructed it for the linking up of house with house hamlet with hamlet like all roads it represented the initial instinct of communal life the basis of a reasoned social order of civilization in short he walked forward over the soft couch of fallen watersoaked leaves his boots squelching at times into inches of sucking mud and his spirits rose he began to enter into normal relations both with himself and with things in general a hundred yards or so and the village green would be reached then on his left behind an illkept quickset hedge that guarded a strip of garden and orchard he became aware of movement among the apple trees three small figures shuffled about some dark recumbent object for the most part they went on all fours but at moments reared up on their hind legs their action was at once silent stealthy and purposeful our young clergymans shortness of sight rendered their appearance the more peculiar his normal attitude was not so completely restored moreover but that they caused him another nervous tremor then he grasped the truth while the detective latent in every moralist sprang to attention here were criminals to be brought to justice criminals caught redhanded reginald sawyer having been rather badly scared himself lustedthough honestly ignorant of any personal touch in the matterto very badly scare others standing back beside the halfopen gate screened by the hedge here high and straggling he awaited the psychological moment ready to pounce to enter the orchard and confront these sinners with their crime if their activities did by chance happen to be legitimate was to put himself altogether in the wrong he would bide his time would let them conclude theirin his beliefnefarious business and challenge them as they passed out nor had he long to wait the two smaller boys breathing hard hoisted the bulging halffilled sack on to the back of their bigger companion who bowed beneath its weight grunting with exertion advanced towards the exit sawyer laid aside his walkingstick and as the leader of the procession came abreast of him pounced but missed his aim upon which the boy cast down the sack from the mouth of which apples beets turnips rolled into the road and with a yelp bolted down the lane towards the causeway leaving his accomplices to their fate these thrown into confusion by the suddenness of his desertion hesitated and were lost for pouncing again and that the more warily for his recent failure sawyer collared one with either hand they were maladorous children and the young clergyman grasping woollen jerseyneck and shirtband the backs of his hands in contact with the backs of their moist warm dirty little necks suffered disgust yet held them the more firmly i am convinced you have no right to that fruit or to those vegetables you are stealing give an account of yourselves at once and he shook them slightly to emphasize his command one hung on his hand limp as a rag the other showed fight kicking our friend liberally about the shins with hobnailed boots which did most confoundly hurt you lem me go he cried lem me go or ill tell father and first time you come along by our place ell set the ratting dawgs on to you our ole bitch as got er teeth yet shell bite ketch the fleshy part of your leg she will and just tear and bite this carrying of war into the enemys country proved as disconcerting as unexpected while to mention the sex of an animal was in reginald sawyers opinion to be guilty of unpardonable coarseness the atmosphere of a protestant middleclass home clung to him yet begetting in him a squeamishness not to say prudery almost worthy of his hostesses the miss minetts he shook the culprits again with a will he also blushed if you were honest you would be anxious to give an account of yourselves he asserted ignoring the unpleasant matter of the dogs i am afraid you are very wicked boys you have stolen these vegetables and fruits thieves are tried by the magistrates you know and sent to prison i shall take you to the policestation there the constable will find means to make you confess beyond provoking a fresh paroxysm of kicking these adjurations were without result his captives appeared equally impervious to shame contrition or alarm they remained obstinately mute whereupon it began to dawn upon their captor that his position risked becoming not a little invidious since the practical difficulty of carrying his threats into execution was so great how could he haul two sturdy active children plus a sack still containing a goodly quantity of garden produce some quarter of a mile without help to let them go on the other hand was to have them incontinently vanish into those trailing whitish vapours creeping over the face of the landscape and once vanished they were lost to him since he knew neither their names nor dwelling place and could with no certainty identify them having seen them only in the act of struggle and in this uncertain evening light he felt himself very nastily planted on the horns of a dilemma when on a sudden there arrived help a vehicle of some description turned out of the main road and headed down the lane laocooenlike flanked on either hand by a writhing youthful figure reginald sawyer called aloud histop therepray stop darcy faircloth lighted down out of a ramshackle marychurch station fly and advanced towards the rather incomprehensible group whats happened whats the matter he said what on earth do you want with those two youngsters i want to convey them to the proper authorities sawyer answered with all the selfimportance he could muster he found his interlocutors somewhat abrupt and lordly manner at once annoying and impressive as were his commanding height and rather ruffling gait these boys have been engaged in robbing a garden i caught them in the act and it is my duty to see that they pay the penalty of their breach of the law i count on your assistance in taking them to the policestation you want to give them in charge what elsethe moral tone of this parish is i grieve to say very low sawyer talked loud and fast in the effort to assert himself low and coarse he repeated both as a warning to others and in the interests of their own future an example must be made of these two lads must it faircloth said towering above him in the pale bewildering mist the little boys who had remained curiously and rather dangerously still since the advent of this stranger now strained together signalling whispering sawyer shook them impatiently apart steady there please faircloth put in sharply it strikes me you take a good deal upon yourself may i ask who you are i am the assistant priest reginald began but his explanation was cut short by piping voices its capen darcy thats who it is we never meant no arm capen that we didnt the apples was rotting on the ground shlp me if they wasnt grannie staples was took to the union last wednesday fortnight and anyones got the run of her garden since dont you let the new parson get us put away capen we belongs to the islandim william jennifers tommy please capen and es bobby sclanders e is and being cunning alike by nature and stress of circumstance they pathetically drooped blubbering in chorus we never didnt mean no arm capen strike me dead if we did at which last implied profanity reginald sawyer shuddered loosening his grasp of what followed he could subsequently give no definite account the dignities of his sacred profession and his selfrespect alike reeled ignominiously into chaos he believed he heard the person addressed as captain darcy say quietly cut it youngsters nows your chance he felt that both the children violently struggled and that the round hard head of one of them butted him in the stomach he divined that sounds of ribald laughter in the distance proceeded from the driver of the marychurch station fly he knew two small figures raced whooping down the lane attended by squelchings of mud and clatter of heavy soled boots knew further that captain darcy after nonchalantly picking up the sack dropping it within the garden hedge and closing the rickety gate stood opposite him and quite civilly said i am sorry i could not give you the sort of assistance sir which you asked but the plan would not have worked sawyer boiled over you have compounded a felony and done all that lay in your power to undermine my authority with my parishioners fortunately i retain the boys names and can make further enquiries this however by no means relieves you of the charge of having behaved with reprehensible levity both towards my office and myself nono faircloth returned goodnaturedly sleep upon it and you will take an easier view of the transaction i have saved you from putting unmerited disgrace upon two decent families and getting yourself into hot water up to the neck i know these deadham folk better than you do im one of them you see myself theyve uncommonly long memories where theyre offended though it may suit them to speak you soft take it from me youll never hound them into righteousness they turn as stubborn as so many mules under the whip he hailed the waiting flyman good evening to you sir he said and followed by the carriage piled with seachest and miscellaneous baggage departed into the mysteriousness of deepening dusk had the young clergyman been willing to leave it at that all might yet have been well his ministry at deadham a prolonged and fruitful one since his intentions at least were excellent but as illluck would have it while still heated and sore every feather on end his natural combativeness almost passionately on top turning out in the highroad he encountered dr cripps faring westward like himself on the way to visit a patient at lampit the two joined company falling into a conversation the more confidential that the increasing darkness gave them a sense of isolation and consequent intimacy of all his neighbours the doctora peppery disappointed man struggling with a widestrewn country practice mainly prolific of bad debts conscious of his own inefficiency and perpetually smarting under imagined injuries and slightswas the very last person to exercise a mollifying influence upon sawyer in his existing angry humour the latter recounted and enlarged upon the insults he had just now suffered his hearer fanned the flame of indignation with comment and innuendorecognized faircloth from the description and proceeded to wash his hands in scandalous insinuation at the young seacaptains expense for example had not an eye to business dictated the sheltering from justice of those infant applestealing reprobates their respective fathers were good customers the islanders all had the reputation of hard drinkersand an innkeeper hardly invites occasion to lower his receipts the inn stood in old mrs faircloths name it is true but the son profited at all events vicariously by its prosperity a swaggering fellow with an inordinate opinion of his own ability and merits but in that he shared a family failing for arrogance and assumption the whole clan was difficult to beat you have heard whose son this young faircloth is of course startled by the question and its peculiar implication reginald sawyer hesitatingly admitted his ignorance the grey house stands flush with the road and the two gentlemen finished their conversation upon the doorstep above them a welcoming glow shone through the fanlight otherwise its windows were shuttered and blank this is a matter of common knowledge dr cripps said but one about which for reasons of policy or more truly of snobbery it is the fashion to keep silent so for goodness sake dont give me as your authority if you should ever have occasion to speak of it and lowering his voice he mentioned a name as like as two peas he added when you see them side by sidewhich in point of fact you never do oh i promise you the whole dirty business has been remarkably well engineeredhushmoney i suppose sometimes i am tempted to think poverty is the only punishable sin in this world for those who have a good balance at their bankers there is always a safe way out of even the most disgraceful imbroglios of this sort but i must be moving on mr sawyer i sympathize with your annoyance you have been very offensively treated good night the young clergyman remained planted on the doorstep incapable of ringing the bell and presenting himself to his assiduously attentive hostesses the miss minetts for the moment he was in truth indescribably shocked deadham presented itself to his mind as a place accursed a veritable sink of iniquity high and low alike its inhabitants were under condemnationand he had so enjoyed his tea with the ladies at the hard had been so flattered by their civility spreading himself in the handsome room agreeably sensible of its books pictures ornaments and air of cultured leisurewhile behind all that as he now learned was this glaring moral delinquency never had he been more cruelly deceived he felt sick with disgust what callousness what hypocrisyhe recalled his disquieting sensations in crossing the warren was the very soil of this place tainted exhaling evil he made a return upon himself for what after all was he here for save to let in light and combat evil to bring home the sense of sin to the inhabitants of this place convincing them of the hatefulness of the moral slough in which they so revoltingly wallowed he must slay and spare not he saw himself as david squaring up to goliath as christian fighting singlehanded against the emissaries of satan who essayed to defeat his pilgrimage yes he would smite these lawbreakers hip and thigh whatever their superficial claims to his respect whatever their worldly position he would read them all a lessonthat king log canon horniblow included he at once pitied and admired himself not being a close critic of his own motives telling himself he did well to be angry while ignoring the element of personal pique which gave point and satisfaction to that anger he was silent and reserved with the miss minetts at supper and retired early to his own room to prepare a sermon chapter iii brother and sister upon the sunday morning following damaris went to the eleven oclock service alone miss felicia verity attended church at an earlier hour today partly in the interests of private devotion partly in those of a person she had warmly befriended in the past and wanted to befriend in the presentbut with delicacy with tact and due consideration for the susceptibilities of others she wished earnestly to effect a reconciliation but not to force it to force it was to endanger its sincerity and permanence it should seem to come about lightly naturally therefore did she go out early to perfect her plansof which more hereafteras well as to perform her religious duties sir charles verity was from home staying with colonel carteret for partridge shooting over the norfolk stubblefields the habit of this annual visit had for the last two seasons been in abeyance but now with his return to the hard was pleasantly revived although this autumn owing to business connected with the publication of his book the visit took place a few weeks later than usual hence did damarisarrayed in a russetred serge gown black velvet collar and cuffs to its jacket of somewhat manly cut and a russetred upstanding plume in her closefitting black velvet hatset forth alone to church this after redirecting such letters as had arrived for her father by the morning post one of them bore the embossed arms of the india office and signature of the then secretary of state for that department in the corner of the envelope she looked at it with a measure of respect and curiosity wondering as to the purport of its contents she studied the envelope turning it about in the hope of gleaning enlightenment from its external aspect still wondering slightly oppressed even by a persuasionof which she could not rid herselfthat it held matters of no common moment closely affecting her father she went out of the house down the sheltered drive and through the entrance gates here as she turned inland the verve of the clear autumn morning rushed on her along with a wild flurry of falling leaves dancing to the breath of the crisp northerly breeze a couple of fine days with a hint of frost in the valley by night after a spell of soft mists and wet sent the leaves down in fluttering multitudes so that now all trees save the oaks only were bare theseby which the road is just here overhungstill solidly clothed in copper amber andmatching our maidens gownin russetred offered sturdy defiance to the weather the sound of them a dry crowded rustling had a certain note of courage and faithfulness in it which caused damaris to wait awhile and listen yet a wistfulness also since to her hearing a shudder stirred beneath its bravery preluding the coming rigours of winter and that wistfulness rather strangely enlarged its meaning and area as the reiterated ting tang tong of deadhams church bells recalled the object of her walk for english church services of the parochial variety such as awaited her had but little she feared to give little that is towards the reliving of those instants of exalted spiritual perception which had been granted to her at distant avila in overstrained and puritanic dread of idolatory the english church has gone lamentably far to forfeit its sacramental birthright it savours too strongly of the school and classroom basing its appeal upon words upon spoken expositions instructive no doubt but cold academic it offers no tangible object of worship to sight or sense its socalled altars are empty upon them no sacrifice is offered no presence abidingly dwells in its teaching the communion of saints and forgiveness of sins are phrases rather than living agencies its atmosphere is selfconscious its wouldbe solemnity forcedthis in any case was how damaris saw the whole matterthough let us hasten to add she was modest enough to question whether the fault might not very well be in herself rather than in our national variant of the christian faith many sweet good personsdear aunt felicia among themappeared to find anglican ministrations altogether sufficient for their religious needs but to damaris those ministrations failed to bring any moment of vision of complete detachment she must be to blame she supposedwhich was discouraging a little outcasting and consequently sad in a somewhat pensive spirit she therefore pursued her way until where the prospect widened as she reached the village green a larger sky disclosed itself flaked with light cirrus cloud this glory of space and the daring northerly breeze blowing out from it sent her fancy flying it beckoned to journeyings to far coasts and unknown seasan offshore wind filling the sails of convoys outward bound and with the thought of ships upon the sea came the thought of darcy faircloth and that with sharp revolt against the many existing hindrances to his and her intercourse freedom seemed abroad this morning even the leaves declared for liberty courting individual adventure upon the wings of that daring wind and this sense of surrounding activity worked upon damaris making her doubly impatient of denials and arbitrary restraints she sent her soul after darcy faircloth across the waste of waters fondly almost fiercely seeking him but her soul refused to travel curiously turning homeward again as though aware not the prodigious fields of ocean nor any loudvoiced foreign port of call held knowledge of him but rather the immediate scene the silverglinting levels of the haven and lonely stonebuilt inn deadham church originally a chapelry of marychurch abbey crowns a green monticule in the centre of deadham village backed by a row of big elmsa wide lowroofed structure patched throughout the course of centuries beyond all unity and precision of design yet still showing traces of norman work in the arch of the belfry and in the pillars supporting the rafters of the middle aisle at the instance of a former vicar the whole interior received a thick coat of whitewash alike over plaster and stone this at the time in question had been in places scraped off bringing to light some mural paintings of considerable interest and antiquity in the chancel upon the gospel side is a finelycarved tomb with recumbent figures of an armoured knight and richlyrobed lady whose slippered feet push against the effigy of a particularly alert sharpmuzzled little hound the two front pews in the body of the church at the foot of the said tomb are allotted to the owner and household at the hard the slender lively little hound and the two sculptured figures lying peaceful in death for ever side by side touched and captivated damaris from the first time she set eyes on them she reverenced and loved them weaving endless stories about them when in the tedium of prayer or overlengthy sermon her attention all too often strayed this morning the three bells jangled altogether as she reached the churchyard gate then the smallest tolled alone hurrying stragglers she was indeed late the bulk of the congregation already seated the canon at the readingdesk and mrs horniblow wheezing forth a voluntary upon the harmonium when she walked up the aisle but during her brief passage damaris could not but observe the largeness of the assembly an uncommon wave of piety must have swept over the parish this morning the battyes and taylors were present in force farmers and tradespeople mustered in impressive array even dr crippsby no means a frequent churchgoerand his forlornlooking redeyed little wife were there the miss minetts had a lady with thema plump short little person dressed with attempted fashion whose back struck damaris as quaintly familiar she catching a glimpse of it in passing most surprising of all william jennifer headed a contingent from the island crowding the mens free seats to right and left of the west door an expectancy moreover seemed to animate the throng then she remembered the new curate reginald sawyer had informed her and miss felicia two evenings ago when he had called and been bidden to stay to tea that he would preach for the first time at the eleven oclock service so far he had only occupied the pulpit on sunday afternoons when a country congregation is liable to be both scanty and somnolent today he would prove himself before the heads of tribes before the notables and damaris wished him well esteeming him a worthy young man if somewhat provincial and superfluously pompous in the servants pew directly behind mary and mrs cooper were duly ensconced supported by mr patch two small male patches whitecollared and shining with excess of cleanliness wedged in between him and his stable subordinate conyers the groom the hard thus made a commendably respectable show as damaris reflected with satisfaction she stood she knelt her prayer book open upon the carved margin of the tomb the slender crossed legs and paws of the alert little marble dog serving as so often before for bookrest canon horniblow boomed and droned like some unctuous giant bumblebee from the readingdesk the choir intoned responses from the gallery with liberal diversity of pitch and presently alas damaris thoughts began to wander making flitting excursions right and left for halfway through the litany some belated worshipper arrived causing movement in the mens free seats this oddly disturbed her her mind flew again to faircloth and the strange impression of her own souls return declaring this and no other to be his actual neighbourhood and if it indeed were sodamaris thrust back the emotions begotten of that question as unpermissibly stormy at this time and in this place she tried to fix her thoughts wholly upon the office but all too soon they sprang aside again now circling about the enigmatic back beheld in the miss minetts pew of whom did that round dressy little form remind her whywhyof theresa of course not theresa genius and saint of spanish avila but theresa bilson her sometime governesscompanion of doubtfully amiable memory she longed to satisfy herself but could only do so by turning round and looking squarelya manoeuvre impossible during the prayers but which might be accomplished later when the congregation rose to sing the hymn before the sermon she must wait and during that waiting light rather divertingly broke in on her for supposing her belief as to the ladys identity correct must not dear aunt felicia be party to this resurrection had not she known and stolen forth this morning to perfect some innocent plot of peacemaking in furtherance of which she now cunningly remained at home thus leaving damaris free to offer renewal of favour or withhold it as she pleased was not that deliciously characteristic of aunt felicia and her permanent effort to serve two mastersto make everybody happy and regardless of conflicting interests everybody else toowell damaris was ready to fulfil her wishes she bore theresa no illwill an inclination to grudge or resentment seemed to her unworthy whatever theresas tiresomenesses they were over and done with surely quite immensely long ago the hymn given out and the tune of it played through the assembly scraped and rustled to its feet damaris standing in height overtopping her neighbours discreetly turned her head let her eyes rest an instant smiling upon the upturned polished countenances of the two small patchesshyly watching herand then seek a more distant goal yes veritably theresa bilson in the fleshvery much in the flesh full of face and plump of bosom goldrimmed glasses gleaming her mouth opened wide in song it was a little astonishing to see her so unchanged for how much had happened since the day of that choirtreat at harchester which marked her deposition the day of damaris sleep in the sunshine and awakening in the driving wet out on the barthe day wherein so much began and so much ended slashed across and across with an extravagance of lasting joy and lasting painin the sense of it all damaris lost herself a little becoming forgetful of her existing situation she looked past over theresa and beyond at the extreme end of the church in the last of the free seats where the light from the west door streamed inward a mans figure detached itself with singular distinctness from the background of whitewashed wall he too overtopped his fellows and that by several inches and from the full length of the building across the wellfilled benches his glance sought and met that of damaris and held it in fearless high security of affection not to be gainsaid the nice cleanshining little patches still watching shyly out of their brown glossy mouselike eyes to their extreme mystification saw the colour flood damaris face saw her lips tremble and part as in prelude to happy speech then saw her grow very pale and turning away clutch at the head of the alert little hound mrs cooper delivered herself of a quite audible whisper to the effectthat miss damaris was took faintlike as she feared and mary leaned forward over the front of the pew in quick anxiety but our maidens weakness was but passing she straightened herself stood tall and proudly again looking at the knight and his lady lying so peacefully side by side upon their marble couch she gathered them into her gladnessthey somehow sympathized she felt in her present sweet and poignant joy her soul had known best had been right in its homingsince faircloth was herewas here that sweet poignant joy flooded her so that she wordlessly gave thanks and praise he was in lifemore was within sight of her hearing the same sounds breathing the same air across the short dividing space spirit had embraced spirit he claimed herhad not his will indeed far more than any curiosity regarding the identity of poor plump little theresa compelled her to look around she demanded nothing further letting herself dwell in a perfection of contentwithout before or afterpossible only to the pure in heart and to the young the hymn concluded damaris knelt while reginald sawyer having mounted into the pulpit read the invocation mechanically rose from her knees with the rest and disposed herself in the inner corner of the pew sitting sideways so that her left hand might rest upon the carven marble margin of the tomb she liked touch of it still in the quietude of her great content cherishing a pretty fancy of the knight and his ladys sympathy and that also of their sprightly little footstool dog otherwise she was deaf to outward things deliciously oblivious wrapped away sweetly within herself hence she quite failed to notice how awkwardly sawyer stumbled treading on the fronts of his long surplice when going up the pulpit stairs how he fumbled with his manuscript as he flattened it out on the cushioned desk or how husky was his voice to the point of the opening sentences being almost inaudible the young clergyman suffered indeed so it appeared from a painfully excessive fit of nervousness all this she missed not awakening from her state of blissful trance until the sermon had been under way some good five to ten minutes her awakening even then was gradual it was also unpleasant it began in vague and uneasy suspicion of something unusual and agitating toward in consciousness of a hushed and strained attention very foreign to the customary placid not to say bovine indifference of the ordinary country congregation the preachers voice was audible enough now in good truth though still under insufficient control it roared cracked upward approaching a scream sentences trod on one anothers heels so rapid was his delivery or bumped and jolted so overlaid was it with emphasis he dealt in ugly words toolies drunkenness theft profanity and worse still uncleanness adultery carnal debauchery for not venial sins only but mortal sins likewise were rife in deadham as he averred matters of common knowledge and everyday occurrencetolerated if not openly encouraged callously winked at the public conscience could hardly be said to exist so indurated was it so moribund through lack of stimulation and through neglect yet such wickedness sooner or later must call down the vengeance of an offended god it would be taken upon these lawbreakers here or hereafter these evillivers would receive the chastisement their deeds invited and deserved let no man deceive himself god is just he is also very terrible in judgment hell yawns for the impenitent breathless he paused and a subdued sigh an instinctive shuffling of feet ran through the assemblyyet these were but generalities after all often heard before when you came to think though seldom so forcibly put every man made liberal gift of such denunciations to his neighbours rather than applied their lesson to himself but reginald sawyer was merely gathering energy gathering courage for more detailed assault he felt nervous to the verge of collapsea new and really horrible experience his head was hot his feet cold the temptation simply and crudely to give in bundle down the pulpit stairs and bolt was contemptibly great his eyesight played tricks on him below there in the body of the church the rows of faces ran together into irregular pink blots spread meaninglessly above the brown of the oaken pews the brown drab and black too of their owners sunday best here and there a childs light frock or white hat intruded upon the prevailing neutral tints as did in a startling manner damaris veritys russetred plume and suit time and again since he began his sermon had that dash of rich colour drawn his reluctant attention he recoiled from oddly dreaded itnow more than ever since to him it rather mercilessly focussed the subject and impending climax of his denunciatory address the pause began to affect the waiting congregation which stirred uneasily some one coughed and sawyer was a sufficiently practised speaker to know that once you lose touch with an audience it is next to impossible successfully to regain your ascendency over it unless he was prepared to accept ignominious defeat he must brace himself or it would be too late he abominated defeat therefore summoning all his native combativeness he took his own fear by the throat straightened his manuscript upon the desk and vehemently broke forth into speech did his hearers deny or doubt the truth of his assertions suppose that he spoke at random or without realization of the heavy responsibility he incurred in advancing such accusations they were in error so he told them he advanced no accusations which he could not justify by examples chosen from among themselves from among residents in this parish he would be false to his duty both to themhis present audienceand to his and their creator were he to abstain from giving those examples out of respect of persons other occupants of this pulpit might havehe feared hadallowed worldly considerations to influence and silence them a nasty cut this at the poor vicarcanon increasingly a prey to distracted fidgets sitting helpless in the chancel but of such pusillanimity such timeserving hereginald sawyerscorned to be guilty the higher placed the sinner the more heinous the sinhe would deal faithfully with all since not only was the salvation of each one in jeopardy but his own salvation was in peril likewise inasmuch as at the dread last assize he would be required to give account of his stewardship in respect of this sinful place thus far damaris had listened in deepening distaste surely the young man very much magnified his office was in manner exaggerated in matter aggressive and verbose notwithstanding its attempted solemnity and heat his sermon seemed to be conventional just a way of talking and a conceited one at that but as he proceeded to set forth his promised examples of local illliving distaste passed into bewilderment and finally into a sense of outrage blank and absolute he named no names and wrapped his statements up in biblical language yet they remained suggestive and significant enough he spoke surely of those whose honour was dearest to her whom she boundlessly loved under plea of rebuking vice he laid bare the secrets violated the sanctities of their private lives yet was not that incredible all decencies of custom and usage forbade it stamped such disclosure as unpermissible fantastic he must be mad or she herself mad mishearing misconceiving him adulterous father bastard sonpublican sheltering youthful offenders from healthy punishment in the interests of personal gainof that last she made nothing failed to follow it but the rest it was true too but not as he represented it all its tragic beauty all the nobleness which tempered and in a measure at least discounted the great wrong of it stripped awayleaving it naked torn from its setting without context and so without perspective against this not only her tenderness but sense of justice passionately fought he made it monstrous and in that far untrue as caricature is untrue crying aloud for explanation and analysis yet who could explain circumstances of time and place rendered all protest impossible nothing could be done nothing said thus her beloved persons were exposed judged condemned unheard without opportunity of defence and realizing this realizing redress hopelessly barred she cowered down her head bowed almost to the level of the marble couch whereon the figures of knight and lady reposed in the high serenity of love and death happier they than she poor child for her pride trailed in the dust her darling romance of brother and sister and all the rare pieties of her heart defiled by a shameful publicity exposed for every tom dick and harry to paw over and sneer at horror of a crowd which watches the infliction of some signal disgrace tormented her imagination moreover to the temporary breaking of her spirit whether that crowd was in the main hostile or sympathetic mattered nothing the fact that it silently sat there silently observed made every member of it for the time her enemy even the trusted servants just behind comfortable comely mary soft mrs cooper the devoted patch were hateful to her as the rest their very loyaltywhich she for no instant doubtedwent only to fill the cup of her humiliation to the brim reginald sawyers voice continued but what he said now she neither heard nor cared her martyrdom could hardly suffer augmentation the whole world seemed against her she set apart pilloriedbut not alone faircloth was set apart pilloried also and remembering this her courage revived the horror of the crowd lifted for herself she could not fight but for him she could fight with strength and conviction out of the greatness of her love for him out of her recognition that the ignominy inflicted upon him was more bitter more cruel than any inflicted upon her for those who dare in a moment the worst can turn bestshe would make play with the freedom which this breach of convention of social reticence of moral discretion conferred upon her the preacher had gone far in demolition she would go as far and further in construction in restitution would openly acknowledge the bond which joined faircloth to her and to her people by openly claiming his protection now in this hour of her disgrace and supreme dismay she would offer no excuse no apology only there should be no more attempted concealment or evasion of the truth on her part no furtiveness in his and her relation once and for all she would make her declaration cry it from the housetop in fearless yet tender pride damaris stood up conspicuous in her red dress amid that rather drab assembly as a leaping flame she turned about fronting the perplexed and agitated congregation her head carried high her face austere for all its youthful softness an heroic quality something indeed superlative and grandiose in her bearing and expression causing a shrinking in those who saw her and a certain sense of awe her eyes sought faircloth again found him and unfalteringly spoke with him bidding him claim her as she claimed him bidding him come which bidding he obeyed and that at the same rather splendid level of sentiment worthily sustaining her abounding faith in him for a touch of the heroic and superlative was present in his bearing and expression also as he came up the church between the wellfilled pewsthese tenanted to left and right by some who figured in his daily life figured in his earliest recollections by others newcomers to him even by sight barely known yet each and all irrespective of age rank and position affecting his outlook and mental atmosphere in some particular as every human personality does and must with whom ones life ever so transiently is thrown had he had time to consider them this cloud of witnesses might have proved disturbing even to his masterful will and steady nerve but he had not time there was for himso perfectlythe single object the one searching yet lovely call to answer the one act to be performed reaching the front pew upon the gospel side darcy faircloth took damaris outstretched hand he looked her in the eyes his own worshipful ablaze at once with a great joy and a great anger and then led her back down the length of the aisle through the west door into the liberty of the sunshine and the crisp northerly wind outside standing here the houses and trees of the village lay below them the whole glinting expanse of the haven was visible right up to the town of marychurch gathered about its longbacked abbey whose tower tall and in effect almost spectral showed against the purple ridges of forest and moorland beyond over the salt marsh in the valley a flock of plovers dipped and wheeled their backs and wide flapping wings black till in turning their breasts and undersides flashed into snow and pearl and because brother and sister notwithstanding diversities of upbringing and of station were alike children of the open rather than of cities born to experiment to travel and to seafaring round this everspinning globe they instinctively took note of the extensive keen though sungilded prospectbefore breaking silence and giving voice to the emotion which possessed themand in so doing found refreshment and a brave cleansing to their souls still holding faircloths hand and still silent her shoulder touching his now and again in walking damaris went down the sloping path hoary lichenstained headandfoot stones set in the vivid churchyard grassas yet unbleached by the cold of winteron either side the sense of his strength of the fine unblemished vigour of his young manhood here close beside herso strangely her possession and portion of her natural inalienable heritagefilled her with confident security and with a restful wondering calm so that the shame publicly put on her to shed its bitterness her horror of the watching crowd departed fading out into unreality though still shaken still quivering inwardly from the ordeal of the past hour she already viewed that shame and horror as but accidents to be lived down and disregarded by no means as essential elements in the adventurous and precious whole presently they would altogether lose their power to wound and to distress her while this freedom and the closer union gained by means of them continued immutable and fixed it followed that when in opening the churchyard gate and holding it back for her to pass faircloth perforce let go her hand and the spell of contact severed found himself constrained to speak at last saying you know you have done a mighty splendid dangerous thingno less than burned your boatsand that in the heat of generous impulse blind perhapsi cant but fear soto the heavy cost damaris could interrupt him with quick sweet defiance but there is no cost and to drive home the sincerity of her disclaimer and further reassure him she took his hand again and held it for an instant close against her bosom tears and laughter together present in her eyes ah you beautiful dear you beautiful dear faircloth cried brokenly as in pain somewhat indeed beside himself before god i come near blessing that blatant young fool and pharisee of a parson since he has brought me to this then he put her a little way from him penetrated by fear lest the white love whichin all honour and reverencehe was bound to hold her in should flush ever so faintly red for after all it is up to me he said more to himself than to her to make very sure there isnt and neverby gods mercyshall be any cost and with thatfor the avoidance of the congregation now streaming rather tumultuously out of churchthey went on across the village green hissed at by slow waddling hardeyed most conceited geese to the lane which leads down to the causeway and warren skirting the riverbank chapter iv wherein miss felicia verity conclusively shows what spirit she is of her attraction consisted in her transparency in the eager simplicity with which she cast her homemade nets and set her innocuous springes today miss felicia was out to wing the angel of peace and crowd that celestial messenger into the arms of damaris and theresa bilson collectively and severally such was the major interest of the hour but for miss felicia the oncoming of middleage by no means condemned the lesser pleasures of life to nullity hence the minor interest of the hour centred in debate as to whether or not the thermometer justified her wearing a coat of dark blue silk and cloth heavily trimmed with ruchings and passementerie reaching to her feet a somewhat sumptuous garment this given her by sir charles and damaris last winter in madrid she fancied herself in it greatly both for the sake of the dear donors and because the cut of it was clever disguising the overnarrowness of her maypolelike figure and giving her a becoming breadth and fulness she decided in favour of the coveted splendour and at about a quarterpast twelve strolled along the carriagedrive on her way to the goose green and the village street there or thereabouts unless her plot lamentably miscarried she expected to meet her niece and that nieces exgovernesscompanion herded in amicable converse by the pinioned angel of peace her devious and discursive mind fluttered to and fro meanwhile over a number of but loosely connected subjects of precisely what upon a certain memorable occasion had taken place between her brother sir charles and poor theresacausing the latter to send up urgent signals of distress to which she miss felicia instantly respondedshe still was ignorant theresa had she feared been just a wee bit flighty leaving damaris unattended while herself mildly gadding but such dereliction of duty was insufficient to account for the arbitrary fashion in which she had been sent about her business literallythe word wasnt prettychucked out miss felicia always suspected there must be something she would say worseit sounded harshbut something more than merely that her interpretations of peculiar conduct were liable to run in terms of the heart had theresa poor thing by chance formed a hopeless attachmenthopeless of course almost ludicrously so yet what more natural more comprehensible charles being who and what he was not that he would in the faintest degree lend himself to such misplaced affection of that he was incapable the bare idea was grotesque he of course was guiltless but assuming there was a feeling on theresas side wasnt she equally guiltless she could not help being fascinatedthus miss felicia was bound to acquit both alike they left the court without a stain on their respective characters not for worlds would she ever dream of worrying charles by attempting to reintroduce poor theresa to his notice but with damaris it was different the idea that any persons of her acquaintance were at sixes and sevens on bad terms when with a little good will on their part and tactful effort upon hers they might be on pleasant ones was to her actively afflicting to drop an old friend or even one not conspicuously friendly if bound to you by associations and habit appeared to her an offence against corporate humanity an actual however fractional lowering of the temperature of universal charity the loss to one was a loss to allin some sort therefore did she run to adjust to smooth to palliate charles was awayit so neatly happenedand theresa bilson here not it must be owned altogether without miss felicias connivance if darling damaris still was possessed of a hatchet she must clearly be given this opportunity to bury it to have that weapon safe underground would be from every point of view so very much nicer at this point in her meditations beneath the trees bordering the carriage drive their bare tops swaying in the breeze and bright sunshine miss felicia fell to contrasting the present exhilarating morning with that dismally rainy one just over three years ago whenregardless of her sister mrs cowdens remonstrancesshe had come here from paulton lacy in response to theresas signals of distress just at the elbow of the drive so she remembered she had met a quite astonishingly goodlooking young man browngold bearded his souwester and oilskins shining with wet she vaguely recalled some talk about him with her brother sir charles afterwards during luncheonwhat was itoh yes of course it was he who had rescued damaris when she was lost out on the bar and brought her home down the tideriver by boat she had often wanted to know more about him for he struck her at the time as quite out of the common quite remarkably attractive but on the only occasion since when she had mentioned the subject damaris drew in her horns and became curiously uncommunicative it was all connected of course with the dear girls illness and the disagreeable episode of theresas dismissalhow all the more satisfactory then that the theresa business in any case was at this very hour in process of being set right miss felicia had advised theresa how to actto speak to damaris quite naturally and affectionately taking her goodwill for granted damaris would be charming to her she felt convinced felicia verity held the fronts of her long blue coat together since the wind sported with them rather roughly and went forward with her quick wavering gait it was a pity damaris did not marry she sometimes felt of course charles would miss her quite terribly their love for one another was so delightful so really unique on his account she was gladand yetwith a sigh while the colour in her thin cheeks heightened a littlelacking marriage a womans life is rather incomplete not that she herself had reason for complaint with all the affection showered upon her the last two years in particular had been abundantly blessed thanks to charles and damaris she admired them dear people with all her warm heart and felt very grateful to them here it should be registered in passing that the resilience of felicia veritys inherent goodbreeding saved her gratitude from any charge of grovelling as it saved her many enthusiasms from any charge of sloppiness both if exaggerated still stood squarely even gallantly upon their feet her mind switched back to the ever fertile question of the married and the single state she often wondered why charles never espoused a second wife he would have liked a son surely but then were it possible to find a fault in him it would be that of a little coldness a little loftiness in his attitude towards women he was too far above them in intellect and experience she supposed and through all the remarkable military commands he had held administrative posts he had occupied quite to come down to their level in some ways damaris was very like himclever lofty too at moments possibly this accounted for her apparent indifference to affairs of the heart and to lovers anyhow she had ample time before her still in relation to all that miss felicia passed into the road about fifty yards distant she saw the servantsmary mrs cooper and patchstanding close together in a quaint solemn little bunch the two small patches circled round the said bunch patiently expectant not being admitted evidently to whatever deliberations their elders and betters had in hand felicia veritys relations with the servants were invariably excellent yet finding them in mufti outside the boundaries of her brothers demesne thus she was conscious of a certain modesty hesitating alike to intrude upon their confabulations and to pass onward without a trifle amiable of talk she advanced smiling nodded to the two women then a delicious day isnt it patch she said adding for lack of a more pertinent remarkwhat kind of sermon did the new curate mr sawyer give youa good one i hope a pause followed this guileless question during which mary looked on the ground mrs cooper murmured oh dear oh dear under her breath and patch swallowed visibly before finding voice to reply one i regret to say maam he never ought to have preached poor young man she laughed it off youre a terribly severe critic im afraid patch probably he was nervous and reason enough you might think satan himself stood at his elbow the wicked things he said this statement coming from the mild and cowlike mrs cooper caused felicia verity the liveliest surprise she glanced enquiringly from one to the other of the little group reading constraint and hardly repressed excitement in the countenance of each their aspect and behaviour struck her in fact as singular to the point of alarm mary she asked a trifle breathlessly has anything happened where is miss damaris hadnt she got back to the hard maam before you came out nowhy should she you and the other servants always reach home first miss damaris went out before the rest mrs cooper broke forth in dolorous widowed accents and no wonder pore dear young lady was it mr patch my heart bled for her maam that it did miss felicia gentle and eager so pathetically resembling yet not resembling her famous brother grew autocratic stern as him almost for once and you allowed miss damaris to leave church aloneshe felt unwell i supposenone of you accompanied her i dont understand it at all she said young captain faircloth went out with miss damaris she wished it maam mary declared heated and resentful at the unmerited rebuke she as good as called to him to come and take her out of church it wasnt for us to interfere so we held back captain faircloth but this becomes more and more extraordinary who is captain faircloth ah there you touch it you must excuse my saying maam mrs cooper gasped but at this juncture patch rising to the height of masculine responsibility flung himself gallantlyand how unwillinglyinto the breach he was wounded in his respect and respectability alike wounded for the honour of the family whom he had so long and faithfully served he was fairly cut to the quickwhile these three females merely darkened judgment by talking all at cross purposes and all at once never had the solid honest coachman found himself in a tighter or for that matter in anything like so tight a place but looking in the direction of the village black of clothing heavy of walk and figure he espied as he trusted approaching help if you please maam he said touching his black bowler as he spoke i see canon horniblow coming along the road i think it would be more suitable for him to give you an account of what has passed hell know how to put it withwith the least unpleasantness to all parties it isnt our placemrs coopers marys or mineif youll pardon my making so free with my opinion to mention any more of whats took place felicia verity now thoroughly frightened darted forward the fronts of her blue coat again flew apart and that rich garment stood out in a prodigious frill around and behind her from the waist as she leaned on the wind almost running in her agitation and haste my dear canon she cried i am in such anxiety i learn something has happened to my niece who i had come to meet our good servants are so distractingly mysterious they refer me to you pray relieve my uncertainty and suspense but even while she spoke miss felicias anxiety deepened for the kindly easygoing clergyman appeared to suffer like the servants from some uncommon shock his large fleshy nose and somewhat pendulous cheeks were a mottled purplish red anger and deprecation struggled in his glance i was on my way to the hard he began to express my regretsoffer my apologies would hardly be too strong a phraseto your niece miss verity and to yourself for i felt compelled without any delay to dissociate myself from the intemperate procedure of my colleagueof my curate he has used or rather misused his official position has grievously misused the privileges of the pulpitthe pulpit of our parish churchto attack the reputation of private individuals and resuscitate longburied scandals the speaker was unquestionably greatly distressed miss felicia though more than ever bewildered felt for him warmly it pained her excessively to observe how his large hands clasped and unclasped how his loose lips worked let me assure you he went on though i trust that is superfluous i am certain it is dear dr horniblow she feelingly declared thanks he replied you are most kind most indulgent to me miss veritysuperfluous i would say to assure you that my colleague adopted this deplorable course without my knowledge or sanction he sprang it on me like a bombshell as a christian my conscience as a gentleman my sense of fair play condemns his action yesyesi sympathizei am convinced you are incapable of any indiscretion any unkindness in the pulpit or out of it but why my dear canon apologize to us how can this unfortunate sermon affect me or my niece how can the scandal you hint at in any respect concern us because he began that mottling of purple increasingly deforming his amiable faceand there words failed him incontinently he stuck he detested strong language butheavens and earthhow could he put it to her as she gazed at him with startled candid eyes innocent of guile as those of a babe only too certainly no word had reached her of the truth the good man groaned in spirit for like patch he found himself in a place of quite unexampled tightness and with no hope of shunting the immense discomfort of it on to alien shoulders such as had been granted the happier patch because he began again only to suffer renewed agony of wordlessness in desperation he shifted his ground you have heard perhaps that your niece miss damaris left the church before the conclusion of the sermon i do not blame her he waved a fatherly hand miss verity acquiesced or rather was led out byby captain fairclotha young officer in the mercantile marine whose abilities and successful advance in his profession this village has every reason to respect he broke off let us walk on towards the hard pray let us walk onhas no rumour ever reached you miss verity regarding this young man the wildest ideas flitted through miss felicias brain the figure in shiny oilskinsyet preposterous surelyafter all an affair of the heartmisplaced affectiondamarisdid this account for the apparent indifference how intensely interesting yet how unwisehowbut she must keep her own counsel the wind now at her back glued the blue coat inconveniently against and even between her legs unceremoniously whisking her forward rumoursoh none she protested none he echoed despairingly pray let us walk on a foolish urgency on his part this she felt since she was already almost on the run none that by birth captain faircloth is somewhat nearly related to your familyto youryour brother sir charles in fact there the incubus was off his straining chest at last he felt easier capable of manipulating the situation to some extent smoothing down its rather terrible ascerbities such connections do he hastened to add as we must regretfully admit exist even in the highest the most exalted circles irregularities of youth doubtlessly deeply repented of i repeat sins of youth at which only the sinlessand they alas to the shame of my sex are lamentably fewcan be qualified to cast a stoneyou you follow me you mean me to understand yes yesexactly soto understand that this young man is reputed to be thank you my dear canonthank you felicia verity here interposed quickly yet with much simple dignity for on a sudden she became singularly unflurried and composed i do i believe follow you she continuedyou have discharged your difficult mission with a delicacy and consideration for which i am grateful but i am unequal to discussing the subject in further detail just nowto me you know my brother is above criticism whatever incidents maymay belong to former years i accept without cavil or question in silencedear dr horniblowin silence his wishes upon this mattershould he care to confide them to meand those of my niece will dictate my conduct totowards my nephew captain fairclothbelieve me in all sincerity i thank you i am very much indebted to you for the information you have communicated to me it simplifies my position and now she gave him her hand will you pardon my asking you to leave me walking slowlyfor he felt played out pretty thoroughly done for as he put it and beatback to the vicarage and his belated sunday dinner and of such are the kingdom of heaven james horniblow said to himselfperhaps truly he also said other things distinctly other things in which occurred the name of reginald sawyer whose days as curate of deadham were numbered if he did not resign voluntarily well then pressure must very certainly be employed to make him resign meanwhile that bluecoated virginal member of the kingdom of heaven sped homeward at the top of her speed she was conscious of immense upheaval never had she felt so alive so on the spot the portals of highest drama swung wide before her she hastened to enter and pour forth the abounding treasures of her sympathy at the feet of the actors in this most marvellous piece that her own part in it must be insignificant probably not even a speaking one troubled her not the least she was out for them not for herself it was also characteristic of miss felicia that she felt in nowise shocked not the ethical still less the social aspects of the drama affected her but only its human ones these dear people had suffered and she hadnt known it they suffered still she enclosed them in arms of compassionif to the pure all things are pure felicia veritys purity at this juncture radiantly stood the test and that not through puritanical shutting of the eyes or juggling with fact as she declared to canon horniblow she accepted the incident without question or cavilfor her brother for herself any possibility of stepping off the narrow path of virtue and exploring the alluring fragrant thickets disposed to left of it and to right had never ever so distantly occurred to her she arrived at the hard with a bright colour and beating heart crossed the hall and waited at the drawingroom door a mans voice was audible within lowtoned and grave but very pleasant it reminded her curiously of charlescharles long ago on leave from india lightening the heavy conventionalities of canton magna with his brilliant enigmatic andto herall too fugitive presence harriet had never really appreciated charlesthough she was dazzled by his fame at intervalsdidnt really appreciate him to this day well the loss was hers and the gain indubitably felicias since the elder sisters obtuseness had left the younger sister a free fieldat thought of which felicia softly laughed again she listened to the mans voiceher brother charless delightful young voice it brought back the glamour of her girlhood of other voices which had mingled with his of dances picnics cricket matches days with the hounds she felt strangely moved transported also strangely shyso that she debated retirement did not of course retire but went into the drawingroom with a gentle rush a dart between the stumpy pillars i hoped that i should find you both she said yes to damaris solemn and enquiring eyesi happened to meet our good kind canon and have a little conversation with him i hopeto fairclothyou and i may come to know one another better know one another as friends you are not goingno indeed you must stay to luncheon it would grieve meand i think would grieve my brother charles also if you refused to break bread in this house chapter v dealing with emblems omens and demonstrations deadham resembled most country parishes in this that while revelling in internal dissensions when attacked from without its inhabitants promptly scrapped every vendetta and for the time being stood back to back against the world as one consequence of such parochial solidarity the village gentry set in a steady stream towards the hard on the monday afternoon following the historic sunday already chronicled commander and mrs battye called captain and mrs taylor called bringing with them their daughter louisa a tightlipped well instructed high school mistress of whom her parents stoodone couldnt but notice itmost wholesomely in awe as is the youthful cuckoo in the nest of the hedge sparrow so was louisa taylor to the authors of her beingmrs horniblow called also flanked by her two girls may and dorisplain thickset energetic wellmeaning young persons whom their shrewd mother loved sheltered rallied and cherished while perfectly aware of their limitations as to beauty and to brains immediately behind her slipped in mrs cripps the doctor abstained conscious of having put a match to the fuse which had exploded yesterdays astounding homiletic torpedo the whole affair irritated him to the point of detestable illtemper still if only to throw dust in the public eye the house of cripps must be represented he therefore deputed the joblike so many another ungrateful oneto his forlornlooking and redeyed spouse this vote of confidence if somewhat crudely proposed and seconded was still so evidently sincere and kindly meant that damaris and miss felicia felt constrained to accept it in good part conversation ran upon the weather the crops the migratory wild fowl now peopling the haven the royal familyinvariably a favourite topic this in genteel circles furthest removed from the thronein anecdotes of servants and of pets interspersed with protests against the rise in butcher cleaves prices the dullness of the newspapers and the surprising scarcity of eggsran on any and every subject in short save that of sermons preached by curates enamoured of the decalogue alonesaving and excepting dr crippsdid the miss minetts fail to put in an appearance this of necessity since had not they figuratively speaking warmed the viper in their bosoms cradled the assassin upon their hearth they were further handicapped in respect of any demonstration by the fact of theresa bilsons presence in their midst owing to the general combustion miss felicia and the peace angels joint mission had gone by the wall theresa was still an exile from the hard and doomed to remain so as the event proved with that remarkable powernot uncommon in her sexof transmuting fact granted the healing hand of time from defeat to personal advantage she had converted her repulse by sir charles verity into a legend of quite flattering quality she had left the hard becausebut she must not be asked to give chapter and verse the position had been extremely delicate even now she could barely speak of itshe had gone through too much to be more explicitshe bridledwould trench upon the immodest almost but just this she could sayshe withdrew from the hard three years ago because she saw withdrawal would be best for others their peace of mind had been her object the above guarded confidences the miss minetts hanging upon her lips received with devout admiration and fully believed and the best of it was theresa had come by now thanks to frequent rehearsal fully to believe this version herself at the present juncture it had its convenience since she could declare her allegiance to her former employer unimpaired thereby was she at liberty to join in the local condemnation of reginald sawyer and his sermon she did so with an assumption of elegant if slightly hysterical omniscience this was not without its practical side she regretted her inability to meet him at meals in consequence the miss minetts proposed he should be served in his own sittingroom until such time as it suited him to find another place of residence than the grey house for their allegiance went on all fours with theresas it was also unimpaired propriety had been outraged on every hand matters heretofore deemed unmentionable rushed into the forefront of knowledge and conversation yet never had they actually enjoyed themselves so greatly the sense of being a storm centreinasmuch as they harboured the viper assassinproduced in them an unexampled militancy latent sexantagonism revealed itself the man by common consent was down and being down the miss minetts jumped on him pounded him if terms so vulgar are permissible in respect for ladies so refined for every sin of omission committed against their womanhood by the members of his sex they made him scapegoatunconsciously it is true but effectively none the less from being his slaves they became his tormentors never was young fellow more taken aback such revulsions of human feeling are instructivedeplorable or diverting according as you view it meanwhile that portion of the local gentry aforesaid whom awkward personal predicamentas in the case of dr cripps and the miss minettsdid not preclude from visiting the hard having called early on monday afternoon also left early being anxious to prove their civility of purest water untainted by selfseeking by ulterior greed of tea and cakes it followed that damaris found herself relieved of their somewhat embarrassed though kindly and wellintentioned presence before sunset and of this she was glad since the afternoon had been fruitful of interests far more intimate and vital in character while captain and mrs taylor with their highly superior offspring louisa still held the floor damaris received a telegram from her father announcing a change of plans involving his immediate return send to meet the seventhirty at marychurch so the pink paper instructed her carteret comes with me when we arrive will explain on reception of the above her first thought was of the letter forwarded yesterday from the india office bearing the signature of the secretary of state and close on the heels of that thought looking over its shoulder indeed in the effortwhich she resistedto claim priority was the thought of the dear man with the blue eyes about to be a guest once again under this roof this gave her a little thrill a little gasp wrapping her away to the borders of sad inattention to louisa taylors somewhat academic discoursethe girls english was altogether too grammatical for entire goodbreeding in that how very far away from carteretsdamaris tried to range herself with present company but the man with the blue eyes indubitably held the centre of the stage she wore the pearls today he gave her at st augustin in what spirit did he comeshe hoped in the earlier one that of the time when she so completely trusted him for his counsel dared she claim it in that earlier spirit would be of inestimable value just now she so badly needed someone in authority to advise with as to the events of yesterday both in their malign and their beneficent aspects aunt felicia had risen to the height of her capacitydear thing had been exquisite but she would obey orders rather than issue them her office was not to lead but rather to be led and that the events of yesterday opened a new phase of her own and faircloths relation to one another appeared beyond dispute where exactly did the curve of duty towards her father touch that relation run parallel with or intersect it she felt perplexed after tea miss felicia having vanished on some affair of her owndamaris asked no question but supposed it not unconnected with the now since sir charles was about to return permanently exiled theresaour maiden went upstairs in the tender evening light on domestic cares intent she wished to assure herself that the chintz bedroom opening off the main landing and overlooking the lawn and front garden had been duly made ready for colonel carteret she took a somewhat wistful pleasure in silently ministering to his possible small needs in the matter of sufficient wealth of towels candles and soap she lengthened out the process lingered rearranged the ornaments upon the mantelpiece the bunch of sweetleafed geraniumas yet unshrivelled by frostand belated roses placed in a vase upon the toilettable in so doing she caught sight of her reflection in the mirror and paused studying it her looks were not at their best she was wanthat might in part be owing to the waning light around her eyes were dark circles making them appear unnaturally large and solemn so yesterdays emotions had left their mark the nervous strain had been considerable and she showed it one cannot drink the cup of shame however undeserved with physical any more than with mental impunity she still felt a little shattered but hoped neither her father nor carteret would remark her plight if the whole affair of yesterday could in its objectionable aspects be kept from sir charless knowledge she would be infinitely glad and why shouldnt it be without permission aunt felicia certainly would not tell neither would the servants the parish had given testimony this afternoon both of its good faith and its discretion so much for the objectionable side of the matter but there was another side far from objectionable beautiful in sentiment and in promise and still viewing her reflection in the glass she saw her eyes lose their solemnity lighten with a smile her lips repeated this was where carterets advice would be of so great value how much ought she to tell her father of all that for from amidst the shame the anger the strain and effort faircloth showed to her thinking triumphant satisfying alike to her affection and her taste in no respect would she have asked him other than he was she moved across to the window and sat down there looking out over the garden and battery with its little cannons to the bar and sea beyond which melted into the dim primrose and silver of the horizon such colour as existed was soft soothing the colour of a world of dreams of subdued and voiceless fancies it was harmonious restful as an accompaniment to visiondamaris let it lap against her consciousness encircling supporting this as water laps also encircling and supportingwhile caressing mysteriously whispering against a boats sidea boat lying at its moorings swinging gently upon an even keeland her vision was of faircloth exclusively of him just now for he had stayed to luncheon yesterday a meal to him in a sense sacred as being the first eaten by him in his fathers house so graciously invited how indeed could he do otherwise than stay and the initial strangeness the inherent wonder of that sacred character wearing off he found voice and talked not without eloquence talked of his proper element the sea gaining ease and selfpossession from the magnitude and manifold enchantments of his theme to him as to all trueborn sailormenso damaris divinedthe world is made of water with but accident of land impeding inconvenient accident at that too often blocking the passage across or through and constraining you to steer a foolishly really quite inordinately divergent course under this obstructive head the two americas offend direfully sprawling their united strength wellnigh from pole to pole the piercing of their central isthmus promised some mitigation of this impertinence of emergent matter though whether in his the speakers lifetime remainedso he took itopen to doubt the roaring forties and grim blizzardridden fuegian straits would long continue as he feared to bar the way to the pacific not that his personal fancy favoured west so much as east not into the sunset but into the sunrising did he love to sail some goodly blackhulled shipand as he talked more especially at his mention of this eastward voyaging those manifold enchantments of his calling stirred damaris imagination making her eyes bright as the fabled eyes of danger and fathomless as well but the best came later for mary having served coffee miss felicia making an excuse of letters to be written with pretty tact left them to themselves and faircloth returning after closing the door behind her fluttering gently eager figure paused behind damaris chairjacobean canepanelled with highcarved back and arms to it thomas clarkson verity had unquestionably a nice taste in furniturethe young seacaptain rested his right hand on the dark terminal scrollwork and bending down laid his left hand upon damaris hand covering it as it lay on the white damask tablecloth have i done what i should and left undone what i shouldnt do my dear and lovely sister he asked her halflaughing and halfabashed its a tricky business being here you knowto put it no higher than that and it might with truth be put far higher i get so horribly fearful of letting you down in any wayhowever trivialbefore other people i balance on a knifeedge all the while have no silly fears of that sort damaris said quickly a trifle distressed for it plucked at her sisterly pride in him that he should even by implication debase himself noting inequality of station between himself and her she held the worldly aspects of the matter in contempt they angered her so that she impulsively banished reserve leaning forward she bent her head putting her lips to the image of the flying seabirdwhich so intrigued her loving curiosityand those three letters tattooed in blue and crimson upon the back of his hand therethereshe murmured as soothing a childdoes this convince you but here broke off her heart contracting with a spasm of wondering tenderness for under that pressure of her lips she felt his flesh quiver and start she looked up at the handsome bearded face so close above her in swift enquiry the potionas once beforetroubling her that in touching this quaint stigmata she inflicted bodily suffering and as on that earlier occasion asked the question ah but have i hurt you faircloth shook his head smiling words failed him just then and he went pale beneath the overlay of clear brown sunburn then tell me what this stands for she said being herself strangely moved and desirous to lower the temperature of her own emotionpossibly of his as well tell me what it means just a boys fear and a boys superstitiona bit morbid both of them perhapsthat is as i see things now for i hold one should leave ones body as it pleased the almighty to make it unblemished by semisavage decorations which wont wash off faircloth moved away drew his chair up nearer the head of the table the corner between them so that his hand could if desire prompted again find hers by the way im so glad you dont wear earrings damaris he said they belong to the semisavage order of decoration i hate them you never will wear them promise me that and she had promised somewhat diverted by his tone of authority and of insistence but about this she asked him indicating the blue and crimson symbol as i say fruit of fear and superstitiona pretty pair in which to put ones faith all the same they went far to save my life i fancyfor which i thank them mightily being here with you today and he told hersoftening the uglier details as unfit for a gentlynurtured womans hearinga brutal story of the sea of a sailing ship becalmed in tropic waters waiting through long blistering days and breathless sweltering nights for the breeze which wouldnt comea floating hell between glaring skies and glaring oceanand of bullyings indignities and torments devised by a brain diseased by drink but was there no one to interfere no one to protect you damaris cried aghast a mans master in his own ship faircloth answered and short of mutiny theres no redress neither officers nor men had a stomach for mutiny they were a poor cowed lot till this drunken madness came on him he had been easy going enough they supposed when it passed hed be so again and then as he reserved his special attentions for me they were willing to grin and bear itor rather let me bear it just stupidly letting things go it was my first long voyage id been lucky in my skippers so far and was a bit soft still a bit conceited i dont doubt as well he swore hed break my spiritfor my own good of courseand he came near succeedingbut damaris damaris dear dont take it to heart so what does it matter it did me no lasting harm and was all over and done withwould have been forgotten too but for the rather silly sign of ityears and years ago let us talk no more about it oh nogo onplease go on she brokenly prayed him so he told her further how at singapore the outward voyage at last ended he was tempted to desert or better still put an end once and for all to the whole black business of living and how meditating on the methods of such drastic deliverancesitting in the palmshaded verandah of a flyblown little eatinghouse kept by a monkeyfaced squinteyed japanesehe happened to pick up a calcutta newspaper he read its columns mechanically without interest or understanding his mind still working on methods of death when a name leapt at him weighted with personal meaning it hit me faircloth said full between the eyes knocking the crybaby stuff out of me and knocking stuff of very different order in for i wanted something stronger than motherloveprecious though that isto brace me up and put some spunk into me just thensir charles was campaigning in afghanistan and this calcutta paper sang his praises to a rousing tune lamented the loss of him to the indian government and the lack of appreciation and support of him at home which induced him to take foreign service cant you imagine how all this about a great soldier whose blood after all ran in my veins pulled me clean up out of the slime where suicide tempted the soft side of me into another worlda sane world in which a man can make good if only hes pluck to hold onyes he saved me or at all events roused the spirit in me which makes for salvation and which that drunken brute had almost killed but because i was only a boy as yet with a boys queer instincts and extravagancies i made the monkeyfaced japanese eatinghouse keeperwho added artistic tattooing to other and less reputable ways of piling up a fortunefix the seabird for faith in my professionand those three initials of my own name and a name not altogether my own right herefix them for remembrance and for a warning of which i could never get free always i should be forced to see it and others must see it too through it my identityshort of mutilationwas indestructibly established from that identity henceforward there wasnt any possible running away faircloth had ended on a note of exultation calmly sounded yet profound and upon that final note damaris dwelt now sitting on the chintzcovered windowseat of the room which carteret would tonight inhabit she went through the cruel story again while the transparent twilight drew its elfin veil over all things outdoor and in the crescent moon a slender upright wisp of a thing climbed the southern sky and damaris soul was strangely satisfied for the story if cruel was one of restitution and the healing of a wrong to her fatherhis fatherthe boy had turned in that bad hour which very perfectly made for peace between them the curve of her duty to the one as she now apprehended in nowise cut across or deflected the curve of her duty towards the other the two were the same were one and this somehow some day when time and sentiment offered opportunity for such disclosure she must let her father know she must repeat to him the story of the eatinghouse and its monkeyfaced proprietorof questionable reputationaway in tropic singapore it could hardly fail to appeal to him if rightly told about the events and vulgar publicity of yesterday nothing need be said about this within careful limits much and that with as she believed happiest result she had succeeded in bringing father and son together in the first instance now with this pathetic story as lever might she not hope to bring them into closer more permanent union why should not faircloth in future come and go if not as an acknowledged son yet as acknowledged and welcome friend of the house a consummation this to her delightful and reasonable as just for had not the young man passed muster and that triumphantlyshe again told herselfin small things as well as great in things of social usage and habit those little foxes which as between class and class do so deplorably and disastrously spoil the grapes therefore she began to invent ingenious speeches to carteret and to her father hatch ingenious schemes and pretty plotsin the style of dear aunt felicia almostwas that ladys peacemaking passion infectious by chance and supposing it were hadnt it very charming and praiseworthy turns to itwitness felicias rather noble gathering in and acceptance of faircloth yesterday arriving at which engaging conclusion damaris felt minded to commune for a space with the restful loveliness of the twilight before going downstairs again and seeking more definite employment of books or needlework she raised the windowsash and kneeling on the chintzcovered cushioned windowseat leaned out the gardeners today had rooted up the geraniums and dug over the empty flower beds just below preparatory to planting them with bulbs for spring blossoming the keen pungent scent of the newlyturned earth hung in the humid air as mingling with ita less agreeable incensedid the reek of the mudflats on the right the twin ilex trees formed a mass of soft imponderable gloom above and behind them the sky was like smoked crystal the lawn lay open and vacant upon it nothing hopped or crept the garden birds had eaten their suppers long since and sought snug bosky perching places for the night even the unsleeping sea was silent the tide low and waveless no more than a languid ripple far out upon the shelving sands all dwelt in calm in a brooding tranquillity which might be felt damaris listened to the silence until her ears began to suspect its sincerity sounds were there in plenty she believed were her hearing sharp enough to detect them they naughtily played hideandseek with her striking a chord too deep or too thinly acute for human sense sights were there too had her eyes but a cats or an owls keener faculty of seeing behind the tranquillity she apprehended movement and action employing a medium obeying impulses to us unknown restfulness fled away but in place of it interest grew if she concentrated her attention and listened more carefully she should hear looked more steadily she should see just because she was tired a little shattered still and spent did this predominance of outward nature draw her imposing itself it beckoned her and through passing deficiency of will she followed its beckoning making no serious effort to resist with the consequence she presently did hear sounds but sounds surely real and recognizable enough coming from the shore eastwards below the seawall along the river frontage ponies walked or rather floundered fetlock deep in blown sanda whole drove of them to judge by the confused and muffled trampling of their many hoofs the drop from the top of the seawall to the beach was too great and the space between the foot of the wall and the riverbank and breakwater too confined for her to see the animals even had not oncoming darkness rendered all objects increasingly illdefined but the confused trampling instead of keeping along the foreshore as in all reason it should now came up and over the seawall on to the battery into the garden heading towards the house damaris strained her eyes through the tranquil obscurity seeking visible cause of this advancing commotion but without effect yet all the while as her hearing clearly testified the unseen ponies hustled one another plunging shying away from the swish and crack of a longthonged whip one stumbled and rolled over in the sandfor although the mob was halfway up the lawn by now the shuffling sliding sand stayed always with themafter a nasty struggle it got on to its feet tottering forward under savage blows dead lame another a laggard fell into its tracks and lay there foundered rattling in the throat by this time the foremost of the drove came abreast the house front where sir charles veritys three groundfloor rooms with the corridor behind them ranged out from the main building the manypaned semicircular windows of these rooms dimly glistened below their fanshaped slated roofs the crowding scurry of scared overdriven animals was so indisputable that damaris expected a universal smashing of glass but the sound of many hoofs still muted by sliding sand passed straight on into and through the house as though no obstacle intervened barring progress the manypaned windows remained intact undemolished dimly glistening beneath their slated roofs the garden stretched vacant as before right away to the battery in the elusive twilight a sky of smoked crystalthrough which stars began to show faintly points of cold blurred lightabove the gloom of the ilex trees to the west and in the south above the indistinguishable sea the slender moon hanging upright silver and sickleshaped thus far damaris entire consciousness had resided in and been limited to her auditory sense concentration being too absorbed and intense to allow room for reasoning still less for scepticism or even astonishment she had watched with her earsas the blind watchdesperate to interpret instant by instant inch by inch this reconstructed tragedy of longdead man and longdead beast there had been no thinking round the central interest no attempted reading of its bearing upon normal events mind and imagination were fascinated by it to the exclusion of all else it acted as an extravagant dream acts abrogating all known laws of cause and effect giving logic and science the lie negativing probability making the untrue true the impossible convincingly manifest not indeed until she beheld mary fisher deepbosomed and comely in black gown white apron and cap moving within those rooms downstairsstill echoing as they surely must to that tumultuous and rather ghastly equine transitdid the extraordinary character of the occurrence flash into fullness of relief mary meanwhile set down her flat candlestick upon the big writingtable in sir charless study lighted lamps and drew blinds and curtains went into the bedroom next door and dressingroom beyond methodically performing the evening ritual of shutting up her shadow marched with her as though mockingly assisting in her operations now crouching now leaping ahead blotting a ceiling extending itself upon a wall space other shadows thrown by the furniture came forth and leapt also pranced skipping back into hiding as the candlelight shifted and passed but save this indirect admission of the immaterial and grotesque everything showed reassuringly ordinary the woman herself unconcerned ignorant of disturbance damaris rose from her kneeling posture upon the windowseat and standing lowered the sash once was enough it was no longer incumbent upon her to listen or to look if these ghostly phenomena were repeated they could convey nothing more to her nothing fresh they had delivered their messageone addressed wholly and solely to herself so she judged since mary had so conspicuously no suspicion of it our maidens lips were dry her heart beat in her ears yet she was in no degree unnerved seldom indeed had she been more mistress of her powers selfrealized and vigilant nor did she feel tired any more infirm of will and spent rather was she consciously resolute to encounter and withstand eventsof what order she did not know as yet but events of moment and farreaching result already on the road journeying toward her hotfoot they were designed to test and try her would do their utmost to overwhelm to submerge her were she weak but she didnt intend them to submerge her she bade weakness quit all her young courage rising in arms the marvellous things she just now heard so nearly sawfor it had come very near to seeing hadntwere avant couriers of these same journeying events their appointed prelude she could explain neither how nor whybut very certainly somehow nor could she explain the relationif anycoupling together the said marvels heard and the events nevertheless she knew the former rode ahead whether in malignity or mercy to forewarn her this place the hard in virtue of its numerous vicissitudes of office and of ownership of the memories and traditions which it harboured both sinister amiable erudite passionate was singularly sentient replete with influences in times of strain and stress the normal wears thin and such lurking influences are released they break bounds shoutingto such as have the psychic geniusconvincing testimony of their existence all this damaris perceived standing in the middle of the room while the silver crescent moon looked in at her the stillness once again was absolute the dusk save where the windows made pale squares upon the carpet thick the fourpost bed gay enough by day with hangings and valences patterned in roses on a yellow ground looked cavernous carteret would lie under its black canopy tonight if if all goes well damaris said the words aloud her thought becoming personal and articulate once before she had heard the smugglers ponies waiting in this same room waiting at the open window to catch the first rumble of the wheels of a returning carriage her poor dear nannie sarah watson was returning home after a summer holiday spent with her own people in the north and damaris younger then by nearly five years had listened impatiently ready to skirmish down into the front halldirectly the carriage turned the elbow of the driveand enclose her faithful nurse and fostermother in arms of childlike love but destiny ruled otherwise in vain she waited sarah watson returned no more death having elected to take her rather horribly to himself some hours previously amid the flaming wreckage of a derailed express what did this second hearing presage a like vain waiting and disclosure of deathdealing accident notwithstanding her attitude of high resolution the question challenged damaris in sardonic fashion from beneath the black canopy of the great bed her hand went up to the string of pearls which on a sudden grew heavy about her throat but notnotpray god the dear man with the blue eyes she cried she was glad to be alone in the encompassing semidark for a warm wave of emotion swept over her an ardour hardly of the spiritual sort had she deceived herself was she in truth desirous carteret should approach her solely according to that earlier manner in which she so simply trusted him did she hail his coming as that of a wise counsellor merelyor but here marystill pursuing the timehonoured ritual of shutting upentered candle in hand the landing showing brightly lit behind her dear heart alive she exclaimed whoevers that you miss damaris alone here in the dark you did make me jump but there she added repentant of her unceremonious exclamation i dont know what possesses us all tonight the least thing seems to make you jump mrs coopers all of a twitter and laurasilly girlis almost as bad i suppose its the weather being so quiet after yesterdays gale for my own part i always do like a wind about it seems company particularly these long evenings if youre called on to go round the house by yourself all of which amounted to an admission as damaris was not slow to detect she was still under the empire of emotion the abrupt intrusion affected her she too needed to carry off the situation poor mary she said you have been frightenedby what did you hear anything you could not account for when you were down in the library just now the answer came after a pause as though the speaker were suspicious slightly unwilling to commit herself no miss damaris not in sir charless rooms or in the west wing either whatever unaccountable noises there ever is belong to this old part of the house she set her candlestick on the dressingtable and went to each window in turn drawing blinds down and curtains across so doing she continued to talk moving to and fro meanwhile with a firm light tread not that i pay much attention to such things myself i dont hold its right its my opinion theres no sort of nonsense you cant drive yourself into believing once you let ideas get a root in you ive seen too much of mrs cooper giving away like that the two winters you and sir charles was abroad id a proper upset with herthough we are good friendsmore than once after sundown she was enough to terrify you out of your lifewouldnt go here and wouldnt go there for fear of she didnt know what tempting providence i call it and spoke to her quite sharp if ever i wanted to go over to spend an hour or two with father and mother in marychurch i was bound to ask mrs patch and the children to come in and keep her company theres no sense in putting yourself into such a state it makes you a trouble to yourself and everybody else and in the end a thousand to one if anything comes of all the turmoil and fussmrs cooper to be only fair to her when shes in a reasonable humour allows as much mary stepped across to the bed and doubled back the quilt preparatory to turning down the fine linen sheet she felt she had extracted herself from a somewhat invidious position with flying colours and in the process had administered timely advice for it wasnt suitable miss damaris should be moping alone upstairs at odd times like this it all came of yesterdays upsether righteous anger blazed against the clerical culprit in that connection there was other matter of which she craved to deliver herselfrefreshing items of local gossip sweet as honey to the mouth did she but dare retail them she balanced the question this way and that would satisfaction outweigh offence or offence satisfaction on the part of miss damaris you could not be sure how shed take thingsquite and yet she ought to know for the affair certainly placed captain faircloth in a pleasant light only one who was every inch a gentleman would behave so handsomely as he had she stretched across the bed to smooth the slightly wrinkled surface of the sheet this gymnastic feat necessitated the averting of her face and turning of her back theres a fine tale going round of how the island ladswild young fellows ready for any pranksserved mr sawyer the curate she began they say william jennifer put them up to it having a grudge against him for trying to get his youngest boy taken up for stealing apples last week they planned to give him a ducking in the pool just above the ferry where the waters so deep under the bank and if captain faircloth hadnt happened to come along for certain theyd have made mr sawyer swim for it mr patch hears they handled him ever so rough tore his coat and were on the very tick of pitching him in but captain faircloth would not suffer it he took a very high line with them it is said and not content with getting mr sawyer away walked with him as far as the grey house to protect him from any further interference she gave the pillows sundry judicious strokings and pats i hope mr sawyers properly thankful for it isnt many that would have shown him so much leniency as that she would have enjoyed labouring the point but comment appeared to her under the circumstances to trench on impertinence facts spoke for themselves she restrained herself fetched her candlestick from the dressingtable and stood by the open door thereby enjoining her young ladys exit thus far damaris maintained silence but in passing out on to the landing she saidthank you i am glad to know what has happened encouraged by which acknowledgment the excellent woman ventured further advice and now miss you must please just lie down on the schoolroom sofa and get a little sleep before the gentlemen and mr hordle arrive back there is a good two hours to wait yet and ill call you in plenty of time for you to dress you dont look altogether yourself miss too much talking with all that host of callers you are properly fagged out ill get mrs cooper to beat up an egg for you in a tumbler of hot milk with a tablespoonful of sherry and just a pinch of sugar in it that will get your circulation right chapter vi showing how sir charles verity was justified of his labours which homely programme being duly executed worked restorative wonders matter in the sublimated form of eggflip acted upon mind beneficially through the functions of a healthy if weary young body our maiden slept to dream not of ghostly ponies or other uncomfortably discarnate creatures but of darcy faircloth in his pretty piece of quixotism rescuing a minister of the church of england as by law established from heretical baptismal rites of total immersion the picture had a rough side to it and also a merry one but beyond these generous dealing wholly delightful to her feeling she awoke soothed and restored ready to confront the oncoming of eventswhatever their characterin a spirit of high confidence as well as of resolution with the purpose of advertising this brave humour she dressed herself in her best i do not deny a love of fine clothes in damaris yet in her own home and for delectation of the men belonging to her a woman is surely free to deck herself as handsomely as her purse allows beauty unadorned ceased to be practicable in selfrespecting circles with the expulsion of our first parents from the paradisaic state while beauty merely dowdy is a pouring of contempt on one of gods best gifts to the human race therefore i find no fault with damaris upon this rather fateful evening in that she clothed herself in a maizecoloured silk gown flowered in faint amber and faint pink cut in the piece from shoulder to hem according to a then prevailing fashion it moulded bosom waist and haunches spreading away into a demitrain behind the high medici collar of old lace at the back of the square decolletage conferred dignity the hanging lace of the elbow sleeves a lightness her hair in two wide plaits bound her head smoothly save where soft disobedient little curls refusing restriction shaded her forehead and the nape of her neck after a few seconds of silent debate she clasped carterets pearls about her throat again and so fared away a creature of radiant aspect amid sombre setting of low ceilings and dark carpeted floors to await the advent of the travellers these arrived some little while before their time so that the girl in her gleaming dress had gone but halfway down the staircase when they came side by side into the halltwo very proper gentlemen the moist freshness of the night attending them a certain nobility in their bearing which moved her to enthusiasm momentarily even bringing a mist before her eyes for they were safe and well both of them so she joyously registered serene of countenance moreover as bearers of glad tidings are whatever the ghostly ponies foretold could be no evil shadowing themfor which she gave god thanks meanwhile there without the light of the carriage lamps pierced the enclosing gloom played on the silver plating of harness on the shining coats of the horses whose nostrils sent out jets of pale steam played over the faces of the servants too mary and laura just within the open door hordle and conyers outside loading down the baggage from the back of the mailphaeton and on patch exalted high above them on the drivingseat as damaris paused irradiated by the joy of welcome and of forebodings falsified upon the lowest step of the staircase sir charles turned aside and tenderly kissed her my darling he said and carteret following him an instant later took her by both hands and from arms length surveyed her in smiling admiration he made no effort to repress dear witch this is unexpected good fortune i had little thought of seeing you so soonresplendent being that you are veritably clothed with sunshine and with your pearls she gaily said ah my poor pearls he took her up lightly i am pleased they still find favour in your sight but arent you curious to learn what has made us desert our partridge shooting at an hours notice granting the pretty little beggars unlookedfor length of life his blue eyes laughed into hers there was a delightful atmosphere about him something had happened to him surelyfor wasnt he after all a young man even yet yeswhatwhat has brought you colonel sahib damaris laughed back at him bubbling over with happy excitement miracles he answered a purblind government at last admits the error of its ways and proposes to make reparation for its neglect of a notable publicservant you she cried carteret shook his head still surveying her but with a soberer glance nononot me in any case there isnt any indebtedness to acknowledgeno arrears to pay off i have my desertsto a man immensely my superior look nearer home dear witch he made a gesture in the direction of his host my commissioner sahib yesyour commissioner sahib who comes post haste to request your dear little permission before accepting this tardy recognition of his services to the british empire ah but thats too much the girl said softly glancing from one to the other enchanted and abashed by the greatness of their loyalty to and prominent thought of her has this made him happy she asked carteret under her breath he looks so i think how good that this has come in timethat it hasnt come too late for in the midst of her joyful excitement a shadow crossed damaris mind oddly obscuring the light she suffered a perception things might so easily have turned out otherwise a suspicion that had the reparation of which carteret spoke been delayed even by a little its beloved recipient would no longer have found use for or profit in it damaris fought the black thought as ungrateful and faithless to fear disaster is too often to invite it just at this juncture miss felicia made hurried and gently eager irruption into the hall and with that irruption the tone of prevailing sentiment declined upon the somewhat trivial even though warmly affectionate for she fluttered round sir charles as mary fisher helped divest him of his overcoat in sympathetic overflowings of the simplest sortshe had been reading and failed to hear the carriage hence her tardy appearance let him come into the drawingroom at once out of these draughts there was a delightful wood fire and he must be chilled the drive down the valley was always so cold at nightparticularly where the road runs through the marsh lands by lampit in her zeal of welcome miss verity was voluble to the point of inconsequence not to say incoherence questions poured from her she appeared agitated quaintly selfconscious so at least it occurred to damaris finally she addressed carteret and you too must be frozen she declared how long it is since we met i have always been so unlucky in just missing you here really i believe i have only seen you once since you and charles stayed with us at canton magnayou were both on leave from india i dare not think how many years ago that isbefore this childher candid eyes appealingly sought those of damarisbefore this child existed and you are so wonderfully unaltered colour dyed her thin face and rather scraggy neck only the young should blush after forty such involuntary exhibitions of emotion are unattractive questionably even pathetic really time has stood still with youit seems to me colonel carteret time has done better than stand still damaris broke in with a rather surprising imperiousness it has beautifully run backwardslately and our maiden in her whispering gleaming dress swept down from the step swept past the sadly taken aback miss felicia and joined her father she put her hand within his arm come and warm yourselfcome dearest she said gently drawing him onward into the long room where from above the range of dark bookshelves goggleeyed pearlgrey chinese goblins and monsters and obliqueeyed chinese philosophers and saints looked mysteriously down through the warm mellow light damaris was conscious of a singular inward turmoil for miss felicias speeches found small favour in her ears she resented this open claiming of carteret as a member of the elder generation still more resented her own relegation to the nullity of the prenatal state reminiscences in which she had neither lot nor part left her cold or to be accurate bred in her an intemperate heat putting a match to jealousies which till this instant she had no knowledge of touched by that match they flared to the confusion of charity and reverence hence impulsively unscrupulously yet with ingenious unkindness she struckher tongue a swordto the wounding of poor miss felicia and she felt no necessity for apology she liked to be unkind she liked to strike aunt felicia should not have been so selfassertive so tactless she had brought chastisement upon herself it wasnt like her to behave thus her enthusiasms abounded but she possessed a delicate appreciation of relative positions she never poached this came perilously near poachingand everything had danced to so inspiring a tune the movement of it so delicious now the evening was spoilt the first fine alacrity of it could not be recapturedwhich was all aunt felicias faultno for her unkindness damaris felt no regret it may be remarked that our angry maidens mind dwelt rather upon the snub she had inflicted on miss verity than upon the extensive compliment she had paid and the challenge she had delivered to carteret hearing her flattering declaration his mind not unnaturally dwelt more upon the latter it took him like a blow so that from bending courteously over the elder ladys hand he straightened himself with a jerk his eyes followed the imperious sunclad young figure questioning and keenly alert today he had liberally enjoyed the pleasures of friendship for charles verity had been largely and generously elate but damaris outburst switched feeling and sentiment onto other lines they became personal were her words thrown off in mere lightness of heart or had she spoken deliberately with intention it were wiser perhaps not to ask he steadied his attention on to miss felicia once more but not without effort you always said kind and charming things i remember so he told her you are good enough to say them still damaris stood by her father upon the tiger skin before the hearth tell me dearest she prayed him charles verity put his hand under her chin turned up her face and looked searchingly at her her beauty tonight was conspicuous and of noble quality it satisfied his pride public life invited him offering him place and power ranklings of disappointment of detraction and slight were extinguished his soul was delivered from the haunting vexations of them he was in the saddle again and this radiant womanchild whom he so profoundly loved should ride forth with him for all the world to seeif she pleased that she would please he had no doubt pomp and circumstance would suit her well she was moreover no slight or frothy piece of femininity but could be trusted amid the glamour of new and brilliant conditions to use her judgment and to keep her head increasingly he respected her character as well as her intelligence he found in her unswerving sense of right and wrong sense of honour likewise impetuous she might be swift to feel and to revolt but of tender conscience and on occasion royally compassionate now he could give her fuller opportunity could place her in circumstances admittedly enviable and prominent from a comparative backwater she should gain the full streamand that stream in a sense at the flood rarely if ever had charles verity experienced purer pleasure touched a finer level of purpose and of hope than today when thinking of and now when looking upon damaris he thankfully appraised her worth and in spirit bowed before it not doatingly or weakly but with reasoned conviction weighed in the balances she would not be found wanting such was his firm belief for himself he accepted this recall to active participation in affairs active service to the state with a lofty content but that his daughter in the flower of her young womanhood would profit by this larger and more distinguished way of life gave the said recall its deeper values and its zest still he put her off awhile as to the exact announcement smiling upon her in fond yet stately approval let the telling keep until after dinner my dear he bade her pacify the cravings of the natural man for food and drink the day has been fertile in demandsstrenuous indeed to the point of fatigue so let us comfort ourselves inwardly and materially before we affront weighty decisions he kissed her cheek by the way though does it ever occur to you to think of the bhutpur sultanibagh and wish to go east again and damaris with still uplifted chin surveyed him gravely and with a certain wistfulness miss felicias attempted poaching forgotten and an impression of faircloth vividly overtaking her for they were so intimately disturbingly alike the father and the son in voice as well as in build and feature go east she said faircloths declared preference for sailing into the sunrise present to her why i go east in my dreams nearly every night i love itlove it more rather than less as i grow older of course i wish to gosome day but thats by the way commissioner sahib all that i really want now at once is to go wherever you go stay wherever you stay you wont ask me to agree to any plan which parts us will youwhich takes you away from me ruth to a strange naomi my dear he answered but so be it i desire nothing better than to have you always with mebut i will not keep you on tenterhooks as to your and my projected destination let them bring in dinner in half an hour carteret and i shall be ready meanwhile read thisagreeing to relegate discussion of it to a less hungry season and taking the letter she had forwarded to him yesterday bearing the imprint of the indian office from the breast pocket of his shooting coat he put it into her hand the appointmentnamely that of lieutenantgovernor of an indian presidency famous in modern history a cradle of great reputations and great men of english names to conjure with while our eastern empire endureswas offered in terms complimentary above those common to official communications sir charles veritys expert knowledge not only of the said mighty province but of the turbulent kingdom lying beyond its frontiers marked him as peculiarly fitted for the post a campaign against that same turbulent kingdom had but recently been brought to a victorious conclusion his influence it was felt might be of supreme value at this juncture in the maintenance of good relations and consolidation of permanent peace damaris heart glowed within her as she read the courteous praiseful sentences even more than through the wellmerited success of his book did her father thus obtain and come into the fullness of his own at last her imagination glowed too calling up pictures of the halfremembered halffabulous oriental scene the romance of english rule in india the romance of india itself its variety its complexity the multitude of its gods the multitude of its peoples hung before her as a mirage prodigal in marvels reaching back and linking up through the centuries with the hidden wisdom the hidden terror of the ancient of days to this land of alien faiths and secular wonders she found herself summoned not as casual sightseer or tourist but as among the handful of elect persons who count in its social political and administrative life in virtue of her fathers position her own would be both conspicuous and assured an intoxicating prospect this for a girl of oneandtwenty intoxicating yet as she envisaged it disquieting likewise she balanced on the thought of all it demanded as well as all it offered of all it required from herdazed by the largeness of the purview volition in suspense carteret was the first to reappear habited in the prescribed black and white of evening male attire in the last six months he had perhaps put on flesh but this without detriment to the admirable proportions of his figure it retained its effect of perfect response to the will within and all its natural grace his fair hair and moustache were still almost untouched with grey his physical attraction in short remained unimpaired and of this damaris was actually if unconsciously sensible as he closed the door and passing between the stumpy pillars walked up the long narrow room and stood his hands behind him his back to the pleasantly hissing and crackling fire of driftwood alone dear witch he said and seeing the open letter in her handwell what do you make of this proposition and yet again as she raised serious pondering eyesyou find it an extensive order i find it magnificent for himbeautifully as it should be adequate and right and for yourself carteret asked aware of a carefulness in her language and intrigued by it magnificent for me toothough it takes away my breath you must learn to breathe deeper thats all he returned gently teasing her and who is to teach me to breathe deeper dear colonel sahib she quickly and rather embarrassingly asked not my father hell have innumerable big things to do and to do them without waste of energy he must be saved at every point he must not fritter away strength in coaching me in my odds and ends of duties still less in covering up my silly mistakes oh you exaggerate difficulties he said looking not at her but at the fierce yellow and black striped tiger skin at his feetbless the lovely child what was she driving at carteret started for deadham under the impression he had himself thoroughly in hand and that all danger of certain inconvenient emotions was passed he had lived them down cast them out for over two years now he had given himself to the superintendence of his estate to county business to the regulation of his sistershappily more prosperousaffairs to the shepherding of his two elder nephews in their respective professions and securing the two younger ones royally good times during their holidays at home throughout the hunting season moreover he rode to hounds on an average of three days a week such healthy sport helps notably to deliver a man from vain desires by sending his body cleanly weary to bed and to sleep o nights by such varied activities had carteret systematically essayed to rid himself of his somewhat exquisite distemper and when coming to deadham honestly believed himself immune sane and safe he was proportionately disturbed by finding the cure of this autumn lovemadness less complete than foollike he had supposed for it showed disquieting signs of resurrection even when damaris arrayed in the sheen of silken sunlight greeted him at the staircase foot and an alarming disposition finally to fling away headcloth and windingsheet when she petulantly broke in upon miss veritys faded memories of canton magna with the flattering assertion that time had run backward with him of late now alone with her confident moreover of her maidenly doubts and pretty selfdistrust he felt at a decided disadvantage the detached affectionately friendly the avuncularnot to say grandfatherlyattitude escaped him he could not play that part oh you exaggerate difficulties he therefore told her with a singular absence of his habitual mansuetude his tone trenching on impatience instinct and common sense will teach youmotherwit tooof which you may take it from me you have enough and to sparelet alone that there will be a host of people emulous of guiding your steps aright if your steps should stand in need of guidance which i venture to doubt dont underrate your own cleverness hearing him sensible of his apparent impatience and misconceiving the cause of it damaris temper stirred she felt vexed she also felt injured what has happened to you colonel sahib she asked him squarely i see nothing foolish in what i have said you wouldnt have me so conceited that i rushed into this immense business without a qualm without any thought whether i can carry it out creditablywith credit to him i mean thus astonishingly attacked carteret hedged miss verity of course will behe began damaris cut him short aunt felicia is an angel a darling she declared butbut and there stopped pricked by a guilty conscience for to expose miss felicias inadequacies and enlarge on her ineligibility for the position of feminine chief of the staff struck her as unworthy a meanness to which under existing circumstances she could not condescend to stoop carteret looked up to be entranced not only by the fair spectacle of her youth but by her delicious little air of shame and selfreproach evidently she had caught herself out in some small naughtinesswas both penitent and defiant at once admitting her fault and pleading for indulgence he suspected some thought at the back of her mind which he could neither exactly seize nor place she baffled him with her changes of mood and of directioncoming close and then slipping from under his hand this humour was surely new in her she would not leave him alone would not let him rest had she developed since last he had converse with her into a practised coquette look here dear witch he said making a return upon himself and manfully withstanding the sweet provocation of her near neighbourhood we seem to be queerly at cross purposes i cant pretend to follow the turnings and doublings of your ingenious mind i gather there is something you want of me to be plain then what is it thatthat you shouldnt desert medesert usin this crisis you have never deserted me beforenever since i can first remember i desert yougood lord carteret exclaimed his hands dropping at his sides with an odd sort of helplessness ah thats asking too much i suppose she said im selfish even to think of it yet how can i do otherwise dont you understand how all difficulties would vanish and how beautifully simple and easy everything would be if you coached meif you dear colonel sahib went with us the man with the blue eyes looked down at the tiger skin again his countenance strained and blanched more than ever did he find her humour baffling not once nor twice had he putting force upon himself resisted the temptation to woo herwitness his retirement from st augustin and his determined abstinence from intercourse with her since but now so it might veritably appear the positions were reversed and she wooed him though whether pushed to that length merely by wayward fancy by some transient skittish influence or frolic in the blood or by realized design he had no means of judgingwell he had bidden her be plain and she in some sort at least obeyed him it behooved him therefore to be plain in return in as far as a straightforward reading of her meaning would carry so you think all would be simple and easy were i to go with you and your father he said both speech and manner tempered to gentleness i am glad to have you think soshould be still more glad could i share your belief but i know better dearest witchknow that you are mistaken this is no case of desertionput that out of your precious mind once and for allbut of discretion my being in attendance far from simplifying would embroil and distort your position an elderly gentleman perpetually trotting dont damaris cried holding up both hands in hot repudiation dont say that theres distortion if you like its uglyi wont have it for it is not true in the obvious sincerity of which denunciation carteret found balm yet adhered to his purpose but it is true alas and i therefore repeat it both for your admonition and my own for an elderly gentleman trotting at a young girls heels is a most unedifying spectaclegiving occasion and reasonably to the enemy to blasphemebad for her in numberless ways and if hes any remnant of selfrespect left in him is anything better than a fatuous dotard damnably bad for him as well do you understand damaris presented a mutinous countenance she would have had much ado to explain her own motives during this ten minutes conference if her mentalor were they not rather mainly emotionalturnings and doublings proved baffling to her companion they proved baffling to herself in an almost greater degree things in general seemed to have gone into the meltingpot so many events had taken place so many more been preshadowed so many strains of feeling excited and these were confusingly unrelated or appeared to be so as yet amongst the confusion of them she found no sure foothold still less any highway along which to travel in confidence and security her thought ran wild her intentions ran with it changing their colour chameleonlike from minute to minute now she was tempted to make an equivocal rejoinder to understand she said is not always colonel sahib necessarily to agree i am satisfied with understanding and dont press for agreement he answered and on an easier notesince to me it is glaringly evident you should take this fine flight unhandicapped my duty is to stand aside and leave you absolutely freenot because i enjoy standing aside buthe would allow sentiment such meagre indulgencejust exactly because i do not here for the second time at the crucial moment felicia verity made irruption upon the scene but though her entrance was hurried it differed fundamentally from that earlier one so that both the man and the girl standing in the proximity of their intimate colloquy before the fire were sensible of and arrested by it she was selfforgetful selfpossessed the exalted touch of a pure devotion upon her i have been with my brother charles she began addressing them both i happened to see hordle coming from the libraryand i put off dinner i thought darlingthis to damaris with a becoming hint of deferencei might do so i gathered that charlesthat your fatherwished it he has not been feeling well and as damaris anxiously exclaimed yesmiss felicia went onnot at all well hordle told me that was why i went to the library he hoped if he waited and rested for a little while the uncomfortable sensations might subside and it would be needless to mention them he did not want any fuss made we gave him restoratives and he recovered from the faintness but he wont be equal he admits to coming in to dinner colonel carteret must be hungryyour father begs us to wait no longer i assured him we would not hordle is with him he should not be alone i think while any pain continues painpain damaris cried her imagination rather horribly caught by the word but is he hurt has he had some accident while carteret asked tersely painand where here felicia answered laying her hand upon her left side over the heart she looked earnestly at carteret as she spoke conveying to him an alarm she sought to spare damaris he tries to make little of it and assures me it was only the heat of the house which caused him discomfort after the cold air out of doors it may be only that but i think we ought to make sure again and with that same becoming hint of deference she turned to her niece so i sent orders that patch should drive at once to stourmouth and fetch dr mccabe i did not stop to consult you because it seemed best he should take out the horses before they were washed down and stabled yesbut i can go to him damaris asked darlingof course but i would try to follow his lead if i were youtreat it all lightly since he so wishes your father knows best in most thingsand may know best in this please god it is so left alone with carteret i am anxiousmost cruelly anxious about my brother she said while damaris sweeping across the hall and down the corridor in her sunshine silken dress repeated the poniesthe smugglers ponies a sob in her throat chapter vii telling how charles verity looked on the mother of his son which is equivalent to saying hear the conclusion of the whole matter isnt it mccabe dr mccabes square hairybacked hands fumbled with the stethoscope as he pushed it into his breast pocket and in replying his advertised cheerfulness rang somewhat false not so fast sir charlesin the good lords name not so fast while theres life theres hope its me settled opinion im never for signing a patients deathwarrant before the blessed soul of hims entirely parted company with its mortal tenement of clay the normal human being takes a mighty lot of killing in my experience where the will to live is still intact let alone that you can never be quite upsides with nature ah shes an astonishing box of tricks to draw on where final dissolutions concerned she glories to turn round on your pathological and biological high science and while youre measuring a man for his coffin to help him give death the slip charles verity slightly shifted his positionand that with singular carefulnessagainst the pillows in the deep redcovered chair his hands inert and bluish about the fingertips lay along the padded arms of it the jacket of his greyandwhite striped flannel sleepingsuit was unfastened at the throat showing the irregular lift and fall of his chest with each laboured breath his features were accentuated his face drawn and of a surprising pallor the chair in which he sat had been brought forward into the wide arc of the great window forming the front of the room two bays of this stood open down to the ground looking out beyond the rich brown of the newlyturned earth in the flowerbeds the lawn stretched awaya dim greyish green under the long shadows cast by the hollies masking the wall on the left and glittering powdered by myriads of scintillating dewdrops where the early sunshine slanted down on it from between their stiff pinnacles and sharply serrated crests in the shrubberies robins sang shrilly sweet a murmur of waves breaking at the back of the bar hung in the chill moist windless air presently a handbarrow rumbled and creaked as westthe head gardener last surviving relic of thomas clarkson veritys reignwheeled it from beneath the ilex trees towards the battery leaving dark smudgy tracks upon the spangled turf arrived at his objective the old gardener with most admired deliberation loaded down longhandled birchbroom rake and hoe and applied himself to mysterious peckings and sweeping of the gravel around the wooden carriages of the little cannon and black pyramid of ballman tools and barrow were outlined against the pensive brightness of autumn sea and autumn sky which last to southward still carried remembrance of sunrise in a broad band of faint yellowish pink fading upward into misty azure and barred with horizontal pencillings of tarnished silver cloud thus far charles verity had watched the progress of the bowed slowmoving figure musingly but now as the iron of the hoe clinked against the gravel flints he came back so to say to himself and back to the supreme question at issue he looked up his eyes and the soundless ironic laughter resident in them meeting mccabes twinkling cunning yet faithful and merry little eyes with a flash the work of the world is not arrested he said see that octogenarian old west he wheeled illoiled squeaking barrows and hacked at the garden paths when i was a harchester boy he wheels the one and hacks at the other even yeta fact nicely lowering to ones private egotism when you come to consider it why then my good friend perjure yourself or strive to mince matters the work of the world will be done whether im here to direct the doing of it or notgranted i am tough and in personal knowledge of illhealth a neophyte my luck throughout has been almost uncanny neither in soldiering nor in sport from man or from beast have i ever suffered so much as a scratch i have borne a charmed lifeestablished a record for invulnerability which served me well in the east where the gods still walk in the semblance of man and miracle is still persistently prevalent accident has passed me bysave for being laid up once nearly thirty years ago with a broken ankle in the house of some friends at poonah he ceased speaking checking as it seemed disposition to further disclosure while the soundless laughter in his eyes found answering expression upon his lips curving them to a somewhat bitter smile beneath the flowing moustache in todays enforced idleness how persistently cancelled episodes and emotions rap ghostly on the door demanding and gaining entrance he presently said must we take it doctor that oblivion is a fiction merciful forgetfulness an illusion and that every action every desirewhether fulfilled or notis printed indelibly upon ones memory merely waiting the hour of weakness and physical defeat to show up the lord only knows mccabe threw off a little hopelessly this was the first utterance approaching complaint and he deplored it for his patients sake he didnt like that word defeat then to his hearers relief with a softened accent charles verity took up his former theme save for a trifling go of fever now and again illness has given me the goby equally with accident but for all my ignorance of such afflictions i know beyond all shadow of doubt that a few repetitions of the experience of last night must close any mans account experiment is more enlightening than argument there is no shaking the knowledge you arrive at through it mccabe standing at ease by the open window untidy hirsute unkempt rammed his hands down into his gaping trouser pockets and nodded unwilling agreement the attack was bad he said im not denying it was murderously bad and all the harder on you because but for the one defaulting organ your heart youre as sound as a bell youre a well enough man to put up a good fight and that you see cuts both ways be danged to it a chain is no stronger than its weakest linkyou know as well as i do the indian appointment will never be gazetted there you have me sir charles loath though i am to admit as much id be a liar if i denied it would not how long do you give me then months or only weeks that depends in the main on yourself in as far as i can presume to pronounce with care which means sitting still here it does charles verity raised his shoulders the least bit not good enough mccabe he declared not good enough there are rites to be duly performed words to be said which i refuse to neglect oh no dont misunderstand me i dont need professional help to accomplish my dying were i a member of your communion it might be different but i require no muchmarried parsonic intermediary to make my peace with god i am but little troubled regarding that shall not the judge of all the earth do rightnevertheless there remain rites to be decently performed i must make my peace with manand still more with womanbefore i go hence and am no more seen but look here i have no wish to commit myself too soon and risk the bathos of an anticlimax by having to perform them twice repeat them at a later dateso how long do you give meweeks too generous an estimate a week then orwellless you want it straight i want it straight more likely days god grant i am mistaken with your fine constitution as i tell you you are booked to put up a good fight all the same to be honest sir charles it was touch and go more than once last night in the room an interval of silence and without song of the robins and murmur of the sea nearer now and louder as the rising tide lapped up the sands at the back of the bar the faint yellowpink afterthought of sunrise and pencillings of tarnished cloud alike had vanished into the allobtaining misty blue of the upper sky heading for the french coast a skein of wild geese passed in wedgeshaped formation with honking cries and the beat of strongwinged flight the barrow creaked again wheeled some few yards further along the battery walk thanksso i supposed sir charles verity calmly said he stretched himself falling into a less constrained and careful posture leaned his elbow on the chairarm his chin in the hollow of his hand crossed the right leg over the left twentyfour hours will give me time for all which is of vital importance the rest must and no doubt perfectly will arrange itselfoh ill obey you within reasonable limits mccabe i have no craving to hurry the inevitable conclusion these last hours possess considerable significance and charman impressiveness even which it would be folly to thrust aside or waste once more he looked up his tone and expression devoid now of all bitterness i propose to savour their pleasant qualities to the full so make yourself easy my good fellow he continued with an admirable friendliness go and get your breakfast heaven knows youve most thoroughly earned it and a morning pipe of peace afterwardsthe bell upon the small tableyesoh yesand hordle within earshot ive everything i require and at the risk of seeming ungrateful shall be glad enough of a respite from this course of food and drink potions and poulticesremedial to the delinquent flesh no doubt but a notable weariness to thespiritand see here report to the two ladies my sister andand damaris that you leave me in excellent case free of discomfort resting for a time before girding up my loins to meet the labours of the day charles verity closed his eyes in intimation of dismissal anxious to be alone the better to reckon with that deeper final loneliness which confronted him just now in all its relentless logic for though his mind remained lucid selfrealized and observant his control of its action and direction was incomplete owing to bodily fatigue hence it lay open to assault at the mercy of a thousand and one crowding thoughts and perceptions and over these he desired to gain ascendencyto drive rather than be driven by them the epic of his threescore years from its dim illusive start to this dramatic and inexorable finishbut instantly disclosed to him in the reluctant admissions of the goodhearted irish doctorflung by at a double in coloured yet incoherent progression so to speak now marching to triumphant blare of trumpet now to roll of muffled drum which incoherence came in great measure of the inalienable duality of his own naturepassion and austerity arrogance and selfdoubt lovesurpassing most mens capacity of lovingand a defacing strain of cruelty delivering stroke and counterstroke from all such tumult he earnestly sought to be delivered since not the thing accomplishedwhether for fame for praise or for remorsenot in short what has been but what was and still more what must soon be did he need at this juncture dispassionately to contemplate that sharptoothed disappointment gnawed him is undeniable when he thought of the culminating gift of happy fortune royally satisfying to ambition as unexpectedly offered him as through his own unlookedfor and tragic disability it was unexpectedly withdrawn but disappointment failed to vex him long a more wonderful journey than any possible earthly one a more majestic adventure than that of any oriental proconsulship awaited him for no less a person than death issued the orderan order there is no disobeying he must saddle up therefore bid farewell and ride away nor did he flinch from that ride with death the black captain as escort any more than during the past night he had flinched under the grip of mortal pain for some persons the call to endurance brings actual pleasureof a grim heroic kind it did so to charles verity and not only this conscious exercise of fortitude this pride of bearing bodily anguish but a strange curiosity worked to sustain him the novelty of the experience in both cases excited and held his interest continued to exercise it and to hold now as in solitude his mental atmosphere acquired serenity and poisethe authority of the past decliningthis matter of death increasingly engrossed him for it trenches on paradox surely that the one absolutely certain event in every human career is also the most unexplored and practically incrediblean everyday occurrence a commonplace concerning which there remains nothing new nothing original to be written sung or said yet a mystery still inviolate aching with the alarm of the undiscovered the unpenetrated to each individual summoned to accept its empire he had sent others to their death now his own turn came and he found it however calmly considered a rather astounding business an ending or a beginninguseless after all to speculate the worst feature of it not improbably this same preliminary loneliness this stripping naked no smallest comfort left you of human companionship or even of humble material keepsake from out the multitude of your familiar possessions here in the dear accustomed human scene the gates of death open you pass them they close behind you and what thenthe whole hierarchy of heaven the whole company of your forerunners thitherbeloved and honoured on earthmay be gathered to hail the homing soul within those amazing portals or it may drop as a stone into a well down the blank nothingness of the abyssof all gambles invented by god man or devilso he told himselfthis daily hourly gamble of individual dissolution is the biggest mans heart refuses the horror of extinction while his intellect holds the question in suspense we hope we believe from of old fair promises have been made us and granted the gift of faith hope and belief neighbour upon assurance but certainty is denied no mortal still clothed in flesh has known northe accumulated science of the ages notwithstandingdoes know actually and exactly that which awaits it thus anyhow in the still tender brightness of the autumn morning while nature and men alike pursued their normal activities and occupations did this singular matter appear to charles verityhe himself arbitrarily cut off from all such activities and occupations in the very moment of high fruition had death been a less eminent affair or less imminent the sarcasm of his position might have seemed gross to the point of insult but the longer he envisaged it the more did the enduring enigma and its accompanying uncertainty allure not as victim but rather as conqueror of the final terror did he begin to regard himself meanwhile though reason continued to hold the balance even between things positively known and things imagined only and hoped for the godward impulse strengthened in him not by conscious or convincing argument from within but by allpowerful compulsion from without was his thought borne onward and upward to increasing confidence so that he asked himselfas so many another still unwearied still enamoured of attainment has asked in like casewhether impending divorce of soul and body may not confer freedom of a wider range and nobler quality powers more varied and august than the mind circumscribed by conditions of time and sense has yet conception of to him such development seemed possiblecertainly probableah well perhapsperhaps which brought him back to his former contention that its inherent loneliness constitutes the bitterest sting of death smiling he quoted the ancient divinely tender saying there is a child in each one of us which cries at the dark while in swift reaction he yearned towards battle where amid the fierce and bloody glory of the fight souls of heroes troop forth together shouting into everlasting day orsceptical reason shaking a sadly sage head once againinto everlasting night he stretched out his hand instinctively for the bell on the little table at his elbow hordle answered his summons grey of countenance from alarm anxiety and broken rest let miss damaris know i shall be glad to see her when she is free to come to me he said and here although our damsels reputation for courage and resource may thereby sustain some damage i am constrained to state that while in the sickroom miss felicia shone damaris gave off but a vacillating and ineffective light imagination is by no means invariably beneficent the very liveliness of the perceptions which it engenders may intimidate and incapacitate upon damaris imagination practised this mischief becoming for the time that upon which she looked sharing every pang and even embroidering the context she weakened in some sort to the level of the actual sufferer helpless almost as he through the drench of overwhelming sympathy she had been taken poor child at so villainous a disadvantage without preparation or warningsave of the most casual and inadequateher humour wayward she a trifle piqued fancying her pretty clothes her pretty looks excited both by the brilliant prospect presented by the indian appointment and by her delicate passage of arms with carteret she was compelled of a sudden to witness the bodily torment of a human being not only by her beloved beyond all others but reverenced also the impression she received was of outrage almost of blasphemy the cruelty of life lay uncovered naked and open to her appalled and revolted consciousness she received a moral in addition to a physical shock utterly confounding in its crudity its primitive violence the ravage of pain can be in great measure surmounted and concealed but that baser thing functional disturbancein this case present as heart spasm threatening suffocation with consequent agonized and uncontrollable struggle for breathdefies concealment this manifestation horrified damaris the more so that being unacquainted with the sorry spectacle of disease her father under the deforming stress of it appeared to her as a stranger almostinaccessible to affection hideously removed from her and remote his person and character to her distracted observation were altered beyond recognition except during intervals poignant to the verge of heartbreak when passing ease restored his habitual dignity and grace thus while miss felicia and carteretwith hordle and mary fisher as assistantsministered to his needs in as far as ministration was possible she stood aside consumed by misery voluntarily effacing herself backed away even against the wall out of range of the lamplight stricken shuddering and mute upon dr mccabes arrival and assumption of command carteret finding himself at liberty to note her piteous state led her out into the passage and then to the long drawingroom with gentle authority there for a halfhour or moreto him sadly and strangely sweethe sat beside her while the tears silently coursed down her cheeks letting her poor proud head rest against his shoulder his arm supporting her gracious young body still clothed in all the bravery of her flowered silken sunshine dress later mary bringing more favourable news of sir charlespain and suffocation having yielded for the time being to mccabes treatmentcarteret persuaded her to go upstairs and let the said mary put her to bed once there she slept the sleep of exhaustion fatigue and sorrow mercifully acting as a soporific her capacity for further thought or feeling literally worn out during that session in the drawingroom damaris to his thankfulness had asked no questions of him all she demanded childlike in her extremity had been the comfort and security of human contact and this he gave her simply ungrudgingly with a high purity of understanding guiltless of any shadow of embarrassment or any afterthought their lighter somewhat enigmatic relation of the earlier evening was extinguished swamped by the catastrophe of charles veritys illness exactly in how far she gauged the gravity of that illness and its only too likely result or merely wept unnerved by the distressing outward aspect of it carteret could not determine but he divined and rightly that she was in process of ranging herself at least subconsciously with a new and terrible experience which could she learn the lesson of it aright would temper her nature to worthy issues hence with a peculiar and tender interest he watched her when coming down in the morning he found her already in the diningroom the pleasant amenities of a wellordered hospitable house and household abundantly evident whatever the tragic occurrences of the last twelve hours domestic discipline was in no respect relaxed the atmosphere of the room distilled a morning freshness furniture and flooring shone with polish a log fire tipped by dancing flames burned in the low wide grate upon the sidetable between the westward facing windows a row of silver chafingdishes gave agreeable promise of varied meats as did the tea and coffee service arrayed before damaris of grateful beverage while she herself looked trim and finished in white silk shirt and russetred suit her toilet bearing no sign of indifference or of haste that her complexion matched her shirt in colouror rather in all absence of itthat her face was thin its contours hardened her eyebrows drawn into a little frown her eyes enormous sombre and clouded as with meditative thought increased in carterets estimation assurance of her regained selfmastery and composure nor did a reticence in her manner displease him i have persuaded aunt felicia to breakfast upstairs she told him dr mccabe sends me word hemy fatherwishes to rest for the present so i engaged aunt felicia to rest too she was wonderful damaris voice shook slightly as did her hand lifting the coffeepot she stayed up all night so did you im afraid didnt you colonel sahib oh for me that was nothing a bath a change and ten minutes out there on the battery watching the sun come up over the sea carteret said so dont waste compassion on me im as fit as a fiddle and in no wise deserve it ah but you and aunt felicia did stay she repeated her hands still rather tremulously busy with coffeepot and milk jug you were faithful and i no better than a shirker i fell through miserably lost myself which was selfish contemptible i am ashamed only i was so startled i never really knew before suchsuch things could beforgive me colonel sahib i have been to aunt felicia and asked her forgiveness alreadyand dont think too meanly of me please the shirking is over and done with for always you may trust me it never will happen againmy losing myself as i did last night i mean in making this appeal for leniency her eyes met carterets fairly for the first time and he read in them not without admiration and a twinge of pain both the height of her newborn determined valour and the depth of her established distress you neednt tell me that you neednt tell me that dear witch he answered quickly i was sure of it all along i knew it was just a phase which would have no second edition so put any question of shame or need of forgiveness out of your precious head you were rushed up against circumstances against a revelation calculated to stagger the most seasoned campaigner you did not shirk but it took you a little time to get your bearings that was all dont vex your sweet soul with quite superfluous reproachessugar yes and plenty of it i am afraidbut you too must eat and on her making some show of repugnance see here we cant afford to despise the day of small things of minor aids to efficiency dearest witch he wisely admonished her whereupon emulous to please him bending her will to his damaris humbled herself to consumption of a portion of the contents of the chafingdishes aforesaid to discover that granted a healthy subject sorrow queerly breeds hunger the initial distaste for foodin the main a sentimental oneonce surmounted later mccabe joined them recognized damaris attitude of valour and inwardly applauded it although himself in woeful state for he was hard hit badly upset conscious of waste of tissue he set about to restore it without apology or hesitation trouble putting an edge to appetite in his case also and that of formidable keenness bitterly he grieved since bearing the patient he feared very certainly to lose an uncommon affection he loved charles verity while from the worldly standpoint his dealings with the hard meant very much to himmade for glory a feather in his cap visible to all and envied by many minus the fine flourish of it his position sank to obscurity as a whistplaying golfplaying clubhaunting angloindian excivil surgeonand irishman at thatliving in lodgings at stourmouth he commanded meagre consideration but as chosen medicalattendant and in some sort retainer of sir charles verity he ranked the county came within his purview thanks to this connection with the hard he on occasion rubbed shoulders with the locally great hence genuine grief for his friend was blackbordered by the prospect of impending social and mundane loss the future frowned on him view it in what terms he might to use his own unspoken phrase he felt in hellishly low water one point in particular just now worried him thus as fish eggs porridge hot cakes honey and jam disappeared in succession he opened himself to damaris and carteret a difficult subject namely that of a second opinionlet no thought of any wounding of his susceptibilities operate against the calling in of such he was ready and willing to meet any fellow practitioner they might selecta harley street bigwig or dr maskall of harchester whose advice in respect of cardiac trouble was wide sought he had however but just launched the question when hordle entered and walking to the head of the table addressed damaris sir charles desires me to say he will be glad to see you miss when you are at liberty he told her in muffled accents she sprang up to pause an instant irresolute glancing wideeyed at carteret he had risen too coming round the corner of the table he drew back her chair put his hand under her elbow went with her to the door there is nothing to dread dearest witch he gently and quietly said have confidence in yourself god keep youand himnow you are quite ready thats rightwell then go carteret waited looking after her until crossing the hall followed by hordle she passed along the corridor out of sight silent preoccupied he closed the door and took a turn the length of the room before resuming his place at the opposite side of the table to mccabe facing the light the doctor who had ceased eating and half risen to his feet at the commencement of this little scene watched it throughout at first indifferent a prey to his own worries but soon in quickening interest shrewd enquiry and finally in dawning comprehension holy mother of mercy so thats the lay of the land is it and his loose lips shaped themselves to a whistle yet emitted no sound to obliterate all signs of which tendency to vulgar expression of enlightenment he rubbed moustache mouth and chin with his napkin studying carteret closely meanwhile in the pink of condition by gadgood for a liberal twenty years yet and morebar accident indefinite postponement of the grand climacteric in this caseall the same a leetle leetie bit dangerous im thinking for both if she tumbles to it then aloudhas the poor darling girl grasped the meaning of her fathers illness do you make out colonel grasped the ugly eventualities of it carteret slowly brought his glance to bear on the speaker i believe so though she has not actually told me as much he saidand now about this question of a second opinion mccabe the easily huffed irishman accepted the reproof in the best spirit possible as confirming his own perspicacity quite so flicked him neatly on the raw and he winced all the same hes a white man a real jewel of a fellow worthy of good fortune if the balls thrown his way i wonder how long bytheby this handsome games been aplaying with which as requested he returned to the rival claims of harley street and harchester in respect of a consulting physician carteret proved a faithful prophet for in truth there was nothing to dread the beloved presence once entered as damaris thankfully registered the sun by now topped the hollies and shone into the study flinging a bright slanting pathway across the dim crimson scarlet and blue of the turkey carpet charles verity stood in an open bay of the great window looking out over the garden seen thus in the still sunlight the tall greyclad figure possessed all its accustomed slightly arrogant repose damaris thrilled with exalted hope for the young are slow to admit even the verdict of fact as final his attitude was so natural so unstrained and unstudied that the message of ghostly warning yesterday evening was surely discounted while the subsequent terror of the night that hideous battle with pain and suffocation became to her incredible an evil dream from which in grateful ecstasy she now awoke her joy found expression dearest dearest you sent for meis it to let me see you are really better more beautifully recovered than they told me or i ventured to suppose her voice broke under a gladness midway between tears and laughter the envious blades of atropos scissors have not cut the mortal thread yet anyhow he answered smiling permitting himself the classic conceit as a screen to possible emotion but we wont build too much on the clemency of fate how long she proposes to wait before closing her scissors it is idle to attempt to say he laid his hands on damaris shoulders bent his head and kissed her upward pouted lipsthereby hushing the loving disclaimer which rose to them so we will keep on the safe side of the event my wise child he continued make all our preparations and thus deny the enemy any satisfaction of taking us unawarescan you write a business letter for me a dozen dearest if you wish damaris assented eagerly yet that image of the scissors stayed by her already her joy was sensibly upon the wane oh one will be sufficient i thinkquite sufficient for this morning charles verity turned his head looking seaward through the tranquil sunshine that indian appointment has to be suitably thanked for anddeclined damaris drew back a step so as to gain a clearer view of him the hands resting on her shoulders were oddly inert so she fancied forceless and in temperature cold even through the thickness of cloth jacket and silk shirt she was aware of their lifelessness and chill this roused rebellion in her her instinct was for fight she made a return on mccabes suggestion regarding further advice she would demand a consultation call in expert opinion the dear man with the blue eyeshere her white face flushed rosywould manage all that for her and compel help in the form of the last word of medical science and skill might not your letter be put off for just a few days she pleaded in caseuntil but charles verity broke in before she could finish her tender protest a sadness even hint of bitterness in his tone you covet this thing so much he said your heart is so set on it she made haste to reassure himno no not that way not for her how could it signify save on his account she only cared because greedy of his advancement greedy to have him exaltedplaced where he belonged on the summit the apex so that all must perceive and acknowledge his greatness as to herselfand the flush deepened making her in aspect deliciously youthful and ingeniousshe confessed misgivings reported her talk with carteret concerning the subject and the scolding received from him thereupon one more reason for writing in the sense i propose then her father declared since it sets your overmodest doubts and qualms at rest my dear that is settled his hands weighed on her shoulders as though he suddenly needed and sought support i will sit down he said there are other matters to be discussed and i can perhaps talk more easily so he went the few steps across to the red chair sank into it leaned against the pillows bending backward his hand pressed to his left side his features contracted and his breath caught as of one spent with running and damaris watching him again received that desolating impression of change of his being in spirit far removed inaccessible to her sympathy a stranger he had gone away and rather terribly left her alone are you in pain she asked agonized discomfort he replied we will not dignify this by the name of pain but i must wait for a time before dictating the letter theres something i will ask you to do for me my dear meanwhile yeshe paused shifted his position closed his eyes have you held any communication with he stopped for the question irked him even at this pass it went against the grain with him to ask of his daughter news of his son but in that pause our maidens scattered wits very effectually returned to her with darcy faircloth she said and as charles verity bowed his head in assentyes i should have told you already butbut for all which has happened he was here the day before yesterday he came home from church with methat was my doing not his to begin with you mustnt think he put himself forwardtook advantage i mean of your being away if there is any blame it is mine mine ratherand of long standing god forgive me but damaris fairly launched now upon a wholly welcome topic would have none of this to maintain her own courage and if it might be combat that dreaded withdrawal of his spirit into regions where she could not follow she braced herself to reason with him nothere indeed you are mistaken dearest she gently yet confidently asserted you take the whole business topsyturvy fashion quite wrong way round i wont weary you with explanations of exactly what led to darcy faircloth coming here with me on sunday but you ought to know that he and aunt felicia met i hadnt planned that it just happened and she was lovely to himlovely to us both she made him stay to luncheoninviting him in your name i seem to possess a singular gift for saddling my relations with the payment of my bad debts charles verity remarked but there isnt any bad debtthats what i so dearly want you to believe what im trying so hard commissioner sahib to tell you damaris cried afterwards when he and i were alone by ourselves the ice broke somehow he gave himself away and said beautiful thingsthings about you which made me delightfully happy and showed how he has felt towards you all along simply without picking of her words hesitation or artifice damaris repeated that somewhat sinister tale of the sea of a sailing ship becalmed through burning days and stifling nights in tropic waters of the illdoings of a brutal drunken captain of a flyblown eatinghouse in singapore of the spiritual deliverance there achieved through sight of charles veritys name and successful record in the columns of a calcutta newspaper and the boys resultant demand for the infliction of some outward and visible sign some inalienable stigmata which should bear perpetual witness to the fact of his parentage so you see damaris kindled standing before him flamed indeed to a rare carelessness of convention of enjoined pruderies and secrecies you gave him the beautiful gift of life to begin with and saved his life later when he was so miserably tempted to end it as he loves life where then is the debtnot on your side certainly dearest listening to which fondly exalted sophistriesfor sophistries from worldly and moral standpoint alike must he not surely pronounce themcharles verity still received comfort to his soul they ought to be reckoned mistaken of course transparently in error yet neither son nor daughter condemned him neither did his sister in the pathetic innocence and purity of her middleage maidenhood this moved him to thankfulness none the less genuine because shot with selfmockery for he was curious to observe how as the last urgings of ambition and thirst of power fell away from himhe riding under escort of death the black captainall tributes of human tenderness and approval gained in valuenot the approval of notable personages of those high in office nor even that of sympathetic critics and readers but of persons in his own immediate voisinage bound to him by friendship by association or the tie of bloodtheir goodwill was precious to him as never before he craved to be in perfect amity with every member of that restricted circle hence it vexed and fretted him to know the circle incomplete through the exclusion of one rather flagrantly intimate example yet to draw the said member the said example within the circle yielding it the place which it might rightfully aspire to occupy amountedafter half a lifetime of abstention and avoidanceto a rather tremendous demonstration one which might well be hailed as extravagant as a courting of offence possible only to a sentimental egoist of most aggravated kind and he was tiredhad no smallest inclination towards demonstrations for the threatening of heart spasm to which he lately denied the title of pain though of short duration affected him adversely sapping his strength his mind it is true remained clear even vividly receptive but just as earlier this morning his will proved insufficient for its direction or control he mused his chin sunk on his breast his left hand travelling down over the long soft moustache his eyes half closed thought and vision followed their own impulse wandering back and forth between the lowcaste eatinghouse in the sweltering heat and perfumed stenches of the oriental tropic seaport and the stonebuilt english innhere on marychurch havenoverlooking the desolate waste of sandhills the dark reedbeds and chill gleaming tides for love of damaris his daughter while still in the heat of his prime he had foresworn all traffic with women yet now along with the tacitly admitted claims of the son arose the claim of the mistress mother of that sonin no sensual sort but with a certain wildness of bygone romance wind and rainswept unsubstantial dim and grey ever since conviction of the extreme gravity of his physical condition dawned on him the idea of penetrating the courts of that deserted sanctuary had been recurrent in the summing up of his human his earthly experience romance deserved surely a word of farewell damaris story served to give the idea a fuller appeal and consistency but he was tiredtired he longed simply to drift it was infinitely distasteful to him definitely to plan or to decide respecting anything meanwhile his continued silence and abstraction wore badly upon damaris she had steeled herself had flamed greatly daring now reaction set in her effort proved vain she had failed for once more she recognized that an unknown influence a power dark and incalculably strongso she figured itregained ascendency over her father working to the insidious changing of his nature strangely winning him away waiting for some response some speech or comment on his part fear and the sense of helplessness assailed and would have submerged her had she not clung to carterets parting god bless you and avowed faith in her stability as to a wonderworking charm nor did the charm fail in efficacyoh really he was a wonderful sheetanchor the shadow of a great rock in a weary land that dear man with the blue eyes consciously she blessed himand thanks to remembrance of him presently found voice and purpose once again you arent displeased with me dearest she asked displeased charles verity repeated at first absently displeased my dear nowhy we didnt do wronglabouring the point the more fully to recall and retain himdidnt take too much upon ourselvesaunt felicia i mean and iby persuading darcy faircloth to stay on sunday by entertaining him when you were away oror have i been stupid dearest and thoughtlessly wearied you by talking too much and too long neither he said on the contrary all you have told me goes to lessen certain difficulties make the crooked in some degree straight and rough places plain for if faircloth had been here so recently broken bread too in the house so he argued it became the easier to bid him return and charles verity needed to see him see him this morningsince purpose of farewells to be spoken in those longdeserted courts of romance stiffened becoming a thing not merely to be turned hither and thither in thought but to be plainly and directly donesend for him in your own name he said explain to him how matters stand and ask him to talk with me and as damaris agreed rejoiced by the success of her adventurous diplomacy making to go at once and give the required instructions staystay a moment her father said and drew her down to sit on the chairarm keeping her hand in his and with his other hand stroking it wistfully for though certain difficulties might be sensibly lessened they were not altogether removed and he smiled inwardly aware that not even in the crack of doom are feminine rights over a man other than conflicting and uncommonly ticklish to adjust before we commit ourselves to further enterprises my darling let us quite understand one another upon one or two practical pointsbearing in mind the blades of atropos envious scissors my affairs are in orderdamaris shrank piteously expostulated oh but must we are we obliged to speak of those things they grate on mecommissioner sahib they are ugly they hurt yesdistinctly we are obliged to speak of them to do so can neither hasten nor retard the event all the more obliged to speak of them because i have never greatly cared about money except for what i could do with itas a means of vast importance as an end uninterestingso it has been lightly come and lightly go i am afraid all the same ive not been culpably improvident a portion of my income dies with me but enough remains to secure you against any anxiety regarding ways and means if not to make you a rich woman i have left an annuity to your aunt felicia her means are slender dear creature and her benevolence outruns them so that she balances a little anxiously i gather on the edge of debt the capital sum will return to you eventually carteret and mccabe consented some years ago to act as my executors their probity and honour are above reproachnow as to this placeif you should ever wish to part with it let faircloth take it over i have made arrangements to that effect about which i will talk with him when he comeshave no fear lest i should say that which might wound him i shall be as careful my dear of his proper pride as of my ownunderstand i have no desire to circumscribe either your or his liberty of action unduly but this house all it contains the garden the very trees i see from these windows are so knitted into the fabric of my past life that i shrinkwith a queer sense of homelessnessfrom any thought of their passing into the occupation of strangerschildish pitifully weakminded no doubt and therefore the more natural that one should crave a voice thus in the disposition of what one has learned through long usage so very falsely to call ones own we will do exactly what you wish even to the littlest particular i promise youboth for faircloth and for myself damaris answered forcing herself to calmness and restraint of tears he petted her hands silently until as the minutes passed she began once more to grow fearful of that dreadful unknown influence insidiously possessing him and winning him away and he may have grown fearful of it too for he made a sharp movement raising his shoulders as though striving to throw off some weight some encumbrance there is an end then of business he said and of such worldly considerations i need worry you with them no more only one thing remains of which before i speak to others it is only seemly my darling i should speak to you charles verity lifted his eyes to hers and she perceived his spirit as now in nowise remote but close evident almost to the point of alarm it looked out from the wasted face at onceto her seeingexquisite and austere reaching forward keenly curious of all death should reveal unmoved yet instinct with the brilliance the mirthfulness even of impending portentous adventure you know damaris how greatly i love and have loved youhow dear you have been to me dearer than the satisfaction of my own flesh speech was beyond her she looked back dazzled and for the moment broken therefore it goes hard with me to ask anything which might ever so distantly cause you offence or distress only time presses we are within sight of the end ah nono she exclaimed wrenching away her hands and beating them together passion of affection of revolt and sorrow no more to be controlled how can i bear it how can i part with you i will not i will not have you diemccabe isnt infallible we must call in other doctors they may be cleverer may suggest new treatment new remedies they must cure youor if they cant cure at least keep you alive for me i wont have you die call in whom you like as many as you like my darling the whole medical faculty if it serves to pacify or to content you he said smiling at her damaris repented took poor passion by the throat stifling its useless cries i tire you i waste your strength i think only of myself of my own grief most beloved my own consuming grief and desolationseei will be goodi am good what else is there you want to have me do thisbut recollect you are free to say me nay without scruple or hesitation i shall not require you to give your reasons but shall bow unreservedly to your wishes for you possess a touchstone in such questions as the one now troubling me which did i ever possess it i lost as do most men rather lamentably early in my career if you suffer me to do so i will ask darcy faircloth to bring his mother here to me this evening at dusk when her coming will not challenge impertinent observationso that i may be satisfied no bitterness colours her thought of me and that we part in peace she and i damaris got up from her seat on the arm of the redcovered chair she stood rigid her expression reserved to blankness but her head carried high of course she said a little hoarsely and waited of course how could i object wasnt it superfluous even to ask me your word dearest is law but in the present case hardly gospel yesgospel toosince it is your word gospel that is for me let darcy faircloth bring his mother here by all means only i think perhaps this is all a little outside my province it would be better you should make thethe appointment with him yourself i will send to him directly patch can take a note over to the island i would prefer to have patch go as messenger than either of the other men she walked towards the door stopped halfway and turned hearing her father move and as she turnedher eyes quick with enquiry as to his case but inscrutable as to her owncharles verity rose too and held out his arms in supreme invitation she came swiftly forward and kissed him while with all the poor measure of force left him he strained her to his breast have i asked too much from you damaris and in the desire to make sure of peace elsewhere endangered the perfection of my far dearer peace with you she leaned back from the waist holding her head away from him and laid her hand on his lips dont blaspheme most beloved she said i have no will but yours again she kissed him disengaged herself very gently and went chapter viii chapter the eighth which is also chapter the last at ladys oakan ancient forest boundarywhere the main road forks damaris swung the dogcart to the left across the singlearch stone bridge spanning the arne and on up the long winding ascent from the valleybottom to the moorlands patched with dark fir plantations which range inland from behind stourmouth this constituted the goal of her journey for the highlying plateau reached leagues of open country are disclosed north and west far as the eye carries to the fine bare outline of the wiltshire downs she asked for wide prospects for air and ample space but as floored by stable earth rather than by the eternal unrest and fruitless sonorous furrows of the sea ever since the day of the funeral now nearly a fortnight ago damaris had kept within the sheltering privacy of the house and grounds that day one of soft drizzling rain and clinging ground fog had also been to her one of hardly endurable distraction beneath assumption of respectful silence it jarred boomed took notes debated questioned beneath assumption of solemnity it peeped and stared her flayed nerves and desolated heart plagued her with suspicions of insincerity in as far as colonel carteret controlled proceedings all had been marked by reverent simplicity but where the carcass is the eagles proverbially gather and unfeathered fowl in their own

death occurring precisely when he was invited to mount nothing lessaccording to local reportthan an oriental throne sufficed to stir the most lethargic imagination moralists of the reginald sawyer school might read in this the direct judgment of an offended deity deadham however being reprehensibly clannish viewed the incident otherwise and questionedthanks to an ingeniously inverted system of reasoningwhether the said reginald sawyer hadnt laid himself open to a charge of manslaughter or of an even graver breach of the decalogue theresa bilsonin whose hat artificial buttercups and daisies hastily made room for bows of crapelurked in the humble obscurity of the free seats near the west door to right and left she was flanked by a guardian miss minett but these ladies today were but broken reeds on which to lean they still laboured under a sense of having been compromised and of resultant social ostracism this although their former parsonic lodger had vanished from the scene on the day following his threatened immersiona halfhearted proposition on his part of facing out the undeserved obloquy living down the coarse persecution meeting with as scant encouragement from his ecclesiastical superior the vicar as from themselves theresait really was hard on hershared their eclipse hence the humble obscurity of the free seats where she sniffed dabbed her eyes and gurgled unheeded and unseen finally young tom verityhome on his first long leavehaving accompanied the family party from canton magna and feeling his sense of humour unequal to the continued strain of their sublime insularity benevolently herded two stately though shivering turbanned native gentlemen who reached deadham during the early stages of the ceremony no one quite knew whence or when in the intervals of his selfimposed duties he found time to admire the rich unction of his father the archdeacons manner and voice plus ca change plus la meme chose he quoted gleefully what a consummate fraud the dear old governor is and how deliciously innocent of the fact that he imposes upon no one half so successfully as he does upon himself our young man also found time from afar to admire damaris but let it be added to a very different tune her beauty came as surprise to him as having much more than fulfilled its early promise he found it impressive beyond that of any one of the many ladies mature or callow with whom it was his habit largely to flirt so far he could congratulate himself on having successfully withstood the wiles of matrimonybut by how near a shave at times by how narrow a squeak if that fine parental fraud the archdeacon had but knowntom undeterred by the solemnity of the occasion hunched up his shoulders like a naughty boy expecting his ears boxedbut thenthank the powers the archdeacon so blessedly and refreshingly didnt and what was more didnt in the very least want to know he never asked for trouble but like the priest and levite of sacred parable carefully passed by on the other side when trouble was about our young friend looked again at damaris yesshe had beauty and in the grand manner standing there at the foot of the open bricklined grave calm immobile blackclad whitefaced in the encircling melancholy of the drizzling mist with the family grouped about her largeboned pompous wellfed persons impervious to general ideas as they were imperviously prosperous he compared her to a strayed deer amongst a herd of store cattle really with the exception of his cousin felicia andnaturallyof himself the verity breed was almost indecently true to type prize animals most of them he granted still cattlefor didnt he detect an underlying trace of obstinate bovine ferocity in their collective aspect damaris calm and immobility exceeded theirs but in quality and source how far removed how sensitive and intelligent her mourning was in the grand manner too her grief sincere and absolute to the extent of a splendid selfforgetfulness she didnt need to pose for that forgotten self could be trustedin another acceptation of the phrasenever to forget itself and here tom veritys agreeable frivolity the astute and witty shiftiness of mind andin a degreeof practice for which he so readily found excuses and forgave himself made place for nobler apprehensions not merely damaris just now rather tragic beauty moved and impressed him but some quality inherent in her upon which he felt disposed to confer the title of genius that was going farmentally he pulled himself up shortfor wasnt it going altogether too farabsurdly so what the dickens did this excessive admiration portend could he have received the coup de foudrehe had today a fancy for french tags in reaction from the familys overpowering englishnessthat wouldnt suit his book in the very least for in the matters of the affections he held it thriftless to the confines of sheer lunacy to put all your eggs into one basket he therefore politicly abstained from further observation of damaris and with engaging assiduity reapplied himself to herding the two native gentlemen through the remainder of the ceremony and at the conclusion of it into the mildewed luxury of a marychurch landau deadham parish went home to its tea that evening damp not to say dripping but well pleased with the figure it had cut in the public eye for it had contributed its quota to contemporary history and what parish can after all do more reporters pervaded it armed with notebooks and pencils they put questions politely requested a naming of names the information furnished in answer would reach the unassailable authority of print giving deadham opportunity to read the complimentary truth about itself still better giving others opportunity to read the complimentary truth about deadham hence trade and traffic of sorts with much incidental replenishing of purses great are the uses of a dead prophet to the keepers of his tomb not within the memory of the oldest inhabitant had any funeral been so largely or honourably attended truly it spelled excellent advertisementand this although two persons calculated mightily to have heightened interest and brought up dramatic and emotional values were absent from the scene for lesbia faircloth giving her barman and two women servants a holiday closed the inn at noon alone within the empty house she locked the outer doors drew the blinds reducing the interior to uniform shadowpeopled obscurity with the exception of her own bedchamber there she left one small square windowset deep in the stone work of the wallopen and uncurtained it faced the causeway and perspective of lane skirting the warren and leading to the high road and village looking out thence in winter when the trees were bare she could see deadham church crowning its monticule part of the sloping graveyard and below these in the middle distance the roofs and gables of the village street today the view was obliterated for here at the river level mist and drizzle took the form of fog opaque chill and dank it drifted in continuous just perceptible undulations past and in at the open casement soon the air of the room grew thick and whitish the dark oak furniture and the floor boards furred with moisture yet her methodical closure of the house complete lesbia faircloth elected to sit in full inward sweep of it drawing a straightbacked chair mounted on roughly carpentered rockers close to the window a handsome woman still though in her late fifties erect and of commanding presence her figure wellproportioned if somewhat massive her dark hair showed no grey her rather brown skin was clear smooth and soft in texture her eyes clear too watchful and reticent on occasionsuch as the driving of a business bargain say or of a drunken clienthard as flint her mouth a wholesome red inclined to fullness but had been governed to straightness of linewill dominant not only in her every movement but in repose as she now sat the chair rockers at a backward tilt her capable and wellshaped hands folded on her black apron in the hollow of her lap putting aside all work for once and permitting herself a space of undisturbed leisure she proceeded to cast up her account with love and life in as clearheaded accurate a fashion as she would have cast up the columns of cashbook or ledgerand found the balance on the credit side so finding it she turned her head and looked across the room at the wide halftester wooden bed set against the inner wallthe white crochet counterpane of which an affair of intricate fancy patterns and innumerable stitches loomed up somewhat ghostly and pallid through the gloom a flicker of retrospective victory passed across her face attesting old scores as paid for there through sleepless nights nursing the ardours and disgust of her young womanhood she lay barren beside her applecheeked pipingvoiced spouse his wife in name only there later times having as by miracle changed for her she gave birth to her son if somewhat prechristian in instinct and in nature the child of a more ancient and a simpler world she was in no sort slow of intelligence or wanton what had been sufficed her she cried out neither for further indulgence of passion nor against barriers imposed by circumstance and class that which she had done she had done openeyed counting and accepting the cost since then wooers were not lacking but she turned a deaf ear to all and each a frank materialist in some ways she proved an idealist in this no subsequent love passage could rival in wonder or beauty that first one since compared with charles verity the men who subsequently aspired to her favourswhether in wedlock or outwere to her taste at best dull loutish fellows at worst no more than human jackasses or human swine and through it all she possessed the boy on whom to spend her heart in whose interests to employ her foresight and singular capacity of moneymaking for loves sake therefore and for his sake also she had lived without reproach a woman chary even of friendship chary too of laughter chary above all of purposeless gaddings and of gossip business and the boys seagoing or returning might take her as far as southampton plymouth cardiff more rarely london or some northern port but deadham village rarely beheld her and never it is to be feared did the inside of deadham church yet deadham church bell plaintively insistently tolling the sound reaching her muted by the thickness of the fog kept her attention on the stretch for the ensuing hour startling as it was poignant charles veritys demand to see her six days ago brought the story of her love to full circle their meeting had been of the briefest for he was exhausted by pain but that he had sent and she had gone was unlocked for largesse on the part of fortune sufficient to give her deepseated and abiding sense of healing and of gain and this stayed by her now rather than any active call for mourning she inhaled the dank chillness of the fog gratefully it suited the occasion better far than sunshine and bright skies for winter darkness sullen flowing waters and desolate crying winds furnished the accompaniment of those earlier meetings hearing the tolling bell she strove to relive them and found she did so with singularly mounting wealth and precision of detail not only vision but sense pushed backward and inward revitalizing what had been until she ached with suspense and yearning shrewdly evaded dangers surmounted obstructions by action at once bold and wary and tasted the transfiguring rapture of the end attained in the soberness of her middle years occupied as she was with the rough exacting business of the inn and with the management of accumulating landed and other propertyanxiety born of her sons perilous calling never absent from her thoughtlesbia faircloth inclined to live exclusively in the present hence the colours of her solitary passion had somewhat faded becoming clouded and dim recent eventsled by the ugly publicity of reginald sawyers sermonserved to revive those colours today they glowed rich and splendid a robing of sombre glory to her inward and backward searching sight the bell tolled quicker announcing the immediate approach of the dead lesbia listened her head raised her face turned to open window felt over by the clammy impalpable fingers of the fog now they bore the coffin up the churchyard path as she timed it she wondered who the bearers might be and whether they carried it shoulder high the path was steep and charles verity though spare and lean broad of chest and notably tall bone tells they would feel the weight would breathe hard stagger a little even and sweat and with this visualizing of grim particulars love bodily love and desire of that which rested stark and for ever cold within the narrow darkness of the coffinshut away from all comfort of human contact and the dear joys of a womans embracerushed on her like a storm buffeted and shook her so that she looked to right and to left as asking help while her hands worked one upon the other in the hollow of her lap nor did darcy faircloth figure in deadhams record funeral gathering upon the day preceding it having watched by charles veritys corpse during the previous night he judged it well to take his new commanda fine fivethousandton steamer carrying limited number of passengers as well as cargo and trading from tilbury to the far east and to japan via the cape in his withdrawal at this particular date miss felicia hailed a counsel of perfection which commanded and continued to command alike her enthusiastic approval and unfeigned regret for that he should so seasonably efface himself arguedin her opinionso delightful a nature such nice thought for others such chivalrous instincts and excellent good tasteall the more lamentable then effacement should be from social moral or other seasons requiredyet for the family to gain knowledge of certain facts without due preparationhow utterly disastrous think of her halfsister harriet cowden for instance with a fullgrown and alas wrongwayabout stepnephew

had shown towards damaris and herself you can count on my unswerving affection my dear darcy she had said adding with to him very touching humilityand any affection you have to give me in return i shall cherish most gratefully be very sure of that all which as shall presently be shown brings our narrative though by devious courses back to damaris sweeping the dogcart to the left across the bridge spanning the arne and on up the long winding ascent from the woods and rich meadows in the valley to the wide prospects and keener air of the moorland above until now as already chronicled she had remained in house or garden prey to an apathy which while not amounting to definite illhealth refused interest and exertion she could not shake it off to her all things were empty blank immensely purposeless religion failed to touch her statereligion that is in the only form accessible the interior of some frowning gothic church of old castile or from another angle of some mellow latin basilica might have found the required mystic word to say to her but protestantism even in its mild anglican form shuts the door on its dead children with a heavy handand she suffered this religious coldness although any idea that death of the body implies extinction of the spirit extinction of personality never occurred to her damaris sense of the unseen was too ingrained her commerce with it too actual for that nothe spirit lived on he her most beloved lived on himself his very self but far away from her in just this consisted the emptiness the unspeakable and blank bitternesshe was somewhere and she could not reach him the dreadful going away of his spirit against which she had fought during the thirtysix hours of his illness had reached its ordained consummationthat was all the body which had contained and by that beloved spirit been so nobly animated in its present awful peace its blind dumb majesty meant scarcely more to her than some alabaster or waxen effigy of her dead it was so like yet so terrifyingly unlike charles verity in lifeshe had visited it morning and evening since to leave it in solitude appeared wanting in reverence throughout each night she thankfully knew that either carteret mccabe or faircloth watched by it yet to her it hardly retained as much of her fathers natural presence as the clothes he had worn the books and papers littering his writingtable the chair he preferred to sit in his guns and swords upon the wall or the collection of fishingrods walkingsticks and his spud stacked in a corner after the strain and publicity of the funeral her apathy deepened perplexing and saddening carteret and bringing miss felicia near to veritable wailing for while thanking them both she in fact put them both aside this in no sour or irritable humour but with a listlessness and apartness hopeless to overcome she prayed them to give her time soon she would begin again but not just yet she couldnt begin again to ordercouldnt make herself begin again they must not trouble only be patient with her please a little longershe wasnt indeed she wasnt pretendinga statement which in its simplicity cut carteret to the quickfor she meant to begin again directly she could today the weather took an encouraging turn for the better following the spell of fog and wet a northerly wind at last arose it swept the sky clear of clouds the land of melancholy vapours begetting a brilliance of atmosphere which wooed our maiden to come forth and once more affront the open she therefore ordered the dogcart at two oclock would herself drive and if aunt felicia didnt mind and think her unsociable would take patch for sole company because thenrenewed apologiesshe neednt talk and she felt disinclined to do so during the first half mile or so as must be confessed each prick of the black horses ears and change in his pace sent a quake through her as did the sight of every vehicle upon the road she passed or met her nerve was nowhere her selfconfidence in tatters but since this parlous state was in the main physical air and movement along with the direct call on her attention steadied the one and knit up the ravelled edges of the other by the time the plateau was reached and the hill lay behind her she could afford to walk the horse tentatively invite her soul and attempt to hold communion with nature sorrowas well as the napoleonic patchstill sat very squarely beside her but the nightmare of mortality with consequent blankness and emptiness was no longer omnipresent interest again stirred in her the healthy instinct of going on except in the foreground where foxy browns of withered bracken and pinkshot browns of withered heather gave richness of tone the colouring of the great view was somewhat cold it dealt in thin uncertain green the buff of stubble in sharp slatelike blues blended in places with indigo the black purple of hawthorn hedges and greybrown filigree of leafless treesthis did her good she asking to be strengthened and stimulated rather than merely soothed to feel the harsh untainted wind break against her hear it shrill through the dry shivering grasses of the roadside and sturdy spires of heath to see it toss the dark crests and tufted branches of the outstanding firs at the edge of the plantation brought up her morale brought her resignation moreovernot of the selfindulgent order of bowed head and languidly folded hands but of the sort which acknowledges loss and sorrow as common to the sum of human experience places it in its just relation to the rest and though more heavily weighted than before takes up the onward march sobered perhaps yet undismayed sins of omission began to prick her the domestic establishment ran on wheels even during the recent stress and agitation though she had ceased to exercise control over it now it must be reorganizedand probably on a less liberal footingbut these were minor questions comparatively simple to cope with her life had been full it must find fresh purpose fresh interest and occupation in a word be refilled literature allured her she dreamed of wonderful tellings dreamed of the engrossing joys of the written word but in what formpoetry essay history novelthe extreme limitation of her own knowledge or rather the immensity of her own ignorance confronted her and that partly through her own fault for she had been exclusive fastidious disposed to ignore both truths and people who offended her taste or failed to strike her fancy hitherto she had been led by fancy and feeling rather than by reasoned principle she must at once simplify broaden and democratize her outlook must force herself to remember that respect is in some sort due to everythinghowever unbeautiful however even vile or repugnantwhich is a constant quantity in human affairs and human character due to everything in the realm of nature also however repellent if it is really so actually exists in this connection the mysterious and haunting question of sex obtruded itself and along with it the thought of two eminently diverse persons namely lesbia faircloth and the dear the more than ever dear man with the blue eyes that in his agony her father should have desired the visit of the former once his mistress had been very bitter to bear provoking in damaris a profound though silent jealousy this had even come in some degree between her and faircloth for in proportion as that visit more effectually united father and son it abolished her position as intermediary between the two recalling the incident jealousy moved her now so that she gathered up the reins hastily and touched the horse with the whip it sprang forward danced and behaved before settling down to the swinging trot which in so handsome a fashion ate up the blond road crossing the brown expanse of moor damaris was surprised and distressed by the vehemence of her own emotion that her jealousy was retrospective and belonged to a past now over and done with she admitted yet thinking of her fathers demand to see lesbia how amazingly deep it went how profound and lasting is the empire of feeling in that wayso she put it falling back on her phrase of nearly three years ago first coined at st augustin and this was where carteret came infor he alone of all men had made her damaris ever consciously feel in that waya fact of immense significance surely could she but grasp the full the inner meaning of itand one which entered vitally into the matter of beginning again therefore so she argued the proposed simplifying broadening democratizing of her outlook must coveramongst how much elsethe whole astonishing business of feeling in that way she shrank from the conclusion as unwelcome the question of sex was still distasteful to her but she bade herself sternly not to shrink for without some reasoned comprehension of itas now dawned on herthe ways of human beings of animals of plants and so some say even of minerals are unintelligible arbitrary and nonsensical it is the push of life itself essential fundamental which makes us feel in that waythe push of spirit yearning to be clothed upon with flesh made visible and given its chance to enter the earthly arena to play an individual part in the beautiful terrible earthly scene therefore she must neglect it reject it no longer it had to be met and understood if she would graduate in the school of reality and in what other possible school is it worth while to graduate reaching which climax in her argument the selfishness of her recent behaviour became humiliatingly patent to her from the whole household but especially from carteret and aunt felicia she had taken all and given nothing in return she had added to their grief their anxieties by her silence her apathy her whimsies patch she asked suddenly which is the shortest way home without going through stourmouth and marychurch and under his instructions turned the dogcart down a grassy sidetrack heading southeasther back now to the wind and inland country her face to the larger horizon the larger if more hazardous freedom of the sea conversation started thus by her enquiry flourished in friendly desultory fashion until about threequarters of an hour later the front gates of the hard came in sight by then afternoon merged itself in early evening lights twinkled in the windows of the black cottages upon the island and in those of faircloths inn the sky flamed orange and crimson behind the sandhills and stone horse head the air carried the tang of coming frost upon the hard gravel of the drive the wheels of the dogcart grated and the horses hoofs rang loud another damaris came home to the damaris who had set fortha damaris rested refreshed invigorated no longer a passive but an active agent nevertheless our poor maiden suffered some reaction on reentering the house for so entering her loss again confronted her as an actual entity it sat throned in the lamplit hall it demanded payment of tribute before permitting her to pass its attitude amounted in her too fertile imagination to a menace here within the walls which had witnessed not only her own major acquaintance with sorrow but so many events and episodes of strange and sometimes cruel importsupernormal manifestations too of which last she feared to thinkshe grew undone and weak disposed to let tears flow and yield once more to depression and apathy the house was stronger than she butbutonly stronger surely if she consented to turn craven and give way to itwhereupon she consciously of set purpose defied the house denied its right to browbeat thus and enslave her for had not she this afternoon up on the moorland found a finer manner of mourning than it imposed a manner at once more noble and so more consonant with the temper and achievements of her beloved dead she believed that she had on the hall table lay a little flight of visiting cards her mind occupied in silent battle with the house damaris glanced at them absently and would have passed on but something in the halfdeciphered printed names caught her attention she bent lower doubting if she could have read aright briggeneral and mrs fraylingtwo smaller cards also bearing the generals name ranged with two others bearing that of the rev marshall wace a written inscription in the corner of each notified a leading hotel in stourmouth as the habitat of their respective owners this little discovery affected damaris to a singular extent she had small enough wish for henrietta fraylings society at this juncture still less for that of her attendant singerreciterparson yet their names and the train of recollections evoked by these made for the normal the average and in so far had on her a wholesome effect for henrietta of once adored and now somewhat tarnished memorysoulless finished and exquisitely artificial to her fingertips beguiling others yet never herself beguiled beyond the limits of a flawless respectabilitywas wonderfully at odds with high tragedies of dissolution how had the house received such a guest how put up with her intrusion but wasnt the house perhaps itself at a disadvantage its sting drawn in presence of such invincible materialism for how impress a creature at once so light and so pachydermatous the position lent itself to rather mordant comedy in this sense though not precisely in these phrases did damaris apprehend matters as still holding henrietta fraylings visiting card in her hand she crossed the hall and went into the drawingroom there from upon the sofa behind the teatable through the warm soft radiance of shaded lamps and glowing fire felicia verity uplifted her voice in somewhat agitated greeting she made no preliminary affectionate enquiriessuch as might have been expectedregarding her nieces outing or general wellbeing but darted not to say exploded into the declaration darling i am so exceedingly glad you werent at homemrs fraylings card this as the girl sat down on the sofa beside her then you know whos been here i didnt intend to see anyoneunless poor little theresabut no truly no one both hordle and mary were off dutyi ought not to have let them be away at the same time perhaps but i did feel they both needed a holiday dont you knowand either they had forgotten to give laura my orders or she lost her head or was talked over i daresay mrs frayling insisted henrietta is not easily turned from her purpose damaris said exactlya very few minutes conversation with her convinced me of that and so i felt it would be unfair to blame laura too severely i should suppose mrs frayling excessively clever in getting her own way poor lauraeven if she did know my orders she hadnt a chance not a chance damaris repeated once convalescence initiated youth speedily regains its elasticity and aunt felicia with her feathers ruffled aunt felicia upon the warpath thus presented a novel spectacle meriting observation evidently she and henrietta had badly clasheda nice little demon of diversion stirred within damaris for the first time for many days she felt amused excessively clever miss felicia continued without doubt the dear thing was finely worked up and though i hardly like to make such accusation none too scrupulous in her methods she leads you on with a number of irrelevant comments and questions until you find shes extracted from you a whole host of things you never meant to say she is far too inquisitivetoo possessive miss felicia ended on an almost violent note yes henrietta has a tiresome little habit of having been there first damaris said a touch of weariness in her tone remembering past encounters miss felicia caught by that warning tone patted her nieces rather undiscoverable kneeundiscoverable because still covered by a heavy furlined driving coatlovingly excitedly if you choose to believe her darling she cried which i for one emphatically dont following which ardent profession of faith or rather of scepticism miss felicia attempted to treat the subject broadly she soared to mountaintops of social and psychological astuteness but only to make hasty return upon her gentler self deny her strictures and snatch at the skirts of vanishing christian charity men arent so easily led away she hopefully declared nor can i think mrs frayling so irresistible to each and all as she wishes one to imagine she must magnify the number and still more the permanence of her conquests no doubt she has been very much admired i know she was lovely i saw her once ages ago at tullingworth dearest charles the words came softly as though her lips hesitated to pronounce them in so trivial a connectionasked me to call on her as i was staying in the neighbourhood she had a different surname then by the way i remember henrietta has had four in allcounting in her maiden name i mean exactly miss felicia argued and that no doubt does prejudice me a little against her i suppose it is wrong but when a woman marries so often one cant help feeling as if she ended by not being married at alla mere change of partners dont you know which does seem rather shocking it suggests such an absence of deep feelingpoor thing i dare say that is just her nature still it doesnt attract me in fact it gives me a creepbut i quite own she is pretty still and extraordinarily well dressedonly too well dressed dont you know that is for the countrymore tea darling yes mrs coopers scones are particularly good this afternooni wish i liked her better mrs frayling i mean because she evidently intends to be here a lot in future she expressed the warmest affection for you she was very possessive about you more i felt than shed any real right to be that im afraid put my back upthat and one or two other things she and general frayling think of settling in stourmouth for good if mr wace is appointed to the deadham curacy the curacy here damaris echoed a rather lurid light breaking in on her miss felicias glance was of timid slightly distressed enquiry yes she said mr wace has applied for the curacy he and general frayling were to have an interview with canon horniblow this afternoon they dropped mrs frayling here on their way to the vicarage and sent the fly back for her she talked a great deal about mr wace and his immense wish to come here she gave me to understand it was his one object to the speaker broke off raised her thin longfingered hands to her forehead i dont know she said but really i feel perhaps darling it is better to warn you she impliedoh she did it very cleverly really in a way charminglybut she implied that things had gone very hard with mr wace that winter at st augustin and that all he went through has remarkably developed and strengthened his characterthat it in fact was what determined him to take holy orders his difficulties melted before his real need for the support of religion it would have all been most touching if one had heard a story of such devotion from anyone butbut her about anyone but himunder the circumstances poor young manbecausedarlingwell because of you of me damaris stiffened yesthat is just the point mrs frayling left me in no doubt she was determined to make me understand just what mr waces attitude had been towards youand that it is still unchanged damaris got up pulled off her driving coat gloves and hat threw them upon the seat of a chair the act was symbolic she felt suffocated impelled to rid herself of every impediment for wasnt she confronted with another battlea worse one than that with the house namely a battle with her longago babylove and her fathers love toohenriettahenrietta so strangely powerful so amazingly persistenthenrietta who enclosed you in arms apparently so soft but furnished with suckers octopus arms adhering never letting you go she had played with the idea of this intrusion of henriettas and its effect upon miss felicia at first as something amusing it ceased to be amusing it frightened her and my attitude is unchanged too she said presently gravely proud i didnt want to marry marshall wace then i was dreadfully sorry when henrietta told me he cared for me i dont want to marry him or have him care for me one bit more now i think it very interfering of henrietta to trouble you with this it is not the moment she might at least have waited so i felt miss felicia put in she watched her niece anxiously as the latter went across to the fireplace and stood her back to the room looking down into the glowing logs for she hador rather ought she not to haveanother communication to make which involved the fighting of a battle on her own account not against henrietta frayling still less against damaris but against herself it trembled on the tip of her tongue she felt impelled yet sorrowed to utter it hence her wishes and purposes jostled one another being tenderly bravely heroically even contradictory in speaking she invited the shattering of a dream of personal election to happinessa late blossoming happiness and hence the more entrancing the more pathetic that any hope of the dreams fulfilment was fragile as glass lighter than gossamer the veriest shadow of a shade her natural diffidence and sane sense alike convinced her for this very cause the dream being of the sweetest and most intimate how gladly would she have cherished the enchanting foolishness of it a trifle longerher act of heroism would earn no applause moreover would pass practically unnoticed no one would be aware of her sacrifice she would only gain the satisfaction of knowing she had done the perfectly right and generous thing by two persons who would never share that knowledgeshe blushedheaven forbid they ever should share itand thank her mrs fraylingi dont want miss felicia stopped what dont you wantthis from damaris over her shoulder the pause being prolonged to set you against her darling i think damaris said i know all about henrietta she insinuates so much miss felicia lamentedor seems to do so one grows wretchedly suspicious of her meaning perhaps i exaggerate and misjudge hershe is quite confusingly adroit but i extremely disliked the way in which she spoke of colonel carteret damaris bent a little forward holding her skirt back from the scorch of the fire her eyes still downcast how did she speak of him oh all she said was very indirectbut as though he had not played quite fair with her on some occasion andits odious to repeatas if that was his habit with women and with unmarried girls as wellas if he was liable to behave in a way which placed them in a rather invidious position while he just shuffled out of all responsibility himself she hinted his staying on with us here was a case in pointthat it might give people a wrong idea altogether that in shortat least thinking it over i feel sure this is the impression she meant to convey to methat he is indulging his chronic love of philandering at your expense and thereby standing in the light of serious lovers such as marshall wace after a moment damaris added is that your idea of colonel carteret aunt felicia ah no indeed no the poor lady cried with rather anguished sincerity then making a fine effort over herself least of all where you are concerned my darling and she drifted hastily on to her feet the curtains were still undrawn and through the window opposite she caught sight of a tall figure coming up across the lawn in the frosty twilight pardon me if i run away ive forgotten a note i meant to send to poor little theresa bilsoni must let laura have it at once or she maynt catch the postman she said with equal rapidity and apparent inconsequence as felicia verity passed out into the hall at one end of the avenue of stumpy pillars carteret came in at the other end through the garden door he halted a moment dazzled by the warmth and light within after the clairobscure of the frosty dusk without and looked round the room before recognizing the identity of its remaining occupant then ah youdear witch he said so youre home and what of your drive damaris turned round all of a piece her hands white against the black the fingers slightly apart still pressed back the skirt of her dress as though saving it from the fire scorch in quaintly careful childish fashion her complexion was that of a child too in its soft brightness and the wonder of her great eyes fairly challenged carterets wits a babe of a thousand years he quoted to himself does that look grow out of a root of divine innocence or of quite incalculable wisdom i told you if you would be patient with me i should begin again i have begun again dear colonel sahib so i perceive he answered her is it written so large she asked curiously very large he said falling in with her humour and where does the beginning lead to i wish youd tell mehenrietta has begun again too i know it he said our incomparable henrietta overtook me on her way from here to the vicarage and bestowed her society on me for the better part of half an hour she was in astonishing form carteret came forward and stood on the tiger skin beside damaris mrs fraylings conversation had given him very furiously to think and his thoughts had not proved by any means exhilarating does this recrudescence of our henrietta her beginning again affect the scope and direction of your own beginning again dearest witch he presently enquired in singularly restrained and colourless accents that depends a good deal upon youdoesnt it colonel sahib our maiden gravely answered carteret felt as though she dealt him a blow the pain was numbing he could neither see nor could he think clearly but he traced mrs fraylings hand in this and could have cursed her elaboratelyhad it been worth while but was anything worth while just now he inclined to believe notso called himself a doating fool and then though tormented shaken turned his mind to making things easy for damaris oh i see that he told her and now you have got hold of your precious little self again and made a start its easy enough to manage your affairsin as far as they need any management of minefrom a distance this beginning again is triumphant i congratulate you youre your own best physician you know how to treat your case to a marvel so i abdicate but why why abdicate do you mean go away then henrietta was right what she said was true i never believed her i damaris grew tall in her shame and anger the solemn eyes blazed yespray go she said its unwarrantable the way i kept you herethe way ive made use of you but indeed indeed i am very grateful colonel sahib i ought to have known better but i didnt i have been so accustomed all my life to your help that i took it all for granted i never thought how much i taxed your forbearance or encroached on your timethat isnt quite true though i did have scruples but little things you said and did put my scruples to sleep i liked having them put to sleepnow you must not let me or my business interfere any moreoh youve treated me given to me like a prince she declared rising superior to anger and to shame her eyes shininglike a king nobody can ever take your place or be to me what youve been i shall always love to think of your goodness toto himmy fatherand to mealwaysall my life damaris held out her hands and thats allnow let us say no more about this its difficult it hurts us both i fancy a little but carteret did not take her proffered hands dear witch he said weve spoken so freely that i am afraid we must speak more freely stilleven though it pains you a little perhaps and myself almost certainly very much more i love younot as a friend not as an amiable elderly person should love a girl of your agethis isnt an affair of yesterday or the day before yesterday you crept into my heart on your sixth birthdaywasnt itwhen i brought you a certain little green jade elephant from our incomparable henrietta and found you asleep in a black marble chair set on a bloodred sandstone platform overlooking the gardens of the club at bhutpur and you have never crept out of it againwont do so as long as body and mind hang together or after it has been a song of degreesfor years you were to me a delicious plaything but a plaything with a mysterious soul after which i felt every now and again in worship and awe the plaything stage came to an end when i was here with you before we went to paris four years ago for i found then beyond all question of doubt that i loved you as a man only loves once and as most men never love at all i have tried to keep this from you because i have no right to burden your youth with my middleage carteret smiled at her it has not been altogether easy to hold my peace dearest witch he said the seven devils of desireof which you knew nothing bless youim not sure that i do know nothing damaris put in quietly she looked him over from head to heel and the wonder of her great eyes deepened it isnt wrong she said brokenly hoarsely i dont think it can be wrong then you will be good to my brother to darcy faircloth and let me see him quite quite often and lastly her lips trembling it is beautiful more beautiful than i ever knew about to have you for quite my own colonel sahib
