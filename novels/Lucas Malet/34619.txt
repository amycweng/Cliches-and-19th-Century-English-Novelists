new york dodd mead company copyright by dodd mead and company university press john wilson and son cambridge usa preface what is the book according to the japanese pronunciation of the chinese characters of the title we call it mumonkwan which means the gateless barrier it is one of the books especially studied by the zen sect or the sect of dhyana a peculiarity of some of the dhyana textsthis story being a good exampleis that they are not explanatory they only suggest questions are put but the student must think out the answers for himself he must think them out but not write them you know that dhyana represents human effort to reach through meditation zones of thought beyond the range of verbal expression and any thought narrowed into utterance loses all dhyana quality well this story is supposed to be true but it is used only for a dhyana question lafcadio hearn exotics and retrospectives pages the gateless barrier i laurence leaned his arms upon the broad wooden handrail of the bulwarks the water hissed away from the side immediately below it was laced by shifting patterns of white foam and stained pale green violet and amber by the light shining out through the rounds of the portpoles further away it showed blue black but for a glistening on the hither side of the vast ridge and furrow the smoke from the funnels streamed afar and was upturned by a following wind the great ship swung in the trough and then liftedas a horse lifts at a fencewhile the seas slid away from under her keel as she lifted her masts raked the blueblack night sky and the stars danced in the rigging this was the first time since his marriage nearly two years before that laurence found himself alone and altogether his own master his marriage was a notable successevery one said so and he himself had never doubted the fact so far yet this solitary voyage this temporary return to bachelorhood possessed compensations he reproached himself as in duty bound for being sensible of those compensations he excused himself to himself he gave reasons doubtless his present sense of freedom and content took its rise not in his enforced absence from virginia from her bright continuous talk her innumerable and perfectly constructed dresses her perpetual and skilful activities but in his escape from the highly artificial and materialised society in which she lived and moved and had her being laurence had certainly no ostensible cause of complaint against that society its members had recited his verses given a charming performance of his little comedyin the interests of a deserving charityquoted his opinions on literature and politics and waxed enthusiastic over his strokes at golf and his style at rackets and polo he had in fact been the spoilt child of two new york winters and two newport summers no englishman he was repeatedly assured had ever been so popular among the smart set of the great republic it had petted and feted him and finally given him one of its fairest daughters to wife and for all this laurence rivers was sincerely grateful his vanity was most agreeably flattered his natural love both of pleasing and of pleasure was well satisfied yetsuch is the perversity of human naturethe very completeness of his success tended to lessen the worth of it he even questioned at moments whether that success did not offer the measure of surrounding immaturity of taste and judgment rather than of the greatness of his personal talent and merit he was haunted by the conviction that he had never yet given his best the highest and strongest of his nature either in thought or art or adventure or evenperhapshe feared itin love the demand had been for a thoroughly presentable and immediately marketable article and the best is usually far from marketable often but doubtfully presentable either it followed that laurence had almost of necessity kept the best of himself to himselfkept it to himself so effectually that he had come uncommonly near forgetting its existence altogether and letting it perish for lack of air and exercise now leaning his arms upon the handrail of the bulwarks while the stars danced in the rigging and the great ship ploughed her way eastward across the mighty ridge and furrow of the atlantic gratified vanity ceased to obtain in him his thoughts travelled back to periods of his career at once more obscure and more ambitiousto the few vital raptures the few fine failures the few illuminating aspirations which he had known the bottom dropped out of the social side of things so to speak he looked below superficial appearances into the heart of it all life put off its cheap frippery of fancy dress death its cunningly devised concealments and evasions backed by the immensities of sea and sky both stood before him naked and unashamed in all their primitive and eternal vigour their uncompromising actuality their inviolable mystery while with a sudden and searching apprehension of the profound import of the question rivers asked himself what shall it profit a manwhat in good truthif he gain the whole world and lose his own soul he had been summoned to england by the illness of an uncle whose estates and considerable wealth he would inherit that illness had been pronounced incurable but the approaching death of this near relation made small demand upon his intimate feelings a decent seriousness of thought and speech concerning the impending event were all that could reasonably be required of him for the elder mr rivers was both morose and eccentric and had given his nephew a handsome allowance on the express understanding that he saw as little of him as possible a declared misogynist he had received the announcement of laurences proposed marriage with an exasperating mixture of contempt and approval i am sincerely sorry for you he had written on this occasion the more so that you appear to labour under the impression that the step you have in contemplation is calculated to secure your happiness this you must pardon my remarking is obviously absurd i grant that you are under a moral obligation to perpetuate our family and secure the succession to our estates in the direct line i cannot therefore but be glad that you should adopt the recognised means to attain the above ends i should however respect both your motives and your intelligence more highly had you done this in a rational and scientific spirit without indulgence in sentimental illusions which every sane student of human history has long since perceived to be as pernicious to the moral as they are enervating to the mental health i could say much worthy of your attention upon this point but in your present condition of emotional inebriation it would be a waste of energy on my parti might add a throwing of pearls before swine still justice my dear laurence compels me to own that even so i must ever consider myself in a measure your debtor since the fact of your existence your remarkably sound physical condition your normal and slightly unintelligent outlook on life have combined to relieve me of the odious necessity of sacrificing my time and my personal liberty to the interests of our family by entering into those domestic relations which you appear to regard with as much thoughtless complacency as i with reasoned repulsion and distrust this being the attitude of the elder mr riverss mind it followed that when by his request mr wormald the family solicitor summoned his nephew and heir to attend his deathbed the young mans wife was not included in that gloomy invitation and this laurence could not by any means honestly regret virginia at a disadvantage was an idea almost inconceivable yet so immediate and concrete a being would not he felt shade quite gracefully into the mortuary landscape she would not suit it neither would it suit her for she was almost amazingly in harmony with her modern mundane environment and save in the way of costly mourning costumes it seemed incredible that death should have any dominion over her it struck him moreover that if he gauged the position aright virginia notwithstanding her many charms and much cleverness would have to take a back seat in his eccentric uncles establishment and virginia in a back seat was again an idea almost inconceivable so he said its an awful nuisance to have to leave you like this but this is going to be a pretty dismal bit of business anyhow id much better just worry through it alone youll join me later when its all over and we are free to take possession and knock the place in shape stoke rivers is really rather delightful though it is not very large there used to be some good pictures and books and things in it i remember i believe my uncle is a virtuoso in his way though he is such a crossgrained old chap youll enjoy the place at all events for a few months every year i think virginia and you can have all your own people over in turn you know and show them how the savage english do it in their savage little island youll make the neighbourhood sit up i fancy itll be amusing but as laurence leaned his arms upon the broad handrail of the bulwarks in the chill of the march night while the water hissed away from the side and the engines drummed and pounded and the bows of the great ship lifted against the far blueblack horizon he began to wonder whether he had not been somewhat over hasty in proposing chronic invasion of stoke rivers by all virginias smart friends in turn they were wellbred hospitable amusing very much uptodate he owed them thanks for a most uncommonly good time but they seemed a trifle thin a trifle superficial and ephemeral just now in face of the immensities of ocean and sky and of the ancient mysteries of life and death ii not until after dinner on the evening of his arrival was laurence admitted to his uncles presence the aspect of the room was rich though sombre long in proportion to its width with a low heavilymoulded ceiling the walls of it were panelled in black oak three parts of their height the space between the top of the panelling and the cornice was hung with dark blue silkdamask narrow diagonal lines of yellow crossing the background of the raised pattern the short full curtains drawn over the wide window were of the same handsome material so were the counterpane and hangings of the halftester ebony bed this last was elaborately carved two couchant sphinxes the polished surface of whose cuplike breasts glowed in the firelight supported the footboard as did a couple of caryatidesnaked to the loinsthe canopy near the fireplace stood an oaken table on which lay a few wellbound books the further end of it was covered by a cloth of gold and crimson embroideryevidently fashioned from some priestly vestmentupon which rested a memento mori about four inches in height cut out of a solid block of rock crystal the olive crown which encircled the brow being of pale green jade in a deepseated highbacked armchairplaced between the table and the outstanding pillars of the chimney piecepropped up by dark silken pillows his spare frame wrapped in a long furlined violet cloth dressinggown a violet velvet skullcap on his head sat mr rivers laurence who had not seen his uncle for the last five or six years was conscious of receiving an almost painfully vivid impression at once of physical feebleness and intellectual energy the elder mans face and hands appeared transparent as the crystal memento mori on the table beside him his long straight nose showed thin as a knife his wide lipless mouth seemed to shut with a spring like a trap the bone of the face and hands was salient as of one suffering starvation yet the bluegrey eyes though sunk in their cavernous sockets were brilliant alert full of an almost malevolent greed of observation laurence noted that a spotless cleanliness and order pervaded the room and the person of its occupant the angular and attenuated face was shaven with scrupulous nicety the fingernails were carefully polished and pointed an open collar and wristbands of fine lawn showed exquisitely white against the purple cloth and fur of the dressinggown it was evident that mr rivers whatever the peculiarities of his temper or of his opinions treated illness and approaching dissolution with an admirable effect of stoicism and personal dignity as laurencehimself conspicuously wellgroomed in evening dress no mark of his long journey upon him save in a complexion tanned by sun and seawind and by the directness of glance and vigour of movement that remains for a while by every true sealover after he comes ashorecrossed the space between the door and fireplace the old man raised himself a little in his chair believe me i am very sensible of the consideration you show in so immediately gratifying my desire to see you my dear laurence i was very happy to come sir the younger man answered but he was not unconscious of a point of irony in the cold level tones of the voice or in the persistent scrutiny of the brilliant eyes these appeared to regard him as they might some row of figuresmentally casting up subtracting dividing intent on arriving with all possible despatch at a conclusive and final result the effect was not precisely encouraging nor were the words which followed that is well mr rivers said but it is desirable you should understand from the outset that which you have undertaken you may be detained here the disease from which i suffer is as you have been informed incurable though it is i am happy to say neither offensive or infectious but though the final result is assured the moment of its advent is uncertain neither i nor the physicians who amiably expend their limited and somewhat empirical skill upon me can determine the date at which this disease will prove fatal i shall regret to cause you inconvenience but the event is beyond my control i may keep you waiting the longer the better sir laurence said smiling and his smile was sincere and genial of the sort which inspires confidencethat is he added if you do not suffer unduly when the mind has realised the greatness of its own powers and trained itself to their exercise the will can almost invariably reduce suffering to endurable proportions mr rivers replied contemptuously as dealing with a matter obvious and so beneath discussion he raised one transparent hand pointed towards a chair and then let his wrist drop again upon a supporting silken cushion as he did so the two heavy rings he woreone an amethyst set in brilliants and engraved with arabic characters the other a black scarab on a hoop of rough goldslipped up the long phalange of his second finger to the knotted knuckle and back again with a dry rattle and chink oblige me by sitting down laurence he said i wish you to labour under no misapprehension as to my intentions in sending for you a certain amount of business may need attention but all that you can discuss with my agent armstronga very worthy though prejudiced person my affairs are in order i am not called upon to waste any of the time remaining to me upon them let me explain myself the diseasefor to do so i must refer to it once againwhich is in process of destroying certain organs and consequently paralysing certain functions of my body has in no degree affected my mind this retains the completeness of its lucidity indeed i am disposed to believe that my enforced physical inactivity and the small number of objects presented to my sighti never leave this roomtend to exalt and stimulate my intellectual powers you recall the legend of the ancient philosopher who plucked out his eyes that undisturbed by the vision of irrelevant objects he might attain to greater concentration of thought disease in limiting my activities has gone far to confer upon me the boon which the philosopher in question strove rather violently to bestow upon himself i have ever been a student i propose to continue so to the last my interest is unabated my passion for knowledgethe sole passion of my liferemains in full force laurence sat listening nursing his knee the speakers attitude was impressive in a way admirable his detachment his calm his acumen commanded his hearers respect yes yes i seethats fine laurence said under his breath a slightly ironical expression passed across the elder mans attenuated face i am of course glad that my sentiments meet with your approval but i fear that approval may prove premature i have not yet fully explained myself laurence smiled at him goodtemperedly all right sir im listening he said i must frankly admit i did not require your presence with a view to having you endorse my opinions these are i trust too much the outcome of close and lengthened thought to stand in need of support from the agreement of another mind i have never desired disciples having the evidence of the history of all great religious political and scientific movements to prove conclusively that it is the invariable habit of the disciple to falsify his masters teaching to attach himself to the weak rather than the strong places of such teaching to betray intellectually with some emotional some hysterical kiss the disciple resembles those parasitic plants of the tropic forests that strangle the tree upon which they climb upward toward the air and light he paused a moment turned his head against the pillows with a movement of almost distressing weakness then gathering himself together by a perceptible exercise of will he looked searchingly at laurence again and resumed his speech nor have i required your presence here during these last days or weeksas the case may bewith a view to offering to you or receiving from you that which is usually termed affection i am not aware of any demand or supply in myself of that very much overrated commodity i deny the actuality indeed of its existence subjected to analysis it can always be resolved into workings of selfinterest or into the gratification more or less gross of the animal passions it is the generator of all the practical folly and intellectual sloth which go to retard the progress of science and the rule of high philosophy among men as between ourselves my dear laurence any pretence of affection would be transparently ridiculous we are barely acquainted my departure will very clearly be to your advantage moreover our tastes and characters are so divergent that any real community of interests any real bond of sympathy is clearly out of the question during the course of this address the young mans pleasant smile had broadened almost to the point of laughter i understand i really do understand he said and now that weve cleared the decks for action in this very comprehensive manner i growif i may mention itmost uncommonly curious to learn what you did send for me here for i sent for you because there is one matter regarding which my information is conspicuously defective and because your conversation your habits your very appearance and gestures may serve to enlighten me i have lived among books and objects of art of no mean value i have enjoyed communion both by letter and in speech with many of the most distinguished minds of the present century but i never associated i have never cared to associate with the average man of the world of the clubs and the racecourse the man of intrigues of in short society he appeared to me to weigh too lightly in the scale to be a worthy object of study i ignored him and in so doing dropped an important link out of the chain of being for these persons breed they perpetuate tendencies they influence and modify the history of the race not to reckon with such persons is not to reckon with a persistent and active factor in intellectual and moral evolution laurence had risen to his feet he stood with his hands behind him and his back to the fire he was amused but he was also slightly nettled ah he said exactly and so you sent for me you took for granted i was that sort you wanted to see how we do it yes mr rivers answered it did appear to me that you were calculated to fulfil the conditions in any case you were the only example of the type available our connection by blood and the relation in which you stand to my property gave me certain claims upon your time and your consideration i wish very much to observe you i wish to study you from the psychological and other points of view you need not attempt to assist me be yourself please be passive i need no cooperation on the part of my subject this will really give you very little trouble while it will afford me interesting occupation during the periodwhether short or protracted i know notwhich must elapse before disease has run its course and procured dissolution laurence listened in silence and while he did so he ceased to be nettled he ceased even to be inclined to treat these singular proposals humorously for there appeared to him a certain pathos in the earnest desire of this recluse and student now at the eleventh hour to acquaint himself with just that which he had so arrogantly despised namely the commonplace it was slightly wounding to personal vanity to be thus selected from among the millions of mankind as a fine thoroughpaced example and exponent of the commonplace but laurence was kindhearted he also possessed a fund of practical philosophy nodecidedly the position was not a flattering one yet it was rather original and moreover how could one in common charity refuse any little pleasure to a dying man very well sir he said i think i quite grasp the necessities of the inquiry im quite willing to be operated on and i promise to play fair and not let the evidence be faked but im afraid youll get bored first i am likely to be more illuminated than illuminating i am obliged to you mr rivers said tonight i will not further detain you pray give any orders you please to renshaw he is a welltrained and responsible servant there are horses in the stable goodnight i repeat that i am obliged to you iii finding it unlikely that his uncle would ask for him before evening and that consequently he had plenty of time at his disposal laurence embarked after breakfast upon a survey of the house when a boy at school he had occasionally passed a couple of nights at stoke rivers his recollections of these visits were not gay he had been glad enough to go away again it followed that his impressions of the house itself were vague and confused he now found that it was constructed in the shape of a capital l reversed the base of the letter facing east and west contained kitchens offices and servants quarters the main buildingat right angles to itwas two stories in height and consisted of suites of handsome rooms opening on to a wide corridor the windows of the latter looked south those of the rooms north the colouring and furnishings resembled in the main those of mr rivers bedroom dark panelled walls rich sombre hangings of dark blue crimson or violet obtained throughout in the drawingrooms were some noble landscapes by cuyp ruysdael and other dutch masters of note there was also an admirable collection of italian ivories small figures of exquisite workmanship and several glass cases containing fine antique and renaissance gems the walls of the libraries were lined with booksa curious and varied collection ranging from ancient blackletter volumes down to the latest german treatise on natural science or metaphysics of the current year laurence promised himself to make nearer acquaintance with these rather weighty joys at a more convenient season meanwhile in contrast to the otherwise distinctly oldfashioned character of the house he remarked a very complete installation of electric light and an ingenious system of hotair ventilation by means of which a temperature of over seventy degrees was maintained throughout the whole interior this produced a heavy and enervating atmosphere of which laurencefresh from the strong clean air of the atlanticbecame increasingly and disagreeably sensible it made him at once restless and inert and as he wandered rather aimlessly from room to room he was annoyed by finding a slight nervousness gained on himhe whose nerves were usually of the steadiest happily conspicuous by their absence indeed rather than by their presence upon my word this beats the american abomination of steam heat he said to himself his visit to the library where the smell of old leather bindings added to the deadness of the air nearly finished him he went out on to the corridor and paced the length of it past the flying staircase of black oak leading to the upper corridor and back again a broad strip of deeppile crimson carpet was spread along the centre of the polished floor on one hand between the doors of the livingrooms hung a collection of valuable copperplate engravings representing classic ruins in italy and greece while on the other in the spaces between the windows were ranged a series of bustsaugustus tiberias nero the two antonines caligula and commodusset on tall columnar pedestals of dark green or yellow marble the blind sculptured faces deepened the general sense of oppression by their rigidity their unalterable and somewhat scornful repose out of doors the march morning was tumultuous with wind and wet offering marked contrast to the dry heat the almost burdensome order and stillness reigning within the air of the corridor was perhaps a degree fresher than that of the library he had just quitted laurence leaned his arms on a stone windowsill and glanced in a desultory way at the days times which he had picked up off the hall table in passing but chinese railway concessions plague reports from bombay even the last racing fixtures or rumours of fighting on the northwest indian frontier failed to arouse his interest in his present humour these items of news from the outside world seemed curiously unimportant and remote he stared at the wide wellwooded rainblurred landscape the scene at which he had assisted last night the intimate drama moving forward relentlessly even now to its close in that wellappointed room upstairsand the extraordinary character of the chief actor in that dramahis overstimulated brain and atrophied affections his greed of experiment and of acquiring information even yet in the very article of deathdepressed laurences imagination as the close atmosphere depressed his body it was all so painfully narrow barren hungry joyless somehow and meanwhile he laurence was required to play the foolnot for the provocation of laughter which would after all have had a semblance of cheerful goodfellowship in it but in cold blood as an object lesson in the manner and customs of the average man a lesson the result of which would be tabulated and pigeonholed by that unwearying intelligence as might be the habits of some species of obscure unpleasant insect the young man had developed slight intolerance of the exclusively worldly side of things lately it seemed by no means improbable he might develop equal intolerance of the exclusively intellectual side before long at this rate i seem qualifying as a pastmaster in the highly unprofitable act of quarrelling with my bread and butter he said to himself if i chuck society and proceed to chuck brains as well for a man like myself without genius and without a profession what the devil is there left meditating thus he had left his station at the window and walked to the extreme end of the corridor farthest away from the servants wing of the house it was closed by a splendid tapestry curtain whereon a crowd of roundlimbed cupids drove a naked and reluctant woman with gestures of naughty haste towards a satyr seated beneath a shadowy grove of trees upon a little monticule who beckoned with one hand while with the other he stopped the notes of his reed pipe the tapestry was of great beauty and indubitable worth but the subject of it was slightly displeasing to laurence a trifle gross in suggestion as had been the sphinxes and caryatides of the carven ebony bed oh of course theres that sort of thing left he said to himself recurring to his recent train of thought but no thank you i flatter myself i can hardly find satisfaction in those low latitudes at present having however an appreciation of all fine artistic work he laid hold of the border of the curtain wishing to feel its texture to his surprise it was of very great weight padded and lined with leather as are curtains covering the doors of certain roman churches laurence pulled the corner of it towards him and passed behind it the curtain fell back into position with a muffled thud leaving him standing in a narrow dark cupboardlike space closed by a door of which it took him some stifling seconds to find the handle he fumbled blindly in the dark an almost childish sense of agitation upon him he felt as in dreams when the place to be traversed grows more and more contracted walls closing down and in on every hand while the means of exit become more maddeningly impossible of discovery to his surprise he turned faint and broke into a sweat it was not in the least an amusing experience at last the handle gave with a click and the door opened disclosing a large and lofty room quite unlike any one which he had yet visited it was delicately fresh both in atmosphere and colouring it wore a gracious and friendly look seeming to welcome the intruder with a demure gladsomeness a certain gaiety pervaded it even on this unpropitious morning the great baywindow facing east gave upon a stately italian garden beyond the tall cypresses white statues and fountains of which spread flat highlying lawns of brilliantly green turf these were crossed by a broad walk of golden gravel leading to an avenue of enormous limetrees the domed heads of which were just touched with the rosepink buds of the opening spring the furniture of the room was of satinwood highly polished and painted with garlands of roses truelovers knots of blue ribbon dainty landscapes ladies and lovers after the manner of boucher the chairs and sofas were upholstered in brocade the predominating colours of which were white pale yellow and pale pink an oldfashioned square semigrand pianothe case of it in satinwood and painted like the reststood out into the room on a spindlelegged table beside it lay a quantity of music the printing very black the pages brown with age close against these was a violin case covered with faded red velvet on which were stamped initials and a crest laurences eyes dwelt on these things and thensurely there should be a harp in the further lefthand corner the strings of it covered by a gilded stamped leather hood yes it was there right enoughand a tall escritoire with a miniature brass balustrade running along the top of it should stand at right angles to the chimneypiece upon which last doubled by the lookingglass behind should be tall azure and gold sevres jars an empire clockthe golden face of it set in a ring of precious garnetsfigures in chelsea china and branched gold candlesticks laurence looked for and found these objects a prey at once to surprise and to a sense of happy familiarity he was perfectly acquainted with this roombut why or how he knew not he was filled too by a singular sense of expectation it was to him as though some exquisite presence had but lately quitted this apartment and might at any instant return to it he apprehended something tenderly delectably feminine the china ornaments and many little fanciful silver toys spoke of a womans taste so did a tambour frame and an ivory workbox the lid of it open disclosing dainty property of gold thimble scissors cottons and what notand a halffinished frill of cobweblike india muslin a little goldeyed needle sticking in the mimic hem on the small table beside the workbox lay a white vellumbound copy of the vita nuova of dante and the introduction to the devout life of st francis de sales perplexed by his own sensations possessed too by a sudden gentle reverence and longing which he could not explain laurence touched the pretty trifles in the workbox fitted the thimble on the tip of his little finger turned the pages of the dante and read how the poet came near swooning at first sight of the maiden of eight years old whom though she was never destined to be his mistress or wife he loved ever after and made immortal in immortal verse he unlocked the worn redvelvet violin case and drew the bownot for the first timehe could have sworn notacross the wailing strings what did it all mean yes what indeedin the name of commonsense of new york and newport of his golf and polo and cotillions of crowded operahouse and shouting racecourse in the name too of those hard brilliant dying eyes and that cold hungry intellect upstairs what did it mean he had no recollection of having been into this room on his former visits to stoke rivers in his boyhood and yet of course he must have been hereotherwise but then this overmastering sense of expectation this apprehension of an exquisite feminine presence this upon my word im playing the fool to some purpose he said half aloud he crossed the room threw wide the french window and went onto the head of the semicircular flight of stone steps without the wind buffeted him roughly the rain spattered in his face on the left the lawns were divided from the downward slope of rough park and woodland by a sunk fence beyond was outspread an extensive tract of rolling wooded countryred and white hamlets half buried among trees here and there the spire of a village church flat green pastures lying along the valleys brown patches of hopgarden and ploughland and uplifted against the grey stormdrifted horizon a windmill crowning some conspicuous height suddenly the cry of hounds running saluted laurences ear then the whole pack breaking covert crossed the open park the field followed horses pulling riders leaning forward squaring their shoulders to the winda flash of scarlet chestnut black and bay behind the dappled joy of the racing pack for a moment the strange influences of this strange day made even the merry hunt appear to laurence as the pageant of an uneasy dream but soon the honest outdoor life claimed him again forcing him back upon unquestioned realities he closed the french window behind him stood on the wet steps spending some anxious moments in the lighting of a cigar and then strolled hatless round to the stables to make inquiry as to what his uncle might own in the matter of horseflesh iv in the afternoon laurence drove over to bishops pudbury some eight miles distant from stoke rivers an english soldierby name bellinghamwhom he had known in new york and who had married a miss van renan a cousin of virginiahad taken a house there for the hunting season his wife had impressed upon laurence the duty of making an early call on these connectionshe being the bearer of certain gifts to a small daughter of the family virginias godchild a revulsion in favour of the ordinary ways of ordinary modern life in favour indeed of that very commonplace of which last evening he had supposed himself so unwilling an exponent was upon him he wanted to get in with his accustomed habits his accustomed outlook again the last twentyfour hours had been somewhat of a strain and laurence was as lazy as are most healthy englishmen he hated energising specially of the superinduced involuntary sort and mrs bellinghams society would be helpful she was an agreeable woman of this world worldly he could have a good square gossip with her she was possessed moreover of a cult for virginiafor her beauty her clothes her social ability and in the back of his mind somehow laurence was conscious that it would be an excellent thing for him to hear virginias praises sounded loudly mrs bellingham would count his blessings to him that recital would be at once humbling and bracingaltogether salutary but unfortunately neither the lady nor her husband were at home so he could but deposit virginias immaculate parcels tied with flaring bows of amber ribbon and drive homeward through the rolling sussex countrynow engulfed in its deep narrow lanes now climbing its breezy wooded hills catching glimpses of the smooth open downs ranging away to beachy head and of the grey turmoil of the dirty channel sea all this was not very exciting it must be owned but it afforded him relief from the singular sensations he had experienced during the morning he came into the house in excellent spirits bringing the clean chill of the march evening along with himcame in to meet the same dry dead atmosphere the same dark glossy walls and rich sombre colours the same at once unemotional yet almost voluptuous suggestion from objects of art a lonely dinner followed admirably served by two silent middleaged menservants their faces were sallow and without expression their manner was correct to the point of absolute nullity of character they moved as automata the dinner itself was a little chefdoeuvre and was served on remarkably handsome silver plate as centrepiece three dancing female figures in silvergiltcopied apparently from those on some etruscan vasesupported a cutglass bowl in which floated fantastic orchids some mottled dull browngreen toadlike some in long sprays of mauve or tigercolour striped with glossy black these last gave off a thick musky scent towards the end of the meal renshaw the butler delivered a note to him which laurence read not without kindly amusement it was from the curateinchargethe rector of stoke rivers preferring to dwell amid the social excitements of cheltenham and but rarely on the plea of bad health visiting the parish laurence judged the curateincharge to be a very young man his letter ran thus dear siri trust i am not presuming upon my official connection with this parish by hastening to express to you the great relief which i feel in learning that you have arrived at the courthouse as representative of the incumbent of this parish i hold myself responsible for the spiritual welfare of all persons resident in it whether of exalted or humble station i have therefore suffered much anxiety regarding your uncles mr rivers spiritual condition in his present very serious state of health i know that his views are regrettably latitudinarian and that his attitude is far from conciliatory towards the church these sad facts however far from relieving me of responsibility only increase it i would so gladly read and pray with him and reason with him of those things necessary to salvation the time permitted him may i understand be short it is my duty first to warn and then to console i cannot reproach myself with negligence in calling at the courthouse i do so regularly three times a week unhappily mr rivers is persistent in his refusal to receive me this is not only very shocking as precluding the possibility of my offering either the warnings or consolations of religion to the invalid but it injuriously affects my position with my parishioners who seeing me thus slighted by the principal landowner in the parish show a painful disposition to treat my ministrations with levity and my person with disrespect i trust to your sense of justice to obtain my admittance to the sickroom both in the interests of your uncles eternal welfare and in those of the church of which i am a humble but i trust efficient ministeri have the honour to remain dear sir yours obediently walter samuel beal laurence finished his glass of claret and his cigarette with a smile he sat a minute or two gazing at the dancing golden figures and at the rather malign loveliness of the orchids poor little padre sahib he said to himself ill go and see him tomorrow and do my best to quiet his worthy conscience funny mixture of soul and of self in that letter but hes very much too mild a daniel to fling into the lions den upstairs he little imagines what hes asking well he wont get it anyhow so that doesnt much matter pahhow hot this room is laurence rose from the table folded up the letter and put it in his pocket now for processes of vivisection its the most original fashion of paying succession duty i ever heard of my word if i ever do come into possession wont i just open the windows in this house v the conversation that evening did not move very smoothly laurence brought all the good temper and practical philosophy at his command into play but the elder man was captious his blank scepticism his keen unsparing statements jarred on his companion an inclination towards revolt arose in laurence i am half afraid sir he permitted himself to say at last while his eyes rested on the gleaming breasts of the ebony sphinxesthat we have made a radical mistake and put the cart before the horse to understand the average man and his relation to things in general must not you begin with the study of the average woman is not cherchez la femme after all the keynote of our inquiry mr rivers raised his thin hand almost as in warning and the heavy fingerrings chinked as he let it fall again on the arm of his chair the subject of sex in connection with human beings is distasteful to me he said laurence glanced at the speaker and then back at the carven sphinx again his eyes were a little merryhe could not help it oh no doubt he said there are times when it is distasteful to many of us and most infernally inconvenient into the bargain only you see unluckily it is the pivot on which the whole history of the race turns a most objectionable pivot an insult to the intellect a degradation that may be so laurence answered still the thing is therealways has been always will be modern science notwithstanding unless humanity agrees to voluntary and universal suicide a consummation which does not seem immediately probable in any casemale and female created he them an error perhaps of judgment but one the creator has never shown much sign of wishing to correct as yet the most venerable religious systems recognise this i need not remind you that it lies at the heart of their mysteries christianity toocatholic christianitythe only form that is of christianity worth considering seriouslyacknowledges the profound significance of it in the worship of the divine motherhood and the perpetually renewed miracle of the incarnation you interest me mr rivers said slowly i am glad of that laurence answered he had warmed up unexpectedly to his subject i am glad of that for i cant help seeing mr rivers interrupted him pardon me he said i would not have you labour even temporarily under a misapprehension it is less your exposition that interests me than yourself i note indications of thought and feeling for which i was not wholly prepared taking you as a fair example of the type i perceive that the mind of the average member of society is of an even lower order than i had supposed i had in my ignorance imagined that even in the class to which you belong modern scientific ideas had taken sufficient root to oust such effete superstitions as those to which you have alluded a more or less stupid agnosticism an utter indifference would not have surprised me from such a condition development is still possible but here i recognise traces of a return to fetich worship to savage standardsthis indeed is hopeless a degeneration from which revival is impossible i admit of course the necessity of the existence of woman since the perpetuation of the race appears at present desirable it would be childish to argue the matter she must be kept and cared for by qualified persons as are the other higher domestic animals but but but laurence said laughing i must protest perhaps his type of mind is too low for yours to be able to stoop to it but upon my word sir even with so thoroughpaced a specimen as myself before you you have not grasped the characteristics of the average man one bit i dont say we are conspicuously noble or virtuous or godly creatures and i dont say that the side of our lives which has to do with our ambitions with public affairs our profession or our artthe side in fact in which woman counts leastmay not give scope to that which is best in us i have no end of belief in the life a man lives among men i grant a good deal on your side of the question you see only i know it will be a precious bad day when we keep our women merely for breeding purposes we shall have degeneration in uncommonly full swing then there is an immense lot in the relation between man and woman beside the physical one andandim not ashamed to thank whatever gods there be for that your wife began mr rivers laurence looked hard at him while the good temper the geniality died out of his face my wife does not enter into our contract sir he said shortly the coldly brilliant eyes fastened on him with a certain voracity of observation then the elder man bowed slightly courteously contemptuously you interest me extremely he said i am obliged to you but i must not presume upon your complaisance you have supplied me with sufficient subjects of meditation for tonight i will not detain you further i thank you my dear laurence goodnight i was a fool to let myself go and a still bigger one to lose my temper the young man said to himself as he closed the door and passed out on to the corridor save for a ticking of clocks silence prevailed throughout the house the electric light clear and steady revealed every object in its completeness the temperature was some degrees higher than during the day and airless in proportion to its increased warmth halfway down the shining oak staircase laurence was saluted by the musky odour of the orchids clinging enfolding it seemed to meet him more as a presence than a scent the diningroom door stood wide open the underbutler came forth and went noiselessly towards the offices there followed a muffled sound of baize doors swinging to then simultaneously sharply from all quarters clocks struck the half hour only halfpast ten laurence exclaimed how villainously early i wish to goodness i had not lost my temper though it was slightly imbecile if the poor old gentleman enjoys being offensive why shouldnt he be so he has none too many opportunities of amusement he paused looking down the bright vacant silent corridor past the open doors of all the bright vacant silent rooms if it comes to that nor have i he added when i come to think of it theres a notable paucity of excitement in this existence and this beastly hot air makes one too muzzy to read he yawnedwhat a mercy virginia didnt come she would have been most extensively and articulately bored he sauntered aimlessly along the passage past the fine copperplate engravings and the impassive roman emperors and drew up before the great tapestry curtain again he looked curiously at the figures worked so skilfully upon it the light took the silken surface bringing the warm fleshtints into high relief against the dim greygreen background of shadowy hill and grove no wonder my uncle blasphemes if that represents his only idea of the relation of the sexes he sighed involuntarily yes but thank god there is more in it all than merely that he said then he repeatedit is a mercy virginia did not come it would not have suited her from any point of view shed have been hideously bored and she would have been offended and a good deal shocked it is queer the way the puritanic element survives over there notwithstanding their modernity laurence smiled to himself becoming aware of the slight inconsistency of his own attitudehis late heated championship of the claims of the eternal feminine his selfcongratulation at the fact that his own particular investment in the matter of womanhood was at present safely away on the other side of the atlantic then taken by a sudden impulseborn in part of a desire of escape from the suffocating atmosphere around himhe pulled the edge of the heavy curtain outwards passed round it letting it drop into place behind him he stood a moment in a contracted blind space the place seemed possessed of singular influences again he grew faint as he groped for the door handle while a conviction grew upon him that he had stood just here and so groped an innumerable number of times already and that he should so stand and gropeeither in fact or in imagination just as long indeed as consciousness remained to himan innumerable number of times again at last the handle was found and yielded breathing rather quickly laurence entered the lofty faircoloured room it too was bright with electric light but the air of it was sensibly purer than that of the corridor while standing before the painted satinwood escritoire at the further side of the fireplace was a slender woman her back was towards him she wore a highwaisted clinging rosepink silken gown her dark hair was gathered up in soft yet elaborate bows and curls high on her small head after the fashion prevalent in the early years of the century a cape of transparent muslin and lace veiled her bare shoulders vi the young mans astonishment was immense recovering from the first shock of it he was taken with reprehensible irreverence towards the sick man upstairs the old sinner how he has lied he said to himself a pretty ass he has made of me with this card up his iniquitous old sleeve all the while he debated momentarily whether good manners demanded his retirement before his presence was perceived or whether he was free to go forward and make acquaintance with this unacknowledged member of his uncles household strong curiosity coupled with a spirit of mischief provoked him to adopt the latter course he owed it to himself surely not to neglect so handsome an opportunity of turning the tables upon old mr rivers while astonishment and levity notwithstanding laurence was aware of a strong attraction drawing him towards the slender roseclad figure he began to question indeed whether it like the room and its furnishings was not in a degree familiar to him whether it was not the embodiment of just all that of which he had been so singularly expectant when visiting the room this same morning meanwhile the young ladys hands moved over the rounded cover of the escritoire as though endeavouring to open it the lace frills edging her muslin cape flew upwards showing her bare arms these were thin but beautifully shaped while the movement of her hands was singularly graceful and rapid she touched yet seemed unable firmly to grasp the gilded handles of the escritoire again and again clasped her hands as it appeared to laurencefor her back was still towards himwith a baffled despairing gesture and then moved away across the room she appeared to flit rather than walk so light and silent were her steps birdlike in their swift and dainty grace watching her laurence was reminded of a certain spanish danseuse who during the previous winter had excited the wild enthusiasm and considerably lightened the pockets of the jeunesse doree of new york but the charm of the dancer had for him at least been spoilt by the somewhat unbridled pride of success perceptible in her bearing whereas the flitting figure now before him notwithstanding the beguiling loveliness of its motions struck him as penetrated with the sorrow of failure rather than the arrogance of success she wandered to and fro regardless or unconscious of his presence searchingsearchingas it seemed passing her hands over the worktable sweeping them along the surface of the chimneypiece between the ornaments and china fingering the music upon the piano he caught sight of a delicate profile a round and youthful cheek but her movements were so anxious and rapid that he could get no definite view of her face indeed her action was so quick that it was not without effort laurence followed it at first the young mans attitude had been one of slightly irritated amusement at the concealment practised on him by his host but as the roseclad ladys search continued the sense of amusement was merged in one of sympathy she was so graceful a creature she appeared so sadly baffled and perplexed a subtle anxiety laid hold of himan apprehension that something momentous and of farreaching consequence to himself was in act of accomplishmentthat he was himself deeply involved and pledged by a long train of antecedent circumstances to assist those delicately framed and apparently so helpless hands in their unceasing search pardon me but what have you lost he asked her at last speaking gently as to a timid and unhappy child tell me and let me try to help you find it at the sound of his voice the flitting figure paused stood a moment listening as though striving to collect the purport of his address then it turned to him for the first time laurence saw his companions face clearly and he shrank back penetrated at once by a great admiration and a vague dread of her for it was a very lovely face but shy and wild as no other human face he had ever beheld the sweet mouth drooped at the corners as with some haunting but halfcomprehended distress the eyes were serious bluepurpleas are deep highlying mountain tarns set in a soft gloom of pinetrees and of heather a gentle distraction pervaded the young ladys aspect and this was the more arresting that each bow and curl of her pretty hair was in place every detail of her dress fresh and finished from the string of pearls about her white throat to the toes of her rosepink satin slippers sparkling with an embroidery of brilliants which showed beneath the small flounce edging her rosepink skirt laurence had lived at least as virtuously as most men of his class yet it would be idle to declare virginia his first and only flame he had married her which constituted the difference between her and all those other flamesand at times it occurred to him what a prodigiously great difference that was since his marriage he had been guiltless of looking to the right hand or to the left even in thought but before that event it must be owned he had had his due share of affairs of the heart he was thoroughly conversant with the premonitory symptoms of that fascinating disorder commonly known as falling in love and to his dismay as he looked on the sad and lovely person before him he was conscious that some of those premonitory symptoms were not entirely absent an immense pity and tenderness took him a deepening conviction too of recollection as one who after a long lapse of years hears again some almost forgotten melody or sees again a once wellknown and wellbeloved landscape the sad face was new to him not in itself but in its sadness only the corners of the sweet mouth should not droop but tip upward in soft discreet laughter the serious eyes should dance as the surface of these same mountain tarns in sunlight under a rippling breeze the face remembered thus had indeed never been wholly forgottenhe knew that it formed part of inherent prenatal impressions of which all his life he had been potentially if not actively aware all this flashed through him in the space of a few seconds while he repeated somewhat staggered by the fulness of emotion which the tones of his own voice implied only tell me what you have losttell me and let me help you find itthen he added more lightly smiling at her with his sincere and kindly smilereally my services are worth enlisting ive always been a rather famous hand at finding things you know she gazed at the young man for a minute or more a tremulous wonder in her expression while she fingered the string of pearls about her rounded throat her lips moved but no sound came from them her attitude changed she stood with her head raised apparently listening then reluctantly as in obedience to some unwelcome summons she moved swiftly across the room to the outstanding painted satinwood escritoire passed at the back of it and the young man found himself alone vii though usually an excellent sleeper laurence passed a restless night like most sane persons he was disposed to resent that which he could not account for and with the best will in the world to evolve ingenious hypotheses explanatory of her disappearance the manner of his sweet companions going remained a mystery he had examined the escritoire and found it locked he had also examined the wallspace in its vicinity this was hung from cornice to wainscot with pale yellowandwhite brocade as was all the room but neither behind the brocade nor in the wainscot was any door or sliding panel discoverable indeed when he came to think of it remembering the structure of the house as he had seen it on his way along the south front to the stables that side of the room consisted of a blank wall doorless and windowless this fact when he realised it caused laurence something of a shock it was unpleasant to him and so he took refuge in scepticism he laughed at himself declaring that the unwholesome atmosphere of the house and the lonely uneventful life he was compelled to lead were breeding morbid fancies in him all that talk about woman and the relation of the sexes had stamped itself upon his mind in an exaggerated way thanks to his surroundings the musky scent of the orchids had a word to say in the matter too no doubt so had his revulsion from the gross suggestions of the scene represented on the tapestry curtain heavy sleep amounting almost to torpor induced by the heavy atmosphere had fallen upon him directly after he had entered that strangely engaging and familiar room and in that sleep imagination had created a woman who should embody all that which the room and its furnishings suggestedan ideal woman far away alike from the brilliant young leader of smart society whom he had marriedbut on this clause laurence refused to allow his thoughts to dwelland from the mere human broodmare whom his uncle pronounced to be the only admissible exponent of the eternal feminine he had dreamed a poemone of those poems he kept at the bottom of his despatchbox and had never felt any inclination to read aloud to virginiahad dreamed instead of writing it that was all laurence got out of bed and threw open the window where the eastern angle of the house stood out dark against the sky he could see the pallor of the dawn warming into rose while overhead the stars died out one by one as the light broadened yes the vision of a dream he said to himself only another of those thousand exquisite things which belong to the language of symbol and possess alas no tally in realityreality that is as most of us hidebound victims of conventionality are destined to know ithe laughed a little grimlyreality as we know it being precisely the biggest illusion of all he watched the fading stars the deepening rose and gold of day above the woods and lawns the black cypresses and white statues upon the northern boundary of the italian garden starlings chattered joyously from the gutters under the eaves and then swept down with a rush of passing wings on to the grass a keeper gun on shoulder with a busy little black cockingspaniel and a longlimbed red irish setter behind him crossed the rough downward slope of the park and the wide bluegrey landscape began to grow definite to assert itself right away up to the horizon the earth seemed to awake with a quiet smile from the kindly sleep of night laurence drank in his fill of the moist sharp air poor dear virginia he said suddenly and it was probably the very first time in her whole life that this popular admirably finished and much admired young lady had ever excited pity after breakfast laurence set forth to visit his clerical correspondent and strive to ease the latters conscience while refusing his request the rectory distant about threequarters of a mile stood on the rising ground across the valley backed by a fringe of highlying woods the church a small but very perfect example of norman architecture closely adjoined the house there were good details of carving about the narrow roundheaded windows of the chancel and the low heavy arch of the porchthe floor of which was sunk several steps below the level of the churchyard the tower square and solid but little higher than the roof of the nave was surmounted by a squat shingled spire it struck laurence as a calm selfcontained little building on which the centuries had set but slight mark of decay the churchyard tooshadowed by a few ancient yewtreeswas singularly peaceful full for the most part of unnamed grassgrown graves death seen thus had nothing awful nothing repulsive about itquiet rest after toil it amounted to no more than that but then the charm of spring was in the air and the young man was pleasantly beguiled by it he sat down on the broad coping of the churchyard wall lighted a cigarette and idly watched the rooks streaming out from the rectory elms and dropping on the fragrant freshturned earth of a ploughfield in the valley he listened idly to the nimble wind that blew up from the tenmiledistant sea sang in the woodland above and whispered through the dark plumelike branches of the yews here in this sheltered piece of ground the sky was a thin bright blue and across it wandered little clouds like flocks of white sheep herded by that same nimble wind up from the channel it seemed to laurence that here indeed would be a pleasant enough place to lie when life was over but then that time had by no means arrived for him yet he felt againas he had felt that night on board shipthat he had never done complete justice to his own capacity whether the fault lay in himself or in circumstance he could not say but he knew that neither body nor mind nor heart had worked up to their full strength yet ambition of some notable and absorbing undertaking stirred in him he looked out over the goodly land would this by no means contemptible inheritance on the threshold of the possession of which he now stood afford him his great opportunity and then his thought harked back to the lovely and pathetic vision which had blessed his sleepfor of course he was asleeplast night a man could find fulness of satisfaction in a great passion for such a womanif so be she actually existed instead of being only the ideal vision of an ideal dream yes a man could go very far down that road ififand there laurence being a decent fellow laid strong hands on his imagination to indulge it was just simply not right since whatever womans existence might belong to the land of fancy his wife virginias belonged to the land of very positive fact he got up shook himself and walked away to the rectory house through the sunshine and shadow of the peaceful country graveyard viii mr beal received his guest with an agitation in which natural timidity warred with professional pride he laboured under the conviction that he was called upon at all times and in all places to maintain the dignity of the anglican church he believed she was very much in the midst of foes rome and nonconformity alike perpetually plotting her downfall while atheism cruised about in the offing ever ready to seize any who escaped the machinations of these more declared enemies and unfortunately the young man neither in appearance nor constitution was a born fighter or even a born diplomatist in appearance he was mild with sandy downlike hair a high narrow forehead and freckled skin pale anxious eyes behind spectacles and a moist white hand he opened the front door to laurence himself and it occurred to the latter that his clothes were very black and that he wore a great many of them mr laurence rivers i presume he said looking up nervously into his guests face yes i thought it would be simplest to answer your letter in person the other replied he felt a certain kindly pity for the young clergyman whose existence he divined to be of a somewhat limited and unproductive sorti should have given myself the pleasure of calling on you in any case in a day or two but your letter seemed to require attention at once i am sorry you are having any bother about will you not come in mr beal asked hurriedly our conversation might be overheard and commented upon this way please you will excuse the diningroom i always occupy this room during the winter months it is both necessary and right that i should practise economy and to occupy this room exclusively saves a fire in his nervousness mr beal talked continuously pray take a seat he said pushing forward an armchair the leather cover and springs of which were decidedly tired i at once begged you to come in here because in speaking of personal and parochial matters one cannot i feel be too careful mr wingatethe rector of stoke rivers you knowwished i am sure to treat me with generosity when i undertook the duty here he not only placed the whole of this house at my disposal but he left two female servantsnot on board wagesan elderly woman and a younger person as her assistant the intention was generous i feel sure but i grieve to say they are not such staunch churchwomen as i could desire and this has led to difficulties between us i thought it my duty to admonish them separately of course suiting my remonstrances to their respective ages and dispositions but they did not receive my admonitions in a submissive spirit since then i have found it necessary to exercise great caution there has been much gossip remarks of mine have been repeated and that not in a manner calculated to improve my position with the parishioners my actions are spied upon there is a small but bigoted dissenting element in the village and ah yes theyre a nuisance i dare say laurence put in smiling still its a charming place all the same i have just been poking round the church there are some wonderfully quaint bits about it and i like the churchyard i could wish to have the graves levelled and the head and foot stones placed neatly in line on the confines of the enclosure oh no no that would destroy the character of the place we cant carry anything away with usgrantedwhen we go and so theres a certain subjective comfort in knowing we leave a little mound of earth and turf behind to mark our restingplace thats hardly ostentatious considering our pretensions during lifedo you think so mr beal shifted the position of his spectacles he braced himself the churchyard has been levelled at bishops pudbury he said i had the privilege of being assistant priest there for five years the archdeacon is considered a man of great taste i should have thought the parishioners would have objected now laurence remarked so they did mr beal replied i grieve to say some persons displayed a most illiberal spirit they called meetings and behaved in a really seditious manner many even became guilty of the sin of schism they ceased to attend the church services and frequented dissenting places of worship the archdeacon was pained but he felt a principle was at stake he has long contended that the churchyard is legally the rectors freehold he therefore felt it a duty to the church to be firm laurence contemplated the young clergyman with a touch of goodnatured amusement wondering if with that anaemic physique he was capable of emulating the militant virtues of the archdeaconrector of bishops pudbury but about this letter of yours mr beal he said thats what i came to talk to you about i am afraid my conversation has been a little irrelevant butbut the young man sat opposite to laurence shifting his spectacles and washing his hands in an access of nervousness i confess i am not quite myself this morning mr rivers i was made an object of public ridicule last night i am very sorry to hear it how was that i think i am at liberty to tell you because the incident took its rise in your uncle the elder mr rivers refusal to receive me you see it is known how often i have been repulsed last night we had the weekly choir practice at the school while it was in progress i was called and informed by the pupilteacherwhom i excuse of participation in the unseemly jestthat mr rivers had sent for me and that his carriage was waiting at the gate this surprised me but i supposed you might have received and immediately responded to the request contained in my note i excused myself to the organist and choir and hastily put on my hat and coat i hurried out but some illdisposed youths had placed strings across the school door i fell the ground was exceedingly muddy my reappearance was greeted with hardly concealed derision i discovered the whole matter was a vulgar hoax ah thats very much too bad laurence said kindly though the picture suggested by the young clergymans story provoked him to internal mirth we must straighten this out somehow and yet i tell you frankly your letter placed me in a difficulty even when in good health my uncle was not an easy person to approach and now as you know he is fatally ill i would deal with him very gently mr beal remarked bracing himself i am sure of that but i am afraid he might deal anything but gently with you i thinki believei am prepared to suffer for my faith i am sure of that laurence repeated consolingly but it appears to me this would be both a superfluous and inglorious martyrdom my uncle is perfectly secure of his own position and opinions the latter are peculiar and he has a very trenchant way of stating them you would convey to me that i should be worsted in argument mr beal inquired yes i really am more than half afraid you would and so you see no end would be gained you would be pained and possibly humiliated while my uncles victory would render him more stubborn in the maintenance of his own views he would be irritated too and that might accelerate the action of the disease from which he suffers remember hes both old and ill i own i think he must just go his own way i hesitate to coerce him during this address walter beal had washed his moist hands in a very agony of agitation this handsome stranger impressed him greatly he was sympathetic moreover a patient and kindly listener the young clergyman could have found it in his heart to adore him with a humble and doglike devotion but then his own professional dignity must be asserted so he whipped down his natural and wholesome inclination to heroworship and whipped up his rather spavined ecclesiastical valour and said with all the sternness his tremulous voice could command i fear you are not a true christian mr rivers or you would find no room for hesitation where the salvation of a soul is involved laurence turned his chair sideways to the dinnertable crossed his legs and rested his elbow on the bare white cloth some crumbs remained on it left over from walter beals breakfast but happily they were at the far corner the young man deserved a snub but he was an innocent creature a great sincerity in his foolishness laurence looked out of window across to the sunny peaceful churchyard after all why be harsh why snub anybody so he smiled again genially enough upon the distracted beal oh we must discuss the heights and depths of my christianity some other time he said the point is to stop this impertinence of which you are the victim look here honestly i dont see my way to making a meeting between you and my uncle at present but as you cant get the uncle let me beg you to put up with the nephew let it be known that you and i are on excellent terms come and see me lets seetomorrow evening i shall be free till halfpast nine or ten come and dine with me but mr beal shrunk back and raised his moist white hands in protest oh no he exclaimed that is i am sure your intentions are most kind most kindindeed indeed really i am sure of that but except professionally except at the urgent call of dutyand then grace would be given mei felt that yesterday when i received the summons during the choir practicei prayedi was praying when those strings intercepted my passage and caused me to falli knew i should be supportedbut except professionally i could not make up my mind to enter that housestoke rivers and after dark too i could not it would be too dreadful laurence stared at him blankly why my good man he said laughing a little what on earth is the matter with the house i understand that it contains pictures and statues of an immoral character it is very frightful to think of a soul the soul of a scoffer of one who speaks lightly of holy things going forth to meet its doom from among such heathenish surroundingsbut it is not that so much which deters me i ought to cope with that strong in faith but from a child i own it i have suffered from the fear of the supernatural laurences eyebrows drew together the supernatural he said yesyesthe supernatural laurence paused a moment gazing down at the worn drugget between his feet look here he said either you are talking great nonsense or there is something uncommonly serious at the bottom of all this of which i ought to be informed tell me plainly what are you afraid of there there are lights all night certainly there are the electric light is left on it is a fancy of my unclesand not an unreasonable one in time of illness if your fears take their rise in nothing worse than that why laurence shrugged his shoulders oh butbut mr beals voice sunk to a whisper and his pale eyes looked piteously upon his guest from behind his spectacles it is commonly reported there is a female in the house laurence shook his headoh no pardon me he said that is a mistake there are only menservants in the house that i know no lady has stayed at stoke riversso my uncle informed mesince my mother stayed there with me when i was quite a small boy butbut poor walter beal almost wailed i dont mean any lady visitor thethe scarlet womanyou know i understand the keepers have frequently seen her at night at the windows downstairs and i believe i saw her once this winter myself saw her yourself yes i had been to call and inquire for mr rivers it was dusk and i was much alarmed at going but i would not permit myself to neglect a duty i was going back up the avenue when i saw a person in a red dress coming out from the bowwindow iiiidid not wait laurence had risen he stood for a moment speechless then a sudden gladness took him the sun was bright outside there but the yewtrees waved their dusky arms quaintly making little shadows dance and flit upon the churchyard grass noi see you ran away he said well mr beal perhaps that was the very best thing under the circumstances that you could have doneyou cant make up your mind to dine with me all right ill come and see you then well let the parish know you and i are on excellent terms anyhow i should be glad to have a talk with you about the schools and charities and of course if mr rivers should soften and express any willingness to receive your ministrations ill not fail to let you know on reaching the house laurence went straight down the corridor pulled aside the tapestry curtain and entered the room beyond as yesterday it was fresher in atmosphere than the rest of the interior the furniture the knickknacks even the little frill in the open workbox were stationary untouched precisely in the same position as last night again laurence examined the room carefully very certainly there was no exit from it save the door or the baywindow and no human being in it save himself ix that afternoon captain bellingham called at stoke rivers he was a large fair freshcoloured man of about fiveandthirtyextremely wellgroomed addicted to fieldsports and an arrant gossip this last characteristic was much in evidence during his visit he gossiped of london of new york of sussex displaying a vast amount of knowledge of other peoples affairs well my dear fellow its uncommonly pleasant to forgather with you again those presents your wife sent my small daughter were princely sibyl will write to her the child has a regular yankee eye for valueand i tell you she was impressed my wife was awfully disappointed at missing you yesterday shes frightfully gone on mrs rivers i think she wants to have a look at you to satisfy herself that youre living up to your high privileges in that quarter come over tomorrow cant you and dine and sleep laurence explained that his evenings were bespoken ah reallyby the way how is the old gentleman making headway towardsdont you know rather depressing business for you waiting on like this pity you cant come and dine and sleep it would make a little break for you ive never seen him you know but i hear he is rather a formidable old person my wife intends asking you a number of questions about him of course you must know there are a whole lot of queer stories current so i hear laurence said oh its not for you to hear its for you to tell jack bellingham answered his eyes twinkling why my dear fellow your arrival is the excitement of the hour the whole neighbourhood is sitting on the edge of its respective chairs just bursting for information about stoke rivers you wait a little i warn you youre going to be handed round like a plate of cake at an old maids teaparty and my wife in right of her relationship to mrs rivers means to have the first slice she means to walk in collar you and then skilfully and economically retail you to her whole local acquaintance to tell the truth ive been rather worried about louise lately she has an ideaive noticed nothing to justify it myselfthat she has rather missed fire down here shes taken that awfully to heart you know and i think she looks to you to give her her opportunity she thinks if she gets possession of you and all these queer stories shell make the runningall the other women will be nowhere you know laurence laughed he felt slightly embarrassed but what the dickens is it all about he said thats for you to tell us captain bellingham repeated perhaps youll be rather glad of an audience in a day or two anyhow come over and see my wife as soon as you can shes great on spookhunting psychical research all that sort of thing so give her the first chance let her have a postcard in the morning shell be brokenhearted if she misses you again laurence partook of another solitary dinner admirably cooked and served in company with the dancing etruscan figures and the muskyscented orchids again when the meal was finished he went upstairs through the steady light and close dry atmosphere to that stately and sombre sickroom the last twentyfour hours had been very full of disquieting episodes and suggestions i am inclined to reverse the order of proceedings tonight he said to himself and crossquestion my uncle instead of letting him crossquestion me after all thatll fit in to his scheme of observation well enough my questions no doubt will be indicative of the depths of my native ignorance and the poverty of my powers theyll enable him to draw conclusions conclusions he added smilinga sufficiently fatuous occupation when one thinks of the limited amount of evidence obtainable and the breadth of the inquiry on the stairhead his uncles valet a thin wiry man longarmed grey of hair and of skin met him and preceded him silently along the corridor laurences relations with servants and other persons in an inferior position to his own were usually of a kindly and cordial sort such persons told him of their affairs they admired and trusted him but the servants in this house though caring for his comfort with scrupulous forethought and punctuality remained so far impossible of approach they seemed to him like so many machines incapable of hopes or fears affections even of sins inhuman in their rigidity and silence now the valet announced him and stood aside to let him pass with a perfection of drill and an absence of individuality so complete that it was to laurence quite actively unpleasant immediately after he met the hungry glance of those coldly brilliant eyes looking out of the face fixed in outline transparent as the crystal skull lying on the table close by and this house so full of beings but half alive of paralysed activities defective or onesided development seemed to the young man for the moment terrible the country churchyard in which the wind sang and the sunshine played among the graves with flitting beckoning shadows was gay by comparison no wonder the place had an evil reputation and that people invented weird stories about it a sensation of loneliness such as he had not known since early childhood came over laurence almost involuntarily he made an effort towards closer more sympathetic intercourse with his host how are you this evening sir he asked better i hope it has been a wonderfully charming day i am glad to learn you have found it so weather has always appeared to me an accident unworthy save in its scientific aspects of attention yet i understand that it exercises strong influence on certain temperamentsemotional temperaments i apprehend undisciplined by reason that the weather today has affected you agreeably is matter for congratulation since it will have helped to mitigate the tedium of a small portion of this period of waiting oh theres not much tedium laurence answered he looked across at the elder man smiling very pleasantlyim beginning to find things here a little too dramatic if anything you were good enough to tell me that you found me interesting last night sir i only wish i could be half as interesting to you as you and your house and the whole state of affairs here is to me you find it distinctly interesting mr rivers inquired but whether in approval or disapproval laurence could not determine unquestionably he answered the house is cram full of treasures and there are unexpected influences in it which get hold of ones imagination it stands alone in my experience unlike any place i have ever known the elder man sunk further back against the pillows and with one long thin hand drew the violet furlined dressinggown closer across his knees as though cold indeed have i divorced myself and my surroundings so completely from the ordinary habits of my contemporaries youve been strong enough to follow your own tastes and lead your own life and that has produced something unique something as finished as it is apart of course this provokes a lot of criticism other people i observe recognise that it is unique too other people mr rivers said loftily i have never entertained exactly laurence answered thats where part of the uniqueness comes in we mostly herd together like sheep in a pen and cant be easy unless were rubbing sideshe paused a moment your refusal to rub sides causes great searchings of heart i assure you the poor little parson here for instance is tormented by the idea that it is his duty to the almighty and to the church of england and to his own abnormally developed conscience to raid you and do a little spiritual gardening in the neglected flowerbeds of your soul my soul is my own mr rivers observed that is if the term soul is strictly speaking admissible conscious consciousness is all that i can predicate of my other than physical existence the little parsons point of view is quite different he is by no means backward in predication he is quite sure you have a soul but whether it is your own or whether it doesnt belong to him as curateincharge of stoke rivers he is not at all sure he has strong leanings to the latter belief i fancy these are puerilities the average man is puerile laurence asserted cheerfully we carted away woman last night sir you remember in deference to your slight prejudice against herthough i still maintain she is by no means foreign to our inquiry but i really cant consent to the carting away of puerility too or you will never get hold of the average man at all forbid his affections and his ineptitudes both and you dont leave the poor wretch a leg to stand on meanwhile the little parson is not the only person a good deal worked up by the unique character of your habits and surroundings these give rise indirectly to surprising legends indeed yes indeed i think they would amuse you and in connection with all this sir there are one or two questions i should most uncommonly like to ask you you may do so mr rivers said his nephews rapid speech and breezy manner made him slightly breathless he was unaccustomed to be treated in this light and airy fashion he moved uneasily in his chair as one who tries to avoid a draught laurence observing this repented of his purpose i dont tire you sir do i he asked kindly exhaustion is a consequence of the failure of the will my will is still obedient to my mind and my body to my will laurence looked at him with a certain admiration he was true to his creed such as it was and his pride had consequently rather a superb quality well then he said since i may ask youi have found from conversation with several of our neighbours that this house which i took to be a sort of temple of reason is regarded with a good deal of vulgar suspicion though the room was warm the atmosphere of it close as that of a thundering night in the tropics laurence instinctively leaned forward spreading out his hands to the glowing woodfire on the hearth i am not superstitious he continued and you very certainly i take it are not so we shall agree in that still i confess the whole subject of the occult and supernatural is rather fascinating to me i cant quite keep my hands off it i find an idea is prevalent that there are manifestations here queer things are seen you know which cannot be put down to natural agency i want to know if you but mr rivers interrupted him with unaccustomed vehemence of speech and manner stop he said stop if you please this subject is exceedingly distasteful to me then we wont pursue it laurence answered quickly yet he wondered his interest already considerably aroused being sensibly increased by the violence displayed by his companion it was singular and he paused a little thinking before embarking in further conversation during that pause mr rivers leaned sideways slowly and with difficulty raised the crystal skull from its place on the table beside him he held it in front of him in both hands and gazed as though performing some religious rite into the cavities of the empty eyesockets then stiffly letting his hands sink he rested it upon his knees pardon me he said looking full at laurence while a shadow rather than a flush seemed to pass over his attenuated face i was tempted to act unworthilyi agreed to answer such questions as you might put to me but perceiving those questions tended to revive a matter which has caused me one of the few humiliations and regrets i have suffered during my life i shrank i was tempted weakly to break faith with you and retract my promise pray sir dont take it so seriously laurence entreated of course i should never have approached the subject had i known it was disagreeable to you it was just the idle curiosity of an idle man what on earth does it matter to you very little presumably since you are as you say idleyour days that is filled with a round of amusements deadeningas i fearto the intellectual and moral conscience but with me the case is otherwise the judgment of no human being is of moment to me but my judgment of myself is of infinite moment mr rivers laid one transparent hand upon the dome of the crystal skull as though for support his face had grown hard as steel it is therefore incumbent upon me not in satisfaction of your curiosity my dear laurence but in satisfaction of my own sense of rectitude that i should accept this opportunity of stating the following facts i inherited this propertyas you will shortly inherit itfrom an uncle a man very much my senior i had prosecuted my studies abroad in the learned centres of germany and france from an early age my acquaintance with my uncle was slight i knew little of his private life but i had reason to believe him a person of an undisciplined mind imbued with the extravagant socialistic views current during the french revolution unbridled alike in passions of love and of hate questions of character have never interested me i therefore made no further inquiry regarding my predecessors private life my own tastes and habits were already fixed i settled myself here and continued the studies in experimental physics philology and metaphysics in which i had already engaged i also added to the collection of pictures and objects of art that i found in the house my life has been blameless as most men count blame i can assert without fear of contradiction that my moral and intellectual integrity have been complete only in one connection have i been guilty have i failedfailed as i now confess miserably and grossly mr rivers paused a moment his fingers twitched as they rested upon the crystal skull miserably and grossly he repeated the vulgar gossip which you have heard rests upon a basis of truth i cannot deny the existence of supernatural manifestations so called in one quarter of this house they are undeniable i have witnessed them myself laurence felt a queer shiver of excitement run through him he sat very stillthen i wasnt asleep after all he said to himself in that room last night the said manifestations were not only disturbing and distasteful to me but i perceived that their existence threatened the validity of some of my most carefully reasoned hypotheses of some of my most ardently cherished beliefs of vulgar physical fear i need hardly tell you i was incapable but i trembled before a dislocation of my thought it followed that i became guilty of an act of flagrant mental cowardice i refused to submit those manifestations to scientific investigation i never mentioned them to my correspondents i took elaborate precautions against ever witnessing them again myself i made a determined effort to erase the memory of them from my mind i almost succeeded in forgetting that i ever had witnessed them thus i tricked my own intelligence i lied to my own experience i committed a crime against my own reasona crime which i can never hope to expiate moved by the passion of the elder mans selfdenunciation laurence had risen and stood close to him ah surely you take it too hardfar too hard sir he said but mr rivers looking up at him answered sternly a sin is heinous not in itself but in relation to the level of virtue habitually maintained by whoso commits it and so even were i not disabled were i still capable of carrying out these investigations the unsparing prosecution of which could alone give proof of the sincerity of my repentance that could not really wipe out the iniquity of the past in morals i cannot logically admit the possibility of cancelling a wrong once done in the realm of physics we know that vibrations once generated ring out everlastingly through space to send forth a contrary set of vibrations is not to limit or cause the first generated to cease their circles may intersect yet they are practically independent and cannot neutralise one another in the realm of morals it is the same the act once committed passes into the region of persistent and indubitable fact of sins both passive and active this is equally true and consequently i am doomedso long as i retain conscious individualityto remain hopelessly lowered in my selfesteem the sick man spoke with a fierceness of conviction his voice usually low and even swelling into full sonorous tones his attenuated frame vibrant with energy his face illuminated as though a lamp burned behind that thin investiture of flesh and bone laurence saw in him for the moment a great orator more probably a great preacher wasted and the thought of that waste of force waste of power stung him out of indolence out of mere easy good nature he at least would shillyshally no more with life but play the gamewhatever the game presenting itselfwholeheartedly and again that queer shiver of excitement ran through him while again he reminded himself he had now reliable testimony that he had met with something far stranger more incalculable and mysterious than any vision of a dream in that clearcoloured room downstairs last night he stood silent thinking intently feeling keenly his whole nature alert but a small rustling sound as of a chill wind among dry leaves in a winter hedge recalled him to his immediate surroundings mr rivers had sunk back against the silken cushions which rustled under his weight the light had died out of his face his hands clutched tremblingly at the crystal memento mori resting on his knees for the first time laurence realised how very nearbut for the indomitable strength of will which supported himhe was to death laurence bent over him this is heavy sir he said touching the crystal skull may i put it back on the table mr rivers bowed his head in assent we have talked too much it would be wise i think for me to leave you it would be so may i call your man before i goi hardly like to leave you alone thank you he will come at the accustomed hour i do not deviate from habits once formed except under stress of necessity laurence was pushed by the desire to say something gentle something expressive of the honour in which he held his hosts rectitude and sincerity but mr rivers lay back motionless his eyes closed it was difficult to find just the words he wished he turned away towards the door when the elder mans voice recalled him laurence he said laurenceone word before we part if you should see fit to undertake those investigations of which we have spoken and in face of which i showed myself unfaithful and a cravenremember i press nothing upon you i leave you free to undertake them or not as you pleasei have one request to make of you yes sir he answered it is thisthat you will under no circumstances communicate the result of those investigations to any person save myself and only to me should i definitely ask you to do so will you give me your word i give you my word sir and with the feeling that he had bound himself to an engagement of unlookedfor solemnity the young man went out into the steady brightness of the corridor whileas last nightthe odour of the orchids met him enfolding him in their thick musky sweetness halfway down the dark shining oakenstairs x as he pulled the edge of the heavy leatherlined curtain towards him laurence laughed a little in part at his own eagerness in part defiant of scruples waking in the small hours as a babychild he had often imagined that could he climb the high rails of his cot and steal back unperceived to the daynursery he would find all his toys alive and stirring at play on their own account and this conception of the reversal of the natural order of things while it frightened him yet enchanted his fancy something of that childish alarm and enchantment arose in him now he felt about to bid farewell to commonsense possiblyto usual established habits of thought assuredly he was about to commit himself to an untried element offering himself as sport to seas unsounded as yet to unknown forces which might prove malign and merciless while the promise by which he had so lately bound himself introduced into the coming experience an element of secrecy that madeas enforced secrecy so often does makefor a rather dangerous degree of personal liberty so he turned the doorhandle not without expectation and this time expectation suffered no disappointment in front of the tall satinwood escritoire her back towards him her delicate hands wandering anxiously over the painted and polished surface he beheld once more the slender roseclad figure laurence drew in his breath with a sigh of satisfaction he crossed the room boldly tonight and stood beside her and her pale ethereal loveliness entranced him as he spoke listen to me he said we are strangers to one anotherso strangely strangers that i half distrust the evidence of my senses as only too conceivably you distrust the evidence of yours i dont pretend to understand what distance of time or space or conditions separates us i only know that i see you and that you are unhappy and that you search for something you are unable to findlook here look herelisten to me and try to lay hold of this ideathat i am a friend not an enemy that i come to help not to hinder you try to enter into some sort of relation with me try to cross the gulf which seems to lie between us try to believe that you have found some one who will keep faith with you and do his best to serve you and believing that put sorrow out of your face he stopped suddenly when he began speaking he might have been addressing a sleepwalker or a person in a trance there was no speculation in her sweet eyes they were wild with a wondering distress looking on him as though not seeing him but as he continued to plead with herspeaking slowly pausing at the close of each sentence in the hope that the sense of his words might so reach and arrest hera gradual change came over her aspect as of one awakening from prolonged and troubled slumber there was a dawning of intelligence in her expression as in that of a little child first struggling to apprehend and measure not by means of its senses merely but in obedience to the conscious effort of its mind the drooping corners of the mouth straightened turned upward the lips breaking into a timid questioning smile she stretched herself a little clenched her fists gently rubbed her eyes with them in innocent baby fashion stretched again and then looked full at laurencea woman shy diffident but in possession of her faculties expectant and alive yesyesthere thats right now you look as you used to look as you should he exclaimed his voice low shaken with very vital excitement he felt as whenonce or twicebringing a racing yacht in to the finish a fair spread of blue water between her stern and her competitors bows he had felt her pace quicken while the tiller throbbed and danced under his hand a buoyancy of heart a delicious conviction of successful attainment was upon him sportsman and poet alike rejoiced in laurence just then and the spiritual side of his nature was touched as well he seemed to have witnessed a glad resurrection enforcing belief in the immortality of the soul as he gazed on this lovely face in which reason hope even gaiety were so visibly born anew never mind about that which you have lost he said let it be for the present we will arrive at it in time sure enoughleave all that to me you want these drawers opened their locks pickedwell that shall be done all in good time but whatever treasures we find there will be but a trifle it strikes me compared with that which we have already found tonight for i have found youfound you once moreand you thank god have found yourself again his companion stretched and passed her hands across her eyes while her lips parted in a soundless sigh silence held her yet but that appeared to make singularly little difference in their intercourse for he perceived that she understood that she sympathised that she too was penetrated with quick intimate joy and an exquisite and innocent goodfellowship as plainly as though a very torrent of eloquent explanation and asseveration had issued from her mouth indeed this wordlessness had for him an extraordinary charm far from a power being lacking it was to him as though a new power had been granted and that the most subtle and convincing to the heart laurence stood tall upright in the full pride of his young manhood of his virile energy and strength before this slender fairylady with her softly gleaming jewels her dainty frills and laces her clinging rosered oldworld silken gown and held out his hands to her come he said the night is fair and windless and full of stars shall we go out into it and read the great poem of the sky and the woodland while all men sleep you and igood comrades old friends though as most mortals count meeting we have met each other it would seem but twiceyou have known sad things well forget them you have searched vainly for lost things well forget them too the finest house at best remains somewhat of a prison and this room is pervaded by melancholy memories leave it let us give the past give convention give reason even the slip for onceand go for a minute or more she hesitated looking at laurence profoundly as though trying to read his inmost thought then she laid her hand in his it had neither weight nor substance but touched his palm as a light summer wind might have touched his cheek or a butterflys wings might have fluttered with a just perceptible pulsation within the hollow of his hands and so laurence threw open the high french window and together they passed out onto the grey semicircular flight of steps immediately below lay the italian gardenits formal flowerborders its faintly dripping fountains its black spirelike cypresses white balustrades and statues vague mysterious in the starlight the great lawns stretched away beyond crossed by the broad gravel walk which showed pale for some fifty yards and then was lost in the dusky shadow of the grove of limetrees in the north was a wide white light travellingsince the march nights now grew shortalong the horizon through the quiet hours from the last deathflush of sunset to the first birthflush of the dawn lawrence watched his companion anxiously as her little feet in their diamondpowdered slippers crossed the windowsill with that impalpable hand in his that scarcely perceptible flutteras of a captive butterflyagainst his fingers he could not but entertain fears that the strong open air might work some change in her that she might be drawn up and absorbed by the sharp glittering starlight that she might be resolved into nothingness by the keen breath of the night or that some sturdy seabreeze might arise and blow her quite away but such as she waswoman or sprite or visitant from beyond the gates of the graveshe remained by his side and together they passed down the garden alleys and lingered by the dripping fountains watching the sleepless fish that movedsilent as the dainty lady herselfthrough the water of the lichenencrusted stone basins they stood together beneath the dark cypresses which even on winter nights smell dry and warm of the south and talk in husky whispering accents of classic landsof marble columns mellow with age and saffronplastered walls over which great vines hang and in the hot cracks of which scorpions breed and lightfooted lizards glance and scamper and still together they went onthe unspoken sympathy between them growing deepeningdown the second flight of steps and along the broad gravelled way here in the open space the whole panorama of the heavens was disclosed and then almost in spite of himself laurence broke into utterance he talked as never even in his most brilliant moments he had talked before the scene was so majestic and moreover he had so perfect a listener every movement of whose graceful body every glance of whose profound and gentle eyes expressed comprehension accordas when the violin strings answer in exquisite melody to the skilfully handled bow and so forgetting himself ceasing to exercise that reticencehalfhumorous halfreverentwith which as with a cloak modern civilised man strives to hide the noblest and purest of his thought laurence laid bare his heart and soul to his sweet companion he told her tender trivial incidents of his youth and childhoodin themselves of little moment yet such as leave an indelible mark on the imagination and character he told her of the splendid hopes of his opening manhood when with the magnificent selfconfidence of inexperience the whole world seemed his to conquer if he pleased he told her of those plays and poems so full of promise that could he have realised the fulness of his own conceptions they must have rendered his name famous through all the coming years he told her too of those brief fugitive moments of spiritual illumination when he had felt himself draw very near to the ultimate meaning and purpose of things when he had apprehended god as the eternal lover the soul of man as the eternal bride and how in the light of that blessed apprehension all confusion had ceased all life all death becoming at once very simple and very holy guiltless alike of suffering and of shame thenas they wandered yet further into the thin shadow of the still leafless limetrees and sitting for a while upon the stone bench beside the broad dim walk looked forth under the downsweeping branches to the vast expanse of the distant countryhe descended from discourse of these high matters he told her of the joys of manly sports and pastimes and of the still greater joys of travel and adventure in far countries among alien peoples by land and sea thus did the hours pass in glad and fearless communion of heart with heart and soul with soul while upon the horizon the white light walked slowly surely eastward and then at last it seemed as though some disturbing thought invaded his fairyladys mind causing her attention to waver her gentle gaiety to wane the purport of that thought laurence failed to read and this troubled him with a sensation of helplessness as though a gulf was once again opening between his state of being and hers which he was powerless to cross she rose from her place beside him and moved restlessly to and fro and when he pleaded with and questioned her she moved yet further from him and stood with one hand raised as imploring silence she appeared to listen for some call some summons quite other than welcome for he could see the corners of her dear mouth droop once more while her eyes grew shy and wild unwillingly as though constrained by some force she did not love yet must obey she passed out on to the clear smooth spaces of the great lawns the grass blades were touched with a whiteness of frost but laurence observed that neither her footsteps nor the little frills bordering her gown as they swept it left any track upon the spangled turf sheep bells sounded plaintively from some faroff fold rabbits slipped out timorously from the edge of the wood to take their morning feed and perceiving no threatening presence waxed bold skipping and gambolling upon the frosty grass then with a sullen roar breaking up the gracious quiet of nature with the hoarse voice of mans business mans necessity of labour and unappeasable unrest a train thundered along the valley leaving a long trail of pale smoke hanging among the greybrown masses of the indistinguishable trees the roar died out as it had come sullen and imperative to the last there followed a pause as though for a minute or two all nature all living creatures held their breath and then from the near stables and from distant homestead and farm cocks challenged one anothersome in tones high and shrill some faint and lowheralding the sunrise and telling all the world that day was once more born immediately to his consternation laurence beheld his lovely companion and friend turn away and without farewell without smallest apparent recollection of his presence flitas some bird or rather as some rosered roseleaf driven by a storm windacross the lawns past the dripping fountains and sighing cypresses of the italian garden back back up the grey steps and in at the open window of the silent house he followed her rapidly the sunrays shot up into the eastern sky as he crossed the windowsill within the glory of the sunrise struggled with the unyielding glare of the electric light every object every corner and recess was clearly seen but the room was vacant once again his fairylady had vanished leaving no trace her sweet presence was removed and laurence found himself alone xi something drummed and drummed and in obedience to that sound it appeared to laurence that he returnedwhence he knew notacross the most prodigious spaces ever traversed by the spirit of man then the matter explained itself he was on board ship once again awakened to the familiar pounding of the engines and drum of the screw opening his eyes they would rest on the white iron and wooden walls of his stateroom and the alert figure of his bedroom steward announcingfair morning sir bath ready sir and this impression was so distinct that it took him some seconds to focus his actual whereaboutsthe stately and serious bedchamber at stoke rivers and the portly person of watkins the underbutler standing at the bedside a silver teatray in his large soft hands i beg your pardon sir but i have been up twice already and received no answer he said his manner correct and respectful as ever but his face wearing for once an expression of quite human solicitudeor was it curiosity i spoke to mr renshaw and mr lowndes and they considered it advisable that i should enter sir mr renshaw and mr lowndes felt with me not quite comfortable sir knowing your habit of early rising watkins set down the tray carefully turning out the corners of the fine napkin which covered it your tea your letters sir he added and then paused laurence tried to rouse himself shipboard and the pounding engines were a delusion clearly but was the night of sweet converse and the flitting away of a roseclad slender figure at the first flush of dawn a delusion likewise oh yes thanks watkins i am all right he said absently ive slept late have i what time is it between ten minutes and a quarter past eleven when i passed through the hall the man answered any orders for the stables sir laurence was tearing open his letters one was addressed in his wifes large and elaborate hand laughing at her one day before their marriage he had declared that did she possess half the amount of character suggested by these opulent hieroglyphics there would positively be no getting to the end of it so that his work clearly was cut out for him for the rest of his natural life now the sight of that handwritingthough he had possibly ceased to regard it as a perfectly trustworthy index to its writers personalityaffected him with a movement of vague selfreproach for as sleep left him laurence entertained less and less doubt of the actuality of the existence of his roseclad fairylady or of the fact that he had spent hours with herhours blameless it is true yet beautiful beyond all remembered hours of his experience and though he had done no wrong yet the very beauty of those hourssince she had not shared itconstituted a certain subtle subjective infidelity towards his wife this pricked his conscience the more that he perceived virginia must have written to him by the very next mail but three days after he had sailed and that was rather charming and thoughtful of her for she had innumerable engagements claiming her time and attention and was by no means addicted to anxiety regarding the absent why should she worry as she remarked at parting everybody was always crossing now and you hardly ever heard of any one not getting to the other side safely enough therefore it seemed to laurence it would be a duty perhaps also a little salve to his conscience to do something pleasinghowever remotelyto virginia he had an order for the stables he would ride over to luncheon with her friend and admirer mrs bellingham at bishops pudbury once on his feet laurence was somewhat surprised at his own sensations he found himself singularly tired as a man may be by some prolonged concentration of brain or of will he felt as though he had made some tremendous mental effort and now that it was over depression held both his mind and body his spirits were not as buoyant as usual nor was his thought clear he felt dazed and incapable of grappling with the strange problems raised by the events of the last twentyfour hours the swing of possibility they suggested was too great the average the banal attracted him as a narcotic attracts one in pain for the moment he suffered something approaching repulsion towards his recent exaltation and amazing halfrealised discoveries he wanted to get back on to the ordinary lines of thingsbe amused be a trifle stupid laugh gossip forget the sun had long since burnt up that sprinkling of frost upon the grass the air was fragrant and mild catkins fringed the hazel twigs while in the shelter of the deep lanes leaves showed tenderly green the sap had risen in the trees so that a broken branch bled indications of fertility and growth were everywhere nature sensibly putting forth her strength after the sleep of winter the road which laurence followed after crossing the park turned upward under overhanging trees and skirted the low stone wall of the churchyard and the contrast between this last restingplace of human corpses and the perpetual and so evident fecundity of nature struck home to him yet not distressfully he was not wholly unwilling in his present mood to welcome the thought of eventual rest he checked his horse and waited looking at the place againat its dark feathery yewtrees its narrow mounds ranged decently in lineon the surface of which the spring grass raised innumerable blades of vivid greenat its simple monuments that showed not merely a name and date of departure but timehonoured words of faith in the justice and mercy of almighty god there was an unoccupied space on the hither side of the enclosure lying pleasantly open to the sun the grey wall of the chancel pierced by low roundheaded windows backed it a bush of pyrus japonica was trained around and between these windows and the flowers showing up against their black stems spread garlands of pure hot colour over the face of the rough stone laurence to whom the disposal of his body after death had heretofore appeared a matter of extreme unimportance was overtaken by a sudden eagerness to secure for himself rights of burial in this serene and sunvisited spot after all it must come to me sooner or later as to all the rest he thought and why shouldnt i provide for the event according to my fancy ill talk to the poor little parson about it perhaps hell be easier regarding the state of my soul and my prospects of salvation if i make provision for my latter end by staking out a burialplot i wonder what virginia would say to that probably shes a little transatlantic weakness for embalmers and mausoleums mother earths lap is best though i think and then riding onward all in the fair spring weather though he tried to put the thought from him his heart was somewhat troubled by that flitting roseclad figure once againby the lovely speechless lips to which he had brought gentle gaiety and the profound and serious eyes to which he had brought human sympathy and trust silent or not woman or disembodied spirit she was a little too captivating for safety should he inquire no further but in renouncing all further intercourse with her would he perpetrate an act of high moral courage or merely commit one of intellectual cowardice such as that already committed by his uncle here was a problem not easy of solution laurence straightened himself in the saddle and pressed his horse a little bishops pudbury would be a relief and should be reached with as small delay as possible he would try to be amused a little stupid to laugh gossip and forgetfor a time at all events mrs bellingham certainly offered an excellent contrast to the spirit of his present perturbations she was a notable example of modern civilisation guiltless of all mysterious or primitive suggestion her prettiness was considerable according to a neat and unaccentuated type her manner was vivacious her attitudes many but sincere she wore theseso to speakto bring out the value of her conversation as she wore her irreproachably constructed clothes to bring out those of her plump and carefully preserved figure her lightbrown hair was parted in the middle waved and puffed out over the earsthis in imitation of the fashion lately patronised by virginia rivers the set of her purple boxcloth coat and skirt pleased laurences eye as did that of her white satin and lace blouse she was really admirably turned outaccording to current standards of fashion she greeted her guest moreover with that happy combination of selfconsciousness and selfassurance which has in it at once a flavour of compliment and promise of worthy entertainment mrs jack bellingham would never do anything very great but she aspired and succeeded in doing the small things of life remarkably well why mr rivers this is quite too charming for anything she said but unfortunately i am alone here with my children i devote a great deal of time now to my children my husband has gone up to town for the day so much the better laurence answered cheerfully i didnt come to see jack dear mrs bellingham but wholly and solely to see you virginia charged me with innumerable messages and then there are a whole lot of people we both know i want to talk to you abouta few multiplications subtractions and divisions you know not without a humorous side to them here and there will you keep me to luncheon oh thats awfully good of you the pudbury manorhouse had lately undergone reconstruction thereby gaining in convenience what it lost in distinction it was now as well designed to meet modern requirements as finished as generally presentable and as little of an enigma as its present hostess laurence contemplated the elegant if slightly unhomelike room with a movement of ironical satisfaction its contents were as agreeably obvious and unrecondite as the style and plot of a current magazine story it made no demand upon the intelligence or the emotions and laurence had been in contact with quite other literary subjectmatter latelyproblems of love morals metaphysics not unworthy to inspire the magnificent obscurities of browning or the fine frenzies of shelleys lyrics therefore he hailed the emotional limitations of his existing environment the indolent side of his nature was paramount he settled down to chatter genially about tom dick and harry and the fair ladies interested in those worthies or in whom those worthies were interested he was amused and amusing relished his luncheon his hostesss smart talk and enjoyed countless reminiscences of newport and new york and as the ease of this attitude of mind began to grow on him the question very forcibly presented itselfwhy strain why not always drift thus pleasantly and comfortably down the smooth stream of worldly prosperity why try to plumb the depths lying below that smiling surface for does not this in the majority of cases involve an expenditure of energy out of all proportion to the worth of the result to be lightinhand and lightofheartwas not that after all the truest philosophy to what a hopelessly dreary pass had not the elder mr rivers brought himself by thinking otherwise and taking his studies his opinions himself in short so seriously so sipping his coffee in the drawingroom after luncheon while mrs bellingham maintained the flow of conversation in penetrating and emphatic tones laurence thoughtyes on the whole he did thinkit would be wiser and better to retire upon the former lines of his lifeto eschew high ambitions of sorts and fall back upon the works and ways of lhomme moyen sensuel upon the great goodnatured uninspired commonplace of which his uncle had accredited him with being so oblivious and complete an exponent he thoughtnotwithstanding the tightening of some cord at his heart perhaps moral perhaps merely physicalyes honestly he did think he had better do that and make his decision here and now judging by past experience he was doomed in all departments to be second not to say thirdrate well then best accept that doom smiling to do so might hurt vanity a bit yet undoubtedly there would be consolations laurence set down his coffeecup with a little lift of the eyebrows and shoulders and an expression of countenance somewhat cynical he would coquet no longer with fairy roseclad ladieshe would decline the so strangely offered adventure the truth is im not big enough for it he thought to himself ruefully you know just how i feel about virginia his hostess was saying she is a perfectly lovely woman in every way and her social sense amounts to genius the thought of her being over makes it possible for me to contemplate spending another winter here in the country i look forward to seeing virginia lay hold of this neighbourhood and just put it through her brightness and verve and savoir faire will be a perfect revelation she will positively electrify every person within a fifteen mile radius but and there the speaker paused for along the carriagedrive all in the pleasant sunshine the children of the house a trifle inebriated by recent dinner of chicken and rice pudding by freedom and the open air went forth with shoutings and laughter for their afternoon walk first sybil and her younger sister arrayed in straight scarlet jackets beneath which showed a long length of tan boot and tan stocking encasing very active legs then the portly coachman leading a donkey upon which the threeyearold son and heir of the bellingham family also scarletcoated made a first essay in horsemanship finally two nurses clothed in white the little girls ran wildly their gay figures backed by a bank of shrubberyrusty red of berberis and glinting green of laurelswhile the pink and azure balloonballs they carried were whisked heavenward by the wind to the uttermost length of each tethering string around the procession barking circling jumping high in air after the floating balls and even threatening assault of the donkeys nose skirmished a couple of rough irish terriers the donkey shied the coachman admonished a laughing nurse ran forward and clutched the small cavalier by the outstanding skirt of his coat and by the seat of his nether garments the little girls shrieked and capered and in such hilarious fashion the company passed out of sight laurence riverss eyes rested rather wistfully upon the scene it belonged to the great goodnatured uninspired commonplace upon which he was just agreeing with himself to retire and it offered a comely and wholesome enough example of the same mrs bellingham also had turned towards the window and the expression of her neat face had softened the selfconsciousness the worldliness therein usually displayed were in abeyance while the beautiful content of motherhood was regnant visibly enthroned laurence had never supposed she could look so charming and he could have found it in his heart to envy his friend jack bellingham very early in their connection virginia had pointed out to him with consummate tact but entire lucidity that the modern husband who marries a fascinating woman of society and really appreciates her will give proof of such appreciation by relegating the matter of childbearing to a dim and distant future it will come all in good time no doubt but it can wait for is not it really a little too much in these days of enlightened equality between man and woman to require the latter to forego amusement to endure serious discomfort risk her freshness and her figure even come within measurable distancein not infrequent casesof the supremely foolish calamity of deathpolitical economy and the health of the race notwithstanding let the poor breed let the obscure breed let that innumerable company of women to whom life offers so much of a trial and so little of a pastime that in the sumtotal of their infelicity one pain or peril the more cannot make any appreciable differencelet these breed but spare the fair virginias those fine flowers of wealth and worldly circumstance to whom fortune shows so radiant a face it is simple justice and reason so to doat least such had been virginias argument but as laurence now reflectedwiser by some year and a halfs experience of woman and matrimonyif life on the lines of the commonplace is to afford its legitimate compensations it must not be trained too fine or jockeyed too carefully the mans ear must not be too ready to hear specious arguments nor his imagination to entertain too elaborate sympathies he must compel those said fine flowers to bow their heads to the common yoke all his life helaurencehad been liable to stultify himself by permitting his imagination to turn up in the wrong place what good luck to have been born like his friend cheery jack bellingham devoid of that embarrassing faculty good luck for jack himself and for his wifewho just looked so delightfully prettyand for those three nice shouting scarletcoated small bellinghams otherwise only too probably nonexistent laurence had ceased suddenly to be much amused had ceased to relish discussion of mutual friends reminiscence or anecdote he rose with the intention of bidding his hostess farewell but her selfconsciousness her manner and manners came back with a snap why mr rivers you do not propose to leave yet she protested i am not half through with our conversation i assure you we have not yet approached the subject upon which i am most keen for firsthand information i am perfectly wild to hear on what terms you believe virginia with her bright fearless highlydeveloped modern temperament will be with your family spectre xii laurence drew himself up with a sharp sensation of annoyance geniality and wistfulness alike departing from his aspect the matter had never presented itself to him in this combination before and it offended his taste even in a degree his sense of decency he paused a moment and then took refuge in slight insincerity always assuming dear mrs bellingham that there is a family spectre for virginia or anybody else to be on terms with why you do not really propose to call that thrilling fact in question the lady answered very brightly that would be too mortifying it would constitute the climax of the ennui from which i have suffered during the many months of this english winter i had promised myself at least one vital sensation when you and i should meet and you should tell me the true inward history of that romantic old house of yours stoke rivers she sat in an attitude arranged the folds of her boxcloth shirt patted the lace into place about her neck you make me feel very badly she said laurence objected to soiling his conscience by lying at least as much as most men but surely he argued there are cases of justifiable perjury as of justifiable homicide i am awfully sorry he said to dash your hopes of a sensation but you see neither the romantic old house or its inward history are my property as yet so i cant give either away however much i may desire to do so i know it i do not ask you to commit any indiscretion i do not ask you to tell me anything laurence braced himself how fortunate since theres nothing to tell he said his hostess looked hard at him for a moment and then at the floor there was a time before i lived among them when i believed the english to be a simple and undiplomatic nation she said i know better now laurence was halfamused halfirritated oh come he retorted its too bad to make it an international question i had promised myself such a fine time in that house she continued still gazing abstractedly at the floor virginia is i considerand i believe you know thatthe most perfectly lovely woman of my acquaintance she represents the last word of our american culture and i would advise every young girl who was ambitious of social success to study her as a model she catches right on to everything new at once and her power of repartee is great my admiration for virginia is so overpowering that it would really be a wonderful encouragement to my selfrespect to get a step ahead of her for once well i concluded i could do that in a perfectly legitimate manner i planned to ask you to let me go right around that house from cellar to garret and acquaint myself with the whole interior i wanted to see it before virginia had brought our younger and more complex western civilisation to bear upon it i promised myself great gratification from doing that as she finished speaking mrs bellingham raised her eyes that she was in earnest keenly inquisitive there could be no doubt but unhappily in asking that you would be asking me to commit the greatest possible indiscretion laurence answered laughing a little you see my uncle is alive as yet and while he lives i must obey orders orders yes and they are such preposterously unchivalrous orders that i tremble to mention them to you mrs bellingham looked away she grew a trifle anxious having the greatest fear of hearing anything even remotely morally or socially incorrect but the young mans manner tended to reassure her he appeared particularly engaging at that moment yes it will shock you he said shock you outrageously coming as you do from a country where no member of your delightful sex is ever requested to take a back seat my uncle is a brilliantly clever person but on some points he is a little mad and simply at stoke riversi blush to mention itno woman is admitted no woman is permitted to exist mrs bellinghams eyes positively flashed her face went extremely pink but this is the most unparalleled country she exclaimed mr rivers do you seriously intend me to believe that no lady may enter that house why i ask you how is it possible to conduct a domestic establishment under such circumstances ah thats the worst of it laurence said he was beginning to be amused again i tell you the condition of that house suggests the most awful reflections i am glad to hear it yes awful he repeated for it is the best mounted the best served the best kept house i have ever stayed in it is as clean as a new pin the whole thing moves on wheelsand yet never the trace of a petticoat it follows that one is assailed by the unholy suspicion that woman may be after all a quite superfluous luxury and that the work of the world even in its humble domestic aspects can get along just as well without her my uncle entertains this opinion anyhow and gives the most convincing practical exposition of it he has supplied me with a large amount of information under this head and upon my word im afraid i am beginning to see the force of his arguments after that id better go hadnt i well i really believe perhaps you had she answered for once she looked perplexed almost flurried her face was still decidedly pink but she rallied herself and fired a parting shotunless she added to make amends for having told me so very plainly that my presence would not be tolerated at stoke rivers you relent and give me the whole story of that family spectre laurence raised his head sharply and once more his sense of amusement evaporated the return to this theme jarred on him the ladys persistence appeared to him in singularly bad taste the reiteration of that word angered him moreover in hearing it he was sensible of a turn in his blood as though an insult were being offered to one very dear to him spectre he said slowly pardon meii dont quite follow you what spectre his hostess was roused in her turn why mr rivers what has happened to you she inquired what have i said to disturb your equanimity i had not supposed you to be so sensitive whereupon the folly of his anger became extremely apparent to laurence the more so that he had so recently concluded to eschew ambitious adventures and decline upon the large and unexciting levels of the commonplace in those regions hasty resentments hot blood the finegentlemanduellingspirit in short is clearly out of the picture and then why quarrel with mrs bellingham of all people she was a very charming little person specially whenas just nowher glance dwelt fondly upon her redcoated babies and their escort of nurses donkey and dogs if she had trodden on his toes it was unwittingly and without any intention of malice so he proceeded to make amende honorable with proper despatch forgive me he said i am an idiot but the legends to which my poor old uncles crankiness have given rise really begin to get upon my brain wherever i go they crop up you can understand it becomes a little exasperatinggoodbye i have had a delightful time love to jack the lady smiled upon him yet with an air of criticism and slight reserve oh yes she said certainly mr rivers love to jack but i am going to write to virginia and report on our interview i believe it is incumbent on me as a true friend to do thatyes you may come again just as soon as you like now do i not display a perfectly lovely spirit in inviting you here after you have done just all you know to explode my romance mr rivers this day will leave a scar i know it i do regret that spectre laurence smiled back looking down at her yes its a pity isnt it he said ever to explode a romance there arent too many of them about perhaps i too could find it in my heart to regret that spectre and there at least the young man spoke truth for regrets pursued him on his homeward way all this talk moreover was a nuisance an intolerable nuisance and though he did not stay to analyse the probabilities of when and how he apprehended upcroppings developments and ramifications of the said nuisance in the future mrs bellinghams question as to the attitude virginia might adopt towards the occult element in her husbands fine inheritance was more uncomfortably pertinent than the questioner could by any means have imagined it suggested most disturbing complications thus laurence rode onward heedlessly harassed by vexatious and perplexing thoughts what a confounded bother it all is he exclaimed impatiently i wish to goodness the poor old man would live for everoutlive me anyhow that would be the simplest solution of the situation he raised his head and looked about him then became aware that he must have taken some wrong turn in the labyrinth of crosscountry roads between bishops pudbury and stoke rivers that he must have struck too far southward and so lost his way the mouth of the steep rutted lane shut in by copse on either hand which he had been following now debouched on a highlying tableland small rough fields bordered the road their crumbling illkept banks bare of trees some fifty yards ahead where four roads crossed stood a lonely onestory turnpike house it was sixsided whitewashed and had a slated roof rising extinguisherlike to a single central chimney placed in an angle of the intersecting roads it was without garden ground the turnpikegate had long ago disappeared and the house a thing that had lost its use and become obsolete was in a halfruinous condition an air of cheap desolation pervaded it bundles of rags bulged from the broken windowpanes longlegged highshouldered fowls pecked and squatted in the dust before the halfopen door yet seeing it laurence was sensible that this unsightly building had a tally somewhere in his memory and claimed recognition and this impression received unexpected reinforcement when suddenly its squalid walls changed from dirtywhite to warm primrose while the surviving glass in its rickety windows gave off dazzling splendours of light anxious to learn the cause of this transformation the young man drew up and laying his right hand upon his horses sleek quarters turned half round in the saddle and stayed thus looking and listening the view was very noble southward the fall of the ground was sufficiently abrupt to exclude all middle distance with the result that the rough grasses withered bents and sorrelstalks of the near pasturefield were outlined against the immense sweep of the flat coastline far belowthis last mauve and russet and dim green was broken here and there by a pallor of sandhills and the shimmer of seawardtending streams looking west the suave contours of the downs and beachy head rose in indigo and purple against a great space of saffroncoloured sky above them but with a bar of strong light between heavy masses of purplegrey cloud gathered from out which the freshening wind blew chill the sea steelblue and dashed with whitecapped waves lifted a hard serrated edge against the horizon all this laurence saw it made a rather splendid picture big with the drama of approaching storm yet he was persuaded something was lacking as three days ago upon first entering the yellow drawingroom at stoke rivers he had after the first moment of surprise instinctively looked for certain ornaments and pieces of furniture and derived a singular satisfaction from the conviction that they still occupied their accustomed placeso now and here though to his knowledge he had never before ridden across this piece of exposed and but halfreclaimed commonland or seen the great view under its existing aspecthe instinctively gazed seaward in search of that which should support his halfawakened memory and complete the scene to his satisfaction for surelyyes surelybowling up channel under crowded canvas before the freshening breeze he should behold a fleet of some eight or ten squarerigged east indiamen their carven poops standing high out of the watervessels of about a thousand tons burden laden with tea and spices bales of delicate muslins and silks flasks of utter porcelain ivory fans brighthued parrots and unseemly little apes and as convoy of these rich cargoes to secure them their merchant captains and bronzed and sturdy crews against the rapacity of privateers sweeping out from st malo and other ports of northern france he should beholdyes surely he shoulda couple of smart english frigates squarerigged too whose clean scrubbed decks and the black mouths of whose port holes displayed grim argument of cannon ready for action should occasion so demand the ships hugging the land for greater safety from alert and hungry foes seemedwhile the wind filled the bellying sails straining their tall masts as they heeled upon that uneasy bluegrey sealike some flight of huge goldenplumage birds for all the saffron glory now streaming from beneath the gathering stormclouds in the west must lie full on them for such gallant sight laurence watched singularly moved and with a singular eagerness and so clear was the vision to his mind so necessary to the completion of the scene upon which his eyes rested that for some moments he failed to distinguish where actuality ended and hallucination began he contemplated the creation of his own brain in absorbed interest then turned and looked at the rough road and dilapidated turnpike house and then again out to sea only a blackhulled oceangoing tramp her deckhouses piled up amidships close against her reeking funnel laboured slowly down channel in the teeth of the gusty breeze this was all and then the young man understood not without amazement that the gallant show had been a thing of the imagination onlyat most a thing remembered but how and whence remembered he could not tell for how upon any reasonable hypothesis could the memory of a man like himself of but just over thirty put back the clock by close upon a century and disport itself with incidents belonging by rights to at least two generations ago it was all most exceedingly strange it amounted to being disquieting really he did not half like it yet the imagined spectacle had been very inspiring all the same it had made his blood tingle and had effectually or disastrously exorcised that spirit of indolence and laisser aller which he had solicited to take up its abode with him he sent his horse forward at a sharp trot while once again he proceeded to revise the situation for the idea presented itself that perhaps he had been over selfconfident arrogating to himself a far greater freedom of will than he in point of fact possessed it was all very fine to foreswear adventure but what if adventure refused to be foresworn he might easily propose to decline upon modernity mediocrity and the commonplace but what if these as seemed just now highly probable asserted in unmistakable language their determination to have none of him he reflected that temperament may constitute your genius or your fate your opportunity or your ruin as you have the wit to deal with it but that temperament is indestructible and that escape from ithowever inconvenient and contrary to your desire that temperament may beis obviously and inherently impossible as he meditated thus the road he followed dipped slightly leaving the bare upland and passing along the under side of a thick belt of wood which cut off the seaward view on the left between the interspaces of the hedgerow trees the inland country now lay disclosed for many miles clouds had gathered so rapidly in the last ten minutes that the sun was obscured and all the wide expanse was drowned in heavy violet and indigo shadow only a ridge of hill some threequarters of a mile distant was caught by long shafts of wild rainbow light so that it floated as a narrow fishshaped island upon the ocean of stormy colour and upon that island uplifted transmuted etherealised rendered at once unreal yet insistent vividly defined by the unnatural and searching light laurence beheld stoke riversthe long low house and its double range of windows its avenues and carriageways the block of stable buildings every detail of the italian garden its cypress spires as of fulltoned amethyst its white balustrades and statues iridescent as though made of longburied roman glass its great lawns green as malachite the dome of its limegrove touched by a dim glow as of uncut rubies in this strange and unearthly radiance stoke rivers seemed to call upon laurence to challenge his admiration to assert its existence and its claim upon his heart with a singular power it was part of him and he of it it laid hands on his past and his future alike it refused to be taken lightly as a woman wears her jewels to startle and enthral a desired lover so this dwellingplace of his people arrayed itself in marvellous wise to conquer his wavering allegiance and command his thought it would force him not to disregard its secrets it wooed him to intimacy to discovery it cried to him out as it seemed of some unplumbed depth of experience in himself that night mr rivers engaged his nephew until past midnight his manner was gracious his mind apparently unusually at peace his conversation was remarkably brilliant both in range of subject and readiness of expression first dealing with the earliest known examples of art and displaying critical acquaintance with chaldean cylinders and stelae he passed on to the persistent influence of eastern ideas upon western religious thought he discoursed of hindu sacred literature and the crowded pantheon of hindu gods noting how certain practices connected with their worship and certain symbols pertaining to it have passed into the common use of the catholic church he discoursed of the gnostic sects and their influence upon african and syrian christianity then invading the spanish peninsular in the train of the moors he delivered himself of a spirited disquisition upon averrhoes the lawyer philosopher of cordova his doctrine of the universal reason and denial of the immortality of the individual soul laurence went forth onto the bright hot corridor and paused at the stairhead he was honestly tired both in mind and body he needed and would take an honest nights rest but one thing was sure whether he had decided or merely yielded whether he represented the positive or negative element he knew not but this he did know that the commonplace and all the ease of it might wait he was not ready for that just yet xiii of the first twelve keys some slipped round without effect some stuck and were withdrawn with difficulty but the wards of the thirteenth bit into the lock and the bolt gave with a click laying hold of the cylindrical front of the escritoire laurence pushed it up and back within a row of arcaded pigeonholes was disclosed and on either side these a range of little drawers the pale bright wood of which retained its pristine polish while the colours of the painted medallions adorning them were very fresh though frail the cupids the little figures of lover and mistress courtier and prince were instinct with vivacity and gracethe heedless vivacity the artificial grace of those overripe luxurious periods which carry in their womb the seeds of revolution and social catastrophe laurence was moved observing it all evidently the bolt had not been shot the rounded front run back and this mimic world of finefanciful elegance displayed for many years and then this pretty toy of a thing seemed so slight and incongruous a receptacle for the storage of momentous secrets yet that the secrets it held were momentous dealing with problems of life and death subtle transformations of flesh and spirit the young mannotwithstanding the soothing influences of a healthy nights rest and the preeminently unexciting ones of a grey wet march afternoonfelt no doubt for he had given in as he believed finally to the adventure and with that giving in his faith in the magnitude of it suffered by natural rebound serious increase so reverently and as one who approaches a long disused shrine containing promise of strange and precious relics he opened the shallow drawers and examined their contents the first three were filled with packets of letters written on thin discoloured paper and tied some with pink some with yellow sarsenet ribbon each packet was neatly dated the dates ranging as laurence gathered in a first hasty survey from the year to the year the remaining drawers contained a collection of objects miscellaneous in character but united in the thought as he divined of whoso placed them there side by side by some exquisitely tender sentimenta mans paste shoebuckles square and bowed the silver settings of them tarnished to blackness reposed beside a womans striped waist ribbon cinnamon and white embroidered in buds and scattered fullblown roses here were seals cut from envelopes the cracked and blistered wax of them impressed with the riverss arms and crest and a store of semitransparent delicately tinted shells spoils of some fardistant southern coast there were trinkets too rings and bracelets of intricate indian workmanship and a cluster of coral charms of neapolitan origin with the tiny golden hand first and fourth fingers stiffly extended which keeps off the evil eye next little posies such as a lover might pluck and his mistress might wear for an evening pinned to please him in the bosom of her dress these last were pressed and flattened the several hues of the once radiant blossoms faded to an ashen uniformity of tint they were sadly brittle too and though laurence raised them with careful fingers crumbled to nothingness under his touch then he lighted on a mans watch a great gold warmingpan of a thing with a guard of black lustre ribbon and a bunch of heavy seals attached the back of the case bore the riverss cresta bird of doubtful lineage its wings extended for flight its talons holding something which to laurence always appeared to bear humorous relation to a fools cap the case was also engraved with the initials l r in flowing and ornate lettering and over these initials laurence paused they piqued his curiosity they also somewhat to his own amusement provoked in him a feeling suspiciously akin to jealousy they were his own yet he could not but imagine that they were also those of a person closely connected with the sweet and mysterious companion who had walked the lawns and garden alleys with him during the small hours fled and vanished at cockcrow two nights back a very definite purpose of learning more about this same personof whom he divined this pathetic store of objects to be gifts or memorialspossessed laurence had he wronged the gentle lady in life so causing her after sorrow or had some tragic happening parted him from her without fault of his and what manner of man had he been while a dweller here in ordinary fashion upon earth it became of great moment to laurence to answer these questions perhaps those packets of discoloured letters would tell meanwhile there remained another shallow painted drawer to be searched it contained wrapped face to face in a lace and lawn handkerchief two very exquisite miniatures by cosway and then though he courted surprises agreeing with himself to expect nothing save the unexpected and to accept all possible extravagance of improbability that might arise with as little dislocation of mind as one accepts the extravagancies of a dream laurence stood for a moment speechless absolutely confounded for one miniature represented his fairylady her lovely eyes and lips smiling with discreet gladsomeness her expression an enchanting union of sprightliness and of content an azure ribbon was threaded through the soft masses of her elaboratelydressed hair little curls of which strayed down on to her forehead the string of pearls was clasped around her throat she wore her transparent white frilled cape and rosered silken gown her graceful head and slender figureto the waistwere seen against a background of faint dovecoloured cloud the painter had painted fondly as a friend it would seem as well as a master of his craftand the other miniature by the same hand showing the same delightful sympathy of artist with his subject touched by the same poetic insight and grace was a portrait of whom well of himselfhimself laurence rivers not as he was today but as he had been ten years ago at oneandtwenty with astonishment bordering very closely on alarm he observed that colouring features the square cutting of the nostrils a certain softness in the lines of the mouth the shape of the head the straight set of the shoulders all these were perfectly exact while the countenance was instinct with that inimitable charm of unsullied youth that fearlessness and happy selfconfidence the attractive power of which he had only fully realised as they had begun to fade out of his aspect in the course of his passage from early to maturer manhood while the boundlessly generous aspirations of inexperience were in course of being discredited by increasing knowledge of the standards and habits of this not altogether noble or virtuous world laurence took the miniature in his hand and considered it closely with a twinge of selfabasement endowed with so ingratiating a personality so admirable a physical equipment he ought surely to have made a definite name and place for himself in contemporary history and what of moment had he to show after all for his thirtyone years of living practically nothing he feared and the young man of the miniature made better play with his handsome person and the qualities and talents which might be expected to accompany it he had been a sailor apparently for he wore the darkblue naval uniform of the early years of the century his brown hair being tied back into a queue but for these details the resemblance to himself was absolute and then suddenly with a sense of faintness as though his identity were slipping away from him and his hold on actuality loosening as he imagined it might loosen in the moments immediately preceding death laurence remembered that he had worn a precisely similar costumethat of a naval lieutenant of the time of nelsonat a fancy dress ball given in his honour at the country house of certain of his mothers relations on the eve of his twentyfirst birthday he had been mightily chaffed about his good looks and air of assured conquest upon the occasion in question and had laughingly replied that he too intended to fight his battle of trafalgar and win it only that he should take jolly good care not to fall in the hour of success but to survive and thoroughly enjoy the fruits of victory the miniatures were oval each set in a plain gold band laurence turned them over in search of a possible inscription upon the reverse of the one were engraved the wordsagnes a gift to her dear cousin and the date august upon the otherlaurence a gift to his dear love and the same date rain had followed on the stormy splendours of the preceding evening and as the young man raised his eyes absently and stared out of the great baywindow he became sensible that the outlook was comfortless enough the gardens and the distant view were blurred and blotted by driving mist while in the room itself there reigned a singularly blear and cheerless light a damp earthy odour moreover pervaded the atmosphere as though the moisture prevailing out of doors had gained access to the house carefully rather sadly laurence laid the two miniatures side by side upon the filmy handkerchief the radiant pictured faces the two graceful young heads turned slightly towards each other as in mutual tenderness and sympathy offered he thought pathetic contrast to the melancholy of this tearful morning that this young man had in no way wronged the fair and gentle woman he now felt assured but that assurance so perverse is human nature did not serve to elate him far from it as he looked first at the charming pair and then at the driving mist a sense of great loneliness almost of desolation came over him while the word spectrewhich when employed yesterday by his lively hostess mrs bellingham had seemed of such meagre and even vulgar significancenow occurred to him with a new and immediate meaning spectralthat this room was in the present dreary light while if the idea called for further and concrete presentiment he couldlooking on the fearless and hopeful countenance of that other laurence riversoffer it in his own person involuntarily he shivered since for the moment his tenure of name person and individuality seemed so questionable a matter of sufferance merelyamounting to no more in fact than a remote reversionary interest in another mans goods at random he picked up a couple of packets of letters off the top of the escritoire where he had laid them and moved across to the window it was not wholesome to look at those happy facesone his ownany longer the letters tied with a pink ribbon were in a womans hand sloped and pointed but with a peculiar elegance of lettering and evenness of line then for an instant he debated questioning whether he could without breach of honour and of the respect in which all decentminded persons hold the dead open and read these letters the position was extraordinary to the point of abrogating accustomed rules of conduct yet he felt a certain delicacy in reading a womans letters and surprising the secrets of her heart but as he turned them over glancing at the first page of each he perceived that in every case they were addressed to himself for at the top corner of each was writtento laurence rivers esq and below either dear cousin or dear love then the irony of the thing taking him he smiled to himself and said oh well come along surely i have a right to the smooth as well as the rough if i am such a very secondhand affair any way with not so much as a name or face of my own to be proud of ill at least have the advantages of my disabilities i will know how my other firsthand self was made love to and made love yet no sooner had he begun to read than he became aware that he knew that already for as he perused the thin deeplycreased pages he felt with a certainty independent of and passing all proof that he had read these sweet effusions these innocent chronicles of home life of meetings and partings pretty pleasures and junketings not once but many times already he remembered them he could almost tell what words would meet his eye as he straightened and turned the fluttering sheets of paper i am much concerned wrote agnes rivers that so many months must elapse before i can again receive news of you i preach patience to myself but that virtue though a good servant is but a sorrowful master i am pursued by fears on your account which often move me to tears when i am alone or have retired to my chamber at night you will reprove my feminine weakness and bid me take courage yet i defy you to maintain such fears are wholly misplaced in face of the wild scenes of tempest and of battle which you may be called upon to witness againit grieves me that i cannot write to you of my affection with the freedom dictated by my heart but my means of communicating with you amid the convulsions of the present terrible war are so uncertain that i constantly tremble lest my letters should fall into other hands than yours my good mrs lambert who as you will remember is ever solicitous for the maintenance of propriety impresses this danger upon me and urges reticence and circumspection i therefore entreat you dear laurence not to measure the depth of my regard by my present expression of it recall rather all the happy and unclouded hours we have enjoyed together and let them speak for me and againyour brother dudley though i grieve to say not less harsh and imperious towards others continues to treat me with all brotherly consideration and courtesy he is very thoughtful of the improvement of my mind and we still follow our studies in the italian and spanish languages his great knowledge and intelligence are of incalculable advantage to me and i trust that i prove a docile if not a very brilliant pupil i own my thoughts at times wander though i strive in gratitude to my kind preceptor to keep them fixed upon my tasks mrs lambert is unfortunately as much alarmed by dudleys opinions and conversation as ever i could myself wish that he would express himself with less violence on the subject of politics and of religion but his early travels in the unfortunate country of france and his intimate association with mr robespierre and other leaders of her sanguinary revolution have i much fear permanently warped his mind and prejudiced his judgment yesterday at dinner he entered into a discussion with our new rector mr burkinshawa scholarly and estimable personupon the rights of man and the nature and attributes of the deity asserting subversive and atheistical views with so much heat and intemperance of language that mrs lambert fled from table in tears while mr burkinshaw was i could not but see seriously offended and hurt once morethe weather recently has been continuously wet and stormy dudley reports great destruction of timber in the park i have been unable to leave the house and have spent many hours in the east parlour which your brother kindly bids me regard as my exclusive property i have read much i trust with profit nor have i neglected my music though the melancholy character of the season and everpresent fears for your safety have rendered me but a joyless performer for the songs you most admire i cannot find voice indeed i struggle with my weakness and make every effort to present a serene exterior but memory is never perhaps a more sorry companion than when she speaks of happy scenes and finallymy own dear love your packet from madalena has at last reached us what can i say to you save that my heart dances with rapture i cannot sit still but must needs run from place to place for very gladness mrs lambert reproves my lack of occupation but she is mistaken i am fully occupied in reading and rereading your letter and in thanking our merciful creator for this unhopedfor assurance of your safety i have retired to the stone bench beneath the limetrees they are in blossom now and their agreeable fragrance fills the air here i write to you while the sun shines and summer winds play lightly with the leaves do you remember our sitting here the evening you stole the new black ribbon from my embroidered bag with which to tie your hair dear love now i am convinced that you will be permitted to return to me and that we shall add yet other happy hours to those already treasured in our hearts all will be well naywhat am i writingall is well already but for my past anxiety and all my cruel fears i could not have known the rapture of the present my heart overflows i would not have one unhappy creature breathe today i have emptied my purse to a beggar and have expended unpermitted dainties upon my cagebirds and dudleys horses and dogs the servants smile upon me rejoicing in my joy ah my love i am half ashamed to wear so gay a face dudley has withdrawn to the library he is preoccupied and silent mrs lambert for all her affection regards me i fear with disapproval but how can i feign indifference you are safe you will return to me in six months i shall attain my majority and then your brother dudley can no longer as my guardian legally prohibit our marriage of that dear union the consummation of all our prayers and hopes i can scarcely dare trust myself to and here laurence found himself forced to cease reading the page was blotted the writing obliterated by rusty stains of the nature of which he could be in no doubt the further record of agnes riverss pure passion was smothered in blood he folded the letters together tied them up put them back in the drawer closed and locked the escritoire well it must have been worth while to have been loved like that did women ever love so still he wondered he opened the tall french window and once again went out hatless into the driving wet xiv mr rivers regrets that he is unable to receive you tonight sir laurence looked round with something approaching a start at renshaw the butler whose respectful colourless voice broke in thus upon his meditations the diningroom struck him as hotter and more oppressive than everby contrast probably with the buffeting wind and driving mist in which he had paced the limetree walk for a good hour before the dressingbell rang tonight the glass bowl supported by the wanton dancing etruscan figures was filled with tuberoses and carminestained japanese lilies and the odour given off by these acted on the young mans brain as opium or hashish might have actedat least so it appeared to him the longer he meditated the less could he distinguish between real and unreal fact and phantasy the best accredited articles of his moral and scientific creed had passed into the region of the open question speculation ran riot all the accustomed landmarks of his thought being for the time submerged while the wildest and most extravagant ideas presented themselves as within the range of practical action that last read letter of agnes rivers and his own resemblance to her lover had inflamed his imagination and his heart even in their one nights intercourse he had seen intelligence purpose gaiety return to her now the daring conception that such a process might be continued until his sweet and mysterious companion recovered all the senses and attributes of living womanhood formed itself in his mind was it not conceivable that this appearance might be materialised so that the fair and gracious spirit should once again inhabit a human body and know all those dear joys of love and motherhood which had beenby some evil fortune some catastrophe as he supposeddenied to her an immense ambition to be the instrument of this restoration this recovery grew within him he would work a miracle he would be as god clothing the soul with flesh raising the dead and this by no exercise of charlatanism by no dabbling in oldworld superstitions or dealings in folly of white magic or of black but simply by force of will by the action of mind on mind by the incalculable power of a great love it was impious perhaps morally it was doubtfulcircumstanced as he laurence was but it was the most magnificent experiment ever offered either to man of science or to poet here was the opportunity he had desired had waited for here was his chance in life then the butlers voice cut in bringing him down to the everyday level no wonder he looked round a little dazed mr rivers regrets that he will be unable to receive you tonight sir it said and laurence asked in answer is my uncle ill is he worse mr lowndes has brought down word that he is tired sir mr armstrong the agent arrived from scotland this afternoon while you were out mr rivers has had a long interview with himtoo long an interview in mr lowndess opinion i am sorry laurence said absently he fell to caressing his wonderful idea again but the butler waited mr armstrong requested me to add sir that if convenient to you as you will not be engaged with mr rivers he would be obliged if you would allow him to speak to you in the course of the evening oh by all means the young man said rising then he addedtell mr armstrong i will see him at once later i may be occupied where in the small libraryyes laurence betook himself to the library prepared to be bored with a good grace but he might have spared himself such preparation for looking on the newcomer he liked him the man in age about sixty was of barely middle height broadshouldered and lean about the flanks he carried his head forward stooping slightly in observant meditative fashion he was slow of movement calm one capable of having his joke and keeping it to himself his face was shaped like a kite remarkable in the breadth of the lower part of the forehead and the high cheekbones narrowing down to a long flat chin the upper lip was long too a somewhat pragmatical and selfrighteous upper lip while the eyes set far apart under the wide brow showed a clear kindly blue between the narrow lids that ended in a fanlike system of wrinkles at the outward corners the nose was thin and straight at the bridge with widewinged open nostrils the hair formerly sandy was now grey smooth on the low dome of the head and thickly waved above and behind the flatset longlobed ears in all a shrewd humorous sober countenance ruddy moreover as a wellripened autumn apple at first the agents talk was professional dealing in matters of leases and rightsofway of draining operations and the breeding and rearing of cattle of the iniquitous heaviness of road rates the culture of hops and the cutting of copses but gradually it began to take on a more personal and racial character since the scotchman is yet to be born who can go very long in conversation without blowingbe it never so discreetlythe trumpet of his own unrivalled nation so he fell to dilating upon the superiority of the scotch to the english system of national education upon the indolence and general incapacity of the southcountry labourer upon the glaring futilities and imbecilities of district and parish councils and upon the congenital incapacity of the anglican clergyevery manjack of themto deliver a sermon which would satisfy the intelligence and theological acumen of the most ordinary congregation north of tweed laurence listened amused by the exhibition of the speakers both conscious and unconscious prejudices the man was alive he was selfsecure and dependable laurence saw he would be a pleasant fellow to work with and the thought of that work began to occupy his mind opium dreams giving place before practical interests and activities laurence talked in his turn showing a keenness in business and a knowledge of it which armstrong with pursedup lips and slow noddings of the head evidently relished aweel he remarked at last after the younger man had given a particularly lucid description of certain laboursaving farmimplements employed in the wheatgrowing states of western americai trust it is no disrespect to an old master whom it pleases the almighty to withdraw to some other sphere of usefulnessor the contrary for it would be overbold to prophesy largely on that subject of utility in the case of your uncle mr riversit is no disrespect i say i trust for a man who has served such an one for over thirty years to the best of his ability to feel himself not indisposed to welcome the new master i am constrained to tell you mr laurence rivers that i looked to find in you some flighty flimsy modern runabout of a creature i acknowledge my error with thanksgiving the impression you make on my mind is far from unfavourable thats right laurence said genially i am new to all these landed property concerns as yet but i expect i shall be able to get round them pretty smartly when the time comes i think you will i think you will the agents blue eyes twinkled with a certain quiet humour upon the young man from between their narrow lids your uncle i must admit is but a feeble body in the practical domain his great understanding has so to speak not infrequently got between his legs and thrown him down it is pitiful to see any person so clever that he cannot condescend to take advantage of the handsome position the almighty has allowed him i own there have been times when i have felt rebellious against the lords too great generosity in the goods of this worldperishable i know yet deserving of considerationto one constitutionally incapable of drawing full profit out of them therefore i perceive with thankfulness mr rivers you are of a different make laurence leaned back in his chair and lighted another cigarette it was early yetand he liked the man he would encourage him to talk on for a while longer oh yes he said you neednt be worried under that head armstrong ive the reputation of by no means quarrelling with my bread and butter or despising the goodly fruits of this admittedly naughty world in whatever form i find them temperance is a canny virtue and i would recommend moderation in all things after the teaching of the apostle paul yet i am glad to find mr rivers you have your feet upon the floor it will be well for your estates at the preservation and improvement of which i and my kin have labourednot unfaithfullyfor three generations so long as that the young man ejaculated the statement indirectly suggested a former strain of thought yes for three generationsand not without trials for i would have you understand that a certain impracticability runs in your family mr riversa perversity not sinful altogether but very wearing to those that have your temporal interests at heart gently laurence blew a little cloud out of his nostrils and watched it float upward across the dark warmhued landscape by nicholas poussin hanging over the chimneypiece against the windows the rain beat while the heavy folds of the crimson damask curtains covering them swayed just perceptibly in the draught i can believe it he said my people have been afflicted with ideas and ideas play the very mischief with business dont they armstrong in their degree and subject to a thrifty discretion in their application i would not wholly condemn them the agent replied his shrewd glance dwelt on the younger man with undisguised pleasure he was so handsome well bred well made and apparently so able a fellowbut ideas are kittle cattle mr rivers he continued needing strenuous supervision if you would not have them break out of pasture and run mad sairly to the dislocation of all legitimate traffic and it has been the affliction of more than one member of your family to let his ideas run abroad to a length of pernicious extravagance for instance my grandfather a person of capacity and circumspection beyond the average was factor to your great uncle mr dudley rivers and laurence kept his eyes fixed on the last blue of the little smokecloud curling about the intricate foliations of the upper corner of the picture frame yet his voice had a certain quickness and vibration in it as he exclaimed ah dudley riversyes well how about him armstrong not much good not much good like the foolish body recorded by the psalmist he had said in his heart there is no god and having made that very impious and lying observation and so disposed of the deity he proceeded to supersede the latter in his own person and attempt the reorganisation of society according to his own harebrained fancies regarding his deliverance from dangerous delusions my grandfather could do but little being himself a godly man and holding firmly by the doctrine of election if the poor misguided creature would go to the devil mr rivers it wasso my grandfather heldbecause to the devil he was righteously foredoomed and predestined to go and so my grandfather relieved of all responsibility in that respect felt free to apply the whole of his abilities to saving the poor erring persons treasure on earth since it was manifestly not the intention of providence that he should inherit any treasure in heaven he had long taken entire charge of those estates in the county of fife which belonged to mr dudleys young cousin and ward miss agnes rivers ah laurence ejaculated softly and many a time did my grandfather undertake the tedious journey down here from the north to lend a seasonable hand in restraining mr dudley from committing some ruinous foolishness in respect of miss agnes or of his own southern property for mr dudley was just completely saturated with pernicious opinions derived from the writings of rousseau and tom paine and other such seditious persons and satan entering into him at intervals and blinding his small surviving modicum of reason he proposed to reduce them to practicepoor demented body yes laurence said he had graduated in a rather impossible school no doubt butbutarmstrong what about his private lifehis morals blamelessblamelessmores the pity since his virtues could but come under the head of works of supererogationso my grandfather heldprofitless alike in this world and in the next indeed though a strict man himself i am constrained to believe he would have experienced relief in seeing mr dudley enjoy the pleasures of sinthey are real very real while they last unfortunatelyfor a season laurence flung away the stump of his cigarette and turned sideways in his chair now as were on the subject he said and as you seem to know all about these people of mine what sort of fellow was dudleys younger brother my namesake laurence rivers weel i have reason to believe he was a very promising spriga likely young gentleman highspirited cleanliving and not without a show of capacity for affairs my grandparents both of them entertained a warm affection for himthe man paused in his slow singsong talk smilingi should surmise him to have been much such a person as yourself mr rivers with a natural gift of winning the hearts of those brought into contact with him but he fell at trafalgar shot through the lungs as no doubt you have heardcut off before he had opportunity to acquaint the world with the worth of the talents that might reside in him it was a grievous misfortune for his death took place but three months before the day appointed for his and his cousins marriage and often as a softhearted bit of a laddie i have cried to hear my grandmother tell of the coming of the awful news and the grief of the poor young lady she was a gracious winsome thing as bright as a sunbeam on a running brook very pious too and charitable so that no mortal soul could but wish her well that looked on her but she was shivered by the stroke of her sorrow as you might shiver some fragile trifle of an ornament with a careless blow she would not eat or speak for many days and her sleep departed from her and indeed during the few months of life that remained to her she rarely uttered a word her poor bits of wits seemed to drain out of her with her tears for all that she was highly educated and an accomplished musician and sweet singer laurence had risen to his feet he stood with his back to the fire his hands behind him and his head bent poor child he said softly well she knew how to love anyway no woman better but i am thinking mr rivers she introduced into her affections a touch of that same extravagance which pertains to so many members of your family for my grandmother used to tell me that though altogether gentle and docile she studied nothing but to turn over her dead loves letters and play with the various gifts he had bestowed upon her as a little lass plays with its puppets and toys it was the pitifulest spectacle under the dome of the sky that of her affliction and mr dudley notwithstanding his reprehensible opinions and infamous heresies watched over her like a father his patience knew no bounds poor body he would have laid himself down as the ground for her to walk on could that have accelerated her recovery he spared no expense of doctors both foreign and english to prescribe for her and carried her away to bath by their advice to drink the waters there but all the medicinal waters that ever welled up through the length and breadth of god almightys curious earth are powerless to ease the ache of a broken heart she wanted but one thing and that no mortal soul could give her and so poor white lily of a thing she just sickened and faded and died laurence stood very still looking down at the hearthrug between his feet while the rain beat against the windows the agent watched him for a little space and then rose a trifle stiffly and carefully from his chair i am keeping you over long with my family histories mr rivers he said but it comes to me that we are about to see great changes in this place very speedily and our conversation tonight has been a valediction to the old dynasty and a recognition of the new there has been no lady at stoke rivers since miss agnes died and you so i learn are a married man laurence left his contemplation of the hearthrug and drew himself up rather sharply yes he said my wife is much interested in the prospect of this english property he turned his back and stared into the fire look here armstrong he said where was sheagnes rivers i meanwhere was she buried a singularly acute expression came over the agents countenance he looked hard at the young man but the latter did not move or turn his head the wind increasing in force broke as in great waves against the house front and the curtains swayed sullenly in the draught armstrong cleared his throat i am thinking its a calamitous night for too many poor folks at sea he remarked and then addedburied weel presumably at bath where she died mr rivers a grand funeral took place there to my grandfathers knowledge for he was called upon to journey the whole long way from cupar to attend it and the snow lay some foot deep in the north a grand funeral truly in appearance with black horses and plumes and lumbering black coaches and all signs of respect and customary outward manifestations of woe still laurence did not move but the gusty wind was so loud that it obliged him to raise his voice in asking well well if there was all this display about the funeral why presumably then because i am constrained to admit that a certain mystery surrounded that transaction my grandparents would never speak directly of it being prudent persons and knowing conceivably more than it was becoming for them to tell but there were tongues that said mr rivers that no sweet lassies corpse lay in that coffin but only books and cast clothes and bricks and rubbish to make up the weight laurence turned round suddenly his face was keen his eyes alight but why he asked partly i surmise on account of mr dudleys atheistical views which caused him to hate and scorn all decent christian rites and ceremonies and partly because of the feelings he entertained towards his cousinfor it was well known she was the only human creature that had ever moved him to loveit was apprehended he refused to part with her body even in death for a few moments the two men looked hard at each other and what then laurence demanded armstrong raised his hands almost as in repudiation of his own thought the lord only knows he said as the poet says there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our philosophy but i being a practical man do not concern myself with such mr rivers i would not learn more of hidden matters than is strictly necessary to salvation if it is the intention of the deity that further revelation of laws either natural or spiritual should be granted us such revelation will without doubt come at the time appointed and so i personally would not force the hand of providence or be over forward in pushing myself into its secret counsels he paused regarding the younger man with much friendliness and some anxiety but laurence did not speak he merely smiled holding out his hand aweel good night to you then mr rivers the agent said taking the outstretched hand and holding it awhilei must repeat i am glad to carry away so favourable an impression of our first meeting but as a word at parting having in mind the tendencies of your family constitution i would earnestly commend to you those canny virtues moderation and temperance in all your undertakingsi will be resident here for the coming week or longer should a more protracted stay be incumbent on me in the interests of your affairs or your uncles my sons are good steady lads and will mind our northern business for mea business not unprosperous or decreasing and so you can notify me at any time should you feel an inclination to acquaint yourself further with the workings of this estate or other items of poor mr riverss by no means inconsiderable property xv for some minutes laurence remained in the same position before the library fireplace while the rush and wail of the storm without offered marked contrast to the silence and close warmth reigning within he knew all the facts of the case now as far as they were attainable by tradition they proved to be very simple but as he reflected the simplicity of the symbol by no means invalidates the profound character of the mystery of which it may be the outward and visible sign nay the very simplicity the tender human pathos of this story of love and sorrow only engaged his heart and provoked his enterprise the more counsels of selfsaving moderation he waved aside with a smile of danger material moral or spiritual he was defiant with the veil of isis there visibly confronting him and invitingin gentlest most confiding fashionhis hand to lift it would it not be unpardonably poorspirited callous and unfaithful to draw back but virginia laurence moved impatiently from his place he wished to goodness armstrong had not referred to virginia or rather to that circumscription of his personal liberty which virginia presentedto his marriage in short he was very fond of her of course he was very fond of hernot for a moment did he doubt that but must it be a matter of primary duty and honour that he should relinquish the part of hero in this piecethis noble and enthralling piece which made vibrant his whole being and stirred the finest of him into activitysimply because virginias name did not happen to be in the bill marriage came perilously near a disaster if it clipped your wings as much as all that and he would indeed be a bigoted moralist who should maintain that no circumstances can be so extraordinary no opportunities of knowledge or spiritual advancement so rare that they justify a neglect of conventional rules of conduct or permit the relegation of ordinary obligationsfor a time at leastto the second place thus did the young man argueambition chivalry and those hereditary tendencies towards a rather violent reduction of theory to practice against which he had so lately been warned all conspiring to one result and so at last his head erect andthough he knew it notthat air of assured conquest about him which had sat so charmingly upon his namesakeperhaps his rivalthe laurence rivers of the cosway miniature he swung down the still crimsoncarpeted corridor pulled the stiff tapestry curtain forward passed behind it and entered the room beyond he laughed a little to himself he was all of a white heat he would be as the gods working miracles righting wrong conquering death sharp disappointment awaited him the yellow drawingroom was brilliantly lighted the atmosphere of it was fresh almost to the point of chill the miniatures lay side by side upon the escritoire where he had placed them some four or five hours earlier but his sweet fairylady was not there to receive him the room was vacant of all human all visible presence save his own the hours which followed were among the most poignant that laurence had ever experienced he had made so certain that he needed but to open that door to regain the unreal world yet worldas he believedof profoundest reality which enchanted while it baffled and perplexed him he found himself compelled to admit moreover not without a sense of humiliation that his attitude was not exclusively pathological or scientific a good deal of the natural man and the natural mans affections and vanities entered into it he craved once again to see that slender flitting figure to feel the vibration of that otherwise impalpable hand to read the trust and exquisite sympathy of those lovely eyes he craved again to be aware of the fervour of his own eloquence the rush and spring of his own thought moreover he felt jealous absurdly but increasingly jealous of that other laurence rivers of whom for all his vitality and immediate consciousness of living energy and active will he seemed to be but a second edition the man had forestalled him in face and semblance forestalled him too in the heart of the woman it would beit was he fearedonly too easy for him to love and so he wandered aimlessly restlessly about the bright empty room almost as his sweet roseclad lady had wandered on the night he first met her searching searching for some lost good while as time lengthened and his nerves grew strained by impatient waiting and want of sleep fears that by his own action he had procured this disappointment began to assail him he was always overconfident blundering from too great selfbelief for might it not be that in opening her little treasurechest in touching those objects so dear to her dead fingers and dead eyes in reading her lettersnay in striving to approach her and establish relations with her at allhe had outraged her delicacy had in a sense assaulted her soul had been guilty of spiritual insult as in grosser material existence a man might assault or insult a womans person had he unwittingly transgressed some law obtaining in the world of spirits in the state of being which lies outside and beyond the gates of death and of which human beings bound by the conditions of their earthly environment have as yet no cognisancewhy should not the mind and heart be sublimated to as exquisite a fineness of texture in her case as the body had been this idea of possible outrage of unwitting grossness towards her was horrible to laurence it stabbed him with shame and provoked in him a passionate desire for absolution if she would only comeonly come that he might implore her pardon gain forgiveness orstill betterreceive comfortable assurance that he had not sinned his restless wanderings brought him at length to the baywindow and he looked out into the night the storm had not abated dimly he could perceive in the light streaming outward from the window the rainwashed steps the pale balustrades and statues of the garden the near cypresses too bowed and straining in the gale which shrieked across the open lawns and bellowed hoarsely in the woodland like some fierce beast let loose and laurence viewing this tumult and listening to it suffered further humiliation he became but a small thing in his own estimation weak futile incapable for to what after all did his force of will and power of compelling events amount he thought of armstrong the levelheaded and circumspect scotch agent of his uncle dignified and even in mortal illness faithful to the clear purposes of his long life he thought of virginia strong in virtue of her very limitations glittering as a wellcut jewel concrete complete all these persons occupied a definite place served in their degree a definite end whereas for himself was he not the veriest sport of nature and of circumstance endowed with just sufficient wit sufficient talent to court failure in any and every direction his initiative that had lately showed godlike now shrivelled to microscopic proportions while a further unwelcome question presented itself for had the gracious spectrehe no longer quarrelled with that definitionlived as he had fondly supposed through his life regained reason and glad human sympathy through the influence of his will or had the case in very truth been precisely the reverse had not she been the active he the merely passive principle had he not reached a higher development and gloriedfor a little spacein conscious possession of genius had he not lived in short through herand this not by exercise of direct intention on her part but merely in obedience to the might of her love for another mana man long dead but whose name he chanced to bear and whose appearance he chanced to resemble and thereupon a hideous persuasion of his own nullity and emptiness took hold of laurence individuality fled away disintegrated dissolved and was not the component parts of his physical being returned to their original elementsflesh to earth gases to air heat to fire blood to water while all the qualities of his mind his tastes and affections suffered like dispersal being claimed and absorbed by the members of those many generations whose earthly existence had contributed to the eventual production of his own and the terror of this was augmented in that although every atom of his being was thus scattered and appropriated every smallest fraction of that which had gone to compose his personality was dispersed yet annihilation of thought did not follow he was reduced to absolute nothingness but knowledge of disintegration knowledge of loss knowledgerebellious and despairingof that same nothingness remained appalled with the instinct of flight upon him as from some menacing and immeasurable danger laurence turned and groped his way backas a blind man gropesinto the centre of the brightly lighted room the persuasion of his own nothingness seemed to extend itself to his surroundings all partook of the nature of illusion from which sense of sight and touch alike seemed powerless to redeem them and this begot in the young man an immense desolation and a corresponding need of comfort and of quick human sympathy involuntarily in his extremity his thought fixed itself stayed itself upon agnes rivers ah if she would but show herselfshe his wellbeloved fairyladyhe was convinced peace and clearseeing would follow in her train that this terror of nothingness would depart and that sanely calmly he should enter into possession of himself once more and then presently as he moved to and fro in restless search for her it appeared to him that a rosered gleam of silk a just perceptible whiteness of muslin and lace the faintest vision of a vision of her sweet and lovely face moved beside him as he moved it was as though an indefinable tenderness yearned towards him from out some impassable distance striving to declare itself to make itself seen and felt yet without force to master some opposing influence and accomplish its object and this awoke in laurence not only an answering tenderness but an answering struggle he stood quite still yet with every nerve every faculty strained to attain and overcome he felt braced by a sudden exhilaration of battle silently fiercely he fought with some awful unseen enemywith dimly apprehended powers of time and place of death of things spiritual and things material which intervened between him and the love which sought to reach him never had he desired anything as he desired this love his individuality was actual enough now and his whole body ached with the effort to penetrate that resistant medium to be face to face with that love and look on it and so doing to read the riddle both of his future and his past but when the warfare was at its height and the unseen enemy seemed to yield a little while the slender form of his roseclad lady grew more distinct to laurences eyes unaccustomed noise and confusion arose within the deadquiet house doors opened and slammed as with the hurry of panic mens footsteps echoed imperatively down the corridors and upon the stairsanother moment and he would overcome all resistance and his dear companion would stand before him smiling gracious full of consolation and of help but just then voices were raised in quick discussion without suddenly the door was thrown open upon the threshold was renshaw the butler bereft of his usual correctness of demeanour his eyes starting his skin mottled with purple stains behind him stood watkins holding back the leatherlined curtain to the utmost of its length thereby disclosing a triangular vista of darkpanelled passage and the proud heads and arrogant impassive faces of the rulers of imperial rome evidently both men dreaded to venture one step further into the room will you please to come at once sir renshaw called hoarsely excuse me sir you are wanted mr rivers is very ill he has asked for you mr lowndes fears he is dying xvi the agitation pervading the house was sinister laurence felt as though witnessing the convulsions of some human body seen only heretofore amid the restraints and graceful amenities of society but now abandoned and indecently torn in its last agony if indeed mr rivers was dying his soul was not merely quitting its fragile fleshly tabernacle but was also very sensibly quitting this larger tabernacle of house and household which it had informed through a long course of years and moulded to express its tastes flatter its idiosyncrasies and forestall its every wish it was fitting therefore though fearful that this outer envelope of the owners life should be shaken and lose its habitual immutability and impervious calm while his welldrilled servants usually obedient as machines to the direction of his hand ran distracted scared and helpless as a flock of frightened sheep the men hurried aimlessly spoke in whispers members of the establishment with whom laurence was unacquainted invaded the corridor from the direction of the offices at the foot of the staircase were grouped the stout french chef in spotless linen cap and jacket his attendant scullions and a couple of men arrayed in long green baize aprons and black calico blouses the full sleeves of which buttoned tight around the wrist the coachman was there too a stable helper and the groom who had accompanied laurence on his first visit to bishops pudbury all these persons were well on in middle life some old whitehaired and bent all appeared deeply moved an inarticulate confusion in their looks as though finding themselves suddenly confronted by dire calamity laurence had seen men look thus in the breathless pause between recurrent earthquake shocks among the rocking buildings of a faraway spanishamerican city as he passed them coming from that light clearcoloured room they stared at him and slunk aside as though a fresh terror was added to those which already so unmanned them in their present state of feeling the seemly decorum of respectful service was relaxed and to laurence overwrought by his recent and strange experiences it appeared that they shrunk from him as from one unclean and outcast he turned rather sternly upon renshaw what is the meaning of all this commotion if i was wanted why on earth was i not called sooner the butlers large smooth eggshaped face turned from purple to something approaching grey we had looked for you everywhere sir both myself and mr watkins he answered but until mr lowndes suggested it in consequence of some remark passed by mr rivers it had never occurred to us that you would be in the yellow drawingroom sirrenshaw cleared his throat recovering some of his accustomed dignity of bearing the electric light is switched on from the corridor outside you will observe sir it has always been understood that no oneneither the upper or the under servants sirare ever required to go into the yellow drawingroom after dusk and with these words and their implication of commerce on his part with something unlawful and malign sounding in his ears laurence passed into his uncles bedchamber as he did so a blast of air hot and dry as from the mouth of a furnace met him the fire upon the hearth was piled up into a mountain of blazing coal and wood the light of it filled the room with a fitful lurid brilliance such as is produced by a great conflagration in it the breasts of the couchant sphinxes glowed seeming to rise and fall as though they breathed the caryatides supporting the ebony canopy likewise appeared imbued with life their smooth arms and bowed shoulders strained under the weight resting upon them while the wreaths of fruit and blossom girding their naked loins heaved from the painfully sustained effort of nerve and muscle the snakelocks of the medusas head carved in high relief upon the circular central panel of the back of the bedstead writhed twisted interlaced and again slid asunder as in frustrated desire and ceaseless suffering and along the middle of the great bed surrounded by these opulent forms and at first sight far less alive than they lay mr rivers his face was so blanched so unsubstantial that but for the glittering eyes still greedy of knowledge it would have hardly been distinguishable from the white pillows supporting him his shoulders and chest were muffled in a costly sable cape from beneath the lower edge of which his hands thin as reeds protruded lying inert upon the thicklywadded blueandgold damask coverlet on the oak tablemoved from its place by the armchair to the bedsidewere the few handsomely bound books the crystal memento mori resting on its strip of crimson embroidery and a silver bell the handle of it shaped as a slender winged mercury elegantly poised for flight behind the table stood lowndes the longarmed hardfeatured valet he apparently remained untouched by the spirit of anarchy let loose in the house laurence drawing near looked at him silently asking instructions the man fetched a chair and placed it close against the bedside be so good as to lean down sir he said mr rivers wishes to converse with you but he has had a seizure which has slightly affected both his speech and hearing he cannot raise his voice laurence did as he was bidden he leaned towards the old man resting his right hand upon the haunches of the ebony sphinx which felt singularly warm to his touch the term of your probation and of mine alike draws to its close mr rivers said in a small thin voice and for almost the first time in their intercourse laurence saw him smile i hope this is only a passing attack sir and that you may rally he answeredhe looked up at lowndes has everything been done that can be have you telegraphed for the doctors i have administered the prescribed restoratives but mr rivers ordered that no further measures should be attempted until after his interview with you sir the sick man raised his hand feebly yet with an imperious gesture i do not propose to ask further advice of physicians he said their science is but a mockery at this juncture at least in the estimation of a person of my habit of mind that by the employment of drugs and of stimulants they might prolong a semblance of animation in this physical husk of me i do not deny but what advantage can accrue from that when my mental activity is becoming paralysed and the action of my brain grows sluggish and intermittent when all that differentiates a human being from the brute beasts has perished let the animal part perish also the sooner the better for in itself it is far from precious his voice had become very faint and he waited making a determined effort as laurence perceived to rally his ebbing powers tell lowndes to go he whispered i wish to be alone with you then as the manservant noiselessly withdrew the thin but barely audible accents again stole out upon the fiercely heated air the body its necessities its passions its perpetually impeding grossness throughout life is an insult to the mind but the final act of this long course of insult namely the decay of this vile associate is the culminating insolence the most unpardonable insult of all i have trained myself to ignore these thoughts to disregard them as a proud man disregards some mutilation or personal disfigurement but they crowd in upon me refusing to be disregarded tonight here lies the sting of the insult for as the strength of this vile animal part of me lessens far from setting the intellect free it infects this last with its own increasing degradation the lower drags the higher down along with it they grovel together contemptible doubts and fears assail me discredited traditions press themselves upon my remembrance and the burden of it all is this that i have laboured in vain as the body dies so dies the mind all the garnered knowledge of years will be lost will drop infertile into the voidthe insatiable void which yawns alike for high philosopher and for drivelling pothouse sot his voice sank in uttering the last few words into a whisper of concentrated bitterness his eyes closed and for some minutes the dying man lay motionless laurence could not bring himself to speak the words to which he had just listened so nearly reproduced and rendered articulate those sensations he had himself so lately endured the vision of allabsorbing nothingness again arose before him as background to those opulent forms classic and pagan upon which his eyes immediately rested an unholy and voluptuous life seemed to move in those forms still a smile curved the heavy lips of the sphinxes the rounded glistening arms of the caryatides appeared outstretched less in support than in solicitation while the snakelocks of medusa writhed pushing upon each other amorously the flesh triumphant in vigour and in carnal invitation seemed indeed to flout the intellect as though the animal functions of mankind and the symbols of these alone had power to survive from age to age were alone arbiters and architects of human fate and yet yet somewherecould he but have reached itlaurence knew there was a way of escape that he had come very near reaching it in the final moments of that silent struggle downstairs when the sweet figure of his dear fairylady grew increasingly clear to his sight he could not doubt and once again with a great desiring he desired her for his faith was strong that of all these things she somehowhow he could not say as yetheld the key just then mr rivers raised his eyelids slightly and turned his head upon the pillow it is very horrible he said slowly speaking to himself rather than to his companion the quantity of matter is stable it for ever seeks its own and finding it reunites the destruction of one form is but the necessary prelude to the development of others and in this process of perpetual redistribution not a fraction of the sum total is lost there is no waste save in the higher aspects of mans constitution but here laurence roused himself to protest matter returns to matter sir granted he said then why not spirit to spirit are you not assuming a waste which you cannot prove and if spirit does return to spirit what better than that after all can we ask spirit mr rivers retorted with a fine inflection of irony and momentary brightening of those halfclosed eyes you my dear laurence employ words glibly enough which i hesitate to pronounce matter i know it is evident to the senses its actual existenceberkeley certain oriental and other philosophers notwithstandingis within certain limits susceptible of proof and intellect i know its existence though on other lines is equally susceptible of proof its action can be registered and ratified but spiriti will thank you to inform mewhat is spirit the young man bowed himself together resting his elbows on his knees he smiled with a halfhumorous air of apology that i cannot tell you sir he said im better at conviction than at explanation im afraid i only knownot with my reason but with my heartthat spirit is and has been and must be everlastingly and its mode of expression its mode of selfrevelation the other inquired drily laurence straightened himself up laughing a little one way the old whychildish perhaps yet really rather charming in and by love sironly so by love tremulously mr rivers drew the rich sable cape closer about him though the heat of the room was intense i become very abject he said at last i procrastinate and risk letting slip the opportunity still permitted me for in my abjection i own i clutch at straws miserably anxious for support i am ashamed that any other human being should witness the mental prostration to which physical illness has reduced me but time presses and compels me to delay no longer in confessing my object in calling you to me tonight tell me laurence have you investigated those abnormal phenomena of which we spoke and have your investigations yielded any result the question took the listener somewhat by surprise and he hesitated before replying the whole matter had become of such vital importance to him personal intimate among the dearest and most reverentlyheld secrets of his heart so he shrank as before an act of profanation from submitting the history of his fairylady and of his strange relation to her to the criticism of this coldblooded sceptical intelligence yet he was bound by his promise to report if called on to do sobound too in mere humanity towards one lying at the point of death and to whom that history might conceivably bring solace and enlightenment yes i have investigated the phenomena in part he answered and the result briefly i think that which i ventured to state to you just nowthat love is the language of the spirit the only medium through which spirit can declare itself and be apprehended the one element of our poor human constitution which promises to continue and to preserve to us a measure of coherence and individuality even after death the young man leaned forward again and laid his hand on the warm haunches of the ebony sphinx with a movement of slight defiance listen he said please sir and ill do my best to tell you exactly what has happened since we spoke of this subject last he steadied himself to his task trying to keep his narrative circumstantial and restrained to offer nothing more than a bald statement of fact but the charm of it once he had started was a little too much for him his speech grew lyrical against his will and mr rivers listened his eyes closed his brow drawn into hard lines by the effort of attention once he held up his hand did you question this appearance he asked it was useless laurence answered with a queer break in his voice she never spokethat is in words she was dumb that is unfortunate mr rivers said coldly well pray go on and laurence obeyed recounting with but slight reservation all even to the events of the last few hours when he and his sweet companion had vainly sought to reach each other in defiance of some mighty opposing force and how at the crucial moment of the struggle mr riverss summons had come there sir said he finallynow you have it all as far as i can give it you i dont attempt to explain though i may have my own ideas on the subject ive tried to put it quite honestly before you and must leave you to thrash the meaning out of it for yourself for some little space the sick man remained silent then he raised both hands and let them sink back upon the coverlet with the gesture of one who bids farewell to hope fables he said bitterly fables i ask bread of you and you give me a stone i offer you an unprecedented opportunity of psychological study and you approach it in the spirit of a balladmonger or a mountebank i require from you close observation scientific acumen an unrelenting pursuit of truth and you put me off with some old wives tale of lost letters the ravings of an hysterical girl of reincarnation multiple identity and i know not what farrago of sickly sentiment and outworn superstition you trouble me with rubbish which it would be an impertinence to offer as material for serious consideration to a peasants child of ordinary mental capacity in a modern boardschool nor can i my dear laurence acquit you of insincerity since you trick out this unworthy stuff in the extravagant language of an erotic poem while claiming for yourself an attitude wholly platonic and superior to animal passion you are harsh sir laurence was permitted to remark mr rivers turned his head on the pillow his expression was distinctly malevolent i begin to gauge the average man he replied calmly i begin to recognise that he is a willing probably wilful selfdeceiverthat he is incapable of mental advance that he will never expunge the mythological element from his religious outlook or learn to discriminate between emotion the product of the senses and accurate knowledge the product of laborious enquiry and elevated thought perhaps he is wiser so laurence said perhapsi speak subject to correction sirbut perhaps he gets into touch that way with things not altogether unimportant in the long history of the human race here within measurable distance of dissolution i grow somewhat weary of perhaps yet i deserve that you should answer me this since i have shown myself very weak i had not courage to embrace the remarkable opportunity of investigating the phenomena of which we have spoken when it was offered me in my prime now in my decadence surreptitiously and at second hand i try to acquire the knowledge i then repudiated i clutch at straws and the straws sink with me it is just for the second time i am untrue to my principles i accept the rebuke during the last half hour there had been a lull in the storm but now the wind shifting to a point north of west hurled itself against the housefront with renewed fury and screamed against the shuddering casements as though determined to gain entrance the effect was that of personal violence intended and with difficulty repulsed to laurence an inrush of the tempest would have been hardly unwelcome for the heat of the atmosphere oppressed him to the point of distress nor was this all once more he became aware so it seemed to him of the tremendous unseen presence with which he had struggled earlier this same evening in the yellow drawingroom below he was aware that it stood on the far side of the great ebony bed waiting and the young mans heart stood still he saw mr rivers gather the sable cape more closely about him as he lay staring out into the austere yet luxurious room and he recognised that for all his mortal weakness there was a certain magnificence in the dying mans aspect and beyond the superb and always unredeemed promise of human life a blank mr rivers said at last his voice hollow and though so small asserting itself strangely against the tumult of the storm reason learning the senses carry us thus far only to project us against a gateless barrier at the last but laurences whole nature arose in fierce revolt again he renewed that awful struggle but this time in articulate speech no no sir he cried sharply authoritatively the barrier is not gatelessthat is to any one of us who has ever even dimly and passingly known truelove and that of which truelove is the everlasting exponent and blessed symbol namely almighty god and i have known neither mr rivers answered love i have never felt god i have never needed either as an object of worship or as incentive to prayer therefore for me on your own showing the barrier needs must remain gateless he bowed his head slightly smiling upon the young man with a fine ironical courtesy i will ask your pardon for any weariness i may have caused you laurence he added and now i think we have nothing further to say to one another i have no quarrel with your fulfilment of your part of the contract it has been onlypossiblytoo complete so i will detain you no longer you can leave me i bid you goodnight the young man would have answered with some kindly words of farewell but as the other ceased speaking he became aware that under the glistening outstretched arms of the caryatides that tremendous unseen presence bent downwards extending itself sensibly over the bed suddenly and with a surprising effect of strength mr rivers started into a sitting position lowndes he called imperatively and reached out for the handle of the silver bell but before laurence could render him any help he sunk down sidewaysas though under the weight of a heavy blowthe upper part of his body hanging over the edge of the bed and his thin reedlike hands with their ancient and mysterious rings dragging upon the carpetdead xvii the afternoon was fair and mild a pensive charm upon it of misty sunshine and light fugitive shadowsone of those tender silvery afternoons very characteristic of an english spring it was as though nature repentant of the violence of the past night would disarm resentment by softness of mood pretty invitations and all manner of insinuating caresses thrushes piped among the high branches and on the houseroofs starlings whistled and chattered their crops filled with succulent comfort of worms and slugs upon the wide lawns two pairs of grey wagtails scampered with interludes of lovemaking and rapid upward flutterings after young gnats and fliesborn out of due time and paying speedy and final penalty of too precocious an advent the year had fairly turned its back on winter at last and a promise of genial days warm lingering twilights and tranquil nights was in the air yet the late storm had not departed altogether without witness for laurence pacing the broad walk from the last steps of the italian garden to the confines of the limegrove could hear the hushing of birchbrooms and the ring of an axe one of the tall cypresses had fallen right across the central alley and gardeners were still busy chopping it up carting away blocks of red wood and barrowloads of scented branches and obliterating the traces of its downfall laurence paced the walk in a state of dreamy abstraction the influences of the hour and the place were soothing to him their last interview and the final scene in his uncles bedchamber had affected him deeply today had been full of detail he had spent great part of the morning at the little grey norman church in company with armstrong mr beal and the estate mason superintending the opening of the riverss vault and such alteration of the position of the coffins it contained as to render possible the addition of another to their number upon the coffinplates he read the names of many members of his familyof dudley rivers and others and that of his own father denbigh rivers who had died on foreign service in malta when helaurencewas a child and whose body had been sent home not without cost and difficulty to lie among his kindred in this quiet place of agnes riverss coffinthough he closely examined all such as were still intacthe discovered no trace there wont be room for me or mine down there armstrong he said to the agent as the two stood in the sunny churchyard flicking the clinging cobwebs of the vault from off their clothes not that im particularly sorry for that look here you see the vacant space there by the chancel wall just try if you can arrange to have it staked out and reserved without encroaching on the rights or hurting the feelings of any of the parishioners i rather fancy lying thereunless im lucky enough to die at sea and be dropped over the ships side into the clear blue water with a shot at my feet every man to his humour no doubt mr rivers the other answered in his slow singsong though i could find it in my heart to wish you a less uneasy restingplace than the swaying deeps of the ocean yet i suppose it was just there and in the manner you have indicated that your namesake and greatuncle laurence rivers found burial after the glorious battle of trafalgar laurence had stopped beating the clinging cobwebs from his sleeve and turned to the speaker with a look of quick intelligence why of course it was he said presently addingupon my word i wonderwill history repeat itself in that particular also subsequently there had been letters to write telegrams to despatch the disorganised household gently but firmly to lay hold on and now he paced the broad walk in an interval of leisure listening till the grinding of carriagewheels upon the gravel of the chestnut avenue should advise him that mr wormald his uncles lawyerwhom he had summoned from townhad arrived at stoke rivers road and completed the transit from that station and as he thus paced while the silvery sunshine and shadow gently followed one another across the face of the fair woodland landscape a little of the pride of possession awoke in the young man he had hardly had time to think of that before nor did it seem quite fitting or seemly to do so when the breath had but so lately left the body lying in that stately room upstairs yet it was indisputable this was precisely the event which consciously or unconsciously he had waited for ever since his boyhood the prospect of one day succeeding to this property had handicapped him he felt that it had placed him in a position socially slightly beyond his means it had taken from him the incentive and inclination to carve out an independent career so far it had been the reverse of an advantage from the more serious standpoint but now all that was changed he had a very definite name and local habitation he was absolutely his own masterno longer heirapparent but recognised owner and ruler of a by no means contemptible territory this was as the step from boyhood to manhoodfrom the last of a public school to the freedom and personal responsibility of youth no longer subject to tutelage laurence smiled to himself it occurred to him he had really got to grow up at last wellhe had been a precious long time about it and then somehow it occurred to him that this change in his fortunes altered and modified his relation to virginia he had lived in virginias country and among her friends almost exclusively since his marriage he had he was aware ranked somewhat as virginias husband now the state of affairs was reversed he was in a position to claim full masculine prerogativesthose of an old country of a ripe and finished civilisation well understood in future virginiashe was very charming very hed no quarrel with her of courseonly in future virginia would have to rank as his wife and thereupon involuntarily his eyes sought the baywindow of the yellow drawingroom at the foot of the semicircular stone steps on to which that window opened the gardeners still moved to and froslow brownclad figurescollecting and wheeling away the debris of the fallen cypress laurence refused to formulate further the thoughts that arose in his mind only one thing was clear to himclear as the songs and whistlings of the birds clear as the tinkle and plash of the fountains the spray of which glittered so brightly silver in the silvery lightvirginia could not come to stoke rivers just yet it was betterbetter in every waythat her coming should be postponed for a whiletill the period of mourning for his uncle was overtill he laurence had mastered all the business and organised the existent masculine household upon a new basistill he had thoroughly acquainted himself not only with the working of this but of the scotch estatetill he and virginia were free to keep open housetilltill at that moment perhaps fortunately the dogcart emerged from the shelter of the great chestnuttrees and swung round the carriage sweep to the front door laurence crossed the lawns and the angle of the italian garden quicklywhat a pity that cypress had fallen it broke the line destroying the symmetry of the garden and it was almost the tallest and finest grown of the lot in the hall mr wormald discoursed affably with the menservants while the latter divested him of more than one overcoat he was a small withered man his back bowed and his hands sadly crippled by rheumatic gout by much handling of pens and leaning over lengthy legal documents yet his movements were noticeably alert his cleanshaven busy little face was enlightened by nimble redbrown squirrellike eyes thank ye renshaw he said gentlyah yes you remember these damp spring days get into my joints i promise you ah there you are watkins yes sad affair this and sudden great shock to you all no doubt quite sobut i observe that so frequently is the case a lingering illness the termination of which grows to seem more and more remote and then the end with unlookedfor rapidity yes very sad disengaging himself from the sleeves of his second coat he perceived laurences arrival and his squirrellike eyes scampered so to speak over the young man from head to foot like the agent he appeared to receive an agreeable impression for he gave a subdued squeak evidently indicative of satisfaction ah mr rivers he exclaimed you will not remember me it is many years since we met you were a little shaver in an etonjacket and round collar and your poor uncle passed away quite suddenly at lastnot a matter for regret i venture to think few men would have been more fretted by a consciousness of failing powers remarkable intellectmr wormald keckled softly as he passed with the young man into the libraryquite beyond me out of my humble range altogether you know mr rivers i admired his conversation yet i cannot venture to pretend i attached any intelligible meaning to onehalf of what your uncle said but our business relations were very simple he disliked business too much to wish to prolong the discussion of it you will find all legal arrangements very direct the death duties will be heavy but otherwise there are no deductions i believe save one or two small legacies to the servantsdinner yes mr rivers the earlier the better for me i should be glad to put in a long evening with armstrong then we will have everything ready for you in the morning i have an appointment with a client at five tomorrow afternoon so i will ask you to let me go up by the two oclock i shall not need to encroach on your time tonight therefore it happened that comparatively early laurence found himself free to go down the redcarpeted corridor pull back the heavy leatherlined curtain and enter the room of strange and delectable meetings once again what fortune good or bad awaited him he could not even surmise he had learned one thing at least that in this connection nothing was certain save the unforeseen nevertheless he was sensible of slight surprise on finding the room shrouded in vague gloom by some oversight the electric light had not been turned on but the march evenings were long and he had come to the trystingplace before the accustomed hour the day was not wholly dead yet and twilight lingered in the neighbourhood of the baywindow after his first movement of surprise laurence found a restful charm in the soft obscurity surrounding him once again the room had resumed its effect of friendliness and if his fairylady was not there as yet no more were malign and opposing powers the place was kindly and peaceful it like the weather had settled back into a mild and engaging mood the young man felt his way across to the window and sat down in one of the giltframed brocadecovered armchairs on the right of the bay there he waited looking out now at the garden growing mysterious and shadowy in the deepening dusk now at the tall satinwood escritoire the highly polished surfaces of which reflecting the expiring light glistened so that the shape of it remained visible after surrounding objects had faded from sight how long he waited laurence did not know nor did he greatly care he had been very actively employed for the better part of the last sixandthirty hours and both as to mind and body he was in an unusually quiescent state his energies were in pleasant suspension the dimly seen room swam before his eyes he made no effort of resistance a mist clouded his vision clouded all his faculties and he slept when he awoke it was high noon he lay on the stone bench beneath the limetrees the innumerable leaves of which rustled and danced in the warm summer wind he awoke laughing from a wholly delicious dreama young mans dream of very lovely love which after long denial and delay had found perfect fulfilment he felt very light and content life was sweet this smiling summer world infinitely hopeful and sympathetic then he stretched himself smoothed the revers of his flowered silk waistcoat and straightened his lawn cravat which had been somewhat displaced during the pleasant relaxation of slumber he rubbed a trifle of dust too from the knee of his plumbcoloured breeches with his handkerchief then he stood up still laughing yet with a growing hunger in his heart since he began to realise that those delights were his as yet only within the gates of sleep and of dreams he stretched again a sigh mingling with his laughter and then discovered that through the shifting dappled sunlight and shadow agnes rivers approached him with her pretty flitting birdlike grace today she wore a pale lemonyellow indiamuslin dress spotted with cinnamoncoloured sprigs and a white and cinnamon coloured waist ribbon embroidered in blown roses and tiny buds a black velvet workbag with long yellow and black strings to it hung upon her arm while her charming head and neck showed up in high relief against the open bluegrey sunshade she carried tilted over her right shoulder laurence went forward to meet her all aglow from his recent sleep and from the fond imaginations of that delicious dream half playfully half in sharp desire of mastery he took away her sunshade and workbag and threw them down upon the turf then grasping both her hands in his he kissed and kissed them holding them high and bending his head so that his eyes were on a level with hers and there must have been something in his eyes fearful though enchanting to her perfect maidenliness for she flushed and tried to withdraw her hands moving back a step from him with an air of questioning and innocent dignity laurence laurence she said chidingly what does this mean what has taken you only happiness he answered of which having seen the dear vision i very badly need the still dearer reality ah she said and yet you will go awayhow soon we do not knowto this most unhappy war and leave me desolate yes and it is best so sweetheart he replied serious though still smilingshe was so pure so trustful and so very fair her gentle beauty racked himbest so he repeatedbest pass the time honourably fighting for king and country until your twentyfirst birthday is past and dudley can no longer forbid our marriage and i can claim you make and keep you mine forever and a day and thereupon he stopped abruptly for his elder brother had come upon them unperceiveddudley thin and tall clothed in sadcoloured browngrey coat and vest the locks of his long pale hair stirred by the summer wind in his hand a bundle of papersdudley whose high narrow head refined features and deepset fanatical eyes reminded laurence strangely of his uncle montagu rivers lying upstairs in the carven ebony bed with the crystal memento mori and the silver bell of the elegantly poised mercury handle on the table beside himbut how was that how could it be he confused two generations dudley riverss coffin he had seen in the vault of the little norman church only this morning the dust lay thick on it for more than half a century it had reposed there undisturbed whereas his uncle montagu rivers died but last night yet even while he thus reasoned the scene suffered change all around him was the roar of cannon and beneath him the screaming of two ships grinding into one another side to side upon the lift and fall of the atlantic where the sea grows short towards gibraltar and the straits they screamed those ships as fighting stallions screama fierce and terrible sound and all their decks were slippery with blood through which halfnaked men ran redfooted or falling wallowed while the yell of battle went up hoarse from many hundred throats the white sails torn and streaming were dyed wild lurid colours by the flash of musketry and uprolling volumes of smoke from the heavy guns it was as hell let loose yet discipline prevailed as did a desperate and persistent purpose through all the tumult and slaughter laurence himself felt cool lighthearted even as he shouted orders and rallied his men in no mild language his courage was high and his life strong in him he laughed notwithstanding the murderous noise the sickening and brutal sights but to his fury just in the turn of the engagement when victory seemed assured at last he felt a shattering blow at the top of his chest and the blood welled up from his pierced lungs and all the world about him grew black he staggered back against the splintered bulwarks putting his left hand upon the thin packet of letters buttoned inside his uniform against his heart and called aloudagnes agnes and out of the blackness a sweet voice speaking as from some far distance answered cryinglaurence laurencein accents of tremulous but very exquisite joy then within his palm he felt once more that just perceptible pulsation as of the fluttering wings of a captive butterfly while in the ghostly twilight still glimmering in through the great baywindow he beheld the slender form and rosered silken dress of his sweet fairylady there close at his side xviii for some moments the young man dared not move the anguish of his shattered ribs the choking uprush of blood from his lungs was so present to him that he turned deadly faint by degrees he realised that all these sensations were illusory or rather memory of that which had long ago befallen him then he asked himselfwas the cry which had just now answered his cry illusory a matter of memory likewise this he must ascertain he began speaking slowly and softly and the conviction of his identity with that other laurence rivers his namesake was so complete that in speaking as he did he had no sense of practising any deceit upon his hearer agnes he said do you remember the summer morning when like a lazy fellow i fell asleep under the limetrees and how you came to me just as i woke up and how we spoke to one another and how my brother dudley interrupted our conversation a pause followed during which he listened with almost feverish anxiety looking up into the sweet dimlyseen face was it possible that she had already gained in physical attributes and powers to the point of audible speech he almost prayed it might be so and yet what tremendous issues such development opened up at last the low faraway voice began to answer him the words came lispingly at first with a pathetic effort and hesitancy it was as the utterance of a baby child but just learning to articulate how could i fail to remember that morning since the joy of it proved the prelude to the sorrow of your departure laurence could barely control his excitement but he just managed to remain very still and to continue speaking slowly and softly was that so he said i had forgotten surely it was so she answered for dudley brought you the orders which had just been delivered by a despatchrider requiring your immediate return to your ship yes yesof course i begin to recollect he rejoined lord nelson had news of the whereabouts of the french fleet and we put to sea at a few hours notice recollect dear me i should rather think i did it was an awful rush to get ones kit together and get through and there was no end of a bother about posthorses laurence rose to his feet it was impossible to him to sit still any longer this strange awakening of memory and the miracle of his sweet phantom companions recovered speech moved him too deeply he went across to the escritoire come here agnes he said i want to look at you i must see you clearly and ii want you to look at me come while speaking he struck a match and lighted first the tall wax candles standing upon the escritoire and then those in the candelabra upon the chimneypiece beheld in their mellow light the room assumed a more than ever familiar and friendly aspect laurence felt that he was at homeat home consciously and with a security and content upon him such as he had never experienced before it was singularly pleasant to feel thus moving back he stood in front of the slender roseclad figure his manner was serious though very gentle and his voice somewhat broken by the emotion under which he laboured see i have opened your little treasurechest for you he said and i have read your dear lettersthat constituted no breach of faith or act of presumption considering how often i have read them already i have put everything carefully back in its place save our two miniatures which lie here side by side i tell you honestly i am perplexed i cant fit in the bits of the puzzle or piece out the story as yet but that to my mind doesnt matter very much for we are here together once again you and i he shifted the position of the candles so that their full light should fall upon her now let me look at you he said and as he looked his eyes grew somewhat moist for he perceived that which he had blindly desired blindly sought all his days that which had been as an ache at his heart even in his gayest hours because he needed it and had it notthough he had had no knowledge of what indeed it was he needednow stood visibly before him sweet phantom oldtime love exquisite companionhaving found her how could he ever again let her go listening to her pretty halting speech the flattering belief had once more grown strong in him that he had the powerhad he also the willto restore her to complete and living womanhood the ambition of so doing possessed him with redoubled force and the love of her rooted so deeply in that mysterious former life and former personality of his possessed him too considerations of right and wrong of duty even of honour he brushed aside the peace and content of the present the daring effort the triumph and delight of the future should that effort succeed rendered him callous to all things beside then a touch of selfdistrust took him did he please as he was pleased he wondered agnes he asked her almost wistfully tell me have i changed very much her eyes which had grown somewhat shy beneath his searching scrutiny regained their serenity she replied more readily and in more assured accents while a gentle playfulness was perceptible in her bearing you appear older she said but i will not reproach you with that since i think you have matured in character rather than greatly increased in years i could fancy you taller were not such a supposition absurd the fashion of your clothes is much alteredyou affect very sober colours now but suddenly her expression changed a wideeyed haunting sadness came back into her lovely face and she spread abroad her hands in mingled apology and appeal ah indeed she cried i fear a long long period has elapsed during my illness and alienation of mind you have had time and to spare in which to grow older to acquire new habits of thought perchancebut that idea i cannot tolerateto form fresh ties i bitterly deplore my weakness but they assured me of your death their purpose was not cruel i am sure but when i refused to believe their statements your brother dudley and mrs lambart sent for our rector mr burkinshaw to talk with me and preach resignation he preached to deaf ears poor man how could i be resigned to see all the joy of my life cut down as grass under the sweep of a scythe i did not believe them yet their reiterated assertions so worked on me that they killed hope in me and in so doing killed reason likewise yet in my heart of hearts laurence i have always known that you would come again she clasped her hands high on her bosom and smiled upon him and you have come oh my love she said you have come yes in good truth he answered while a sense of fear took himi have come for he was filled with pity and with wonder concerning the end of this adventure while her innocent passion softened his whole nature to a great tenderness as the sun softens the frozen earth in spring then he held out his hand to her in invitation and led her across to the brocadecovered sofa set cornerwise between the piano and the fireplace and for a while they both remained silent sitting there side by side and as the minutes slid away the young mans fears departed and content returned to him it was so natural to sit with her thus yet his content had an underlying pathos in it since their situationhis and hersthough immediately happy was so very strange at last he asked herdid you know me from the first and she replied with an air of gracious diffidence infinitely engagingi can hardly tell you for so long confusion has reigned in my poor mind that all had become to me vague and undetermined i was so very tired that even that which i most craved i in a measure shrank from i seemed to wander everlastingly in blank and desolate places i seemed to move in an interspace between the confines of two worlds to neither of which could i gain admittance i could not go forward neither could i go back everything baffled me everything was so difficult to understand but now you have left those blank and desolate places now you understand laurence asked keenly interested in yet a little dreading her answer i think so still joy has been too long a stranger for me wholly to trust it even yet and i fear there are still lapses and deficiencies in my intelligence i could fancybut doubtless these are but silly fancies born of illnessthat i am not as i used to be and that i feel the miss of much i once had and now have not she looked up at him her eyes troubled once more to their very depths in what am i lacking laurence she inquired piteously i feel that i am lacking and i tremble lest i should disappoint you indeed i will strive to remedy my fault whatever it may be if you will but be patient with me and tell me plainly of it and give me opportunity to effect a cure but he answered her soothingly stung by the humility and innocence of her attitude you are wanting in nothing that time will not set right but we must make haste slowly sweetheart so put all these sick fancies out of your head we will worry neither about past or future but like true economists will enjoy the present now let us talk of the time before i left you to rejoin my ship of that other melancholy time after i left you and before i came back and of the changes it has brought along with it we will talk some other dayi trust there are many days for us ahead and so they remained speaking of the incidents of that mysterious former life of which laurences recollection became momentarily more circumstantial and coherentspeaking of little things merry and tender such as lovers loveuntil more than once gusts of gentle laughter swept through the yellow drawingroom which for such a length of years had been empty of all sound of human mirth and not until the rosered fingers of the dawnin colour matching his fairyladys rosered gownfirst touched the eastern sky above the dome of the lime grove and the broken outline of the woods did laurence and agnes rivers cease to talk then she got up from her place in pretty haste ah she said smiling i must go good mrs lambart will reprove my indiscretion in having remained here so late but laurence was bound to ask her one question which had been in his mind during the whole course of their interview yet had not so far dared put to her tell me he said i waited for youwhy did you not meet me here last night ah she replied do not let us closely inquire into that something terrible was abroad in the house i think it was the shadow of death it stood between usor i dreamed it did sobut we fought against it we conquered itat least i dreamed that we did and it is gonebut now dear love indeed i too must go goodnight or rather goodmorrow carry happy thoughts away with you even as i do to sweeten rest and without more ado she flitted across the room as though her little feet in their diamondpowdered slippers could not go soberly but must dance for very joy and passing behind the tall escritoire laurence once again was aware that she had disappeared and left no trace xix the disposition of montagu riverss property provedas mr wormald had already advised laurence it would proveof a simple and straightforward description all the servants connected with the house and stables would receive a couple of years wages lowndes the valet would in addition draw a substantial pension outside these provisions laurence inherited wholly and solely a single clause in the brief will revealed somewhat of the eccentric character of its maker mr rivers directed that within fortyeight hours of his reported death a london surgeon of acknowledged eminence should use means to ascertain beyond all possibility of doubt that death had veritably and indeed taken place he further directed that armstrong the agent and a local practitioner who had attended him at intervals during his illness should be present at this rather ghastly demonstration it was added that the corpse should receive christian burial not less than twentyfour hours after the autopsy had been carried out the clause concluded with the following words i desire these measures to be takenchildish and superstitious though they may appearas a precaution against that happening in my own case which would appear to have happened in the case of a former inhabitant of stoke rivers the eminent surgeon in question hastily summoned from amid a press of work could spare but one evening for his visit he proved to be a courtly and agreeable person an amateur of the fine arts with a turn for copperplate engravings a weakness for italian ivories and an enthusiasm for antique and renaissance gems his work in the deathchamber accomplished he readily turned his attention to more pleasing investigations and during the hour after dinner before the coming of the carriage to take him to catch the upexpress at stoke rivers road he examined the contents of certain glass cases in the library and looked at the engravings hanging in the lower corridor i little imagined when i left town this afternoon he said addressing laurence with a peculiarly charming smile that such delectable entertainment was in store for me i am proud of my professionno man more so but i am not sorry to put it aside for a time and forget injury and disease and even successful dealing with them in favour of art this collection of your uncles though not large is remarkable it reflects great credit upon his judgment and taste it contains absolutely no rubbish hardly indeed a single object which it would be just to qualify as secondrateah here is another admirable thing though less in my line than those delightful gems the two men had reached the end of the corridor and the doctor paused in front of the tapestry curtain this is a very fine example he continued though i could not off hand be sure of the date how broad and yet how harmonious in colouring just a trifle broad in subject too perhaps but our forefathers were blessed or cursedi am often at a loss to decide whichwith a more robust taste in sentiment than ourselves a witty modern writer has spoken of the saving grace of coarseness there have been times when i have been tempted to endorse his phrase as he spoke he laid hold of the edge of the curtain dear me how singularly weighty he looked at his host quickly inquiringly and with heightened interest singularly weighty he repeated this house enjoys a reputation for a certain originality i understand would it be indiscreet to inquire to what this splendid portiere either gives or denies access just for a moment laurence hesitated staring his guest very full in the face so far this new acquaintance had interested him greatly his conversation had been refreshingly varied moreover laurence in listening to it had become increasingly and pleasingly impressed with the value and distinction of his lately acquired possessions he recognised a steadiness and sanity in the great surgeons outlook an appreciation of things rare and beautiful combined with a wisdom born of wide practical experience a large compassion too for the foibles and sufferings and sins of poor human nature unembittered by any flavour of contempt and so it happened that during that moment of hesitation laurence was sorely disposed to lay bare to this manwhom he would in all probability never meet againthe abnormal situation in which he at the present time found himself if any one could grasp that situation and deal with it at once justly and sympathetically he thought this man could do so since he appeared to have passed the limits of denial and scepticism and reached that composure and poise of mind wherein revolt ceases and the capacity of acceptance and belief becomes almost unlimited butperhaps unfortunatelylaurence put the inclination towards free speech from him as a temptation was he not bound by his promise to the dead he was bound still more perhaps by personal pride it appeared to him free speech would be a yielding a weakness so he answered suavely yet with a sufficient loftiness to leave no room for further question behind the curtain is that which indirectly has procured me the great pleasure of receiving you here today as he spoke he turned and led the way in the direction of the hall again im uncommonly glad he added that you have such a high opinion of my uncles little collection perhaps it may induce you to come down here again sometime from saturday to monday and overhaul the contents of these cases at your leisure i am afraid im a bit of a barbarian and dont reckon with them as reverently as i ought i am a good deal better up in the points of polo ponies than in those of popes rings i know that is no matter for regret the doctor replied in his most courtly manner my esteem for the barbarian increases rather than diminishes as i grow older and i never forget that these delicacies of art are after all the refuge of those who have outlived or injured their digestion of and appetite for simpler and more wholesome diet such dyspeptics are to be commiserated rather than commended as long as the romance of sport and travel holds you as long as you still love the bright eyes of danger you can very well afford to leave the consolations offered by gems and ivories and such like sweepings from the ruins of departed civilisations to the physically and emotionally decrepit he shrugged his shoulders ah youth he said immortal youth and the rather savage joys of iti congratulate you far more profoundly upon the possession of these and upon the magnificent health which i cannot but perceive to be yours than upon your extremely interesting house and both its seenhe paused looking rather hard at laurence and smilingand unseen treasuresa cigar yes thanks i think i will permit myself that indulgence on my way down to the stationbut to return to my contention remember we only take to sweetsop when our teeth are no longer sound enough for ships biscuit eat ships biscuit and relish it just as long as a merciful providence permits you to do so my dear young gentleman the days of sweetsop of the armchair of what we are pleased to call the judicial attitude of mind but which is really nothing save the natural consequence of a sluggish and defective circulation will come all too soon in any case adieu to you a flash of carriage lamps at the open hall door the two menservantsrestored to their habitual correctness of bearingarmed with rugs greatcoat and narrow leather bag of slightly sinister aspectthe snort of a horse in the night air fresh from the comfortable warmth of the stableand after further farewells laurence went back into the hot bright silent house no one need sit up renshaw he said to the waiting butler i shall watch in mr riverss room alone tonight for this was to be a night of abstinence so the young man had decided from the dear sight of his fairylady and the delight of her miraculously recovered speech he had a duty to perform to the dead man lying solitary upstairsthough hardly more solitary now than during the long years past in which he had repudiated all solace of human affection to laurence himself life had become almost terribly well worth living since he had set foot in stoke rivers little more than a week ago and it was to this man of cold and narrow nature that after all he owed this notable enlargement of interests and opportunitynot to mention those material advantages of houses lands and costly furnishings which had come to him gratitude was very much in place and it seemed to him that a silent vigil in that stately bedchamber would be only fitting both as an act of piety and as testimony to the gratitude now no longer permitted expression either in spoken word or kindly act nor could laurence help hoping that during those solemn hours he might arrive at a clear determination regarding the futureceasing merely to drift passive and acquiescent to the push of circumstance as a rudderless boat to the push of the tide he would direct his own course be master of his own action prepared to takefor good or illall the consequences that action might involve for all the whileand it was worse than useless to shirk remembrance of thatall the while across the atlantic under the bright american skies bright as they immediate and modern as the civilisation on which they look down was the vivacious young society beauty whom he had believed he loved whom he very certainly had married and to whomin the opinion of both her world and his ownhis honour and his whole future stood pledged the question of virginiafor the whole situation resolved itself fundamentally into thatthe question of virginia must be reckoned with and the results of such reckoning accepted once and for all he had not visited that upstairs room since the night of his uncles death the impression then received of the furnacelike fire and the apparent life and motion of those figures of enslaved and halfbestial womanhood supporting the bed were still present to his recollection but now as he passed into the room he found the change worked there very arresting all trace of that which had gone forward earlier in the evening under the hands of the eminent surgeon had been obliterated the room was orderly stately as ever but it was very cold the hearth was swept and empty one casement stood wide open and by it entered a continuous breathing of bleak wind a single electric burner was turned on and in the low steady light shed by it the carven figures of the ebony bed offered no illusion of life or motion they showed rigid as the long narrow body they guarded the angular outline of which was perceptible beneath the fine linen sheetupon the surface of which sprigs of rosemary and box lay scattered laurence moved across intending to turn back the upper part of the sheet and look on the face of the dead but as he did so a bent form rose silently from the armchair set at right angles to the fireless hearth and took up its position on the far side of the bed opposite to him though by no means addicted to nervous alarms laurence felt a chill run through him right up to the roots of his hair was it conceivable that he beheld the umbra or corporeal soul of which ovid speaks and that this phantom would keep watch with him over its own unburied corpse during the coming hours his sweet fairylady was one thing and this quite another in the line of disembodied spirits stoke rivers apparently was not a comfortable place to die in laurence registered a hasty vow that he for one would take precious good care to arrange to die somewhere else but as he gazed somewhat fearfully at the intruder it declared itself pathetically and pitifully humannothing more recondite indeed than lowndes the wiry longarmed greyfaced valet i thought it proper to wait till you should come sir he said under his breath though mr rivers has no need of my services now i have attended on him too constantly to feel it fitting i should be out of callhis voice quavered and he cleared his throathe was a gentleman that rarely praised sir some might have thought him harsh but that was because his mind was so engaged with study in all the forty years i waited on him he never gave me an uncivil word and it is not many gentlemen of whom you can say that he lent across carefully removed some sprigs of box lying high on the sheet then folded it down quickly and skilfully across the chest laurence was aware of a jealous devotion in his attitude no hands save his own should again touch his dead master but the sheet once arranged to his satisfaction he stepped back a pace or two into the shadow of the damask curtains then the young man looked long and silently upon the dead notwithstanding its extreme emaciation the face was gentler than in life this was not merely owing to the closing of the brilliant eyes an immense calm rested on it the hunger of the intellect was stayed at last and the face was majestic in its composurethe face of one who has passed for ever beyond the tyranny of desire looking on it laurence bowed himself reverently in spirit while the conviction rooted itself in him that of all virtues the most fertile the most admirable is courage for the weak the dismayed for skulkers liars and dastards in whatever department of action or of thought there is small hopeso he told himselfeither here or hereafter the battle is to the strong and therefore to be strong is the one and only thing which really signifies and then it came to him with a sense of sudden satisfaction that this most desirable thing strength was altogether part of his own inheritance did he choose to claim it for the first time he appreciated the value of that strain of fanaticism resident in his blood he had feared it a little and apologised to himself for its existence heretofore he had made a prodigious mistake for now that strain of fanaticism revealed itself as among the most excellent things of his birthright he remained motionless gazing no longer at the carven bed and its rigid burden but away to the open casementin at which came the breathing of the bleak nightwindhis head held high and a singular compression about the corners of his mouth virginiajust now virginia and all and any obligation he might have contracted towards her went for very little he stood apart complete in himself regardless of custom regardless even of socalled morality should these interfere between him and his purpose his sense of humour in regard to himselfhumour eternal enemy of all exaggerations and fixed ideaswas in abeyance he knew that knew it was dangerous but then as the courtly surgeon had so lately reminded him what so adorable after all as those same bright eyes of dangerlet danger come how and when it mayconventionalities he bade them pack all the sort of them their day was over the day of scruples was over likewise his position was unexampled he took the risks along with the joys of it as his forefathers had been so would he be he felt an extraordinary exaltation and freedom of spirit and feeling this he laughed a little just as he had laughed when rallying his men amid the roar of cannon and scream of the grinding ships in the famous seafight off the southern spanish coast at trafalgar but the old valet hearing that most unexpected and to him unseemly sound emerged from the discreet shadow of the damask curtains and stretched his long arms to draw the sheet again up over the face of the corpse you have done sir he asked in accents of severity no laurence answered the excitement of his thoughts still strong upon himi have only just begun but thank god or devil or what you will i have begun at last xx the funeral was over those few gentlemen of the neighbourhood who had felt it incumbent upon them to appear in person had departed so had the empty broughams of their more numerous neighbours who proposed to offer a maximum of respect to the dead with a minimum of trouble to themselves the archdeacon also had started on his homeward journey to bishops pudbury at mr beals earnest entreaty he had been invited by laurence rivers to take part in the function the young clergyman had been sadly exercised by scruples regarding the propriety of consigning the mortal remains of an admitted sceptic and scoffer to the grave with words of christian hope and blessing what was left for believers if unbelievers thus benefited the conscience of his superior officer was happily of less flabby texture charity before all things my dear walter the latter had said in his full sonorous voice when the ingenuous young man had unfolded his difficulties it is not for you or even for me to judge and condemn a fellowcreature if not an active churchman remember mr rivers displayed no leanings towards rome or any other schismatic body for this we must be very thankful there are occasions moreover as you will learn in time when the purely ecclesiastical attitude may fitly be modified by the knowledge of the man of the world we yield no point mark you but we abstain from pressing a wrong point at a wrong time judgment statesmanshiptherein lies the practical application of the sacred injunction be ye wise as serpents and harmless as doves to raise objections in the present case would be to increase rather than mitigate the possibility of scandalprobably moreover it would be to alienate the sympathies of young mr rivers we must learn never to sacrifice the future to the present my dear walter to do so is to fall into errors of misplaced zeala very dangerous thing much i cannot but think may be done with young mr rivers wisely handled he should prove of considerable local service to the church so the good young mans soul received comfort what a privilege it is to talk with you sir he said i always learn so much last to go as he had been first to arrive at stoke rivers was captain bellingham poor old chap i tell you ive had him very much on my mind louise these last few days he had said to his wife that morning at breakfast its only decent charity to see him through i hear hes looking uncommonly hipped you thought him rather queer you know the day he had luncheon here mercy for him the old gentleman died as soon as he didperfectly mad too i hear and an infernal temper its enough to make any one jumpy to be dancing attendance on such a deathbed as that day after day and in that gloomy ghostly house too i couldnt have done it i know without getting most frightfully broken up we must try to get him over here for a day or two write him a nice note will you louise it would be awfully good of you and i will do my best to bring him back with me tonight ought to be quiet tomorrow i suppose for the sake of appearances but the day after lets have general powys and the westons to dinner i want to rattle him up a bit but neither mrs bellinghams neatly worded note nor her husbands hospitable entreaties moved laurence rivers he had quite other fish to fry all he asked for was solitude and sunset and his courtesy was slightly perfunctory and formal in consequenceso much so indeed that on his return jack bellingham remarked to his wife rivers always was such a goodhearted sensible sort of fellow that its hardly likely coming into this property would turn his head hes above any vulgarity of that kind all the same he really was curiously standoffish to everybody today the archdeacon meant to make an afternoon of it and was a little bit huffed i think rivers was perfectly civil only he gave us pretty clearly to understand there was no call for any of us to dawdle i dont know but somehow i tell you louise i dont quite like his look we shall see it would be an awful pity if he followed in the footsteps of the late lamented and turned out a crank i know it mrs bellingham replied calmly but you omit virginia i have never seen a woman less likely to tolerate a crank as her husband than virginia and so at length the accustomed quiet settled down on stoke rivers dinner was over and the unwelcome daylight fairly flown abstinence had gone to sharpen the edge of hunger and laurence made his way down the corridor pulled the curtain towards him and entered the room of mysterious meetings in a humour to venture much at the escritoire stood his fairylady and at the sound of the closing door she turned and extended her arms a world of delicate welcome in her gesture and her face then as he came towards her she drew back a little as though penitent of the fervour of her greeting her lips moved but no sound issued from them and a quick fear went through the young man that through the action of some malign influence she had declined upon her former condition and once again become dumb this raised the spirit of battle in him and reinforced his resolution to effect her emancipation from the control of whatever opposing powerphysical or spiritualmight hold her in its grasp the more so that for all her gladness there was a hint of trouble a little cloud of distress upon her face which provoked him to indignation he hated thatbe it what it mightwhich held her sweet being in thrall agnes why is this why dont you speak to me he demanded whereat she smiled as one who loves yet deprecates anothers unreasoning heat how can i speak she asked until you have first spoken to me but why not i dont understand he said nor i she answered only i know that so it is i cannot explain the why and wherefore of this or of much besides to myself i am to myself at once real and unrealas an echo a shadow the reflection in a mirror is at once real and unreal she looked at him seriously wonderingly as though trying to take counsel with him against herself i see with your eyes i speak with your voice i comprehend with your mind when you are present when you are absent i become as the echo unevoked by any sound as the shadow when neither sun or moon look forth to cast it as the reflection in the mirror when that of which it was the image has moved away only my heart remains to me and it when you are absent longs and searches journeying from place to place formless wordless and blind sensible only of its own infelicity while seeking that which alone can bring it ease and light my poor love laurence said gently greatly moved my poor love for a space he was silent pondering upon her words almost staggered by the intensity of her innocent passion he was not worthy to inspire such devotion had that other laurence rivers his predecessor and namesake been more worthy he wondered shame covered him in face of the deception he was in process of practising upon her but he put the thought of that from him fiercely for was he not prepared to take all the risks surely his action was justifiedwas it not a work of mercy to rescue and restore this gentle and homeless ghost and then since the air was mild and the young moon lent an added charm to the formal alleys of the italian garden laurence hoping thereby both to allay his own perturbation of spirit and dissipate the melancholy which still sat in the clear depths of agnes riverss lovely eyes engaged her to come out once more and walk but though the charm of the garden was great he almost regretted that he had invited her to leave the shelter of the house she appeared so anxiously elusive and fragile a creature watching her though his courage was stubborn and his will fiercely set the task he had undertaken appeared hopeless of accomplishment but if the task was hopeless all the more must it be fulfilledthat had been the way of his people and henceforth it was to be his way and so he talked to her with a certain lightness looking at her and smiling are you happy agnes he asked her at last and she answered with a return to her daintily demure and oldworld manner i should indeed be ungrateful were i not so dear laurence yet since you question me i must own a distrust of the future works a black thread through all the glad pattern of the present she paused glancing back somewhat timidly at the house every window of it was lighted save those of mr riverss bedchamber these last were dark and blank producing an arresting effect and recalling to laurence the empty eyesockets of the crystal memento mori you are here with me she continued and again i taste happiness yet i am oppressed by the persuasion that as before in some hour of peculiar promise and security you will be called from my side and that this timeah i fear you may justly reproach my weakness and deride my farfetched alarmsthis time going you will not return or returning you will no longer find me here to greet you then very certainly i will never gothat is unless you yourself send me laurence said he walked on a few paces and then added speaking almost sullenly answering his own thoughts rather than her wordsthank heaven i am my own master at last no one can compel me i can do as i think fit and since i think fit to stay stay i most assuredly will here among my own people and in my own house he looked at his companion instinctively desiring to read approval in her eyes but her expression was one of startled inquiry forgive me she said either mrs lambart has omitted to tell me fearing to shock me or in my heedlessness i have forgotten are you indeed master here dear laurence how is that can it be that your brother dudley is dead yes he answered the old order has changedand yet not changed perhaps so very much after all for it appears the owners of stoke rivers ancient and modern are very much of one blood but in truth dudley is gone and others have gonegod rest both him and themand i reign in their stead yes god rest his soul she said and then repeated softlypoor dudley poor unhappy dudley but laurence noting her pensive bearing and hearing the gently regretful tones of her voice was pricked pretty sharply by a point of jealousy from out the long past is it a matter of so very much grief to you agnes he asked to hear the news of your cousin dudleys death whereupon she turned on him eyes very reassuringly full of love whileafter a little spaceher lips curved into a delicious and almost saucy smile ah i feared you had grown old and wise she exclaimed i was foolish to vex myself i see you are indubitably the same laurence as ever she laughed very sweetly sweeping him a delicate curtsey the very same laurence as ever she repeated exultingly then she flitted awayas though childlike joy of heart must needs find relief in movementdown the long alley across the oblique shadows cast by the sentinel cypresses until she reached the great stone basin of the terminal fountain here she paused gazing down at the smooth slow movements of the sleepless fish the borders on either side the walk were set out with bulbs and early flowering plants as yet the majority of these showed but bud or upstanding sheaths of leaf the gillystocks only were fully in blossom the clean homely fragrance of them hung in the still air but the moonlight had bleached their honest orange and russet faces making them like all else of the scene but varying degrees of light and dark alone in this colourless world frail though it was and ethereal had the sweet figure of agnes rivers retained its actual hues the brown of her hair the warm pallor of her skin the blue of her profound and now laughing eyes the soft rosered of her silken gown defied the chill of the moonlight and this as laurence moved towards her deepened alike the charm and the mystery of her appearance it captivated his imagination it stimulated his ambition it challenged the deep places of his love the hopeless task must indeed be accomplished the impossible must come to pass daring that which no other man had dared he would earn a reward such as no other man had dreamed but he must be cautious and discreet and very gentle the diplomatist for a long while to come must hold the lover in check if the end was to be gained and just then agnes riverss voice broke into a little song hardly articulate but clear and instinct with delight even as the songs of birds very early in spring when pairing time has but just begun yet enchanting as the tones were there was in them something remote and beyond the compass of human thought piercing the young man to the very heart so that he cried to her ah my dear come down come near leave your singing it is too sweet it has too much to do with spirit and too little with flesh it cuts like a knife theretherei am not blaming you god forbid only you have lived so long on the borderland between those two worlds of which you once spoke that you have a little lost touch with ordinary mortals such as i come down come near dont you see what i mean dont you know what i want and after gentle converse when that morning the dawn broke and with words of tender farewell his fairylady crossed the yellow drawingroom and passed at the back of the outstanding satinwood escritoire as her habit was it appeared to laurence that for the first time a faint shadow followed her little feet and this filled him with great and farreaching hopeas the first dim greyness of land along the horizon fills the sailor after long voyaging upon the open sea nevertheless she vanished as before leaving him solitary while of the manner of her going there remained no sign xxi days multiplied into weeks march passed into april april into may june came with all its roses the limetrees flowered once again and the scent of them was wafted across the broad lawns and in at the open windows yet laurence stayed on at stoke rivers he had ceased to apologise for or seek to justify his action the fanatical extravagant element of his character was fully in the ascendant and it was conveniently contemptuous of criticism he had become a law unto himself he stayed because he intended to staythere was the beginning and end of the matter meanwhile he made discovery of pleasures subtle and subjective hitherto unimagined living the life of the recluse he enjoyed that sense of inward harmony and freedom of spirit known only to those who dare divorce themselves from society with its many tyrannies and from familiar commerce with their fellowmen he experienced the sensible increase of willpower and the mental elation that are born of solitude silence and wholehearted devotion to a single idea the values shifted and many worldly matters many amusements which had formerly appeared to him of vital importance now began to appear slightly absurd he ate and drank sparingly since meat and liquor tend to render the action of the brain sluggish and the imagination somewhat gross his dear fairylady should regain the completeness of her humanity but he would fit himself to meet her half way on her mysterious return journey from the regions of the dead by purging himself of all superfluous animality and his environment lent itself to these practices and experiments the household had settled back into its accustomed decorum and regularity it asked no questions it obeyed in respectful silence and if certain tremors shook it at times in face of its new masters supposed dealings with things occult and supernatural it accepted them as a necessary part of its service indeed it may be questioned whether lowndes the greyfaced longarmed valet renshaw and watkins irreproachably correct of demeanour would not have suffered far greater inconvenience and perturbation had they been called upon to adapt themselves to the ordinary ways of the ordinary english countrygentleman their pride would have suffered likewise since eccentricity had been so long enthroned in their midst that its absence would have seemed a loss of prestige a regrettable coming down in the social scale they displayed much solicitude for laurences comfort and much grim alacrity in turning guests from his door captain bellinghams fears that his friend might develop into a crank appeared to be in very fair road to fulfilment but the household rejoiced silently and grimly thereat so did not armstrong the shrewd and kindly scotch agent whether the place induces a whimsicality in the family or the family in the place i would not presume to declare he lamented one day when having a crack with a trusted friend and fellowcountryman it is like the matter of priority between the owl and the egg a hidden thing transcending human wit but a certain impracticability is assuredly bred in their bones poor bodies which needs must eventually come out in the flesh of every one of them theyre over proud of the intelligence of which it has pleased the almighty to bestow on them so handsome a portionas the intelligence of saxons and southerners go you understand and being puffed up with conceit of themselves they proceed to apply their bit of unusual reason in wild and impolitic speculations to the endangering of their own and other persons peace and security a sair pity a sair pity not that i would deny degrees in the natural wrongheadedness of the poor misguided creatures the present representative of the family is a young man of excellent parts and practical ability and though i fear he is going astray in some particulars i find in him a praiseworthy application to business by times for in good truth notwithstanding the dominion of his fixed idea laurence was determined on the improvement of his somewhat neglected estate every afternoon saw him ride forth to visit farm or distant hamlet to superintend operations of fencing draining or building to mark wood and copseland for future cutting specially was he interested in the construction of a light railway from stoke rivers road to some gypsum quarries at hazledown about three miles distant the worth of which would be doubled by direct and permanent means of transport silent and selfabsorbed for the most part he rode about the charming sussex country while the gay spring weather matured into the glow and heat of summer and all the while against his heart lay the poignant delight of a great romance and in his eyes sat the light of a great adventure he was very happy so happy that while he longed for the attainment of his purpose and strained every nerve to accomplish it he almost dreaded that accomplishment since it must rob him of the sweet and gracious present and that such accomplishment drew on as the summer went forward he could not doubt for his fairylady had grown less timid than of old braving now the earlier dusk now the later dawn as the fancy took her while a veritable shadow clung unquestionably to her little feet and lengthened behind or beside her though no less slender and graceful than before her person was less ethereal it appeared to gain a certain substance a greater opacity while her movements were more measured once or twice laurence had fancied he saw her pale face flush under sudden emotion as though blood once more began to course beneath the clear smooth skin her talk moreover was less of the past than of the present at times she would ask questions not wholly easy for him to answer without revealing those things regarding which he had agreed with himself to keep silence but on many matters he had come to speak to her freely telling her of his daily occupations and affairs of the books he read even of passing events of public interest and to all his talk she listened now thoughtfully now with pretty mirth offering not only sympathy but discreet counsel while sometimes a touch of farreaching and singularly mature wisdom gave a significant value to her speech there were moments indeed when laurence gazed at her in wonder for she betrayed a depth and daring of thought impossible to a young girl however good her training and notable her natural talentsthought only possible to one who had discounted the many subterfuges and illusions of life as most mortals see and live it by apprehension of things supramundane eternal and so of infinite moment to the conscience and the heart she grew in womanhood and she grew in the charm of distinction and of a fine equality yet the mystery surrounding her was to laurence in no wise lessened for he began to perceive that if he held back somewhat from her knowledge concerning himself she notwithstanding her transparent sincerity and the perfection of her love held back somewhat from him she played with him she eluded him and he perceived that her lovely souldid he dwell with her for a thousand yearswould still have its surprises for him and its secret places adorably difficult of access then too for all her increasing humanity the way of her coming at sundown and going at sunrise remained unexplained as ever one morning in late june standing in the baywindow with the fragrance of the blossoming garden and the songs of awakening birds saluting them he questioned her on this matter her hand rested in hisno longer perceptible as a mere pulsation such as might be caused by the fluttering wings of a captive butterfly it had substance now actual though very delicate weight and feeling this amazement and ecstasy invaded laurence his eyes were alight and his blood hot you are going he asked but why should you go stay and see the day in its beauty but she smiled on him a serious and enigmatic smile though very full of tenderness the day does not belong to me yet she answered i cannot take that which is not mine everything is ours if we dare take it laurence said possession is in the act not in the fact you create law by believing in and submitting to it cease to believe cease to submit the prohibition the obligation vanishes into fine air the day is yours dear love and all the vigorous life and joy of it if you will but venture have just a little courage try but she shook her pretty head still smiling though as it seemed to laurence rather mournfully then tell me where you go he said tell me where you pass all the hours when you are not here see i have been very patient i have asked you no questions and yet loving you as i do i have a right to hear ah she answered playfully though with a touch of sadnesswhat an importunate being you have suddenly become yet whyhalf your life is hidden from me dear laurence and i do not ask to have it otherwise why then should not half of mine be hidden from you indeed it is always so between man and woman i think whether they know itas we door know it not but laurence was not in the humour to have his inquiry put aside thus lightly still tell metell me he insisted look here really i am not unreasonable he laughed a little looking at her very charmingly in mingled eagerness and commandfor your exits and entrances are not as those of other women agnes so tell me or let me go with you wheresoever you go or justit is very simpledont gostay right here and brave the glory of the sunrise stay as he spoke long shafts of pale golden light shot through the openings between the highstanding trees of the eastern woodland and lay in misty radiance along the dewy lawns touching the heads of the cypresses and flashing upon the upspringing waters of the fountains ah have patiencebut a little trifle of patience yet dearest love agnes rivers pleaded only wait and that which is to be will surely declare itself i would so gladly stayor gladly take you with me going but i can do neither though why i do not at present fully comprehend she turned and for a moment stood facing the sunlight bright in its royal brightness looking out on the fair summer landscape an infinite hope and yearning in her lovely face then she folded her hands high upon her bosomslightly ruffling the smooth surface of her dainty muslin capebowed her head meekly as in worship and moved away as she passed laurencestanding a little behind herfor the first time heard the soft sound of her rapid footfall and the whisper of her silken gown the young man too worshipped the rising sun after his mannera manner it must be admitted by no means of the meekest the room was empty but he did not greatly care for his great purpose seemed so close upon consummation the crisis was very near now before that splendid june sun rose tomorrowso he told himselfhis work would be complete she was so nearly human his dear fairylady her pure spirit so strangely yet sensibly in process of clothing itself with sweet living flesh he would set bread and wine before her in the small hours when this bright day was dead she should eat and drink of a sacramental feast designed to secure not eternal life to the soul in this case but mortal life to the beautiful young body which he so desired and loved thus did laurence rivers hail the sunrise filled with an immense pride of his own action his own will and the powers of his race deeming himself a worker of miracles and equal of the immortal gods xxii laurence swung himself down from the high twowheeled dogcart at the front door the sky was lowering the evening sultry after a burning day down in the southeast a storm was brewing with low mutterings of thunder the air was curiously still yet now and again among the thick foliage of the limes and chestnuts a few leaves would flutter tumultuously as though stricken with panic and then become motionless as suddenly and causelessly as they had become agitated laurence was late and had driven home rapidly not sparing his horsea young thoroughbred brown which he had bought about a fortnight before and which was new as yet to harness it was all of a lather and sweat and stood with outstretched neck and open heavilybreathing nostrils he looked at it with a slight sense of compunction and gave some orders to the groom it was a little hard to have pressed the poor beast but he had been out all the afternoon mapping out the projected course of the light railway to the hazledown quarries with armstrong and an engineering expert and he had been kept later than he anticipated as it was he had barely time for a bath and to dress before dinner at a quarterpast eight his mind still ran upon questions of gradients and detail of expenditure he had thrown himself energetically into practical work it was best to do so with the climax of his great adventure looming so large just ahead all day he had been conscious of a quiet sustained excitement engendered by the double life he was leading it stimulated the action of his brain the engineer had warmly approved some of his suggestions and adopted them this pleased laurence it was not a little satisfactory to find himself thus capable and on the spot while interests of so very different a character formed the undercurrent of his thought it fed selfconfidence and justified his determination of daring action after a look first at the sweating horse and then at the lowering sky he hurried into the hall the storm if it came up at all would not break yet probably it would travel along the northern horizon following the line of the downs how hot it was though the house felt cool by comparison with the atmosphere outside then just inside the door the two menservants met him renshaw with a salver in his hand a telegram for you sir he saidaddingdo you wish dinner put off for a quarterofanhour or so sir nono laurence answered absently i shall be down in plenty of time as he spoke he tore open the ugly orangecoloured envelope the sheet of dirtypink paper within contained but a few words wanted here immediately return next steamer virginia laurence bathed dressed dined while at intervals the thunder muttered far away in the east and the dark came swiftly as with great strides in the centre of the table the cutglass bowl upheld by the dancing golden figures again tonight as on the second night of laurences visit to stoke riverswhich now seemed such an incredibly long time agoheld fantastic single flowers and sprays of orchids some mottled warty toadlike some tigercoloured striped with black these last gave off a heavy musky scent the oppressive heat too was suggestive of that earlier eveningthough the windows now stood wide open but then whatever the discomfort of his physical sensations laurence had been lighthearted enough his life if not particularly full of purpose had at least been free of entanglement he had neither climbed heights nor sounded depths his honour was untarnished by so much as a questionable thought now the splendour of life had got him he was in the full swing of his great opportunity but his conscience was not clear as at that former period and thatwhich seemed not a little ironicalthough he had lived more austerely than of old abjuring all frivolity and denying himself all bodily indulgence laurence juggled neither with himself or with the facts of the case he did not whimper or grumble in accepting the risks of his own action he had of necessity accepted this one it was just the fortune of warnot an altogether pretty fortune for a man who plumed himself on a nice taste in matters of honour perhaps but that was hardly to the point the present position was an inevitable consequence of all which had preceded it and was bound to present itself sooner or later remorse and anger were alike futile and out of place the question resolved itself into thiswhat to do next laurence dropped the stump of his cigarette into his fingerbowl and sat resting his elbows on the table and his forehead in his hands thinkingfor virginia meant what she said of course she did virginia always meant what she said sometimes a little morecertainly never less and her reasons for saying that which she said were always perfectly convincing to herself virginia was never impulsive her action was always the outcome of intention therefore it was useless to temporise or ask explanations by means of that farflashing cable in her letters virginia had lately commented upon the length of his absencequite goodtemperedly virginia was always goodtempered partly perhaps because she had never had occasion to learn what opposition meant this telegram was her ultimatum but whether delivered of her own free will and initiative or in deference to some unusual circumstance illness accident or sudden financial crisis he could not of course divine yet even so the position remained very simple there were but two paths one or other he must choose either he must obey her and that unquestioningly and directlythis was thursday the next american mail left liverpool at the end of the weekor he must refuse and that he believed meant a break with virginia laurence remained very still for a time a break with virginiayes the storm was working round by the north as he had anticipatedhe had no complaint to make against virginia heaven forbid she was just precisely that which she had always beenin her own sphere and connection from the modern and mundane point of view an eminently and admirably clever person he agreed with her disciple mrs bellingham that in social affairs she possessed a savoir faire and intelligence amounting to positive genius she was absolutely selfreliant she had never been surprised or nonplussed in all her life andand laurence rose to his feet crossed the room and rang the bell his face had grown singularly hard it bore but slight resemblance to that of his namesake the gallant and debonair young laurence rivers of the cosway miniature indeed his eyes were coldly brilliant his lips almost as thin as those of montagu rivers his uncle but lately deadwell he proposed to enlarge virginias experience he proposed to surprise to nonplus her it was a blackguardly thing to do and she of all women would be the last to forgive it so much the better he did not want her to forgive it he proposed to repudiate virginia he proposed to desert herand then fortunately the american divorce laws are easy when renshaw answered the bell he said leave the fruit and wine on the table and bring an uncut loaf of new white bread dont sit up i shall be late and i wish to have the house to myself tonight xxiii pulling out the heavy curtain laurence paused for an unwonted sound saluted his ears to which at first they refused credence he opened the door quietly the sound continued the keys of the piano were struck so softly that they gave forth little more than the echo of a melody his fairylady sat at the instrument and so absorbed was she in the making of this dainty music that the young man had crossed the room and leaned his elbows on the edge of the flat pianocase opposite to her before she looked up at him nor meeting his eyes did she leave playing but let her fingers still draw forth that procession of slender phrases from the discoloured ivory notesphrases not only exquisitely refined but with a tremulous coquetterie in them the music of some polite and graceful minuet in which bouchers fine fanciful little figures of lover and mistress courtier and prince painted upon the satinwood escritoire might have moved and postured with a hundred pretty arts and invitations at the court of louis the fifteenth over a century ago the finedrawn little melody and all its suggestions of past intrigues heartburnings elegant if questionable joys and luxurious living knocked at the door of the listeners heart with rather perilous pathos notwithstanding his stern humour agnes riverss eyes too as she looked steadily at him were at once grave with thought and beseeching as those of a child covetous of a possible pleasure yet ready to swallow its poor tears should that pleasure be denied her lips were parted but she did not speak she only gazed and gazed at himwhile still calling forth those frail and courteous harmoniesas though she sought to penetrate the most hidden recesses of his nature and all this worked strongly upon laurence stirring in him memories of just such hot evenings when with windows set wide upon the fragrant garden and the wild brightness of the summer lightning pulsingas nowupon the far horizon they had sat together making music she and he nearly a hundred years back that first love of theirs had been shattered by cruel calamity of wounds and death it had never found its consummation and now the ache of its frustration was added to the ache of the presentof his passion so strongly held in check during the last many weeks of his longsustained effort now touching on attainment of his so recently made resolution to let honour go by the wall rather than again be defrauded of his love at length he could no longer endure the playful yet in a way tragical music nor the sustained scrutiny of those grave yet wistful eyes thats enough agnes thats enough he cried and leaning across the case of the piano laid hold on her hands and raised them off the keyboard and as he did so the blood leapt in his veins for the fact was no longer open to questionthose hands were firm and softly warm as a living womans hand should be and the clasp of them met and clung in his he drew her up making the sweet musician stand opposite to him while bending down he kissed and kissed those dear warm hands looking at her his face on a level with hers and as he did so her cheeks lost their waxen pallor and became beautifully flushed with clear colour whileso it seemed to himhe could hear the beating of her heart and thus for a space they stood speechless consumed by a very ecstasy of love laurence was the first to break that enchanted silence for he was feverish to complete the working of the miracleto establish her in this earthly life upon which she was reentering to chain her spirit to this recovered human body by some corporeal act he was feverish to set a seal upon her new condition which it should not be possible for her to evade or to break the perfect hour has come he said with fierce exultation do you understand what has happened you asked me once what was lacking well that which was lacking has been restored to you but it wont do to rest here we must go on go forward so as to make security doubly secure yet she sighed turning her face away and gently releasing her hands from his grasp ah the perfect hour has comeyes she said but dear laurence it came once before and remember along with it came the call for you to depart sorrow trod hard on the heels of joy and i fearhow can i do otherwiselest it should do so again tonight laurence felt his throat go dry and his lips stiffen so that speech did not come quite readily it lies with you to prevent that catastrophe he answered only be brave do as i ask you and we can put all fear behind us for ever and a day all the world may call me i shall not go it may howl at me even using foul names but what does that matter i have chosen i abide by my choice as he spoke she moved a little further from him while the thunder growled and muttered in the north and the lightning showed fitfully as with the glare of a burning town low down in the night sky what has taken you laurence she asked you are strange in manner and in voice i hardly know you thus yet indeed i would do anything you ask however difficult if that which you would have me do is not in itself sinful or wrong and this is right he declared incontestably everlastingly right indeed it is little more than bare justicethe restitution of that which was once ours the paying of a longowed debt in past years happiness was snatched from us by jealous fate fate has repentedthough lateand gives us back our happiness we should be fools not to take it he stood by her holding out his hand his eyes alight as with a dull flame the determination of conquest very forceful in him see he said hoarsely i have loved you back into life again agnes and so your life belongs to me as no womans life has ever belonged to a man before that which i ask you must do for believe me i comprehend this matter and all the issues of it best he led her towards the door and she came meekly yet with a certain wonder and reserve in her bearing as one who ponders and questions silently even while they obey he threw the door wide open revealing the back of the leatherlined curtain but on the threshold she hesitated and drew back i have never crossed this she said with gentle decision i cannot cross it but you must cross it he answered or all is lost a strong shuddering ran through her the corners of her sweet mouth turned down and quivered while her hand grew very cold ah me ah me my love she cried then i fear indeed all must needs be lost for to cross this threshold is to force some barrier which i have neither the strength or the right to force i do not know its name but it is ancient and venerable and forbids my passage with authority all the more shall you force it then laurence replied just now sweetheart i tell you i admit no authority but my own and barriers are made to be forced thats the use of them the more apparently ancient and venerable the more must they go so that the new may supersede the decrepit and old truth may supersede superstition hope fear and the living the dead he laughed a little partly in defiance of that more sane and modest self of his with whom for the time being he had parted company partly to rally his dear companions courage and compel her faltering steps come he said dont i love you better than my own soul would i of all men do you any injury do you think surely you can trust mecome but still that strong shuddering ran through her and she hung back then laurence lost patience you foolish child he said you are very much a woman your words are so wise yet you prove so weak in action and scare yourself with selfinvented terrors he set his back against the heavy curtain pushing it outward then he took her delicate body in his arms lifted her over the threshold and set her feet on the crimson carpet of the sombre and stately corridor without the curtain swept back into its place across the door with a dull thud which mingled ominously with the muttering thunder against the panes of the long range of windows the lightning peeped and flickered as in malicious curiosity of that going forward within while the roman emperors looked on supercilious impassive with sightless marble eyes his fairyladys delicate body had been light as a feather so light that lifting it laurence had trembled lest it should slip out of his encircling arms as the little summer winds might slip should one strive to embrace them and yet that same lifting of her had taxed every muscle in his frame and set his heart thumping like a steam hammer it was the very oddest sensation suggesting that there was something very much more than a narrow piece of polished oak flooring and deep pile carpet to lift her across he stood now breathless singularly shaken by the effort notwithstanding his natural vigour and physical strengthshaken yet triumphant there my beloved he cried there its not such a very dangerous experiment after all you see to go out at an open doorand now you are redeemed from slavery free to range the pleasant earth at will and accept all the glad chances of it but she shrunk against him trembling all her pretty pride humbled like that of a little child detected in a fault her countenance had become shy and wild moreover and clear reason had ceased to sit enthroned in her serious and lovely eyes she looked now as she had looked on the night he first found her flitting to and fro in the yellow parlour searching searching vainly and hopelessly for the lost key of the satinwood escritoire and laurence seeing her thus was smitten with selfreproach and alarm was it possible that along with the restoration of her body had returned that alienation of mind from whichas he had learned from her own testimony and from the wellauthenticated tradition of armstrong the agentshe had formerly and so pitifully suffered as more than once before an immense compassion filled the young man so that coaxing her and using tender and endearing namessuch as even the wisest of lovers weakly decline upon at timeshe halfled halfcarried her past the doorways of all those brightlylighted silent rooms through the square hallits flying staircase gleaming upward step above stepuntil finally the diningroom was reached here the musky odour of the tigercoloured orchids met them with the effect as it seemed of a presence rather than a scent it was full of subtle suggestions that seeming presence wooing them with insidious provocations of sense to partake of the mysterious sacramental feast set out before thema feast designed to wed irrevocably the sweet spirit to its so lately recovered body and rivet upon it once again not only the natural joys but the inevitable cares and pains all the grievous burdens of mortal life the cloth had been withdrawn and upon the dark surface of the bare table doubled by vertical reflections a service of costly china antique silver and fine glass was spread rare wines filled the longnecked bottles and quaint highshouldered decanters while the painted and gilded dishes held velvetskinned hothouse peaches redgold nectarines little black italian figs and pyramids of fragrant strawberries set in a fringe of fresh and lustrous leaves the loaf of white bread was there also a simple and humble item offering something of contrast to its ornate surroundings laurence placed his fairylady in the carven armchair at the head of the table seated there her slight figure in its highwaisted rosered silken gown and transparent lace and muslin cape looked singularly youthful and fragile her graceful head and white throat showed up against the dark panelling of the wall her hands rested languidly upon the arms of her chair the corners of her mouth still quivered and her eyes were wide with inarticulate distress and all the while opposite to her in at the windows at the far end of the room the lightning away there in the north peeped evilly and flickered and sometimes glared a broad sheet of pale flame behind the blackness of the distant woods crowning the rounded hills laurence stood close beside her he filled her glass with wine and placed fruit upon her plate speaking to her very gently possessed meanwhile by an adoration of her extreme and pensive beauty a great resolution to complete his work in respect of her and a distrust lest that work was going sorely amiss but though he did his best to secure her attention for many minutes she neither moved nor uttered any sound see dear love the young man pleadedsee i have made you a dainty supper remember this is the first time i ask you to eat a meal in my house you were dudleys guest often enough in old days and did not refuse what was set before you surely it is pleasanter to you to be my guest than his so do not wander off even for a little while to walk those dim and dreary interspaces between two worlds all that is over dont become intangible and remote or yield yourself to malign influences which would enthrall you and draw you away lay hold of your womanhood sweetheart and let human love wrap you about and keep you safe and warm there is nothing nothing in all this to fear if you will but believe me eat my beloved you have fasted long you have come from very farhow far heaven only knows you are faint and weary with the length of the way therefore eat drinklet your body be refreshed and let your heart grow glad and presently while he thus encouraged her slowly as one who shakes off the torpor of exhaustion she stretched sitting very upright in the great highbacked chair the distress and desolation of her expression began to give place to a gentle curiosity she looked at the costly furnishings of the table the dancing golden figures in their flowing robes the fantastic flowers the delicious fruits fingered a silver spoon and seeing her own reflection in the bowl of it quaintly distorted smiled then suddenly putting up both hands and covering her face she gave a quick little sneezesign in the east of life but in the west precursor of death of whichever the sign in the present case incontestible it was that with this same little sneeze a change was perceptible in her which her lover noting hailed as indicative of success so he urged her yet more yes my beloved you are tired he said and it is so long since you have sat at table in this room that very simple things appear perplexing to you but thats a small matter the old habits will soon reassert themselves and all be natural and obvious enough for in the coming days i intend we shall very constantly sit here together you and i and perhaps others will sit here with us as time goes onlaurence paused his voice shook a littleour children fair girls and handsome lads whom we shall greatly love and in whose youth our own youth will live again but to secure all that agnes you must eat and drink now in plain honest fashion sleep sound of nights wake in the kindly sunshine put morbid fears and fancies far from you and grow strong you are compounded of too tenuous and sublimated stuff for motherhood as yet therefore eat dear love delay no longer the hours run on towards the morning and this matter must be assured before the morning comes do not be wayward in the name of your love for me and of all your sorrows i entreat you eat and be strong once again she covered her face with her hand and gave a quick little sneeze then looking full at him she smiled though somewhat sadly let it be even as you wish she said very meekly give me bread laurence mightily rejoicing cut the loaf and placed the bread upon her plate tremblingly as though putting a great force upon herself she broke it into little pieces carried one to her lips then laid it back beside the others on her plate next stretched out her hand for the glass of wine her lover held towards her but shook her head and set it down untasted while he eager to the point of desperation yet dreading in any way to affright her and so defeat his own ends fell to coaxing her once more with a certain playful seriousness see here he said learn by experience the threshold which you declared impassable was very easily crossed and this affair of your little supper is exactly parallel you are the victim of your own imagination what after all holds you back once more she essayed valiantly to obey him but once more laid the morsel of bread down on her plate the thunder rolled from east to west along the northern heights and the lightning flickered but both had grown faint and very distant while a soft cool air wandered in at the open window dispelling the clinging and insidious odour of the orchids purifying the heavy atmosphere of the room and lightly stirring the little lace frills of agnes riverss muslin cape what after all holds you back he demanded with some agitation for that cool draw of air though pleasant affected him unexpectedly it appeared to blow across the valley from stoke rivers churchyard where in the spring morning three months before he had watched the little shadows cast by the feathery branches of the ageold yewtrees dance and beckon among the grassgrown graves but his fairylady pushed her plate aside all her gentle dignity had returned to her and a wisdom born of knowledge more profound than that granted to most human creatures sat once again enthroned in her eyes there was an effulgence in her loveliness which almost awed him yet she did that which during all their intercourse she had never done before calmly fearlessly and as of right she put up her sweet lips and kissed him this holds me back she said that at last all the confusion which oppressed my mind is gone and that i understand who and what i am i have striven and ah how gladly would i have proved victorious in that strife for all my heart goes forth in natural desire not only to obey your dear wishes but to secure to myself those things which your wishes would bring i perceive that to eat is to live not the shadowy unrelated life of a disembodied spirit divorced from the activities of earth yetby some inherent wilfulnessstill so wedded to earth that it cannot enter the peaceful regions of the faithful departed to eat is to live as you liveand rightlyin the shock and tumult of the world to love as you loveneeds must dear heartwith all the passions of the unstable flesh as well as the pure and immutable passion of the soul i have dallied too long with temptation and in my weakness brought sorrow on youperhaps worse than sorrow disgrace but the temptation was so potent the promise of it so enchanting that until tonight i had not grasped its full significance and scope as to our first mother eve ages back in the mystic garden so to me tonight to eat o my love is sin laurence straightened himself up and all the fierceness the relentlessness of his race stiffened itself within him yet he kept himself in hand because love still was paramount to all other emotions and if it be sin it is too late to vex ourselves about that you have forced the barrier after all the curtain which closes the entrance to your not very cheerful eden has swung back into place i have you and i keep you i have fought for you won you not wholly without personal loss so you are to me as the spoils of battle which a man having taken is very certainly in no humour hurriedly to give up and even were this so had i not these claims on your obedience to eat my dear couldnt be sin on the contrary it is bare commonsensejust the next move logically necessary in the particularly delicious game which you and i for cause unknown are ordained to play together with logic and commonsense as backers how can sin have a word to say in the matter thus she answeredbecause now as once before when the perfect hour had come and things showed so fair that to better them appeared almost impossible the call has come for you to leave me and leave me you surely must you are mistaken laurence answered hoarsely you confuse both the events and obligations of the past with those of the present the call has not come then agnes rivers rose up pushing the carven chair away from her and standing with a certain graceful independence before the sumptuously spread table in the centre of the highlylighted room between the open window and the open door her person thus seen suggested some clear jewel of infinite value in a dark and heavy though splendid setting or some tender solitary flower amid the lifeless magnificence of a desert city rich with the tombs of longdead kings a gentle daring a selfassertion strong as steel yet soft as a silken thread seemed to animate her whole being rather is it you that are mistaken she answered but whether with your consent or against it i cannot tell it is you that dream just now my love and suffer perhaps subscribe to delusionstrong man though you areand i that wake for the call has come to you and though you should employ all the eloquence of all the sages to convince me it is otherwise i could not be convinced you are very stubborn he said and yet i spare you she replied in a tone of half mirthful half tender reproach for i only assert the fact the exact nature of the call i do not know and i do not ask you to tell it me i am sufficiently humanyou have brought me so far on the backward road which my naughty feet were only too willing to treadto greatly long to know the exact nature of that call yet did i know it i fear it might provoke a wicked spirit of jealousy in me and of envy towards one who has in the natural sequence of things that which i have not yet fain would have therefore do not try me too far lest my courage fail and i decline from right and break the perfect circle of our dealings with one another so painting both past and future with the ugly colours of remorseful regret you told me you would never leave me again unless i bade you do so well now the time has come redeem your word laurence would have spoken but still with that air of almost heavenly mirth she laid her hand upon his mouth there was hardly perceptible substance or weight in it and once againnow with despair though the sensation was in itself delicioushe felt that fluttering as of the wings of a captive butterfly against his lips no no she protested do not speak for i am woman enough to be resolved to have the last word put away delusion and all extravagancethink after all what do you leave not much believe me for i am but a ghost i have no right to any earthly dwellingplace no right to lie in the arms of living man it would be monstrous a thing abhorrent to nature an insult to the awful and unbroken order of cause and effect that has operated from the beginning of being and of time that i should force the barrier completely and project myself at once unburied and unborn for a second time into the arena of earthly life it would be an act of rebellion of selfseeking beside which that of lucifer grows palefor he at least was an archangel which might give reasonable cause of pridewhereas ino god in his infinite mercy has granted me fulness of understanding just in time and i have no fear but that since i voluntarily resign myself curb my imperious will and forego the desire of my heart he will further grant me access to that place of refreshment light and peace in which souls wait until their final beatitude in gods hands are all things and i now see that behind the loves of earth just in proportion as those loves are noble and have in them a seed of permanence stands for ever the love of god himself sure and faithful full of a satisfaction that can never lessen or pass away i have been blind and very wilful loving him too little loving you too much but he who made all men and sees how beautiful they are so that in loving themthey being made in his imagewe unconsciously all the while but love his image evident in themhe will surely understand me and forgive there laurence broke in madlyah stop talking stop talking what are words at such a time as this you are mine by right of conquest as i have already told you for god and the eternities i care not just now one little bit you belong to me i have bought you at a great price i love you and will enter into possession of my own and he essayed to lay hold of her his blood on fire for the moment with frustrated pride the agony of relinquishment and passion baulked and i love you too she answered fearlessly so greatly so absorbingly that i have broken all bonds of time and space and defied all laws of life and death to find you and behold you and speak with you again yet even as she made this declaration she slipped away from his urgent embrace even as a rosy snowwreath slips from the cliff edge when the sun climbs high in heaven drawing back to itself by the power of its strength and heat snow and vapours dews and fair dissolving mists such as cling at dawn along the watercourses and haunt the quiet underspaces of the woods there were tears in her sweet eyes and that airy frame of hers was shaken by sobs yet her face very brave and of a marvellous brightness go back to the world dear love she said and play your part in the great game finely to the close let no shame touch you or breath of dishonour smirch any page of your record i will go back tooyet rather go forwardreaching a fairer world than yours a world which in my folly i disdained being blinded by the things of sense there i shall await your coming and we shall be one at last being one with almighty and eternal god she passed from the room but though laurence followed her swiftly he found the corridor empty the yellow drawingroom when he entered it was vacant too though retaining its gracious and friendly aspect a cool wind blew through it laden with the scent of the rose borders of the italian garden the storm was over and the night sky was clear and very full of stars xxiv quite a number of people had come to luncheon quite a number still remained though it was past four oclock upon the great deepeaved verandah in attendance on virginia there was a babel of clear penetrating voices occasionally an outbreak of laughter though in point of fact notwithstanding its ready verbal wit the new world is less addicted to laughter than the old laurence had listened had put in a lazy sentence here and there but now the entertainment began to pall on him slightly it was too continuous they were all so young so emphatic so tireless in the business of pleasure these bright clearcut young people he remembered it was mail day the english letters and newspapers should have arrived by now he got up and sauntered cigarette in mouth into the great pale livingroom the venetian shutters were closed and the room with its spare though elegant furniture and buttercoloured parquet floor was full of a clear green light quiet and excellently cool sure enough on one of the tables lay in goodly array lately arrived letters and papers laurence began opening these in desultory fashion the glass doors standing wide on to the verandah framed virginias perfectly finished person lying back in a rockingchair her profile was outlined against a soft seagreen cushion she was talking others were listening as was usually the case in respect of virginia beyond the handrail and uprights of the verandah could be seen a long sweep of rather coarse grass and the waters of the river white in the brilliant afternoon light whereon lay some trim rowingboats and smart pleasureyachts at anchor the water was absolutely still even and gleaming as the surface of a silver mirror yet it lapped with a just audible gurgle and suck against the indentations of the low green banks and this cool liquid sound formed an agreeable undertone to those clear penetrating voices the ceaseless chirrup of crickets and strident fiddlings of countless grasshoppers behind the ample wideranging wooden housespotless in its purity of white paint dignified by its ranges of darkgreen slatted shutters its greybrown shingled roofs and many gablesa certain puritan simplicity pervading it somewhat quaintly at variance with its highlydeveloped appliances of modern comfort and the almost surprisingly civilised examples of modern humanity now domiciled within itbehind it the ground trended upward through pleasant orchards of apple pear and peach trees past commodious wooden barns and stables long grey snakefences and corn patches where the pumpkins began to grow golden beneath the wide glistening leaves the giant cobs and silken tassels of the maize down to meet this spacious foreground unencumbered by superfluous detail wandered the sparse untamed ubiquitous woodland of the new england states everywhere slender longlimbed trees endless scrub festooning vines heavy with bunches of little foxgrapes and below outcroppings of grey rock some two months hence the edge of the woodland would be fringed by spires of goldenrod and processions of purple asters while the maples set forth an amazement of verdigris green lemoncolour and all manner of radiant pinks and scarlets and sumach dyed the hollows bloodred but as yet the woods retained their summer tints there was a slight want of atmosphere no doubt the landscape was oddly lacking in values of distance while the sky was blue to the point of crudity and the sun blazed had blazed would blaze with a youthful and tireless energynot unsuggestive of the conversation of virginia and all those friends of hersthroughout the unshadowed and unmitigated day to right and left were other hospitable mansions the limits of their private grounds unmarked by jealous wall or paling a wideranging spirit of goodnature and confidence appeared to reign yet in point of fact the inhabitants of these agreeable country houses formed a distinctly close corporation the van reenan property had been broken up into building lots on the death of its first owner old erasmus van reenan merchant and financier of new york nearly seventy years ago but the said lots had been acquired by members of his numerous family and still van reenans direct and collateral their children and their childrens children found relaxation at times in this amiable american capua but woe to any intruder from the outer world unless furnished with irreproachable passport and the very highest of highclass references who should venture to set sacrilegious foot on this thrice sacred ground for as laurence had frequently reflectednot without a measure of amusementnothing is so essentially aristocratic as a democratic country nothing so socially exclusive as an immature civilisation it was the first time since her marriage that virginia had honoured the van reenan property with her presence but being debarred by the fact of her mourning for her husbands uncle from participation in the gay life of those summer resorts where the elite of the smart world do mostly congregate she had elected to retire upon one of these manygabled ancestral mansions she was explaining all thisand really it appeared to require a surprising amount of explanationto mr horace greener a young man of distinguished social pretensions the constant frequenter of her entertainments both in newport and new york who finding himself obliged to visit the city on business had sought at once physical refreshment and satisfaction of the emotion of friendship by running out by train today to visit her virginias clear intonations rose superior to the chorus of feminine voices around her their singular vivacity and singular composure alike offering an unconscious challenge to laurences mental attitude as he lazily tore open his english letters and newspapers he had left stoke rivers just three weeks and all that time he had been a prey to vacuity to a sort of gnawing emptiness at moments a blind rage took him but only at moments in the main his attitude was cynical disappointment had embittered him nothing mattered much nothing ever would matter much again he had had his great chance and lost it muddled it somehow a bigger man would have overridden the difficulties of the affair but he was a bungler a poor creature he was profoundly contemptuous of himself and not a little contemptuous also of men and things but here was a thick packet from armstrong and that awoke an unexpected interest in him it would be quite pleasant to have news of the light railway and the gypsum quarriesnice fellow that young engineer and not at all conceited most experts have such a confoundedly good opinion of themselveslaurence fell to whistling softly and involuntarily he recalled the slender courtly music of a certain eighteenth century minuet then he stopped suddenly an immense nostalgia taking him for a very different scene and place andwell a general outlook less secure and circumscribed and he had almost said trivial he didnt want to be censoriouswho was he after all in good truth to be thatbut horace greeners trim lightclad person leaning against a pillar of the verandah close to virginias rockingchair caught his eye the young man was excellently got up he was wellbred agreeable would pass muster in any society yet laurence wearied mightily of him just thenof his neatly handsome features which would photograph so well and paint so poorly and of his alert and civil manner no i imagined you would be surprised to find me so at home in this idyllic and patriarchal milieu mr greener virginia was saying i rather counted upon that you did not accredit me with so much adaptability some other of my friends have observed upon that also and i assure you i am rewarded for i find it the most recuperative process a woman can go through to retire upon herself and upon nature in this way my parents had been anxious to come out here all summer this year and when i concluded to join them we worked out a regular scheme i assure you it has called forth a quite affecting display of family affection there are nine houses on the place they are all full we all meet daily even my cousin mrs bellingham has come over with her children from europeyes i am very glad you should have met louise again mr greener the english life does not altogether suit her i observed she was wanting at first in animation it does her good to see old friends i apprehend she feels rather exiled i wonder if i shall feel rather exiled but i dont propose to take it that way i propose every one there shall feel exiled because they have not had the inestimable advantage of being born on this side do you not think that is the true patriotic platform now mr greener there was another letter laurence knew the handwriting but he could couple no name with it yet certainly he knew it and the sight of it conveyed to him an impression vaguely amusing he laid aside the agents voluminous packet and opened the envelope why the poor little padre sahib to be sure he exclaimed half aloud have they been tripping him up with strings again across the school door but as he read amusement gave place to quite other sentiments his eyebrows drew together and his face for all its healthy sunburn blanched to the indistinct dusty grey of his wellcut flannels this very shocking discovery has as you will i feel sure readily conceive quite unnerved me wrote walter samuel beal but for the support and invaluable advice of the archdeacon i should have sunk under the burden of responsibility thrown upon me a case so extraordinary has rarely if ever arisen i should suppose during the whole history of the christian ministry i should add that the oak coffin was so charred at one corner as to reveal a second coffin composed of lead within as the inscription upon the coffin plate was quite legible and as mr armstrong was in possession of information bearing upon this very painful matter i abstained from further investigation myself and entreated others also to do so thank god for that laurence muttered there was a drawing back of chairs upon the verandah an outbreak of rapid question and answer of laughter reiterated and extensive farewells virginias clear voice still rose dominant she was marshalling her forces arranging future meetings making appointments ordering her plan of campaignand outside all the while the sun blazed on the surface of the white waters of the river the ripple lapped against the green indented banks the crickets and grasshoppers kept up their strident serenade i felt that neither my courage nor my judgment was equal to the ordeal wrote the worthy young clergyman i dreaded to entangle myself in legal questions of which i virtually know nothing i can never express the gratitude i owe to the archdeacon he advised that the coffin should be placed provisionally in the plot of ground reserved by you in our parish churchyard he even came over the considerable distance from bishops pudbury and himself read the shortened form which he had selected from the burial service for this i was deeply thankful as agitation might i fear have prevented my performing the last solemn rites in a suitably impressive manner why certainly mr greener i will go and put on my golfing suit this vivaciously from virginia it will be cooler in an hour we shall have the wind off the riverwillie van reenans theatricals yes i know it louise i am coming to that directly now mr greener if you will walk over to her house with mrs bellingham i will drive around and take you on to the links i will arrange to have laurence meet us at the club pavilion and louise when you see willie tell him he can come right on here after dinner and i will cast the play with him we can count on you for lord follington mr greener yesyou really are very kind laurence still stood by the table littered with envelopes and papers he was reading the agents missive or rather trying to do so for the words were not wholly easy to focus his eyes had a mist before them and a singular sensation gained upon himthat of the inherent duality of his being for some time now he had only been conscious of the existence of the modern laurence rivers wholly and solely the modern laurence rivers and he baffled and discomfited by no means at his best now that earlier life the strong emotions and steady purposes of it crowded in on him calling to and claiming him until his actual circumstances and surroundings became singularly incredible the heels of virginias very pretty shoes tapped lightly upon the buttercoloured boards of the verandah she straightened a chair or two replaced some magazines which slipped from a basketwork lounge on to the floor her movements were direct and deliberate and all the while her trailing skirts made a dragging sound like the wheels of a little cart in a moment more she would come into the house the young man tried to pull himself together but it was so unbelievable to him just now this whole matter of virginia he looked across at her as he might have looked at the merest acquaintance and found her extremely effective as she came through the cool green light of the great livingroom her tall slight yet rounded figure backed by the untempered brightness of sky and water her transparent black muslin dress was thick with beautiful handembroidery upon the tightfitting sleeves and the shoulders of the bodice it was girt with a soft black chiffon girdle knotted low down emphasising the length of the waist and the spring of the hipsaround which her dress fitted very closely below the knees her skirts stood away fanwise over a bewildering arrangement of white silk kiltings and flounces which hid her feet and gave a slightly japanese effect to her costume her fair brown hair was loosely waved and puffed out over the ears her eyes a light hazel harmonized charmingly with the even tint of her rather sallow skin her neck was noticeably long and her face in shape colouring and feature bore an arresting resemblance to that of certain of botticellis madonnas this taken in connection with her extremely fashionable attire and her otherwise declared and complete modernity had in it great piquancy an element trenching on actual though unconscious profanity to laurence looking at her through the eyes of that elder personality of his these details and these suggestions were conspicuous she presented a perfect example of an immensely effective type he recognised that yet he stared at it in almost desperate wonder and something approaching hopelessness why you are there she exclaimed i am glad i wanted you your people have all cleared out havent they yes they have gone they had a grand time i believe i really think it was very well your uncles death put me into mourning it has afforded me the opportunity of giving my family a lovely summer it might have been a catastrophe i have made it into an occasion they appreciate that virginia made these statements with evident selfcomplacency of course laurence said he still stared at her she placed her hands on her hips smoothing down her closefitting skirt her hands were very small much art had been expended upon the finger nails i think it was perfectly sweet of horace greener to come right on and see me she continued it was like a breath of air from the outside and i was glad he should know how finely everything was going i think they all thought i might feel a little left over he knows now it is they who are left overlaurence you must hurry i arranged you should be at the club pavilion in an hour i have to change my dress but if it should still be very hot i will not play i will have you take my place horace greener is a charming fellow he answered all the same im afraid i cant play golf with him this afternoon but i told him you would do so virginia rejoined with absolute assurance it is settled i never go back on an engagement ah but im afraid i do laurence said specially in the case of engagements about the making of which i have not been consulted so far the young lady had been occupied with her own conversation and her own person to the exclusion of any particular observation of her companion now she deigned to regard him more closely dear me she exclaimed you appear to me to be looking pretty wretched upon my word i believe i am pretty wretched laurence answered smiling my home letters have brought me some news i dont in the very least like it entails a journey to england and instead of playing golf with horace greener i must take the seven oclock train to new york and see if there is a decent stateroom vacant on any of the outwardbound liners it was in a way characteristic of virginia that her face notwithstanding her natural vivacity possessed no great mobility or range of expression there were such a number of emotions she had never been called upon to entertain and now no movement of appeal or regret crossed it it merely hardened a little becoming as serenely obstinate as heretofore it had been serenely complacent she spoke with exactly the same conviction and assurance but you cannot do that she said oh yes but indeed i can laurence replied quite goodtemperedly he felt so singularly unrelated to her that assertion was sufficient it did not enter his head to protest or argue you misunderstand she said it is that i do not intend to have you do it he paused a moment making an honest effort to range himself in line with her thought oh come along he began but the young lady interrupted him with the same unwavering composure you place me in an objectionable position she declared by forcing me to explain that is not considerate you should meet me halfway you should be beforehand so as to secure me against the annoyance of referring to all that i had determined to sink it but you make that impossible it is derogatory to me to explain laurence sat down on the arm of the nearest chair he felt curiously helpless and yet all the while he was getting the bit between his teeth if obstinacy was about well he had his share of it across the atlantic matters of such profound moment were awaiting him it was difficult to reckon seriously and courteously with this unlookedfor opposition and not to brush it impatiently aside it seemed little short of ridiculous i give you my word virginia i dont know what you are talking about he said i have the most cogent reasons for going overyou havent given me an opportunity of stating them yet but that doesnt alter the fact it is necessary i should go and after all you know i am not such a conceited ass as to imagine you cant do without me for three weeks or so i am not thinking of myself i am thinking of others she remarked with a certain naivete laurence smiled oh in that case i can book my passage with a clear conscience he said but the young lady continued it is extraordinary to me how little regard you have for appearances comments were made upon the length of your former absence they came round to me that was not to be endured in the case of my husband i put a stop to all that by cabling for you ah yes i see laurence said slowly when i arrived there certainly seemed no very obvious reason for the sending of that cable that was unlike you when i thought of it i confess i was puzzled if you leave again after so short a stay it will give colour to those comments virginia spoke with emphasis almost with solemnity i do not propose to submit to that so you must choose laurence either you must give up going or you must wait till it is convenient to me to go with you i do not care for a summer voyage it is dull between the seasons nobody one ever heard of is crossing one may meet the wrong people my leaving would cause great disappointment here it would break up their summer still i would risk that to avoid the other it would be a scramble too and nothing is more annoying than a scramble but i dare say i could arrange to be ready in two weeks from now thats very good of you laurence replied but unfortunately i must go at once and pardon my saying so it will be better for me to go alone everything is at sixes and sevens confusion reigns at stoke rivers i would not take you there under existing circumstances youd receive a quite wrong impression oh it would be utterly disastrous he exclaimed for the first time he beheld virginia depart from her faultless selfcomplacency lose herself a little and display signs of anger her chin went up with a quick jerk her eyes flashed her features seemed for the moment swollen this shocked him it was so wholly unprecedented he felt very sorry as though he had been careless and clumsy as though he had broken something hitherto flawless and therefore charming if not of supreme intrinsic value i begin to believe she cried you have an intention i shall never see stoke rivers at all no no my dear he answered rapidly rising as he spoke nothing of the kind you are very distinctly mistaken i have never been more ready that you should see stoke rivers than within the last hourthat is when stoke rivers is fit to be seen the poor old house seems to have been in jeopardy of final disappearance about a week ago theres where my bad news comes in they write me word of a nasty fire there nobodys faultan electric light wire heated and not being properly cased charred some of the panelling which finally caught alight the house has been kept at such a high temperature for years that the woodwork is like so much tinder virginias chin was still in the air but she had in great measure recovered her selfcontrol her manner was rather elaborately cold that is a pity she said calmly but of course the house and its contents are insured oh yes the loss is more a matter of sentiment than of money only one room is burnt out as far as i can gather and it didnt contain any very valuable pictures or any part of my uncles collection probably it is as well this fire occurred then virginia observed i have always supposed stoke rivers would need some reconstruction before it came up to the level of modern requirements possibly he spoke rather drily only you see i happened to entertain a peculiar fondness for this particular room and i am sorry to part with the outward and visible signs of certain memories the young lady did not answer immediately but examined the dialplate of the little watch set in diamonds upon her wrist the carriage will be here she said i have not time to change my dress i cannot play golf with horace greener it is very embarrassing i have no valid excuse to offer him oh the heat my dear the heat laurence said smiling any excuse is valid if you make it with sufficient conviction virginia looked hard at himi wonder just what you mean by that she retorted she put up her hand puffing her hair out a little more over her ears that fire was not very serious on your own admission she continued i cannot see that it necessitates your hurrying over with this frantic haste and if i am to live in it it would be desirable i should overlook the reconstruction of the house myself her tone was meditative her statements were concise laurence felt his back against the wall he must take the consequences of his own action however distasteful and disagreeable his course would have been very obvious had his record been quite clean in regard to virginia but he was an honest man something of exquisite of incalculable value had tempted him and the peculiarities of his temperament had heightened that temptation he had been saved from falling not by his own virtue but by the virtue and selfsacrifice of one adorably his superior he could not plume himself upon the achievement he acknowledged that his conscience was not clear in respect of virginia and this necessitated the payment of a heavy penalty in connection with his own selfesteem his pride rebelled against giving himself away against further selfrevelation only the logic of the situation prevailed it cut him to the quick yet it had to be done youre quite right he said the matter of the fire could have waited a little i dare say though it isnt exactly satisfactory to know part of ones house is roofless under a wet english july sky but i had other bad news today he paused a moment i heard of the funeral of a very dear connection of mine virginia moved slightly sweeping those fanwisecut flounces to one side funeral she said quickly really you have the very oddest manner of statement had you not already heard of his death then the young man moved too he turned away and a poignant sensation tore and hacked at him so to speak it hurt him physically he gazed out over the dazzling whiteness of the smooth river seeing nothing his whole being tense with the effort to resist the showing of that pain yes yes i have heard of her death but i refused to believe it he answered there was a moment of ominous silence save for the shrilling of the insects and lapping of the stream oh a woman she said with an almost alarming calm have i ever heard of her i think not laurence answered then louise had grounds for her assertions she said still with that deadly calm i thought it unworthy to listen i forbade her to write or speak to me upon the subject i laurence wheeled round his eyes were dangerous all the fanaticism of his race and something finer than that looked out of them think what you please of me he cried but of her think no evil never dare to think any evil she was one of the saints of god and you of all women have no cause to misjudge her she saved me from committing a great sin a singular expression crossed the young ladys face an imperious desire to ask to search out the ultimate of the matter but it was momentary spoilt child of fortune she was too unaccustomed to vital drama to know how to deal with it it staggered it also slightly disgusted her she could not rise to it so conventionality proved stronger than even this very legitimate curiosity virginia remained true to her somewhat artificial traditions to her own canons of good taste and selfrespect to that singular clause of the social creed which declares the thing unsaid also nonexistent virginia appeared in a way admirable just then yet she gave the measure of her nature it was not great she turned aside with a movement of welldefined and lofty superiority are you aware that you become very indelicate she asked most men are indelicate at times unfortunately but not over here she said american women do not permit that you must remember whom you have marriedshe waited a little the english standards are different i presume she added not without a touch of sarcasm i begin to think they are laurence answeredhe was paying paying abominably yet there was a sensible relief in so doingthey are based on the logic of fact he continued and fact is more often indelicate than not it has never yet you see learned to be a respecter of persons there was a pause in which once again the fiddlings of the grasshoppers and soothing lap of the water became audible do you still propose to go to england laurence nodded yes he said thenbegan virginia but the young man held up his hand partly in warning partly demanding a cessation of hostilities his thought had taken a new departure in regard to his wife somehow she had destroyed her own legend she was more slight and shallow a creature than he had supposed and he would never really stand in awe of her again his smile was sad yet wholly friendly thenin a couple of weeks or soi shall come back and fetch you he declared and then like wise and politic human beings we will eschew controversy each giving the other as much room as possible i fancy youll find we shall shake down pretty easily and rub along like most other married peoplemeanwhile whats becoming of poor neglected horace greener go and amuse both yourself and him my dear if youre not in before i startwellfor the moment addio xxv it was all very much in keeping with his moodthe reposeful landscape heavy with the solid green of the august foliage the sweep of the low grey sky the warm still rain which drew forth an indefinable fragrance from the pastures and hedgerows the wayside flowers and the underwood already the evenings had begun to shorten the rambling villagestreet and its inevitable commotion of boys and dogs left behind laurence looked away with a stirring of the heart over this goodly land of which he was owner as the brown thoroughbred breasted the hilly road leading up from the station to stoke rivers house the prospect at once soothed and stimulated him emotion had been conspicuous principally by its absence lately it was pleasant to feel again at the halldoor the two menservants met him and renshaws large eggshaped countenance bore an expression almost paternal excuse me sir he said his complexion ripening to mulberry with the effort of speechi do not wish to put myself forward or go beyond my place but i must express the pleasure we take in welcoming you home sir i speak not only for myself but for mr lowndes and mr watkins and all the other servantsboth upper and under sir lowndes the greyhaired longarmed valet subsequently gave vent to even more cordial sentiments excepting for the fire we have been very dull during your absence sir he said as he laid out the young mans dress clothes with a critical eye to their packing which did not evidently quite commend itself to his taste living in this house has been like living inside a rundown clock i hope you have returned to make some stay sir we want a head we have forgotten how to take a holiday and amuse ourselves our habits have been so very regular for so many years you see sir we feel lost without our accustomed duties this too was pleasant to be precious in the sight of those who serve you lends a singular graciousness to the conduct of daily life laurence felt at harmony with himself and his surroundings and with that sense of harmony arose certain stirrings of hope during the days and nights of the past week while the great ship ploughed her way eastward across the mighty ridge and furrow of the atlantic he had not been wholly unconscious of that hopethe hope that even now all might not be over and that he might once again be blessed by the vision for however brief a space of his dear fairylady yet he had kept that hope under with a stern hand it was present but at the postern gate so to speak of the castle of his reason and his will he kept it there doing his heart much violence by refusing it admittance and entertainment since he knew that once admitted it would have proved so dangerously absorbing and alluring a guest he tried to deny it admittance still yet he shuffled a little with his own conscience permitting himself a renewing of the routine which had marked his former sojourn at stoke rivers he dressed dined and waited until the twilight had very sensibly closed in before visiting that which might remain of the room of mysterious and enchanted meetings the near end of the corridor offered no noticeable signs of disturbance or injury still it appeared to laurence that as on a former occasion a spirit of disorder the winnowing wings of a profound and elemental fear had but lately swept through it he could have imagined the sightless marble faces of the roman emperors less impassive less wholly scornful their heads carried with something less of arrogant and invincible pride an acrid odour of burned stuffs burned woodwork pervaded the place he had cabled instructions that nothing might be removed nothing renovated before his arrival the tapestry curtain still hung in its accustomed position but it was blackened and shrivelled to the obliteration of the figures wrought upon it the satyr no longer leered from his monticule upon the naked and reluctant woman hurried towards him by the company of naughty loves tongues of fire had licked away that pictured wantonness and purged its offence behind the wreck of the portiere the doorits panels split and tormented by flamestood wide open as on the night when straining every muscle to carry that apparently so light and fragile burden laurence had lifted agnes rivers across the threshold once within the yellow drawingroom the desolation of that heretofore gracious and friendly apartment touched hard on tragedy seen as now in the furtive evening light the rain had ceased and through the remaining sheets of glass in the partially boarded and barricaded baywindow the flowerbeds of the italian garden showed in rich variety of leaf and blossom the statues gleamed calm and graceful from their white pedestals the spires of the cypresses rose with a certain velvet softness of density towards the pensive and slowly clearing sky but the room itself was ruined in most unsightly fashion stained by smoke rendered clammy and dank in places by water wreckage of the pretty costly furniture lay scattered in formless heaps upon the blackened floorwith here and there a shred of fine porcelain the gilt handle of a drawer the pages of a book reduced to tinder or the unlovely remnant of carpet or hanging it was as a place that has suffered siege and which relentless foemen have sacked and trodden underfoot so that it came to laurence very surely that not here would he find his sweet fairylady were he indeed destined in this life ever to find her again her gentle spirit could never be subjected to the indignity of dwelling amid this scene of destruction some incongruities are inadmissible to the imagination they are too violent too gross therefore the days of his beloved companions pilgrimage were endedit could not be otherwisein respect of this once so comely place but though convinced that here it was useless to await her presence there remained somewhat for laurence in all tenderness and reverence to see since the electric light was now unavailable he had ordered candles to be placed upon the chimneypiece which though yellow and disfigured still remained practically intact he moved across from the neighbourhood of the doorwaysad little clouds of corpsecoloured ashes arising about his feet as he steppedand put a match to the candles then as the light of them strengthened and steadied he looked shading his eyes with his hand towards that portion of the wall at right angles to which the painted satinwood escritoire with all its pathetic store of cherished lovetokens had formerly stood the high wainscot and brocadecovered panels masking this space had been entirely burned away disclosing a low vaulted chamber hollowed out of the thickness of the outer wall this chamber had been roughly and somewhat clumsily ceiled the whole construction showed unmistakeable traces of hasty and unskilled labour yet laurence looked at this roughhewn place of sepulture with an infinite tenderness a chastened reverence while a very vital emotion clutched at his throat and farreaching questions of life past life future and the august purposes of being through the abysm of the ages and on to the ultimate goal of things held and sifted his intelligence and his heart for it was here upon the morning following the fire that agnes riverss coffin had been found and it was from here from this hard and narrow bedby what alchemy and agency he knew notit transcended his powers to conceivethat her sweet ghost had come forth nightly through all those long and dreary years of which it sickened him to think flitting impalpable in vain endeavour to find the key to her little treasure chest that was also the key to the love she had so pathetically lost and it was here also to this same hard and narrow bed that she had returned with quick and innocently gladsome farewells in the first flush of returning day when that love by unprecedented circumstancecircumstance trenching on actual miraclehad been restored to her viewing that harsh and meagre restingplace which for the better part of a century had held all that remained of her dear body laurence felt himself strangely reconciled to actual happenings for it was better ten thousand times better that all now subsisting of her mortal investiture should rest in mother earths lapblessed and set apart by the faith and piety of ages as was that pleasant plot of sunvisited grass where the little shadows danced and beckoned in the ageold quiet of stoke riverss churchyard there he would go and watch for her possible coming and pay her the homage of his devotion when the small hours drew on towards tomorrows dawn meanwhile there was time to be passed and he did not care to leave this spot though its present desolation tore at his very vitals with memories of incalculable promise and of unconsummated delight as awakening from his dream of satisfied love long ago during that strange former existence in the summer noon under the light sibilant shelter of the lime grove so now he hungered for completeness of possession for the crowning of desire yet he kept himself in hand even as he had kept the young brown thoroughbred horse in hand when finding the level would have broken its pace and run riot more than once on the road up from the station he moved away and sat down on the defaced and ragged sill of the baywindow the moon had risen but its mild light was often obscured by softlymoving floats of thin opalescent vapour these crossed its face in apparently endless procession herded up from southward and the narrow channel sea laurence watched them at first almost unconsciously his mind occupied with other and to himself more immediate and vital interests but at length their slow and stately progress began to work upon his imagination and insinuate itself into the very substance and foundation of his thought he began to see in them a procession of the souls of all those generations of men and women whose efforts and emotions power of intellect fiercely pursued ambitions passionate devotions passionate revolts had gone to generate his own constitution mental and physical and determine his ultimate fate and so he came to regard them with a sustained and deepening attention since their aspect seemed pregnant with suggestion of admonition of encouragement of warning or restraint once again he decided to keep vigil in this house to watch with the unnumbered and unrecorded dead whose offspring and inheritor he was not until all of them should have passed by and the moon ride solitary in the heavens would he go across the valleyhimself now somewhat bitterly solitaryand visit agnes riverss grave but that procession of lowfloating vapours proved long in passing more than once a break came in it making the young man suppose that the whole of them was gone by and then again out of the south now one alone now in close ranged companies strangely shaped as though draped in dragging shrouds that interminable procession crossed the vault of the sky a terror of incalculable number of unthinkable multitude began to lay hold on him as still they came and came was it conceivable that each human life had this almost appalling vista of human lives behind it of which it was the outcome and result and in which it had consciously or unconsciously taken part there was a certain splendour in the thought though it left but little room for personal vanity yet even while watching and pondering of all this the personal note remainedfor he pondered also not without profound discouragement of his great adventure which just now appeared so signally to have failed at the half hours and hours the striking clocks warned him that the night was far spent but still that endless and mystic procession passed before his watching eyes as once before in this same room his individuality seemed to sink away from him while a horrible sense of his own nullity and nothingness prevailed but at last at last when the first chill grey of the dawn began just perceptibly to lighten the horizon behind the lime grove the last of these trailing vapours arose passed over and disappeared the moon declined towards her setting yet though she hung low the whole field of heaven was at length her own then laurence rose and went away across the quiet park and up the deep treeshadowed lane to the churchyard on the hillside across the valley sheltered by the bank of highlying woods the grass was long starred with tallgrowing buttercups blue speedwell and oxeye daisies heavy and hanging with wet only the plot beneath the grey wall of the little chancel was neatly mown while on the near side of it conspicuous from the smooth surface of the turf rising immediately surrounding it was a newmade grave the sods covering it were kept in place by a cage of osier rods some oneand laurence found it in his heart to bless that unknown ministranthad laid a spray of pink wildrose upon the head of the grave twisted into a little crown at once of blossom and of thorns laurence stood at the foot of the long narrow mound and again he kept vigilhearing the breathing of the moist earth the quick sounds of the woodland and that strange indeterminate stirring of awakening lifebeast bird insect herb and treewhich immediately precedes the birth of day more than once his heart thumped against his ribs and the lovelight sprang into his eyes for deceived by the growing colour of the east he fancied for an instant he again beheld the dear rosered of his fairyladys clinging oldworld silken gown but that fond delusion was soon dissipated wherever her light footsteps might now tread they would never in visible fashion tend earthwards again then on a sudden from the stables up at the house came the crowing of a cock answered in gallant challenge from cottage and from farmyardgrowing faint in the far distance ringing out again close at hand lusty and vigorous full of the joy of living stung by the merry sound laurence straightened himself up looked away from the osierbound rosecrowned grave over the fertile peaceful landscape the hops hung heavy upon the poles the corn warmed to ruddy yellow the grass and hedgerows as the suns rays touched them glittered with a thousand diamond points even as his lost loves little embroidered slippers had glittered when he first led her forth along the alleys of the italian garden a glad wind swept up landward from that great thoroughfare of the nations that highway of stately ships the narrow channel sea it raced through the woodland swayed the sombre plumelike branches of the ancient yewtrees and passed exultant to fulfil its cleanly lifegiving mission elsewhere laurence took a long breath filling his lungs with it it was good to taste sane and wholesome and then somehow those divine words came to him spoken in the far syrian country nearly two thousand years agothe wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth so is every one that is born of the spirit laurence stood erect and very still his head held high his face keen his lips parted in silent laughter his whole being vibrant with the surprise of a great conviction a great discovery for at length he too saw and understood he perceived that his love far from being lost was his close and intimately as she had never been before in either this life or that other halfremembered life in both of which he had loved her so well he perceived that his amazing and desperate experiment far from being a failure was on a highroad to a success hitherto undreamed of he perceived that his splendid adventure far from being ended had but just begun and that could he but keep faith with his present seeing it would not end until he too had pushed back the heavy curtain and finally crossed the threshold of socalled death nor would it end even then were light lived in the light of this his present seeing the future was illimitable since the goal of it was nothing less than union with the divine principle itself however innumerable the company of human lives that had gone to produce his own his individuality was secure henceforth since he had recognised and embraced the life which alone eternally exists and subsiststhe life in and of god five months ago crossing the atlantic in the chill of the march night while the big ship steamed eastward and the stars danced in the rigging as she sunk and swung in the trough and then roseas a horse at a fenceat the coming wave he had asked himself the question as to the profit of gaining the whole world if in so doing a man should lose his own soul all his experience since then had been a setting of that vital question at rest for ever for he had found his soul the matter was simply to the point of laughter when once apprehended in bidding him farewell his sweet companion had promised him that she and he would at last be made one being one with almighty god he had heard that as he might mere rhetoric idle though pretty words placing it in some unimaginable future his mind still in bondage to human conception of time and space now he beheld this consummation as already accomplished immediately present constant here now permanent all that it needed was just an attitude and habit of mind and then work work not so much for any great benefit derivable by others from that work though the desire of the welfare of others must be a fundamental element in that work but for the maintenance of the said allimportant attitude and habit of mind in himself almost any work would do there was his property and happily sufficient of the feudal idea still remains in england to make the possession of a great landedestate fruitful in humane relations between class and class there was the dear earth too to till and sow and render more fertile and more useful to man there were politics and public affairs in the light of his present illumination he dare approach these things strong to carve out a career for himself yet for ever keeping his secret against his heart salvation is for the individual each individual must find it for him or herself souls cannot be saved in batches but to each and all it may and will come if they have courage and fortitude and the single eye which refuses illusion and so farewell yet never farewell my first and last and only love he said looking at the osierbound grave while the shadows of the feathery yewtrees danced and beckoned upon the churchyard grass there have been partings before cruel to be born there may be partings again but they will be transitory i am not afraid that i shall ever lose you or you me i am secure in that meanwhile for your sake o dear soul of mefor so indeed you arei will make the best use of the years i may still have to live here on earth and since you once were woman no woman shall ever suffer at my handsall womanhood being sacred thenceforth since you once were womannow the work of the world calls and god helping me i will help to do it after all dear love we go forth togetheramen there are things virginia does not quite comprehend in her husband she tells the van reenan family that the english character is very obscure but she has had no more dramatic moments in respect of that character she pays a long visit yearly to the other side and is as popular as ever on this side too she has had her social triumphs the yellow drawingroom at stoke rivers has been rebuilt but laurence keeps it for his own use he has moved the books into it from the libraries thus giving virginia a large suite of rooms for social entertainments lately when the red flame of war threatened the integrity of the british empire laurence went south and for a time lived that larger lifein which woman takes her place perhaps her safest one as a hope or a memory merelythe life a man lives among men jack bellingham volunteered also he thinks laurence a better fellow than ever yet is perplexed at moments as to whether he has or has not developedlike so many of his familyinto a
