is altogether a work of fiction the characters it portrays their circumstances and the episodes in which they play a part are my own invention every sincere and scientific student of human nature and the social scene must of necessity depend upon direct observation of life for his general typesthe said types being the composite photographs with which study and observation have supplied him but for the shaping of individual characters out of the said types he should in my opinion rely exclusively upon his imagination and his sense of dramatic coherence exactly in proportion as he does this can he claim to be a true artist since the novel to be a work of art must be impersonal neither autobiographical nor biographicali am not of course speaking of the historical novel whether the history involved be ancient or contemporary nor am i speaking of an admitted satire i wish further to assure my readers that the names of my characters have been selected at random and belong certainly in sequence of christian and surname to no persons with whom i am or ever have been acquainted i may also add that although i have often visited stourmouth and its neighborhoodof which i am very fondmy knowledge of the social life of the district is of the smallest while my knowledge of its municipal and commercial life is nil finally the lamented disappearance of la gioconda from the salon carr of the louvre took place when the whole of my manuscript was already in the hands of the printers may i express a pious hope that this most seductive of women will be safely restored to her former dwellingplace before any copies of my novel are in the hands of the public lucas malet august i concerning the dead and the living adrian savage chapter i in which the reader is invited to make the acquaintance of the hero of this book adrian savagea noticeably distinct wellgroomed and wellsetup figure showing dark in the harsh light of the winter afternoon against the pallor of the asphaltwalked rapidly across the pont des arts and about halfway along the quai malaquais turned in under the archway of a cavernous portecochre the bare spindly planes and poplars in the center of the courtyard to which this gave access shivered visibly doubtless the lightly clad lichenstained nymph to whom they acted as bodyguard would have shivered likewise had her stony substance permitted for icicles fringed the lip of her tilted pitcher and caked the edge of the shellshaped basin into which under normal conditions its waters dripped with a not unmusical tinkle yet the atmosphere of the courtyard struck the young man as almost mild compared with that of the quay outside along which the northeasterly wind scourged bitingly upon the farther bank of the turgid graygreen river the buildings of the louvre stood out pale and stark against a sullen backing of snowcloud for the past week paris had cowered sunless in the grip of a black frost if those leaden heavens would only elect to unload themselves of their burden the weather might take up to adrian savage in excellent health and prosperous circumstances the cold in itself mattered nothingwould indeed rather have acted as a stimulus to his chronic appreciation of the joy of living but for the fact that he had today been suddenly and unexpectedly called upon to leave paris and bid farewell to one of its inhabitants eminently and even perplexingly dear to him having for all his young masculine optimism the artists exaggerated sensibility to the aspects of outward things and equally exaggerated capacity for conceivinghighly improbabledisaster it troubled him to make his adieux under such forbidding meteorologic conditions his regrets and alarms would he felt have been decidedly lessened had kindly sunshine set a golden frame about his parting impressions nevertheless asraising his hat gallantly to the concierge seated in her glassfronted lodge swathed mummylike in shawls and mufflershe turned shortly to the left along the backs of the tall gray houses a high expectation at once delightful and disturbing took possession of him to the exclusion of all other sensations for the past eighteen monthsever since indeed the distressingly sudden death of his old friend the popular painter horace st legerhe had made this selfsame little pilgrimage as frequently as respectful discretion permitted and invariably at the selfsame spotit was where as he noted amusedly between the third and fourth of the heavily barred groundfloor windows a square leaden waterpipe running the height of the house wall from the parapet of the steep slated roof reached the grating in the pavementthis quickening of his whole being came upon him however occupied his thoughts might previously have been with his literary work or with the conduct of the bimonthly review of which he was at once assistant editor and part proprietor this quickening remained with him moreover as he entered a doorway set in the near corner of the courtyard and ran up the flights of waxed wooden stairs to the third story in no country of the civilized world it may be confidently asserted do affairs of the heart even when virtuous command more indulgent sympathy than in france it followed that adrian entertained his own emotions with the same eager and friendly amenity which he would have extended to those of another man in like case he was not in the least contemptuous or suspicious of them he permitted cynicism no smallest word in the matter on the contrary he hailed the present ebullience of his affections as among those captivating surprises of earthly existence upon which one should warmly congratulate oneself having liveliest cause for rejoicing today as usual there was a brief pause before the door of the vestibule opened a space of delicious anxietycarrying him back to the poignant hopes and despairs of childhood when the fate of some anticipated treat hangs in the balancewhile he inquired of the trim waitingmaid whether her mistress was or was not receiving followed by that other moment childlike too in its deliciously troubled emotion and vision when passing from the corridor into the warm vaguely fragrant atmosphere of the long pale rosered and canvascolored drawingroom he once again beheld the lady of his desires and of his heart from the foregoing it may be deduced and rightly that adrian savage was of a romantic temperament and that he was very much in love let it be immediately added however that he was a young gentleman whose head to employ a vulgarism was most emphatically screwed on the right way only child of an eminent english physician of good family long resident in paris and of a french mothera woman of great personal charm and some distinction as a poetesshe had inherited along with a comfortable little income of about eighteen hundred pounds a year a certain sagacity and decision in dealing with men and with affairs as well as quick sensibility in relation to beauty and to drama artist and practical man of the world went for the most part very happily hand and hand in him at moments however they quarreled to the production of complications the death of both his parents occurred during his tenth year leaving him to the guardianship of a devoted french grandmother under the terms of doctor savages will onethird of his income was to be applied to the boys maintenance and education until his majority the remaining twothirds being set aside to accumulate until his twentythird birthday at that age so the document in question stated i apprehend that my son will have discovered in what direction his talents and aptitudes lie i do not wish to fetter his choice of a profession still i do most earnestly request him not to squander the considerable sum of money into possession of which he will then come but to spend it judiciously in the service of those talents and aptitudes with the purpose of securing for himself an honorable and distinguished career this idea that something definite something notable even in the matter of achievement was demanded from him clung to the boy through school and college actingsince he was healthy highspirited and confidentas a wholesome incentive to effort even before fulfilling his term of military service adrian had decided what his career should be letters called him with no uncertain voice he would be a writerdramatist novelist an artist in psychology in touch at all points with the inexhaustible riches of the human scene his fathers science his mothers poetic gift should combine so he believed to produce in him a very special vocation his ambitions at this period were colossal the raw material of his selected art appeared to him nothing less than the feesimple of creation he planned literary undertakings beside which the numerically formidable volumes of balzac or zola shriveled to positive nexttonothingness fortunately fuller knowledge begot a juster sense of proportion while his native shrewdness lent a hand to knocking extravagant conceptions on the head by the time he came into possession of the comfortable sum of money that had accumulated during his minority and he was free to follow his bent adrian found himself contented with quite modest first steps in authorship for a couple of years he traveled resolved to broaden his acquaintance with men and things to get some clear firsthand impressions both of the ancient deeprooted civilizations of the east and the amazing mushroom growths of america on his return to paris it so happened that a leading bimonthly review which had shown hospitality to his maiden literary productions stood badly in need of financial support adrian bought a preponderating interest in it and by the time in questionnamely the winter of and the dawn of his thirtieth yearhad contrived to make it not only a powerful factor in contemporary criticism and literary output but a solid commercial success to be nineandtwenty the owner of a wellfavored person of admitted talent and business capacity and to be honestly in love is surely to be as happily circumstanced as mortal man can reasonably ask to be that the course of true love should not run quite smooth that the beloved one should prove elusive difficult of access that obstacles should encumber the path of achievement that mists of doubt and uncertainty should drift across the face of the situation obscuring its issues only served in adrians case to heighten interest and whet appetite the last thing he asked was that the affair should move on fashionable conventional lines a matter for newspaper paragraphs and social gossip the justifying charm of it to his thinking resided in precisely those elements of uncertainty and difficulty if in the twentieth century a man is to subscribe to the constraints of marriage at all let it at least be in some sort marriage by capture and as he told himself what man worth the name let alone what artist what poetvowed by his calling to confession of the transcendental the eternally mystic and sacred in this apparently most primitive even savage of human relationswould choose to capture his exquisite prey amid the blatant materialism the vulgar noise and chaffer of the modern social highway rather than pursue it through the shifting lights and shadows of mysterious woodland places the dread of its final escape always upon him till his feet were weary with running and his hands with dividing the thick leafy branches his ears all the while tormented by the baffling piercing sweetness of the halfheard pipes of pan not infrequently adrian would draw himself up short in the midst of such rhapsodizings humorously conscious that the artistic side of his nature had got the bit so to speak very much between its teeth and was running away altogether too violently with its soberer more practical stable companion for as he frankly admitted to the ordinary observer it must seem a rather ludicrously far cry from madame st legers pleasant wellfound flat in the center of cosmopolitan twentiethcentury paris to the arcana of pagan myth and legend yet speaking quite soberly and truthfully it was of such ancient secret and symbolic things he instinctively thought when looking into gabrielle st legers goldenbrown eyes and noting the ironic loveliness of her smiling lips that was just the delight just the provocation just what differentiated her from all other women of his acquaintance from any other woman who so far had touched his heart or stirred his senses her recondite beautyto quote the phrase of this analytical loverchallenged his imagination with the excitement of something hidden though whether hidden by intentional and delicate malice or merely by lack of opportunity for selfdeclaration he was at a loss to determine daughter wife mother widowyoung though she still was she had sounded the gamut of womans most vital experiences yet it seemed to him although she had fulfilled and was fulfilling the obligations incident to each of these several conditions in so gracious and irreproachable a manner her soul had never been effectively snared in the meshes of any net good catholic good housewife sympathetic hostess intelligent and discriminating critic stillhe might be a fool for his pains but what artist doesnt know better than to underrate the fine uses of follyhe believed her to be either by fate or by choice essentially a belle au bois dormant and further believed himself thanks to the workings of constitutional masculine vanity to be the princely adventurer designed by providence for the far from disagreeable duty of waking her up only just now providence to put it roughly appeared to have quite other fish for him to fry and it was under compulsion of such prospective fishfrying that he sought her apartment overlooking the quai malaquais this afternoon reluctantly to bid her farewell chapter ii wherein a very modern young man tells a timehonored tale with but small encouragement disappointment awaited him madame st leger was receiving but to his chagrin another visitor had forestalled his adventwitness a womans furlined wrap lying across the lid of the painted venetian chest in the corridor adrian bestowed a glance of veritable hatred upon the garment then recognizing it felt a little better for it belonged to anastasia beauchamp an old friend not unsympathetic as he believed to his suit sympathy however was hardly the note struck on his entrance miss beauchamp and madame st leger stood in the vacant rosered carpeted space at the far end of the long room in front of the open fire both were silent yet adrian was aware somehow they had only that moment ceased speaking and that their conversation had been momentous in character the high tension of it held them to the point of their permitting him to walk the whole length of the room before turning to acknowledge his presence this was damping for adrian who like most agreeable young men thought himself entitled to and well worth a welcome but not a bit of it the elder womanhighshouldered shortwaisted an admittedly liberal sixty her arms disproportionate in their length and thinness to her low staturecontinued to hold her hostesss right hand in both hers and look at her intently as though enforcing some request or admonition miss beauchamp it may be noted in passing affected a certain juvenility of apparel today she wore a short purple serge walkingsuit a velvet toque of the same color trimmed with sable and blushroses perched itself on her elaborately dressed hair which in obedience to the then prevailing fashion showed not gray but a full coppery red her eyebrows and eyelids were darkly penciled and powder essayed to mask wrinkles and sallowness of complexion yet the very frankness of these artifices tended to rob them of offense or in any serious degreethe first surprise of them overto mar the genial promise of her quick bluegray eyes and her thin witty strongly marked rather masculine countenance adrian usually accepted her superficial bedizenments without criticism as just part of her excellent if somewhat bizarre personality but todayhis temper being slightly ruffledunder the cold diffused light of the range of tall windows they started to his seeing into quite unpardonable prominencea prominence punctuated by the grace and the proudly youthful aspect of the woman beside her madame st leger was clothed in unrelieved black from the frill high about her long throat to the hem of her trailing cling skirts over her head she had thrown a black gauze scarf soberly framing her heartshaped face in fine semitransparent folds and obscuring the burnished lights in her brown hair which stood away in soft dense ridges on either side the parting and was gathered into a loose knot at the back of her head her white skin was very clear a faint scarlet tinge showing through it in the round of either cheek but just now she was pale and this along with the framing black gauze scarf developed the subtle likeness whichas adrian heldshe bore in the proportions of her face and molding of it to leonardos worldfamous mona lisa in salon carr of the louvre the strange recondite quality of her beauty and the challenge it offered were peculiarly in evidence thereby making as he reflected cruel though unconscious havoc of the juvenile pretensions of poor anastasia and this was painful to him so that in wishingas he incontestably didthe said anastasia absent his wish may have been dictated almost as much by chivalry as by selfishness all of which conflicting perceptions and emotions tended to rob him of his habitual and happy selfassurance his voice took on quite plaintive tones and his gay brown eyes a quite pathetic and orphaned expression as he exclaimed ah i see that i disturb you i am in the way my visit is inconvenient to you the faint tinge of scarlet leaped into madame st legers cheeks and an engaging dimple indicated itself at the left corner of her closed and smiling mouth meanwhile anastasia beauchamp broke forth impetuously no no on the contrary it is i who am in the way though our dear exquisite friend is too amiable to tell me so i have victimized her far too long already i have bored her distractingly indeed it is impossible you should ever bore me the younger woman put in quietly then i have done worse i have just a little bit angered you miss beauchamp declared oh i know i have been richly irritating preaching antiquated doctrines of moderation in thought and conduct but les vrits btes remain les vrits vraies now as ever with that i go ma toute chre et belle i leave you and she added turning to adrian i leave you you lucky young man in possession retrieve my failures be as amusing as i have been intolerablebut see one moment since the opportunity offers tell me you are going to accept those articles on the stage in the eighteenth century by my poor little protg lewis byewater for publication in the review am i not always ready to attempt the impossible for your sake dear mademoiselle adrian inquired gallantly humhumis it as bad as that then are his articles so impossible byewater has soaked himself in his subject he has been tremendously conscientious he has taken immense trouble over them he has taken immensely too much that is just the worry his conscience protrudes at every sentence it prods it positively impales you the speaker raised his neat black eyebrows and broad shoulders in delicate apology alas he is pompous pedantic i grieve to report he is heavy very heavy your little byewater the eighteenthcentury stage was many things which it had no doubt much better not have been but was it heavy assuredly not ah poor child he is young he is nervous he has not command of his style yet you should be lenient give him opportunity and encouragement and he will find himself will rise to the possibilities of his own talent after all she added every writer must begin some time and somewhere but not necessarily in the pages of my review adrian protested with every desire to be philanthropic i dare not convert it into a crche a foundling hospital for the maintenance of ponderous literary infants my subscribers might not unreasonably object you floated ren dax but he is a genius madame st leger remarked quietly yes adrian asserted there could be no doubt about his value from the first he is extraordinary he is extraordinarily perverted cried miss beauchamp i am much attached to m ren dax madame st leger spoke deliberately and a little silence followed as when people listen almost anxiously to the sound of a pebble dropped into a well trying to hear it touch bottom miss beauchamp was the first to break it she did so laughing in that case ma toute belle you also are perverse though i trust not yet perverted it amounts to this then she continued pulling her long gloves up her thin arms i am to dispose of poor byewater shatter his hopes crush his ambitions tell him in short that he wont do just heaven you who have arrived how soon you become cruel she looked from the handsome blackbearded young man to the beautiful enigmatic young woman and her witty accentuated face bore a singular expression goodby charming gabrielle she said forgive me if i have been tedious for truly i am devotedly fond of you and goodby to you mr savage yes i go to dispose of the illfated byewater but ah ah if you only knew all i have done this afternoon or tried to do to serve you whereupon adrian smitten by sudden apprehension of deep and possibly dangerous issues followed her to the door crying eagerly wait i implore you dear mademoiselle do not be too precipitate in disposing of byewater i may have underrated the worth of his articles i will reread i will reconsider nothing presses i have to leave paris for a week or two let the matter rest till my return i may find it possible after all to accept them then the door closed he came back and stood on the vacant space of rosered carpet in the pleasant glow of the fire she is a clever woman he said reflectively she has cornered me and that is not quite fairon the review for they constitute a veritable atrocity of dullness those articles by her miserable little byewater it is part of her code of friendshipit holds true all round if she helps others madame st leger left her sentence unfinished and glancing with a hint of veiled mockery at her guest sat down in a carven highbacked rosecushioned chair at right angles to the fireplace and picked up a bundle of white needlework from the little table beside it you mean that miss beauchamp does her best for me too adrian inquired tentatively but the lady was too busy unfolding her work finding needle and thimble to make answer i foresee that i shall be compelled to print the wretched little byewater in the end he murmured still tentatively did you not tell miss beauchamp you were going away gabrielle asked she had no desire to continue the conversation on this particular note yes i leave paris tonight that is my excuse for asking to see you this afternoon but i feel that my visit is illtimed i observed directly i came in that you looked a little fatigued i fear you are suffering ought you to undertake the exertion of receiving visitors i doubt it yet i should have been desolated had you refused me for i leave as i say tonight in response to a sudden call to england upon businessthat of certain members of my fathers family i am barely acquainted with them but they claim my assistance and i cannot refuse it i could not do otherwise than tell you of this unexpected journey could i it distresses me to find you suffering gabrielle had looked at him smiling her lips closed the little dimple again showing in her left cheek his eagerness and volubility were diverting to her they enabled her to think of him as still very young and she quite earnestly wished thus to think of him to do so made for security at this period madame st leger put a very high value upon security but indeed she said i am quite well the corridor is chilly and i have been going to and fro preparing a little fte for bette she has her friends our neighbor madame bernards two little girls from the floor below to spend the afternoon with her my mother is now kindly guarding the small flock but i could not burden her with preliminariesi am quite well and for the moment i am quite at leisure bring a chair sit down it is for me to condole with you rather than for you to condole with me she went on in her quiet voice for this is far from the moment one would select for a crosschannel journey but then you are more english than french in all that hereditary instincts assert themselves in you you have the islanders inborn sense of being cramped by the modest proportions of his island and craving to step off the edge of it into space the young man placed his hat on the floor opened the fronts of his overcoat and drew a chair up to the near side of the low worktable whence he commanded an uninterrupted view of his hostesss charming person that is right she said now tell me about this sudden journey is it for long when may we expect you back what do i know he replied spreading out his hands quickly it may be a matter of days it may be a matter of weeks i am ignorant of the amount of business entailed the whole thing has come upon me as so complete a surprise what induced my venerable cousin to select me as his executor remains inexplicable i remember seeing him when as a child i visited england with my parents i remember also that he filled me with alarm and melancholy he lived in a big solemn house on the outskirts of a great noisy dirty manufacturing town in yorkshire it was impressed upon me that i must behave in his presence with eminent circumspection since he was very religious very intellectual i fear i was an impertinent little boy he appeared to me to worship a most odious deity who permitted no amusements no holidays no laughter while his conversationmy cousins i mean not that of the almightystruck me as quite the dullest i had ever listened to i cried very loud and very often to the consternation of the whole establishment and demanded to be taken home to paris at once i never saw him again until three years ago when he spent a few days here on a return journey from carlsbad as in duty bound i did what i could to render their stay agreeable to him and his companions adrians expression became at once apologetic and merry my efforts were not as i supposed crowned with at all flattering success my venerable cousin still filled me with melancholy and alarm in face of his immense seriousness i appeared to myself as some capering harlequin therefore it is as you will readily understand with unqualified amazement that i learn he has intrusted the administration of his very considerable estate to my care really his faith in me constitutes a vastly embarrassing compliment i wish to heaven he had formed a less exalted estimate of my probity and business acumen and looked elsewhere for an executor he had no children poor man madame st leger inquired sympathetically on the contrary he leaves twin daughters and it is in conjunction with thebrieflyelder of these two ladies that i am required to act gabrielle moved slightly in her chair her eyelids were halfclosed she looked at the young man sideways without turning her head her resemblance to the mona lisa was startling just then but it was mona lisa in a most mischievous humor in many ways you cannot fail to find that interesting she said you are a professional psychologist a student of character and then too it is your nature to be untiring in kindness and helpfulness to women to women of flesh and blood yes possibly if they are amiable enough to accept my services adrian returned somewhat warmly a lovers resentment of any ascription of benevolence toward the sex merely as such all agog in him but are these ladies really of flesh and blood they affected me when i last saw them rather as shadowy and harassed abstractions i gazed at them in wonder they are not old but have they ever been young i doubt it with so aggressively ethical and educative a father i was at a loss how to approach them they were so silent so restrained so apparently bankrupt in the small change of social intercourse if they did not add sensibly to my alarm they most unquestionably contributed to my melancholythe humiliating disintegrating melancholy of harlequin capering in conscious fatuity before an audience morally and physically incapable of laughter all this was bad enough when our connection was but superficial and transitory it will be ten thousand times worse when we are forced into a position of unnatural intimacy during this tirade gabrielle had shaken out the thin folds of her needlework and begun setting quick stitches methodically her hands were strong square in the palm and the fingertips finely modeled finely capablemore fitted as it might seem to hold maulstick and palate or even wield mallet and chisel than to put rows of small even snippety stitches in a childs lawn frock if the fifteenth century and the voluptuous humanism of the italian renaissance found subtle reflection in her face the twentieth century and its awakening militant feminism found expression in her firm hands and their promise of fearless and ready strength i believe you do both yourself and those two ladies an injustice she said her head bent over her stitching it will not be the very least in the character of harlequin that they receive you but rather in that of a savior a liberator for you will be delightful to themah i see it all quite clearlytactful considerate reassuring that is your rle and you will play it to perfection how can you do otherwise since not only your sense of dramatic necessity but your goodness of heart will be engaged and take it from me the enjoyment will not be exclusively on their side for you will find it increasingly inspiring to act providence to those two shadowy oldyoung ladies as you see age vanish and youth return i envy you think what an admirable mission you are about to fulfil she glanced up suddenly her eyes and the turn of her mouth conveying to unhappy adrian a distracting combination of friendlinessdetestable sentiment since it went no furtherand of raillery then her face positively brilliant with mischief she gave him a final dig what a thousand pities though that there are two of these abstractions whom it is your office to materialize had there been but one how far simpler the problem of your position the young man literally bounded on to his feet his expression eloquent of the liveliest repudiation and reproach but madame st legers head was bent over her needlework again she stitched stitched in the calmest manner imaginable talking meanwhile in a quiet even voice did i not tell you we are en fte bette has her friends the little bernards to spend the afternoon with her it is an excuse for keeping her indoors the modern craze for sending children out in all weathers does not appeal to me i do not believe in a system of hardening indeed adrian commented with meaning for little girls she inquired oh no decidedly not for grownup people especially for men when they are young and in good health it may of course have excellent results ah he said resentfully theythe children i meanare busy in the diningroom making rather terrible culinary experiments with a new dolls cooking stove shall we go and see how they are getting on i ought perhaps to just take a look at them and assure myself they are not tiring my mother too much and then they will be distressed my mother and bette if they do not have an opportunity to bid you goodby before your journey for once adrian was guilty of ignoring his hostesss suggestions he stood leaning one elbow upon the chimneypiece andabove the powderblue chinese jars and ivory godlings adorning itscrutinizing his own image in the lookingglass he had just suffered a sharp and to his thinking most uncalledfor rebuff he smarted under it unable for the moment to recover his equanimity but contemplating the image held by the mirror his soul received a sensible measure of comfort the smooth opaque colorless complexion the pointed black beard so close cut as in no degree to hide the forcible line of the jaw or distort the excellent proportions of the mask the thick welltrimmed mustache standing upward from the lip and leaving the curved mouth free the straight squaretipped nose with its suggestion of pugnacity let alone the last word of contemporary fashion in collar and tie and heavy boxcloth overcoat the cut of which lent itself to the values of a tall wellsetup figureall these went to form a far from discouraging picture yes surely he was a goodlooking fellow enough one moreover with the promise of plenty of fight in him daring constitutionally obstinate not in the least likely tamely to take no for an answer once his mind was made up then in thought he made a rapid survey of the mental social moral and financial qualifications of those who had formed the circle of poor horace st legers friends and who during the years of his marriage had been permitted the entre of his house a varied and remarkable company when one came to review itsavants artists politicians men of letters musicians journalists from octogenarian m de cubires member of the senate member of the academy and chevalier of the legion of honor to that most disconcerting sport of wayward genius vitriolic caricaturist and elegant minor poet ren dax whose immense domed head and neat little toy of a body had won him at school the nickname of le tetardthe tadpolean appellation as descriptive as it was unflattering and whichrather cruellyhad stuck to him ever since adrian marshaled all these examined their possible claims and pronounced each in turn ineligible some thank heaven were securely married already others though untrammeled by the bonds of holy matrimony were trammeled by bonds in no wise holy yet scarcely less prohibitive some were too old others too young or too poor some as for example ren dax were altogether too eccentric true madame st leger had just now declared herself warmly attached to him but wasnt that the best proof of the absence of danger a woman doesnt openly affirm her regard for a man unless that regard is of purely platonic and innocuous character and then after allexcellent thoughtwas it not he adrian savage who had been admitted even during the tragic hours of poor horaces agony who had watched by the corpse through a stifling summer night a night too hot for sleep restless with the continual sound of footsteps and voices the smell of the asphalt and of the river and since then was it not to him gabrielle and her mother madame vernois had repeatedly turned for advice in matters of business fortified by which reflections stimulated though stung by her teasing defiant of all other possible and impossible lovers the young man wheeled round and stood directly in front of gabrielle st leger listen trs chre madame et amie listen one little minute he said i implore you it is true that i go tonight and for how long a time i am ignorant to arrange the worldly affairs of my alarming old relative montagu smyrthwaite and incidentally to adjust those of his two dessicated daughters but it is equally truefor i vehemently refuse such a solution of the problem of my relation to either of those ladies as your words seem to prefigurei repeat it is equally true that i shall return at the very earliest opportunity and return in precisely the same attitude of mind as i gonamely wholly convinced wholly faithful incapable of any attachment indifferent to any sentiment save one the corners of his mouth quivered and his gay brown eyes were misty with tears i do not permit myself to enlarge upon the nature of that sentiment today to do so might seem intrusive even wanting in delicacy but i do permit myselfyour own words have procured me the opportunityboth to declare its existence and to assert my profound assurance of its permanence you may not smile upon it dear madame you may even regard it as an impertinence a nuisance yet it is therethere adrian drummed with his closed fist upon the region of his heart it has been there for a longer period than i care to mention and it declines to be eradicated while life remains it remains unalterable it is idle absolutely idle believe me to invite it to lessen or to depart madame st leger had risen too laying her work down on the little table her face was grave to the point of displeasure the tinge of scarlet had died out in the round of her cheeks she was about to speak but the young man spread out his hands with an almost violent gesture nono he cried do not say anything do not i entreat attempt to answer me when i came here this afternoon i had no thought of making this avowal it has been forced from me and may well appear to you premature therefore i entreat you for the moment ignore it let everything between us remain as before that is so easy you see since i am going away only he added more lightly i think if you will excuse me i will not join that interesting conference of amateur chefs in the diningroom my mind i confess at this moment is slightly preoccupied and i might prove a but clumsy and distracted assistant may i ask you therefore kindly to express to your mother madame vernois and to the ravishing mademoiselle bette my regret at being unable to make my farewells in person he picked up his hat buttoned his overcoat and without attempting to take his hostesss hand backed away from her with your permission i shall write at intervals during my unwilling exile he said but merely to recount my adventuresnothing beyond my adventures rest assured these are likely to possess a certain piquancy i imagine and may serve to amuse you something of his habitual happy selfconfidence had returned to him his air was highspirited courteous instinct with the splendid optimism of his vigorous young manhood as he paused hat in hand for a last word in the doorway au revoir trs chre madame he cried i go to a land of penetrating fogs and a household of pensive abstractions but i shall come back unaffected by either since i carry a certain memory a certain aspiration in my heart au revoir god keep you ah very surely and with what a quite infinite gladness i shall come back chapter iii telling how ren dax cooked a savory omelette and why gabrielle st leger looked out of an open window at past midnight wrapped in a wadded silk dressinggown with frilled muslin cape and undersleeves to it gabrielle st leger had made her nightly round had seen that lights were switched off fires safe shutters bolted and the maids duly retired to their bedchamber had embraced her mother and looked into details of nightlight and spiritlamp lest the excessive cold should render some hot beverage advisable for the elder lady in the course of the night had visited bette in the little room adjoining her own and found the child snuggled down in her cot profoundly and deliciously asleep then being at last free of further obligation to house or household she turned the key in the lock of her bedroom door and sat down to think until the days work its courtesies as well as its duties was fully done she had agreed with herself not to think for even startling events and agitating experiences should in her opinion be dealt with methodically in their proper season and order without fear and without haste only so could you be both just and clearsighted in respect of them all of whichhad she known itwent to prove a theory of adriansnamely that in her case as in that of so many modern women between the ages of eighteen and say eight and twenty the reasoning the intellectual rather than the sensuous and emotional elements are in the ascendant and indeed gabrielle honestly regretted that which had today happened by the conversion of a valued friend into a declared lover it was tiresome really tiresome to a degree nor was her vexation lessened by the fact that she could not excuse herself of blame the catastrophe had been precipitated by her fatal habit of teasing how constantly she resolved to be staid and serious in the presence of mankind and then all uninvited a sprickety mischievous humor would take her making it irresistible delicately to poke fun at those large selfconfident masculine creatures to plague and trick them placing them at a disadvantage and by so doing to lower for a moment at least the crest of their overweening selfcomplacency only this afternoon as she ruefully admitted she had gone unwisely far letting malice tread hard on the heels of mere mischief this was what vexed her most for why should malice find entrance in this particular connection gabrielle would gladly have shirked the question but it stood out in capital letters right in front of her with a portly note of interrogation at the end of the sentence asking almost audibly why why why with a movement of her hands at once impatient and deprecatory the young woman lay back in her long chair in part it was anastasia beauchamps fault anastasia had come rather close venturing to criticize and to warn anastasia was antifeministe distrustful of modern tendencies of independence of womans life and outlook in and for itself this genial unbeliever preached orthodoxy this unmarried womanwith a legend for there were those who reported events in the far pastpreached matrimony in the end she said in the end independence proved a mistake and not improbably she was right in as far as her own generation was concerned but now the world had moved forward a big piece the conditions were different and in this gabrielles generation how save by experiment could you possibly prove that independence mightnt very much pay whereupon her thought began to march down alluring avenues of speculation guarded by vague masterful theories of feminine supremacy the crimson shades of the electric lights above her dressingtable the crimson silk coverlet of her bed gave an effect of warmth and comfort to the otherwise coolcolored room its carved white furniture and bluegreen carpet curtains and walls formerly this had been a guestchamber but since her husbands death gabrielle had taken it for her own her former room was too peopled with experiences and memories for solitude and like all strong and selfrealized natures gabrielle demanded solitude at timesa place not only for rest but for those intimate unwitnessed battles which necessarily beset the strong just now however the desired solitude was almost too complete presently her attention began to be occupied by it to the exclusion of all other things in the stillness of the sleeping house she heard the wind crying along the steep houseroofs and hissing against the windows there was a note of homelessness even of desolation in the sound involuntarily her thought returned upon adrian savage she saw the mail steamer thrashing out from calais harbor into the black welter of blizzard and winter sea saw too the young mans momentarily tremulous lips and tearful eyes as he declared his love and the subsequent fine recovery of his natural gladness of aspect as standing hat in hand in the doorway a notably gallant and handsome figure he had asserted his speedy return rather than bade her goodby for quite an appreciable space of time she gazed at this visualized recollection of him then shutting her eyes she turned her back on it and lay sideways in the long chair she determined to be rid of it almost fiercely she told it to go for it was useless to deny that it both charmed and moved her and she didnt want that and all which it involved and stood for earnestly honestly she didnt want itah what misguided temerity to have teased for she wantedyes she did anastasia beauchamps middleaged wisdom notwithstandingto retain her but lately acquired freedom not only the repose but the stimulating clarity of mind and obligation the conscious development of personality and broadening of thought which went along with that freedom she had passed straight from the obedience of young girlhood to the obedience of young wifehood now she wanted to belong wholly and exclusively to herself not to be the property of any man however devoted talented charmingnot evernot certainly for a long while yet this craving for the conservation of her freedom took its rise neither in the fact that the memory of her husband was hateful to her nor that it was so dear as to render the thought of a second marriage a desecration shocking to the heart she remembered horace st leger with affection in many respects with gratitude he had been considerate watchfully protective of her beauty and her youth as the mother of his child he had yielded her a worship touched by an immense tenderness he had been irreproachably loyal and indulgent all this she admitted and valued wasnt it indeed very muchthe circumstances of her marriage moreover had not been without their romantic aspect madame vernois after the death of her husband who held a professorship at the collge de france both from motives of economy and the wish to be near her own family had retired to her native chambry in the haute savoie it was in this strangely picturesque town rich in remarkable buildings and in traditions both literary and historic guarded by fantastic mountains and traversed by unruly torrents that gabrielle vernois passed her childhoodmixing in a society both refined and devout though somewhat prejudiced and circumscribed of outlook the members of it being more distinguished for the magnitude of their united ages and the multitude of their quarterings than for the length of their purses or their acquaintance with the world as it now actually is and it was here tooshe being barely nineteen he little short of fiftythat horace st leger had met her had been captivated by her singular type of beauty and the delicious combination of her innocence and ready wit he was something of a connoisseur in women now he surely discovered a unique specimen naturally he wished to acquire that specimen for himself the years of his apprenticeship were over he had made a name had within the limits of his capacity evolved his style and mastered the exacting technique of his art he was young for his age too wellpreserved in the plentitude of his popularity he had made money and he had spent money but he had never to all appearance been more secure of continuing to make he could well afford to indulge his tastes even when they took the expensive form of a serious establishment and a seductive wife he hastened back to paris put a final and satisfactory termination to a connection which had long lost its pristine ardors and begun to pall upon him and then returned to chambry officially to offer this enchanting child of nineteen the sum total of his lifes achievement in respect of fame fortune social opportunity along with that suavity of temper and outlook which result from the successful cultivation of a facile talent untroubled by the torments and dislocations of genius the young girls dowry was of the slenderest the marriage offered not only a secure and agreeable future for herself butand this influenced her decision at least equallyrelief to her mother from straitened means and their attendant deprivations and anxieties the subtle unrest the haunting ambitions and curiosities of her awakening womanhood stirred in her while the disparity of age between herself and her suitor seemed to her inexperience a matter of indifference the marriage took place in due course and ostensibly all went well yet looking back upon it now sitting here alone in her bedchamber while the wind cried along the houseroofs and paris cowered in the grip of the bitter frost gabrielle st leger knew that she had learned life the actualities both of human nature and civilized society in a hard enough school for indisputably the thirty years difference in age between herself and her husband which before marriage had seemed so negligible a quantity entailed consequences that intruded themselves at every turn st legers character and opinions were fixed crystallized insusceptible of change while her own were still if not in the actually fluid yet in the distinctly malleable stage this rendered any equality of intercourse impossible her husband treated her as a child whose ignorance one finds exquisitely entertaining and enlightens with high if indulgent amusementhis attitude toward her quasipaternal in its serene assumption of omniscience yet being quickwitted and observant she soon perceived that assumption did not receive by any means universal indorsement among the younger generation of the artistic and literary brotherhood it became evident to her that though the man was held in affection the painter was regarded as a bit of a charlatan destitute of illumination and sincerity of methodas one who had never possessed the courage or the capacity to attempt any lifting the veil of isis and penetration of the mysteries it conceals nor was she slow to learn hearing the witty talk and covert allusions of the dinnertable and studioalthough her guests made honest and honorable effort to restrain their tongues in her presencethat the rule of faith and morals which had been so earnestly enjoined upon her in her childhood was very much of a dead letter to the average man and woman of the world the general scheme of existence was a far more complicated affair than she had been taught to suppose the dividing line between the sheep and the goats was by no means always easy of recognition delightful people did very shady not to say very outrageous and abominable things she suffered moments of cruel perspicacity and consequent disgust during which she was tempted to accuse even her dearly loved mother of having purposely misled and lied to her for was it not idle to suppose that her husband differed from other men or that his passion for her was unique without predecessors was it not very much more reasonable to see in the perfection of tactful delicacy with which he treated her proof positive of a large and varied emotional experience then followed a further discovery in this marriage she had looked confidently for a brilliant future but in plain truth what future remained st leger had reached the zenith of his career he was well on in middle life the only possible future for him lay in the direction of decline and decay she recognized that her mission therefore was not to share a brightening glory but to maintain a fondly cherished illusion to soften the asperities of his declension and mask the approach of age and lessening powers by the stimulus of her own radiant youth one by one these revelations came upon her with the shock of detected and abiding deceptions her pride suffered her jealous respect for her own intelligence and personality was rudely shaken but she kept her own counsel making neither complaint nor outcry silently after a struggle which left its impress in the irony of her smiling eyes and lips she faced each discovery in turn and reckoned with it then she ranged herself dismissing once and for all as she believed highflown heroic conceptions of love between man and woman accepting human nature and human relations as they actually are and forgivingthough it shrewdly taxed her longanimityall those pious frauds which from time immemorial civilized parents and teachers have supposed it their duty to practise upon the children whom they at once adore and betray it remained to her credit however that even in the most searching hours of disillusionment gabrielle did not lose her sense of justice or fail to discriminate to the best of her ability between that for which the society in which he moved and that for which her husband personally should be held responsible so doing she admitted and gladly that any legitimate cause of quarrel with him was of the smallest taking all the circumstances of the case into account he had behaved well even admirably by her the way of the world its habits and standards the constitution of human nature rather than horace st leger was in fault and it was precisely on that finding as she told herself now having reasoned it out sitting here alone in her bedchamber that she deprecated any change of estate the contraction of any fresh and intimate relation if she had not known it might have been differentand there she paused a little wistfully sorrowfully but she did know and therefore she could not consent to part with her freedom with the repose of mind and the large liberty of thought and action her freedom permitted her her body was her own her soul her emotions were her own almost fiercely she protested they should remain so hence it was useless useless that anastasia should warn or that the image of adrian savage should solicit her standing there handsome devoted and how maddeningly selfconfident she could not listen she would not listen no no simply she would not having thus analyzed the position summed up and delivered judgment upon it clearly it was the part of commonsense to go to bed and to sleep gabrielle stretched out her hand for the crystal and silver rosary lying along with her missal and certain books of devotion on a whatnot beside her chair she fingered it making an effort to concentrate and compose her thoughts but they refused to be composed darting hither and thither like a flight of startled birds restlessness still possessed her making recitation of the hallowed invocations which mark each separate bead trench perilously on profanity she let the rosary drop and pressed her hands over her eyes certain words over and above the disturbing ones spoken by adrian savage haunted her for the agitations of the afternoon had not ended with his declaration and exit a subsequent episode had contributed in no small degree to produce her existing state of perturbation it had happened thus a few minutes after adrian left her going out on to the gallery which runs the length of the flat from the vestibule and studio at one end to the diningroom and offices at the other she had been struck by the strangely cold haggard light filling it the ceiling stared while details of pictures and china upon the walls the graceful statuette of a slim unclad boy carrying a hooded hawk on his wrist and farther on a portrait bust of horace st legereach set on an antique porphyry columnstarted into peculiar and shadowless prominence the windows of the gallery gave on to the courtyard gabrielle held aside one of the vitrine curtains and looked out snow was falling countless thin fine flakes circled and eddied drifted earthward and swept up again caught in some local draught through the lace work of black quivering branches the backs of the houses across the courtyard showed pallid and gaunt far below on the frostbitten grassplat the lichenstained nymph tilted her icebound pitcher above the frozen basin the familiar scene in its present aspect was indescribably dreary provocative of doubting distrustful thoughts with a movement of impatience her expression hard her charming lips compressed the young woman turned away conscious of being foolishly unreasonably out of conceit with most things doing so the bust of her husband confronted her seeming to watch her from out the blank cavities in the eyeballs which so uncomfortably travesty sight an expression of amused slightly cynical inquiry rested upon the sculptured face this in her present somewhat irritable and oversensitized condition she resented finding it singularly unpleasant she moved rapidly away along the gallery then stopped dead from the diningroom came a joyful racket but to her astonishment cutting through the rippling staccato of childrens talk and laughter came the grave tones of a mans voice hearing which steady of nerve and strong though she was gabrielle turned faint the blood left her heart she made for the nearest windowseat and sank down on ithorace was there in the diningroom playing with bette and her little friends as he so dearly loved to play the fact of her widowhood the past eighteen months of freedom became as though they were not in attitude and sentiment she found herself relegated to an earlier period against which her whole nature rose in rebellion she realized how quite horribly little she wanted to see horace again or renew his and her former relation realized her jealousy of him in respect of her child realized indeed that notwithstanding his many attractive qualities and invariable kindness his resurrection must represent to her something trenching upon despair yet it was cruel she knew heartless to feel thus she glanced in positive mental torment at the marble bust it still watched her through the haggard clarity of the snowglare with the same effect of cynically questioning criticism and amusement almost so she thought as one should say my dear be consoled even had i the will i am powerless to return and to claim you follow your own fancy make yourself perfectly easy have no fear but that i am very effectually wiped out of your life the blood rushed back to her heart her face flamed she felt humiliated as though detected in a secret villainy in an act of detestable meanness it is an ugly thing to pillage the dead but she was also very angry for she understood what had happened not horacepoor undesired horacebut adrian savage was there in the diningroom he had changed his mind after all and in the hope of somehow working upon her had stayed to bid grandmother and grandchild goodby this was a plot a plant and she was furious her sense of justice suffering violent eclipse for was it not abominable of him to have placed her in so unworthy and mortifying a position in respect of her dead husband and incidentally to have given her such a dreadful fright regardless of reason she piled his offenses mountainhigh however this simplified matters in a way disposing of a certain question forever marry him shed as soon marry a ragpicker a scavenger she hoped devoutly he would have an atrocious crossing when he did at last seek foreign shores thereupon she rose and swept onward in the stateliest manner imaginable with trailing somber skirts over the polished shining floor as she threw open the diningroom door a slender whitefrocked blacksilklegged figure rushed upon her and clasped her about the hips with ecstatic cries ah mamma it piped at last you have come i am so excited we have waited and listened but it was a secret he forbade us to tell you he was here it was to be a great surprise now you may look but you must promise not to interrupt with conversation that is very important you understand because the next few moments are critical m dax is cooking an omelette in my tiny weeny fryingpan for our dolls and teddybears and so once again upon this day of selfrevelations madame st leger had to revise her position and own herself in the wrong yet the relief of finding neither resuscitated husband nor importunate lover but simply m ren dax in possession was so great that she greeted that eccentric and gifted young man with warm cordialitywholly ignoring his affectations and the rumors current regarding his moral aberrations remembering only the irreproachable correctness of his dress and manners and the quaintly pathetic effect of his small tired face great domed head and bulging foreheadlike those of a hydrocephalic babyand the ingeniously fascinating qualities he displayed as selfelected playfellow of bette and her little friends yes she told herself she really had a great regard for ren dax he touched her and now she undoubtedly passed a wholly delightful threequarters of an hour in his and the little girls company madame vernois looking on meanwhile sympathetic yet slightly perplexed for gabrielle in her reaction of feeling forgetful of her black dress and twentyseven years and the rather tedious restraints and dignities of her matronhood was taken with the sprightliest humor she remembered that threequarters of an hour now with a degree of regret if only it could have stopped at that but unfortunately things went further for at parting she had lingered in the gallery where the haggard whiteness of the snowglare struggled with the deepening twilight thanking ren dax for his kindness to the children and for the happy afternoon he had given them the sense of holiday of playtime was still upon her and she spoke with unaccustomed gaiety and intimacy of tone the young man looked up at her attentively queerlythe top of his head barely level with her shoulderand answered a certain harshness observable in his carefully modulated voice do not spoil it all by accusing me of a good action in accusing me of that you do my intelligence a gross injustice my conduct has been dictated as always by calculated selfishness and when she smilingly protested he went on i have many faults no doubt but i am guiltless of the weakness of altruismcontemptible word under which the modern mind tries to conceal its cowardice and absence of all sound philosophy i am an egoist dear madame believe me an egoist pure and simple he paused looking down with an effect of the utmost gravity at his very small and exquisitely shod feet it happened for reasons with which it is superfluous to trouble you that today i required a change of atmosphere i needed to bathe myself in innocence i cast about for the easiest method of performing such ablutions and my thought traveled to mademoiselle bette the weather being odious it was probable i should find her in the house my plan succeeded to admiration have no delusions under that head it is invariably the altruist not the egoist whose plans miscarry or are foiled he took a long breath stretching his puny person i am better i am cleansed he said for the moment at least i am restored renewed and for this restoration the reason is at once simple and profound you must understand he went on in a soft conversational manner as one stating the most obvious commonplace my soul when it first entered my body was already old immeasurably old it had traversed countless cycles of human history it had heard things no man may repeat and live it had fed on gilded and splendid corruptions it had embraced the forbidden and hugged nameless abominations to its heart it had gazed on the naked face of the ultimate selfexistent terror whose breath drives the everturning wheel of being it had galloped back appalled through the blank shouting nothingness and clothed itself in the flesh of an unborn unquickened infant thus for a brief space obtaining unconsciousness and repose ren dax looked up at her again his little tired face very solemn his eyes glowing as though a red lamp burned behind them has it ever occurred to you why we worship our mothers he asked it is not because they bring us into life but because for nine sacred months they procure us blessed illusion of nonliving how can we ever thank them sufficiently for this and that he added is why at times as today i am driven to seek the society of young children it rests and refreshes me to be near them because they have still gone but a few steps along the horrible perpetually retrodden pathway they have not begun to recognize the landmarks they have not yet begun to remember they fancy they are here for the first time past and future are alike unrealized by them the aroma of the enchanted narcotic of nonliving which still exhales from their speech and laughter renders their neighborhood infinitely soothing to a soul like mine staggering beneath the paralyzing burden of a knowledge of accumulated lives whether the young man had spoken sincerely giving voice to a creed he actually however mistakenly held or whether his utterances were merely a pose the outcome of a perverse and morbid effort at singularity madame st leger was uncertain still it was undeniable that those utteranceswhether honest or notand the somber visions evoked by them remained distressing and perplexing her with a dreary horror of nonprogression of perpetual and futile spinning in a vicious circle of perpetual and futile actual sameness throughout perpetual apparent change so far all the essentials of the faith in which she had been born and educated remained to her yet too often now as she sorrowfully admitted her declaration of that faith found expression in the disciples cry lord i believe help thou my unbelief for unbelief reasoned not merely scoffing had during these years of intercourse with the literary and artistic world of paris become by no means inconceivable to her more than half the people she met smiled at if they might not openly repudiate christianity it followed that she no longer figured the faith to herself as a fair land and large wherein she could dwell in happy security but rather as a fortress set on an island of somewhat friable rock against which winds and waves beat remorselessly and truly at momentscruel moments which she dreadedthe onslaught of modern ideas of the modern attitude in its contempt of tradition and defiance of authorityflinging back questions long since judged and conclusions long established into the seething pot of individual speculationseemed to threaten final undermining of that rock and consequent toppling of the fortress of faith surmounting it into the waters of a laughing envious allswallowing sea this troubled her the more because certain modern ideasnotably that of emancipated and selfsustained womanhoodappealed to and attracted her was there no middle way was no marriage between the old faith and the new science the new democracy possible if you accepted the latter did negations and denials logically follow compelling you to let the former go and so it came about that tonight she alone waking in the sleeping house the gloomy pictures called up by ren daxs strange talk held her painfully they stood between her and sleep between her and prayer heightening her restlessness and suggesting thoughts very subversive of christian theology and christian ethics gabrielle rose from her chair and moved to and fro her hands clasped behind her she never remembered to have felt like this before the room seemed too narrow too neat its appointments too finicking and orderly to contain her erratic and overflowing mental activity the abiding mystery which not only surrounds each individual life but permeates each individual nature the impassable gulf which divides even the nearest and most unselfishly lovedeven she herself and her own darling little bettefrom one another presented itself oppressive and distressing as a nightmare just now it appeared to her inconceivable that tomorrow she would rise just as usual satisfied to accept conventions subscribe to compromises take things in general at their face value while contentedly expending her energies of brain and body upon trivialities of clothes housekeeping gossip the thousand and one ephemeral interests and occupations of a sheltered highly civilized womans daily existence the inadequacy the amazing futility of it all then half afraid of the great stillness she stood perfectly quiet listening to the desolate cry of the wind along the houseroofs and its hissing against the windowpanes my soul has gazed on the ultimate selfexistent terror whose breath drives the everturning wheel of being she murmured as she listened it galloped back appalled through the blank shouting nothingness yes that was dreadful conception of human fate but what if it were true millions believed it or something very closely akin to it away in the east in those frightening lands of yellow sunrise and yellow expressionless peoples of whom it always alarmed her to think swiftly her mind made a return upon the three men living and dead who today had so deeply affected her breaking up her practised calm and selfrestraint she ranged them side by side and in her present state of exaltation they severally and equallythough for very different reasonsappeared to her as enemies against whom she was called upon to fight seemed to her as tyrants either of whom to sustain his own insolent masculine supremacy schemed to enslave her to rob her of her intellectual and physical freedom of her so jealously cherished ownership of herself it galloped back through the blank shouting nothingness she repeated but there came the sharpest sting of the situation for to what covert where could her soul take sanctuary since friendship and marriage proved so full of pitfalls and her fortress of faith was just now as she feared shaken to the base then the homeless cry of the wind finding echo in her homelessness of spirit a sort of anger upon her blind anger against things as they are she moved over to the window drew back the curtains and opened the locked casements the cold clutched her by the throat making her gasp for breath making her flesh sting and ache yet the apprehension of a presence steadying and fortifying in its great simplicity of strength compelled her to remain she knelt upon the windowseat and leaned out between the inward opening casements planting her elbows on the windowledge and covering her mouth with her hands to protect her lips from the blistering chill outside was the wonder of an unknown paris a vacant frozen voiceless paris wrapped in a windingsheet of newly fallen snow under the lamps along the quay immediately below that windingsheet glittered in myriad diamond points a uniform surface as yet unbroken by wheel tracks or footprintsmisery pleasure business alike in hiding from the bitter frost elsewhere it spread in a heavy muffling bleachedness from the bosom of which walls buildings bridges reared themselves strangely unsubstantial every ledge and projection enameled in white beneath the pont des arts on the right and the pont des saints pres on the lefteach very distinct with glistening roadway and double row of lampsthe river ran black as ink the trees bordering the quays were black a spidery black in their agitated windtormented bareness and the sky was black too impenetrable starless low and flat engulfing the many domes monuments and towers of paris engulfing even the roofs and pavilions of the louvre along the opposite bank of the seine inclosing and curiously isolating the scene this effect of an earth so much paler and for the most part so much less solid than the sky above it this effect of buildings rising from that pallor to lose themselves in duskiness was unnatural and disquieting in a high degree the sentiment of this desert voiceless paris was more disquieting still for gabrielle retained something of the provincials persistent distrust of the siren personality of la ville lumire the wonderful and brilliant city had enthralled her imagination but had never quite conquered her affections now leaning out of the highset window she gazed as far as sight carried east west and north while a vague deepseated excitement possessed her it was as though she touched the verge of some extraordinary revelation some tremendous crisis of the cosmic drama had universal paralysis seized the heart of things she asked herself of which this desert voiceless paris was the symbol had the everturning wheel of being ceased to turn struck into immobility as the worldfamous city appeared to be by some miracle of incalculable frost the cry of the wind answered so the wind at least was alive and awake yet as were the black seawardflowing waters of the river then suddenly unexpectedly along with that homeless cry of the wind hailing from she knew not what immense desolation of polar spaces came a small plaintive human cry close at hand hearing which last the young woman sprang down from her kneeling place locked the gaping casements together and ran lightly and swiftly into the adjoining room there in the warm dimness her hands outstretched grasping the rail of her cot on either side slim little bette sat woefully straight up on end mamma mamma she wailed come and hold me tight very tight i have had a bad dream i am frightened m ren dax touched all my toys all my darling tiny saucepans and kettles all my dolls and teddybears with his little walkingcane and it was terrifying they all came alive and chased me hold me tight i am so frightened they rushed along they chased me and chased me they panted their mouths were open i could see their red tongues and they yelped as the little pet dogs do in the public gardens when they try to catch the sparrows i called and called to you but you were not there you did not come i tried very hard to run away but my feet stuck to the floor they were so very heavy i could not lift them it is not true tell me it is not true he cannot touch all my toys with his little cane and make them come alive i think i shall be afraid ever to play with them any more they were so dreadfully unkind tell me it is not true no no my angel gabrielle declared soothingly it is not true not in the very least true it is only a silly dream all the poor toys are quite good you will find them obedient and loving asking ever so prettily to be played with again tomorrow morning she took the slender soft warm body up in her armsit was sweet with the flowerlike sweetness of perfect cleanliness and healthand held it close against her and for the moment perplexities farreaching speculations and questionings were obliterated in a passion of tenderness for this innocent life this innocent body which was the fruit of her own life and her own body all else fell away from her leaving her motherhood triumphant and supreme the child making good the opportunity began to wheedle and coax i think it is really very cold in my bed she said i am sure it would be far warmer in yours and i may dream m dax came back and touched my toys with his little walkingcane and made them naughty if i remain here by myself do not you think it would be rather dangerous to leave me here alone i might wake grandmamma if i were to be terrified again and to scream i like your big bed so very much best the consequence of all of which was that gabrielle st leger said her rosary that night fingering the beads with one hand while the other clasped the sleeping child whose pretty head lay on her bosom her mind grew calm the fortress of faith stood firm again as she thankfully believed upon its foundation of rock she recovered her justness of attitude toward departed husband and absent lover but she determined to reduce her intercourse with m ren dax to a minimum since the tricks he played with his little walkingcane seemed liable to be of so revolutionary and disintegrating a character chapter iv climbing the ladder the snow had been cleared away from the drive and carriage sweep but still lay in thick billowy masses upon the branches of the fir and pine trees and upon the banks of laurel and rhododendron below at sunset the sky had cleared somewhat and a scarlet glow touched the under side of the vast perspective of pale folded cloud and blazed on the upper south westwardfacing windows of the tower house as with a dazzle of fierce flame joseph challoner however was unaware of these rather superb impressionist effects as with his heavy lunging step he came out of the house on to the drive the drawingroom had been hot and he had gone through a somewhat emotional interview a man at once hard and sentimental just now sentiment was so to speak on the top his upright face and head were decidedly flushed he felt warm he also felt excited perceiving perspectives quite other than those presented by the folded clouds and the afterglow usually joseph challoner affected a countrygentleman style of dresstweeds of british manufacture noted for their wear and wetresisting qualities symbolic of those sturdy manly nononsense sort of virtues of which he reckoned himself so conspicuous an exponent and which have as we all know gone to make england what she is but today out of respect for his late client montagu smyrthwaite he had put on garments of ceremony black braidedged coat and waistcoat pepperandsaltmixture overcoat with blackvelvet collar striped dovegray and black trouserswhich had served at a recent local weddingand top hat this costume tended to make an awkwardness of gait and action which belonged to him the more observable over six feet in height he was commonly described by his admirersmostly womenas a splendidlooking man others doubtless envious of his success with the fair sex and of his inches compared him with his straight thick upanddown figure as broad across the loins as at the shoulders his large pawlike hands and feet and flattened slightly mongolian caste of countenance to a colossal infant his opinion of his own appearance concerning which he was in a chronic state of anxiety fluctuated between these two extremes with hopeful leanings toward the former at the present moment for private reasons he hoped fervently that he was a splendidlooking man that he was a moist and hot one was undeniable he took off his hat and passed his hand over his straight shiny reddish haircarefully brushed across impending calvitiesand sucked the ends of his rather ragged mustache nervously into the corners of his mouth he was touched very much touched he had not felt so upset for years he admired his own sensibility yes most distinctly he trusted that he was a splendidlooking manand that she so regarded him then coming along the drive toward him between the snowpatched banks of evergreen he caught sight of the short wellbred welldressed busy not to say fussy little figure of that cherished institution of the best stourmouth society colonel rentoul haig this diverted his thoughts into another channel or to be perfectly accurate set a second stream running alongside the first both it may be added tended in the direction of personal selfaggrandizement goodday to you challoner glad to meet you colonel haig said a hint of patronage in his tone i heard the sad news from woodward at the club at luncheontime and i took the tram up as far as the county gates as soon as i could get away we had a committee meeting at twothirty i felt it would be only proper to come and inquire yes the other answered in a suitably blackedged manner our poor friend passed away early this morning i was sent for immediately having a keen sense of the value of phrases colonel haig pricked up his ears so to speak his attitude of mind was far from democratic and our poor friend from a local solicitor struck him as a trifle familiar he looked up sharply at the speaker he felt very much tempted to teach the man his place but there was such a lot he wanted to hear which only this man could tell him and so the inquisitive nose and puckered gossipy mouth getting the better of the commanding military eye he decided to postpone the snubbing of challoner to a more convenient season i came round this afternoon chiefly to see miss margaret the latter continued she was terribly distressed and felt unequal to seeing me this morning she is very sensitive very sensitive and feminine her fathers death came as a great shock to her and then owing to some mistake or neglect she was not present at the last as she told me she feels that very much indeed the speakers voice took a severe tone he shifted his weight from one massive foot to the other rather after the manner of a dancing bear her grief was painful to witness and i think youll agree with me colonel it was just one of the neglects which ought not to have occurred a pity a pity the other admitted but on such occasions people will lose their heads its unavoidable look here challoner i must go on and leave cards but i shant be more than five minutes i shall not ask to see either of the ladies today so if youll wait ill walk as far as the county gates with you supposing youre going in my direction the mongolian caste of countenance is conveniently noncommittal lending itself to no compromising play of expression challoner was more than willing to wait he had certain things to say a favor indeed to ask and it always looked well moreoverconferred a sort of patent of social solvency upon youto be seen in public with colonel haig he wished the weather had been less inclement so that more people might be about but he betrayed no eagerness took out his watch even and noted the hour before answering yes i think i may allow myself the pleasure he said i have been too much engaged here to get down to my office today and there will be a mass of business waiting for me at homeno taking it easy in my profession if youre to do your duty by your clientsbut yes i shall be happy to wait for you then left alone in the still clear cold he became absorbed in thought again when joseph challoner the elder settled at stourmouth in the early sixties of the last century that famous healthresort had consisted of a single street of small shops stationed along a level space about half a mile up the fir and pine clad valley from the sea plus some dozen unattractive lodginghouses perched on the top of the west cliff the beginnings of business had been meager now stourmouth and the outlying residential districts to which it acts as centeramong them the great stretch of pineland known as the baughurst park estatecovers the whole thirteen miles in an almost unbroken series of shops boardinghouses hotels villas and places of amusement from the ancient abbeytown of marychurch at the junction of the rivers wilmer and arn on the east to barryport the old seafaring town formerly of somewhat sinister reputation set beside a wide shallow islanddotted landlocked harbor to the west along with the development of stourmouth the elder challoners fortunes developed so that when as an old man he died in the last of the eighties his son the younger joseph succeeded to a by no means contemptible patrimony as business increased other members came into the firm which now figured as that of challoner greatrex pewsey but and that not in virtue of his senior partnership alone joseph challoners interest remained the largely predominant one he was indefatigable quick to spot a good thing and so some said more clever than scrupulous in his pursuit of it he came to possess the reputation of a man who it is safer to have for your friend than your enemy so much for the hard side of his character as to the sentimental side when a youth of twenty he had fallen head over ears in love with the daughter of a local retail chemist a pretty delicate girl with the marks of phthisis already upon her she brought him a few hundred pounds they married and he was quite a good husband to heras english husbands go still this marriage had been he came to see a mistake the money after all was but a modest sum while her illhealth proved decidedly costly and then he had grown to know more of the world grown harder and stronger grown to perceive among other things that connection with a shop is a handicap the smell of it sticks theres no ridding yourself of it joseph challoner may be acquitted of being more addicted to peerage or money worship to being a greater snob in short than the average selfrespecting anglosaxon yet it would be idle to deny that when an allwise and merciful providence permitted his poor pretty young wifeafter several unsuccessful attempts at the production of infant challonersto die of consumption her husband felt there were compensations he recognized her death as a call socially speaking to come up higher he set himself to obey that call but he did not hurry for close upon thirteen years now though of an amorous and domestic disposition he had remained a widower and this of set purpose for he proposed that the last whiff of the shop should have time to evaporate by the period immediately in question he had reason to believe it really had done so privately he expended a considerable sum in procuring his fatherinlaw a promising business near london stourmouth knew that retail chemist no more and so it followed that the dead wifes compromising origin was practically forgotten only admiration of the constancy of the bereaved husband remained to complete the divorce between past and present challoner some few years previously had let the upper part over the firms offices at the corner where the old marychurch road opens upon the public gardens and the square in the center of stourmouth to his junior partner mr pewsey and removed to heatherleigh a fairsized villa on the baughurst park estate which he bought at bargain price owing to the insolvency of its owner here with a married couple at the head of his household as butler and cookhousekeeper he lived in solid british comfortsocalledgiving tea and tennis parties at intervals during the summer months and somewhat heavy dinners during the winter ones followed by bridge and billiards granted the man and his natural tendencies it was impossible that the thirteen years which had elapsed since the death of his wife should have been altogether free from sentimental complications these had in point of fact been numerous upon several of them he could not look back with selfcongratulation still the main thing was that he had escaped always managing to sheer off in time to avoid being had being run down and legally appropriated the retreat may not have been graceful might not to a scrupulous conscience even figure as strictly honorable but it had been accomplished and for thatstanding here now today on the snowpowdered carriage sweep of the tower housewith a movement of unsuspected cynicism and profanity he gave thanks sober heartfelt deliberate thanks to god his maker for his chance had come the chance of a lifetime he turned fiercely grimly angry at the bare notion that any turn of events might have rendered him not free to embrace it and his anger as anger will fixed itself vindictively upon a concrete object upon a particular person but at this point his meditations were broken in upon by the sound of colonel haigs slightly patronizing speech and the ring of his brisk returning footsteps over the hard gravel very obliging of you to wait for me challoner he said there are several things which i should be glad to hear in confidence about all this matter since their fathers death i feel a certain responsibility toward the miss smyrthwaites they have only acquaintances here in the south of englandno old friends no relatives i really stand nearest to them though we are but distantly connected i was not aware of even a distant connection challoner returned probably not i suppose hardly any one here is aware of it in a wateringplace like stourmouth a place that has come up like a mushroom in a night as you may say only a very small and exclusive circle do know who is who that is one of the things one has to put up with though i confess i find it annoying at times well you see my grandmother and poor smyrthwaites mother were first cousins once removedboth savages the yorkshire not the irish branch of the family i have reason to believe there was a good deal of opposition to mrs smyrthwaites marriage she was not a roman catholic like most of her people but they all wereand all are i am thankful to saypeople of very solid standing landed gentry soldiers and so on naturally they objected to a marriage with a manufacturer and a nonconformist i am quite prepared to admit unitarians have more breeding than most dissenters but still it isnt pleasant it isnt quite the thing you know prejudice perhaps but gentlepeople are naturally prejudiced in favor of their own class and upon my word i am inclined to believe it is very happy for the community at large they should be so the two men reached the gate opening from the grounds of the tower house on to the public roada broad straight avenue the footpaths on either side divided from the carriageway by a double line of scotch firs rising from an undergrowth of rhododendron and laurel at intervals the roofs gables and turrets of other jealously secluded villasin widely differing styles and nostyles of architecturewere visible but these struck the eye as accidental the somber farstretching fir and pine woods were that which held the attention they and the great quiet of them in which the cracking of a branch overweighted with snow the distant barking of a dog or the twittering of a company of bluetits foraging from treestem to treestem where the red scaling bark gave promise of insect provender amounted to an arresting event after a moment of just perceptible hesitation joseph challoner pushed open the heavy gate for the elder man and let him pass out first several points in colonel haigs discourse pleased him exceedingly little but in dealing with men as with affairs he never permitted minor issues to obscure his judgment regarding major ones if the old lad chose to be a bit impertinent and showy never mind let him amuse himself that way if he wanted to challoner had a use for him just now and could be patient till he had used himused him right up in fine and no longer had any use left for him it followed that as side by side the two turned northeastward up the avenue he answered in a noticeably conciliatory tone i really am indebted to you colonel for telling me this i own my position looked awkward in some respects i foresaw i might want to consult some one unofficially you understand about the miss smyrthwaites affairs and as you truly say theyve nothing beyond acquaintances here i recognized there really wasnt a soul to whom i should feel at liberty to speak but now that i know of your connection with and the interest you take in the family i feel i have some one to turn to if i should need advice it is a great relief colonel haigs selfimportance was agreeably tickled i am very happy to have the opportunity of being of service to you challoner he said graciously particularly in connection with my cousins affairs then he became eminently businesslike the disposition of the property is intricate he asked no not exactly the provisions of the willi drew itare simple enoughin a way but there is such a large amount of property to deal with yes yes smyrthwaite was very close of course very reticent still i have always supposed there was a good deal of money now what about is the amount approximately i meanif you are free to tell me under the circumstances i see no reason why i should not tell youin strict confidence of course that is understood my dear challoner whatever you may feel it advisable in the interests of these ladies to say to me goes no farther absolutely no farther this from one whose face was irradiated with the joy of prospective gossipings struck his hearer as a trifle simpleminded never mind the said hearer had the game well in hand i take that for granted colonel he answered professional instinct made me allude to it one gets so much into the habit of insisting on silence regarding confidential communications that one insists when as in the present case theres not the slightest necessity for doing so a form of wordsnothing more with you i know im safe well the estate stands at about two hundred thousand rather more than less with a considerable yearly income from the mills at leeds in addition haig stopped short he went very red in the face yes it makes a very tidy heiress of each of the ladies challoner said parenthetically it all goes to them practically all of it i doubt if women should be left so much money colonel haig exclaimed explosively remembrance of his own eight or nine hundred a year disgusted him what a miserable pittance he moved forward again still red from mingled surprise and disgust his neat frizzly gray mustache positively bristling yes i doubt i very much doubt he repeated whether it is doing any woman a kindness an unmarried woman in particular to leave her so much money it opens the door to all sorts of risks women have no idea of money its not in them the position of an heiress is a most unfortunate one in my opinion it places her at the mercy of every description of rascally unscrupulous fortune hunter youre perfectly right coloneli agree challoner said it does his face was unmoved but his voice shook gurgling in his throat like that of a man on the edge of a boisterous horselaugh for a few steps the two walked in silence then he added and that is why i am so relieved at having you to turn to colonel unscrupulous fortune hunters are just the sort of dirty gentry we shall have to protect the two ladies against you may be sure of me challoner colonel haig said with much seriousness we must work together yes we must work together colonelin a good causethats it and again his voice shook are you executor the other inquired after a pause no and between ourselves i am glad of it i shall be able to safeguard the miss smyrthwaites interests better since i am not dealing directly with the property miss joanna and a distant relative are the executors i think the second appointment a bad one and ventured to say as much to mr smyrthwaite when i drew this new will for him about two years ago a new will yes a name occurred in the earlier one which he wished to have cut out the speaker paused and the other man rose metaphorically speaking as a fish at a neatly cast fly ah his sons i suppose poor bibbyswilliam i mean william smyrthwaite everybody knew him as bibby yes challoner said his son william smyrthwaite of course i am aware something went wrong there but to tell you the truth colonel i have never got fairly at the story well you may take it from me the story is a disgraceful one i am a man of the world challoner and not squeamish i can make excuses but you may take it from me young smyrthwaite was a hopelessly bad lot a low vicious illconditioned young fellowdegenerate that is the only word i am sorry to say he was several years younger than his sisters i heard all about it at the time through friends there were nasty rumors about him at rugby and he was expelledquite properly his father put him into the business then things happened at leedsgambling chorus girls drink i need not go into particulars there was some question too of embezzlement and young smyrthwaite had to disappear it was a terrible blow to his father he decided to leave leeds he came south bought the tower house and settled here i think he was quite right the position was a very humiliating one especially for his wife and daughters joseph challoner listened carefully and what became of the boy oh deadfortunately for everybody concerned dead dead very fortunate but a proven case of death or only an accepted one oh proven i take it yes unquestionably proven i never heard there was the slightest doubt about that what a chattering fool the old bird is challoner said to himself irreverently adding aloud apparently then we may leave master bibby out of our count thats a good thing anyhow i am extremely obliged to you for giving me such a clear account of the whole matter colonel it explains a great deal really i cant be sufficiently glad that i happened to run across you this afternoon i may call it providential but now to go back to another young gentleman miss joannas coexecutor who is not in the very least dead yes haig inquired with avidity speak without reserve challoner ask me anything you are in any difficulty about i dont want to abuse your good nature and i dont forget you have seen a lot more of the world than i have your point of view may be different i shall be only too glad if you can reassure me for i tell you colonel it makes me uneasy englands good enough for me england and englishmen i may be narrowminded and insular but i can do without the foreigner yes and im not sure you are not right in that the other said rising at another clever cast yes i am glad you agree well this coexecutor whom we have to look after is to all intents and purposes a foreigner that is to say born abroada parisian and a journalist ah exactly i am not sorry to see it strikes you as it did me colonel when poor mr smyrthwaite first broached the subject doesnt sound very substantial does it and when you remember the amount of money that will pass through his hands still you may be able to reassure me by the way i suppose he must be a relative of yours his name is adrian savage never heard of him in my life haig exclaimed irritably then afraid he had altogether too roundly given away his ignorance he went on but wait a moment wait yes now i come to think i do recollect that one of the savages a younger son went into the medical profession i never saw anything of him there was a strong feeling in the family about it like marriage with a dissenter they felt doctoring wasnt exactly the thing for a savage so he was advised if he must follow the medical profession to follow it at a distance i remember i heard he settled in paris and married there this journalist fellow may be a son of his the speaker cleared his throat he was put about uncertain what line it would be best to take at one time i used to be over there often as a young man i knew my paris well enough ill be bound you did colonel challoner put in with a flattering suggestiveness silly old goat he said to himself yes i do not deny i have amused myself there a little in the past the other acknowledged but somehow i never looked doctor savage up it was unfriendly perhaps butwellin point of fact i never did had neater and sweeter things to look up eh colonel challoner put in again i believe you wish id ever had your luck here resisted laughter got the better of him jarring the quiet of the woods with a coarseness of quality startling even to his own ears nothing betrays lack of breeding more than a laugh he knew this and it galled him he felt angry and hastened in so far as he might to recover himself seriously though joking apart i very much wish as things turn out you had kept in touch with the doctor he said then you would have been in a position to give me your views on this son of his mr smyrthwaite seems to have taken an awful fancy to him but i dont attach much importance to that he was ill and crotchety just in the state of health to take unreasoning likes and dislikes and i cant help being anxious i tell you colonel it does not affect my pocket in any wayim not thinking of myself and i am no sentimentalist my line of business leaves neither time nor room for that still i tell you candidly it goes tremendously against the grain with me to think of some irresponsible longhaired foreign bohemian chap being mixed up with the affairs of two refined english gentlewomen like the miss smyrthwaites of course he may turn out a less shadowy individual than i anticipate nothing would please me better than that he should but in any case i mean to keep my eye upon him hes not going to play hankypanky with the ladies money if joseph challoner can prevent it i hold myself responsible to you as well as to them and to my own conscience colonel to keep things straight i am confident you will do your best the other replied graciously and i trust you to consult me whenever you think fit dont hesitate to make use of me i wont colonel make yourself easy on that point i am greatly indebted to you i wont the end of the long avenue had come into sight where between high stone gatepostssurmounted by justlighted gaslampsit opens upon the main road and tramline running from stourmouth to barryport after the silence and solitude of the woods the street appeared full of movement a row of shopfronts across the roadway threw a yellow glare over the pavement and on to the snowheaps piled in the gutter the overhead wires hummed in the frosty air a gang of boys snowballed one another in the middle of the street scattering before some passing cart and rushed back shouting to renew the fight groups of homegoing workmen tramped along the pavement their breath and the smoke of their pipes making a mist about their heads in the cold winter dusk challoner held out a pawlike hand youll excuse me if i leave you colonel he said i have outstayed my time already i am afraid i must be getting homea lot of work waiting for me goodnight he turned away then just inside the gates a sudden thought apparently striking him he hesitated and came back by the way he said i had been meaning to write a line to you today but this sad business at the tower house put it clean out of my head i may just as well ask you by word of mouth itll save you the bother of a note woodford has nominated me for election at the club your name as one of the oldest and most influential members of course carries much weight if you second me youll do me a great kindness here the towering welllighted tram from barryport sailed majestically up with a longdrawn growl ending in a heavy clang and thin shriek as the powerful brakes gripped bringing it to a stop all right i may take it for settled then i have your promise really i am awfully obliged to you dont let me make you miss your tram though hi conductor steady a minute colonel haigs going with youthanks colonel goodnight challoner cried all in a breath without giving the hustled harried almost apoplectic exwarrior time to utter a syllable good or bad had him neatly he said to himself as he turned once more into the stillness and twilight of the woods he cant back outdarent back out their swagger aristocratic dyourimpudence stourmouth club taken by assault and again he laughed but this time the coarse quality of the sound failed to jar him on the contrary he rather relished its stridency he was winning all along the line so he could affordfor a little while here alone under the snowladen firtrees in the deepening duskto be himself in the hall at heatherleigh his manservanta thin yellowish gentle anxiouslooking person who played the part of shuttlecock to the battledores of his strong master and of a commanding wife ten years his seniormet him mr pewsey is waiting for you in the smokeroom sir he said while helping challoner off with the pepperandsaltmixture overcoat and mrs spencer sir called to leave this note she said there was no answer but i was to be sure and give it to you directly you came in challoner took the note and stopped for a minute under the hanging coloredglass gaslantern to read it it was written in a large showy yet tentative hand on highly scented mauve paper with a white border to it and ran thus b gone to mary church to dine and sleep alone come round if you can after dinner want you quite safe love gwynnie challoner rolled the small scented sheet into a ball and tossed it viciously on to the fire watching till the flame licked it up no theres no answer quite true mrs gwynnieeven even less answer than you suppose or will in the least bit like he said between his teeth then he opened the door and passed into the smokingroom to join his junior partner with a quite expressionless face chapter v passages from joanna smyrthwaites locked book you wont go sitting up writing tonight miss joanna you should get right into bed for you are properly worn out it would be useless for me to attempt to sleep yet isherwood but i shall not sit up late this between two women standing on the gallery of the spacious heavily carpeted stairhead save for the feeble light of their glassshaded candles the place was in darkness the atmosphere oppressive from the heat given off by radiators in the hall below and upon the landing itself was permeated by the clinging odor of some disinfectant they spoke in subdued voices covered and whispering as those of reverentminded persons unwillingly compelled to hold conversation in church the northeasterly windwhich at this same hour cried homeless along the steep houseroofs of the quai malaquais to the disturbance of gabrielle st legers meditations upon the deceptions of modern marriageraked the thickset fir and pine trees bordering the carriagedrive outside and shattered against the elaborately leaded panes of the high staircase windows making the thick velvet curtains which covered them sway and quiver in the draught you had better let me wait and brush your hair as usual miss joanna it might soothe your nerves the elder of the two women said she was a comely vigilanteyed person a touch of mustache on her long upper lip and a ruddiness upon her high cheekbones as of sunripened fruit though well on in the sixties her carriage was upright and her hair looped windowcurtain fashion over her ears and plaited in a round at the back of her head still showed as black as her closefitted black silk dress first nurse in the smyrthwaite family now for many years ladys maid and housekeeper capable prejudiced caustic of speech untiring in faithful devotion to thosethe very fewwhom she loved mrs isherwood virgin and spinster represented a domestic type becoming all too rapidly extinct the younger woman made no immediate answer her bearing and attitude bespoke a great lassitude as she stood resting her right hand on the ball of the newelpost the light of the candle she carried was thrown upward showing a face making but small claim to beauty a thick pasty complexion straight heavy yellowish auburn hair turned back over a pad from the high square forehead no sufficient softening of the pale anxious bluegray eyes by eyelash or eyebrow an acquiline nose with upcut winged nostrils and a mouth which but for the compression of the lips might have argued a certain coarseness of nature a face in fine almost painful in its effect of studied selfrepression patient as it was unsatisfied an arrested consciously resisted violence of feeling perceptible in every line of it i could hardly bear having my hair brushed tonight i am afraid isherwood she said presently i am really only fit to be alone you say margaret is quite composed now you think she will sleep oh dear me yes miss joanna miss margaret will sleep she drank a full tumbler of hot milk and fairly settled off before i left her i wish i was half as easy about your nights rest as i am about hers my good isherwood miss smyrthwaite said softly as she moved away across the landing suddenly she paused and came hurriedly back isherwood isherwood she called under her breath the smell of that disinfectant seems so very strong youre sure the door ofof papas room is shut and locked dear me yes miss joanna i have the key here in my pocket mr smallbridge and i went in the last thing before i came up and i locked the door myself youve got the smell of that nasty stuff in your nose anybody would the amount those nurses used of it now you promise youll ring miss joanna if you should feel nervous or poorly in the night you know it never troubles me the least to get up my good isherwood the younger woman said again from the age of fourteen joanna smyrthwaite had been encouraged to keep a diary for the diary was an acknowledged part of the system of feminine educationforming the character it used euphemistically to be calledthat obtained so largely among seriousminded persons of leisure during the earlier half of the victorian era thoughtfulness reserve methodical habits the saving of time hands never unemployed the conforming of ones own conduct to and testing of the conduct of others by certain wholly arbitrary and conventional standardsthese nominal rather than real virtues were perpetually pressed home upon the minds and consciences of the wellbroughtup female child inevitable reaction carried the majority of findesicle female children notably far in the quite opposite direction but in some instances the older system survived its appointed spanthat of the smyrthwaite family may be cited as a case in point the consequences were of doubtful benefit since conditions have changed and adaptability to environment is a necessity of mental as well as of physical health joanna smyrthwaite was now in her twentyninth year she still kept a diary written in a very small neat scholarly hand it filled many octavo volumes bound in darkpurple leather each with a clasp and lock to it her initials and the date stamped in gold lettering on the back she was a diarist absolutely innocent of any thought or wish of eventual print a fierce modesty indeed overlay the whole matter of her diary that it should be secret unseen by any eyes save her own gave it its value she regarded it with a singular jealousy of possession as nothing else belonging to her her diaries were exclusively inviolably her own it may almost be asserted that she took refuge in them as weaker women under stress of unsatisfied passion will take refuge in a drug and so tonight without waiting to make any change in her dress feverishly as one at last set free from unwelcome observation she pushed back the cylinder of the handsome satinwood bureau in her bedroom set lighted candles upon the flat desk of it took the current volume of the diary out of one of the pigeonholes and sat down her thin hands trembling with mingled fatigue and excitement to write wednesday jan it has been impossible to put down anything for some days the strain of nursing and the demands upon my time have been incessant and too great i do not know that i am justified in writing tonight isherwood begged me not to do so but it is a relief it will quiet me and bring me into a more normal relation to myself and to my own thought for days i have been a mere beast of burden bearing the anxieties of the sickroom and of the household upon my back my intellectual life has been at a standstill i have read nothing not even the newspapersthe times or last weeks spectator there has been perpetual friction between the servants and the nurses which i have had to adjust margaret could not be looked to for help in this she is too easily influenced being disposed always to take sides with the person who last spoke to her mr savage cannot arrive before tomorrow afternoon i am glad of this breathing space for the thought of his coming is oppressive to me he appeared so lively and so much a man of society when we met him in paris that i felt shy and awkward in talking to him but it is useless to dwell upon this he is coming i must accept the fact my head aches i keep on fancying there are strange sounds in the house but as isherwood says i am overtired i meant to state quite simply what has occurred since i last wrote but i find it difficult to concentrate my attention papa died just before five oclock this morning it was snowing and the wind was high isherwood and i were in the room with the nightnurse margaret had gone to lie down and i did not call her she has reproached me for this since and will probably continue to do so perhaps i acted wrongly in not calling her but i was dazed everything appeared unreal and i did not grasp what was occurring until they told me we had watched so long that i had grown dull and unresponsive i was sitting upon the ottomanin which mammas evening gowns used to be keptat the foot of the bed when isherwood came close to me and said miss joanna mr smyrthwaites going i said where not understanding what she meant you had better be quick the nightnurse said her manner has never been respectful i got up and went to the side of the bed papas eyes were open they seemed to stare at something which made him angry he used to look thus at poor bibby i felt a spirit of opposition arise in me this i now regret for it was not a proper state of mind presently the nightnurse felt his pulse and held a handmirror to his mouth i saw that the surface of it remained unblurred she looked across at isherwood and nodded familiarly i thought so she said then i understood that papa was dead and i felt sorry for him both because i knew how much he disliked the idea of dying and also because i should never be afraid of him any more the nightnurse said quite out loudher offhand way of speaking has struck me all along as objectionablethere is no reason miss smyrthwaite should stop any longer i always prefer to do the layingout by myself i get through with it so much quicker isherwood will remain i said i felt it right to assert my authority and i so dread the upper servants being annoyed it makes everything so difficult to manage that is quite unnecessary she answered if i require assistance for lifting i can call nurse bagot she will be coming on duty anyhow in another hour and as the case is over i should not mind disturbing her she can finish her rest later but i wish mrs isherwood to remain i repeated of course i shall stay miss joanna isherwood said it is my place to do so it is not suitable or likely i should leave the layingout to strangers besides i do not take orders from anybody in this house but you or miss margaret to have a wrangle just then was painful but i think both isherwood and i spoke under great provocation afterward i went to margaret it was still dark and i heard the wind and snow driving against the passage windows i found margaret difficult to awaken when i told her she became hysterical and said i ought to have spoken less suddenly but margaret cries readily i believe it is a relief to her and enables her to get over trouble more easily i have had no disposition to cry so far yet i have been much more of a companion to papa than margaret ever has latterly in particular she avoided being with him on the plea that was too exhausting for her sometimes i have thought her selfish when i asked her to sit with him she was so ready with excuses still he cared for her more than for me she is pretty and i am notless than ever now my eyes look so tired and have red rims to themand then margaret never opposed him she has a way of slipping out of things without expressing a direct opinion i did oppose him during the terrible troubles about poor bibby and when he spoke harshly or sarcastically before mamma and i kept him at carlsbad away from mamma during the last days of her illness by telegraphing false reports to him that is nearly eight years ago he never actually knew that i had deceived him unless margaret has hinted at it and i hardly think she would dare do soshe is not very courageousbut he suspected something and he never forgave me although he gradually grew more and more dependent upon me i have examined my conscience strictly and it is clear in relation to him yet he looked angry this morning when he was dead i suppose i shall always think of him as looking angry but i think i do not care how extraordinary it is to feel thatto feel that i have ceased to mind to be afraid i sent round quite early to heatherleigh for mr challoner he came at once he strongly expressed the wish to do all he can to help me and inquired more than once for margaret he said that directly he heard of papas death he thought of margaret as he feared she would be prostrated by the shock he said she impressed him as so fragile and so sensitive the words struck me because it had never occurred to me that margaret was fragile she has better health than i have she is more excitable than i am and easily gets into a fuss but i do not think her particularly sensitive probably it was just mr challoners way of expressing himself but i cannot think the terms are particularly applicable i am afraid mr challoner is vexed at papa having appointed mr savage my coexecutor he intimated that margaret had been slighted by the arrangement i may do him an injustice but i fancy he is disappointed at not being executor himself in this i am not to blame as i told him i should have preferred to act with him rather than with mr savage as he knows so much about the property i told him i urged papa in as far as i could to give up the idea of appointing mr savage i think this pleased him he kindly sent off the telegram to mr savage for me and the obituary notices for the newspapers himself he said he would call later in the day to inquire for margaret and to see if there was anything further he could do for us i told margaret this she became more composed when she knew he was coming and ceased reproaching me for not having called her when papa was dying she said she should be glad to see mr challoner she has always liked him better than i have he is clever but uncultivated but margaret has never really cared about culture i know mamma feared she might become frivolous and worldly if she was not under intellectual influences if mamma had only lived till nowi dare not develop all i mean in saying that i foresee difficulties with margaret i earnestly hope she will not take up the idea she has been slighted i do not want to put myself forward yet it is my duty not only to carry out papas instructions but in as far as i know them mammas wishes also i tried to word the obituary notices as papa would have liked perhaps i should have inserted the words liberal and unitarian so as to define his political and religious position yet he differed from the main body of unitarians on so many points and condemned so many modern liberal tendencies and measures that i did not feel justified in employing those terms they are generic and as it appeared to me committed him to views he had long ceased actually to hold i should have consulted margaret but she was very fretful just then and it was useless to ask mr challoner as he would not appreciate fine distinctions i fancy so i simply put at his residence the tower house baughurst park estate stourmouth hants montagu priestly smyrthwaite formerly of the priestly mills and of highdene leeds aged seventysix no flowers by special request i suppose andrew merriman and others from the mills will attend the funeral i dread seeing andrew merriman again it will bring back all the terrible trouble about poor bibby and i cannot think how mr savage will get on with the people from the mills it would have been simpler to have mr challoner act officially in the capacity of host i dare not think much about the funeral after luncheon i filled in their papers and dismissed the nurses i think they expected some present but i did not feel it necessary to give them any they had only done what they were well paid to do and i liked neither of them though nurse bagot was the least patronizing and interfering their refusing to take their meals in the housekeepers room and the upper servants objection to waiting upon them made arrangements very trying i sympathized with the servants but i had to consider the nurses lest they should be quarrelsome and make everybody even more uncomfortable i am thankful we had no professional nurses when mamma was ill and that isherwood and i nursed her but this case was different we could not have done without professional help even had we wished to do so i went to papas room this afternoon when the undertakers had finished taking measurements for the coffin i thought it my duty to go i supposed margaret would have accompanied me but she refused saying it would only upset her again just as she was expecting mr challoner i told her i feared the servants might think it unnatural and unfeeling if she did not go into the room at all she said if she felt better tomorrow she would make an effort to go then i hope she will i should not like her to expose herself to criticism even though unspoken on the part of the servants one of our first duties now we are alone is to set an example to the household i think she is wrong in putting off going it will not be any less painful tomorrow than today and if i can bear it she should be able to bear it we are different but i do not pretend to be margarets superior in any way the room was very cold i suppose i remarked this particularly because of the high temperature which has been kept up in it for so many weeks the upper sashes of all the windows were open behind the drawn blinds which the air alternately inflated and sucked outward this made an unpleasant dragging sound i was foolish to mind it but i am tired there was a sheet over the bed which was quite proper but there were sheets over the toiletglass the chevalglass and the mirror above the chimneypiece also this must have been isherwoods doing it placed me in a difficulty i did not want to hurt her feelings but i know papa would have disapproved he was so intolerant of all superstition that the ignorant notion any one might see the dead persons face reflected in a lookingglass in the deathchamber and that it would bring misfortune would have made him extremely angry he was contemptuous of uneducated people and of their ideas i had begun taking the sheet off the chevalglass when i saw that margarets gray persian cat was in the room i suppose it must have slipped in beside me without my noticing it the light was very dim and i was thinking only of my own feelings i called it in a whisper but it ran away from me mewing it went twice right round the bed squeezing in between the head of it and the wall it stood upon its hindlegs and then crouched preparing to spring up over the footboard i drove it away but it kept on mewing it hid under the bed and i could not dislodge it i was afraid to go across and ring the bell lest it should attempt to spring up again the room grew dark it was weak of me but i felt helpless and nervous i seemed to see a movement upon the bed as though some one was trying to crawl from underneath the sheet and had not sufficient strength to do so no doubt this was the result of my brain being so exhausted by sleeplessness and anxiety but i could not reason with myself just then it seemed quite real and it terrified me i was afraid i should scream at last isherwood came she had missed me and came to look for me i could not explain at first but when she understood she called sarah the second housemaid of whom the cat is fond sarah was frightened at entering the room and isherwood had to speak sharply to her it was all very dreadful at last sarah coaxed the cat from under the bed isherwood knelt down and pushed it behind with a broom when sarah had taken it away i lost my selfcontrol and was quite overcome i felt and spoke bitterly about the maids and margarets carelessness during the whole of papas illness the cat has been kept out of the south wing and it would have been so easy to exercise care a little longer i said it appeared things were intentionally neglected now that papas authority is withdrawn and that those who formerly cringed to him now took pleasure in defying his orders and wishes this was an exaggerated statement but the incident brought home to me how little any person even the most important and autocratic matters as soon as he or she is dead death does more than level it obliterates moreover i could not rid my mind of the thought of those feeble ineffectual movements beneath the sheet this added to my distress and nervousness i asked isherwood to uncover the bed so that i might assure myself the body remained in the same position i looked closely at it though it was extremely painful to me to do so the eyes were now closed but the face was still severe expressive of disapproval why and for what obviously it is useless to disapprove of whatever may follow deathif indeed anything does sensibly follow it papas belief in the survival of consciousness and individuality was of the slightest so is mine the socalled future life is i fear but a fond thing vainly imagined the extinction of myriads of intelligent highly organized and highly gifted beings after a few yearsfew as against the vast stretch of astral or geologic periodsof earthly struggle suffering and attainment appears incredibly wasteful but that constitutes no valid argument against extinctionat least in my opinion it would be weakly optimistic to accept it as a valid one a very superficial study of biology convinces one of the supreme indifference of nature to waste as far as sentient living creatures other than man are concerned nature is certainly no economist she destroys as lavishly as she creates therefore it is safer to eliminate all hope of restitution or reward from ones outlook and accustom oneself to the thought of extinction i have long tried to school myself to this but i find it difficult i must try harder recalling the scene of this afternoon i feel grateful to isherwood i was childishly unreasonable and passionate and she was very patient with me she is always kind to me but i must not permit myself to lean too much upon her she is an uneducated woman and has the prejudices and superstitions of her class to lean upon her might prove enfeebling to my character and judgment i have not yet spoken to margaret about the cat for when i was sufficiently composed to go downstairs mr challoner had just left and she began talking about his visit which seemed to have pleased and excited her she praised his thoughtfulness and sympathy no doubt he has valuable qualities but i own something in his manner and way of expressing himself jars upon me he is not quite gentlemanlike in mind or appearance margaret called me proud and fastidious and added that i took pleasure in depreciating those who showed her attention that is neither true nor just but i will be more careful what i say about people before her it is unwise to be betrayed into discussions since she so often misunderstands me and so easily takes offense later on she spoke about our mourning i had not given the subject a thought i admit since there has been so very much else to occupy me i took for granted madame pell would make it for us in stourmouth as she has done all our dressmaking lately but margaret said madame pells things were always rather oldfashioned and that she wished to have our mourning from grays i pointed out that it would be inconvenient and unsuitable for either of us to go up to london for a day just now she replied that grays would send some one down with a selection for us to choose from i mentioned expense margaret said that need not be considered adding mr challoner tells me we shall both be rich for years papa has lived very much below his income and has saved a great deal of money all the property is left to you and me we shall each have a large fortune i was annoyed by her tone which struck me as both exultant and unfeeling i cannot forget that the greater proportion of papas property would have been bibbys and it is dreadful to me that margaret and i should profit by our brothers disgrace and deathif he is dead to the last mamma believed he was still alive in hiding somewhere i still believe it and hope he may come backpoor darling bibby margaret i am convinced neither wishes nor hopes this she has said more than once lately that if people do wrong it is better to put them out of ones life altogether and i know she was thinking of bibby i could never put him out of my life even if i wished to do so i had the greatest difficulty today in not speaking of him when she talked about our large fortunes but i controlled myself i was still shaken by the scene with her cat and feared i might exhibit temper i did reason with her about having our mourning from grays as it seems to me ostentatious but she became fretful and inclined to cry again accusing me of always wanting my own way and of trying to deny her every little interest and amusement so i thought it best to give in to her i promised isherwood i would not sit up so i must stop writing the smell of the disinfectant pursues and disgusts me and i go on fancying that i hear strange noises in the house i wish i could feel sorrow for papas death it would be more natural but i feel none i only feel resentment against mammas suffering and bibbys disgrace how cruel and purposeless the past seems and i feel alarm in thinking of the future i cannot picture margarets and my life alone together will it be cruel and purposeless too i shall not sleep but i must not break my word to isherwood i will stop writing and go to bed two oclock had struck before joanna smyrthwaite closed and locked her diary and replaced it in the pigeonhole of the satin wood bureau at the same hour away in paris gabrielle st leger answering little bettes cry gathered the childs soft warm body in her arms and found the solution of many perplexities in the godordered discipline of motherlove the less fortunate englishwoman also received comfortof a kind her hands were stiff with cold the small neat writing on the last page of the diary showed cramped and almost illegible she was faint from the long vigil yet the fever of her spirit was somewhat appeased for in thus visualizing and recording her emotions in thus setting the picture of her life outside her she had in a measure lightened the strain of it the drug from which she had sought relief acted so to speak allaying the ache of her loveless unsatisfied heart chapter vi some consequences of putting new wine into old bottles the next entry in joanna smyrthwaites diary dates several days later the handwriting though quite clear is less neat and studied than usual i have a sense of crowding and confusion of incapacity to realize and deal with that which is happening around me and in my own thought hence i have delayed writing i hoped to attain composure and lucidity but since these seem as far off as ever it is useless to wait any longer possibly the act of writing may help me mr savage arrived on thursday immediately after luncheon we had not expected him until the evening and i felt unprepared i am afraid my reception of him was awkward and ungracious but his quick speech and brilliant manner made me nervous he spoke at once of his respect for papa and expressed sympathy for us in our bereavement adding that he placed himself entirely at our disposition i found it difficult to make a suitable reply i do not know whether he noticed thisprobably he put it down to my griefand i am not grieved i am hard and cold and i am afraid resentful all of which is wrong i do not attempt to justify my state of mind but it would be dishonest to pretend even to myself about it to return to mr savage he speaks english fluently but employs words and frames his sentences in a peculiar manner this helps to give vivacity and point to all which he says but it might also give rise to misunderstandings i trust it will not do so when he and mr challoner and andrew merriman discuss business smallbridge valets him not edwin i was uncertain whether smallbridge would like to do so but he said he preferred it i think mr savage has made a good impression upon the servants i am glad of this he is certainly very courteous to them after margaret and i came upstairs the first evening he was here she remarked that he was very handsome she has repeated this frequently since i suppose it is true margaret is always very much occupied about personal appearance mr savage is undoubtedly very kind and seems most anxious to save us trouble and take care of us margaret evidently likes this i am unaccustomed to being taken care of i find it embarrassing it adds to my nervousness i feel dissatisfied with myself and anxious lest i should not behave with the dignity which my position as head of the household demands but i am tired and so many new duties and new ideas crowd in on me i seem to have lost my identity ever since i can remember papa has occupied the central place in my thoughts and plans his will and wishes supplied the pivot on which all our lives turned and i cannot accustom myself to the absence of his authority i am pursued by a fear that i am forgetting some order of his or neglecting some duty toward him for which omission i shall presently be called to account he represented fate nemesis to me as i see now i had never questioned but that his power or right to use that power was absolute even through all the trouble about poor bibby though i protested against his action i never doubted his right to act as he saw fit now i cannot help reasoning about our relation to him and asking myself whetherin the general scheme of thingsit can be intended that one human being should exercise such complete and arbitrary control over the minds and consciences of others i know that i was greatly his inferior in ability and knowledge let alone that i am a woman and that as his daughter i owed him obedience still i cannot help feeling that i may have been rendered unnecessarily stupid and diffident through subjection to him something which mr savage said today at luncheon about individualismthough i do not think he meant it to apply to papasuggested to me that there are other forms of cannibalism besides that practised by the degraded savages who cook and eat the dead bodies of their captives in civilized communities a more subtle but more cruel kind of cannibalism is neither impossible nor infrequenta feeding upon the intelligence the energies and personality of those about you which though it does not actually kill leaves its victims sterile and helpless i suppose this idea would be called morbid and should not be encouraged but my will is weak just now and i cannot put it away from me i am haunted by remembrance of the classic legend of saturn devouring his own children it is monstrous and shocking yet it does haunt me if papa had been less stern and exacting with bibby the latter might not have fallen into bad habits or at all events might have had strength to recover from them but papas dominating personality made him hopeless and helpless depriving him of selfrespect and initiative with me it has been the same though in a lesser degree and i am aware of this especially when talking to mr savage then i feel how dull i am like some blighted halfdead thing incapable of selfexpression and spontaneity and i cannot help knowing that he perceives this and pities menot merely on account of our present trouble but for something inalienably wanting in myself this fills me with resentment toward the past as though by my education and home circumstances i had been wronged and deprived of a power of happiness which was my natural right our lives were devouredmammas bibbys mineby papas love of power and pursuit of selfexaltation only margaret in virtue of her slighter nature escaped it was so i see it clearly but i must not dwell on this i have said it once now i must let that suffice to enlarge upon it is useless and would further embitter me to go back to everyday matters i asked mr challoner to dine the night before last so that he and mr savage might make further acquaintance i am afraid mr savage found it a tedious dinner after the brilliant society he has been accustomed to in paris i know i have little conversation and margaret though she looked unusually animated never really has very much to say mr challoner did not show to advantage he is not at his ease with mr savage he is heavy and crude in speech and in appearance beside him i thought he showed bad taste in his remarks about foreigners and his insistence on the superiority of everything english i do not think margaret remarked this but it made me hot and nervous mr savage behaved with great courtesy for which i was grateful to him i am afraid i was a poor hostess but we have entertained so little since we left highdene and then papa always led the conversation we were merely listeners the cooking was satisfactory with the exception of the cheese souffl the top of which was slightly burnt i spoke to rossiter about it this morning and begged her to be more careful in future a young woman came from grays yesterday bringing a profusion of dresses and millinery margaret seemed amused and interested trying everything on asking the young womans advice and talking freely with her i tried to be interested too but i did not find it easy the styles seemed to me exaggerated and showy and the prices exorbitant i should prefer what is simpler for such deep mourning but margaret did not agree with me it would not do for us to be differently dressed and when i suggested modifications the young woman supported by margaret overruled me margaret is fond of elaborate styles and the young woman said that a good deal of fullness and trimming was necessary for me as i have so little figure it was foolish to attach importance to the remarks of a person in her position yet what she said hurt me she admired margarets figure or affected to do so and paid her a number of compliments i looked at myself in the long glass in my room last night after margaret left me and i see that i am very thin my cheeks have fallen in and there are lines across my forehead and at the corners of my mouth my face can give no pleasure to those who see itthe features are not good and the expression is anxious i look several years older than margaret i do not know why i should mind this long ago i accepted the fact that i was not pretty but last night i was depressed by the realization of it for the first time since papas death i felt inclined to cry when isherwood came to undress me i made an excuse and sent her away i did not want her to see me cry i feared she might ask questions and i had no reason for cryingat least no fresh reason none certainly that i could explain to isherwood i am ashamed remembering my state of mind last night i could not write neither could i sleep i sat for a long while in front of the glass looking at myself and crying i seemed rarely to have seen a less pleasing woman i have always valued intellect and talent more highly than beauty but last night i doubted my strongest convictions seemed to be slipping away from me i suppose this is partly the result of physical strain i must try not to give way thus to useless emotion mrs paull and the woodfords called yesterday to inquire so did mrs spencer and marion chase i was surprised at mrs spencer calling we have met her at gardenparties and athomes but we have never exchanged visits no doubt her intention in calling was kind but i should not care to be intimate with her neither she nor her sister appear to me very ladylike i hope margaret will not want to make friends with her now she strikes me as a frivolous person whose influence might be the reverse of desirable margaret saw marion saying she wished to consult her about some details of our mourning i did not see her she and margaret spent more than an hour together in the blue sittingroom the pottingers and mrs norbiton sent around cards of inquiry by a servant today i think every one wishes to be kind papa was very much respected though perhaps he was not liked he was more highly educated and more intellectual than any one here and that helped to make him unpopular his conversation and manner tended to make others aware of their mental inferiority which they resented this was only natural yet it increased our isolation colonel rentoul haig called on the day of papas death he has written since very civilly asking if he can be of any help to us he appears anxious to make mr savages acquaintance but i do not want to ask any one here until after the funeral colonel haig assumes the tone of a near relation this pleased margaret and she is annoyed at my unwillingness to invite him until after the funeral i think she is flattered by his expression of interest in our affairs i am worried about margaret mr challoner is here constantly and i cannot help observing how much attention he pays her he refers to her on every occasion and insists upon asking her opinion it is almost as though he placed her and himself in opposition to mr savage and me this causes delays in business and unnecessary discussions which are very tiresome his tone in speaking of or to margaret is protective as though he thought she was not being well treated perhaps i am unjust toward him but he and margaret are so frequently together he asks for her and goes up to the blue sittingroom to see her i am sure mr savage observes this i feel very anxious lest any wrong impression should gain ground among the servants or others i dread anything approaching gossip just now since we left highdene we have always kept ourselves free of that ever since we came here people have known little or nothing of our doings and affairs and it would humiliate me that they should be canvassed now i wish margaret would be more careful of appearances then too although i do not like her it is our duty to consider mrs spencer her name has been so freely associated with that of mr challoner every one has taken it for granted they will eventually marry i ought to remind margaret of this since she seems to ignore it and i have not the moral courage to do so i am afraid of her tears and reproaches when the funeral is over mr challoner will have less excuse for coming so often i think i will wait things may arrange themselves and i may be spared the unpleasantness of speaking something happened this evening which threw me into a strange excitement i hardly know whether to set it down or not i thought the impression would pass away but i have been writing for more than an hour and it is still strongly upon me my state of mind is exaggerated perhaps if i set it down i shall become more composed when i bade mr savage goodnight in the hallmargaret had gone on and was halfway upstairs she was not in a good temperhe spoke kindly about the responsibilities which have fallen upon me and the amount i have had to do lately he said he admired my business capacity and my high sense of duty he addressed me as my dear cousin and kissed my right hand this surprised and affected me no one ever kissed my hand before the tones of his voice are very varied they caused me unexpected emotion all was said and done very lightly and gracefully almost playfully but i cannot forget it when i came upstairs i locked the door of my room and walked up and down in the firelight looking at my hand for a long while before i recovered sufficient selfcontrol to light the candles and sit down and write i have a strange feeling toward my own hand it seems to have gained an intrinsic beauty and value as of something quite apart from myself i look at it with a sense of admiration i enjoy touching it with my other hand and yet i am doubtful whether to write this down only these sensations are so new to me that when they are past i shall be glad i think to have some record of them i wrote about other things first tonight to test whether the impression was fugitive or not it is still with me though i am quite composed now i am composed but i still look at my hand with emotion i will not write any more i think i shall sleep tonight chapter vii in which adrian helps to throw earth into an open grave adrian savage meanwhile his native buoyancy of spirit notwithstanding became increasingly sensible of the depressing moral atmosphere surrounding him he was impatient of it for did they not really take things rather ridiculously hard these excellent english people had they no sense of proportion had they no power of averaging no little consolations of goodtempered philosophy he went so far in moments of levity as to accuse le bon dieu of reprehensible squandering by thus bestowing the eminently good gift of life upon persons so deplorably incapable of profiting by it to him they appeared thankless cowardly and quite unpardonably clumsy in their handling of opportunity moreover while curiously clannish ready on the slightest provocation to stand back to back against the world they waged internecine war being permanently suspicious of and unamiable toward one another if this represented a fair sample of the muchvaunted english home and the english characterwell for his part adrian was of opinion they did these things quite as well if not a great deal better in france he shrugged his shoulders elevated his black eyebrows stroked his neat beard trying at once to overcome his sense of depression and stifle his sense of humor the atmosphere would he told himself no doubt become more exhilarating when poor montagu smyrthwaites body had been removed from that rather terrible best bedroomapparently turned up as the maids have it for spring cleaningand finally consigned to the tomb never had he seen a dead fellowcreature treated with such meager tribute either in language or symbol of human pity or eternal hope it shocked his sensibility that the corpse should lie there locked away by itself in a cold dismal twilight of drawn blinds without any orderly settingout of the deathchamber without watchers or prayer offered or lighted candles or flowers or other suggestion either of tenderness or of religious obligation observances of this sort he was given to understand by joseph challoner were discredited in highly intellectual circles such as that in which the smyrthwaites moved as savoring of antiquated and unscientific superstitions the result to adrians thinking presented an effect at once so abjectly domestic and so miserably deficient in any appreciation of the eternal mystery of human fate that the crudest deathrites of the most degraded aborigines would have been preferable and then by a singular inversion of sentiment it was held necessary as a testimony of respect to keep the poor disagreeable old gentlemans body waiting such a quite inordinately long time for interment during a to adrian positively endless week did it remain there amid a doleful array of dustingsheets and disinfectants so that what with the dark snowpatched fir woods without and the dark neutraltinted house within what with conventionally hushed footsteps and lowered voices plus an allpervasive odor of iodiform tainting the close heated air the young man found the present among quite the most trying and distasteful of all his personal experiences yet as the interminable days went bywhile joseph challoner jealous alike of his own position and of the newcomers breeding and ability alternately bluffed snarled and flattered and pompous little colonel haig fell headlong from attempted patronage to a certain fulsomeness of conciliationagainst this dismal background the figure of joanna smyrthwaite came to stand out to adrians seeing with an intensity of moral effort and sustained determination of duty both impressive and admirable beneath the bloodless surface behind the anxious unlovely countenance and coldly nervous manner he began to divine a remarkable character he had been mistaken in calling her a shadow she was a distinct entity but she was also to him quite arrestingly unattractive and just on that account the chivalry both of the man and the artist grew alert to be very gentle to her to omit no smallest offering of friendliness or courtesy the very reason and purpose of womans existence being charm and beautyhis thought turned with a great yearning to remembrance of a certain enigmatic fair lady the windows of whose rosered and canvascolored drawingroom overlooked the heart of paris from above the quai malaquaisit was pitiful in the extreme to see any woman thus disfranchised the inherent tragedy of that disfranchisement was brought home to him with peculiar force on the evening following montagu smyrthwaites funeral for eventually almost to adrians surprise the poor lonely corpse really did get itself buried then at the tower house the blinds were drawn up and the mourners local and official returning thither discarding the appointed countenance assumed as due to the mournful character of the rites lately accomplished and resuming that common to them under ordinary conditions prepared almost jovially to do justice to an excellent luncheon the miss smyrthwaites excused themselves from attendance no other ladies being there so it fell to adrians lot to preside at the banquet he was amused to note the fact that they had left all which was mortal of the late owner of the house in the new west stourmouth cemeterywhich with its pale monuments roads and pathways showed as a gigantic scar upon the face of the dusky moorlandin no perceptible degree impaired the healthy appetite of any member of the company to eat offers agreeably convincing testimony that one is as yet well within the pale of the living and none of the eighteen or twenty gentlemen present whatever their diversities of profession or of social standing entertained the faintest desire to follow montagu smyrthwaitetheir neighbor kinsman patron or employerto the grave in any sense save a strictly complimentary one that final civility being now duly paid in respect of him it was in the spirit of those who receive wellearned reward for wellperformed labor that they sat down to feed in adrian both the latin and the catholic were still somewhat in revolt against this scant tenderness shown toward death the whole matter from start to finish had been as he reflected notably of the earthtoearth order the alacrity displayed by the assistants in the direction of food and drink was of the earth earthy too it however had at least the merit of being very human therefore to him it came as a rather humorous relief since his childhood his visits to england had been infrequent with london and london society he was fairly well acquainted but of provincial life and its social conditions he knew next to nothing it followed that in their racial and psychological aspects the members of the present company were interesting to him he tried to forget the poor unloved corpse lying beneath the rattling snowsodden gravel of the moorland and absorb himself in observation of the men seated on either side the dinnertable to where at the opposite end of it the hardfeatured taciturn sagacious yorkshire manufacturer andrew merriman manager and part proprietor of the priestly woolen mills faced him this man had not taken off the appointed countenance for the very good reason that he had never put it on his nature being of a type which disdains conventional manifestations either of joy or woe throughout the day in this as in other particulars merrimans personality had struck adrian as distinct standing away from the rest of the company silently declaring itself as possessed of unusual vigor and independence he tried to enter into conversation but invariably joseph challoner contrived to intervene and it was not till evening shortly before merriman and the rest of the yorkshire contingent were due to depart to stourmouth on their return journey by the night mail to leeds that he succeeded in getting private speech of him then after some brief mention of certain business details merriman said to him gruffly and as though grudgingly i own i am more satisfied now i have met you mr savage i did not much care about your appointment as executor but i might have trusted mr smyrthwaites judgment i have seldom known him wrong in his estimate of a man you wish me to understand that you believe me to be quite fairly honest and competent adrian returned in mingled annoyance and pleasure the intention was complimentary but the address so singularly blunt i venture to agree with you my dear sir without vanity i have reason to believe i really am both so much the better merriman answered sardonically i have no wish to offend you but an uncommon amount of property in which i am interested is changing hands and honest trustworthy persons are pretty scarce he glanced from under penthouse eyebrows across the room to where challoner shifting his weight uneasily from one foot to the other dancingbear fashion stood talking to colonel haig at least in my experience they are mr savage when a family is dying out you generally find the males are debilitated specimens and the females the strongest in this family if miss smyrthwaite had been born a boy it would have been better for the name and for the business only then you and i shouldnt have met here today because mr smyrthwaite would never have left highdene and i should never have been manager at the mills which would have been a misfortunefor me in any case adrian returned suavely maybe the other said but i can tell you joanna smyrthwaites all right she has sound commercial instincts if shes allowed to use them it is an allfired pity shes a woman an idea occurred to adrian she should have married he said this bluntness of statement became lamentably infectious every woman should marry then her abilities find their natural expression and development quite right sir and it is on the cards i am thinking joanna would have married if a man had not been too much afraid of her father to ask her mind he added i have no quarrel with our late head my father was a national schoolmaster my grandfather was a millhand i should not be where i am but for mr smyrthwaite he fancied my looks when i was quite a little nipper picked me out and gave me my start and im not boasting any more than you were just now if i say i know he never had reason to regret doing that the speaker straightened up his heavy figure looking adrian steadily in the eyes i told you he was a sure judge of men but women except to bring him children and mind his house and put up with his tempers and fetch and carry for him didnt enter into his calculations at all he was a bit of a grand turk was mr smyrthwaite and joanna from quite a little mite made herself useful as his amanuensis and reader and so on he looked upon her as his private property and kept her busy i promise you so that the man who wanted to take her away from him didnt have a fighting chance but now the grand turk is finally removed adrian declared havent we just concluded all that and now a man is afraid of her money im thinking the big yorkshireman returned slowly a grim smile pulling at the corners of his mouth joanna was always the plain one of the two girls and she has aged lately you cant seem to picture her with a healthy baby on her lap and so nobody would believethe man though he wished it ever so would hardly believe himselfit was the woman he wanted the woman he was after and not just her wealth he stood silent a moment his jaw set and then held out a large hard but not unkindly hand to adrian i reckon our times about up he said write or wire me to come if i am needed mr savage and when you leave i should be obliged if youll remind joanna im always at her service i shall look after the girls interest at the mills right enough but i can get away down here for twentyfour hours almost any time at a push goodday to you sir i am glad weve met now i must round up my lads and take em back home to work this conversation in its crude sincerity of language and statement remained by adrian and was still present to his mind next morning when he rose early in his stay at the tower house he had petitioned smallbridge to bring him rolls and coffee when calling him since a solid breakfast at nine followed by a solid luncheon at onethirty proved too serious an undertaking for the comfort of the latin stomach by the above arrangement he secured two or three hours to himself either for writing or for exercise this morning he went out soon after eight and walked down the wide avenue past large jealously secluded villas each standing in its acre or half acre of thickly planted grounds to where the mouth of the long dark wooded valley opens between striated gray and orange sandcliffs as through a giant gateway upon the sea thin primroseyellow sunlight glinted on the backs of the steelblue waves a great flight of gulls driven inshore by stress of weather swept and dropped and lifted again with wild yelping laughter above the flowing tide fringing the cliff edge the purple boles red trunks and black ragged heads of a line of windtormented scotch firs detached themselves from foot to crown against the colorless winter sky the thirty or forty yards of level sand stretching from the turn of the road in the valley bottom to the dark windrows of seawrack marking the tideline were pocketed by footsteps but at this hour the place was wholly deserted it being too early in the day and too early in the season for invasion by any advance guard of the mighty army of tourists and trippers which infests the coast from marychurch and stourmouth westward to barryport during the summer and autumn months adrian found himself solitary in a silent wilderness save for the murmur of the pines the plunge and hush of the waves and harsh laughter of the strongwinged gulls from where he stood looking inland the surface of the vast somber amphitheater of blueblack fir forest variegated here and there by the purplebrown of a grove of bare deciduous trees or the pallor of a snowdusted space of tussockgrass and heather was unbroken by houseroof or other sign of human habitation looking seaward no shipping was visible to adrian the scene appeared arrestingly northern in character the spirit of it questioning introspective coldly complex yet primitive and elfin reminding him of griegs occasional music to the haunting parablepoem of peer gynt then as he paced the harder sand to the seaward side of the tidemark the chill breeze pushing against him and the keen smell of the brine in his nostrils his thought carried back vividly to his conversation of last night with andrew merriman for now that he came to think of it might not joanna the main subject of that conversation in all her feminine leanness and overstrained mentality have stepped straight out of one of those plays of ibsens which heretofore had so perplexed him by their distance from any moral and racial conditions with which he was familiar northern joyless uncertain in faith burdened by scruples prey to a misplaced intellectualism yet clearheaded and able in practical matters could not her prototype be found again and again in the norwegian playwrights penetrating and disheartening pages and if it came to that in the relentless commonsense of the big yorkshiremans cruelly sagacious estimate of his own attitude toward her was there not an ibsenish element too for that andrew merriman was himself the man of whom he had spoken adrian entertained no doubt so he paced the sand absorbed in analysis and in apprehension while ripples of spent waves slipped in foamoutlined curves near and nearer to his feet it seemed to him he touched something new here in human tendencies and human development something which in the coming social order might very widely obtain especially among protestant englishspeaking peoplesa democratic scientific unsparing selfknowledge physical and mental on the one hand and a narrow sectarian selfsufficiency on the other a morbidly coldblooded acknowledgment of fact and application of means to ends in which neither poetry nor religion had any determining part the artist in him protested hotly for really a world so ordered did not look enticing in the very least then his thought fixing itself again exclusively on joanna played around the everlastingly baffling problem of womans mind womans outlook in itself divorced from her relation to man it was not the first time his imagination had been held up by this problem nor was he conceited enough to suppose it would be the last woman in her relation to man was a stale enough obvious enough story but in her relation to her fellowwoman in her relation to herselfhad not this tripped even the cleverest novelists and dramatists of his own sex wasnt it after all easier for a woman rightly to imagine the life a man lives among men than for a man to conceive womans life with his own great self left out of it he feared so though the admission was far from flattering to masculine perspicacity he resented his own inability to negotiate those moral and emotional lines of cleavage which do so very actually divide the sexes to think for example that joanna smyrthwaite and gabrielle st legertheir radical differences of circumstances endowment and experience notwithstandingwere still essentially nearer to each other more capable of mutual sympathy and understanding in the deep places of their nature than he with all his acute sensibility and dramatic insight could ever be to either of them but there the young man stopped and fairly laughed outright for to class gabrielle st leger the devoutly worshiped and desired and poor joanna smyrthwaite together even in passing was a little too outrageously farfetched here indeed the study of psychology ran frankly and in a sense almost profanely mad he looked away through the shifting cloud of screaming gulls over the steelblue levels of the channel toward fardistant france and a strong nostalgia took him for the delightful quickwitted land of his birth it seemed a thousand years since he left paris what were they all doing over there the dear people whose friendship spelled for him more than half the joy of living save for one brief note in the response to the announcement of his arrival madame st leger had given no sign and he in face of his last interview with her wanted to knowwanted so very badly to know he wanted to look at her he wanted to hear her voicewhereupon he turned positively vindictive oh most consoling doctrine of purgatorymight montagu smyrthwaite very thoroughly suffer the depleting pains of it as punishment for this fiendishly tiresome legacy of an executorship why couldnt he have left adrian free to pursue his delicious love campaign and appointed somebody elsethe unpleasant heavyweight challoner say or the worldly featherweight haig either of them would have reveled in the brief authority it conferred while to him it constituted an intolerable waste of time he was sick to death interesting racial and psychological researches notwithstanding sick to death of the whole corve and then he skipped aside with quite undignified haste for an incoming wave threatened his longtoed french boots with total immersion chapter viii a modern antigone his retina still holding that northern elfin landscape and seascape his ears the voices of the forest and of the wildly yelping gulls his mind still working on the thought of that new moral and social order now coming into being his heart and his manhood crying out for the woman he loved adrianthe keen freshness of the winter morning pouring in through the open door along with himentered the hall of the tower house and down the broad staircase over the thick soundmuffling carpet the wan light streaming in through the blurred leaded glass of the great staircase windows falling upon her meager flatbosomed crapeclad figure yellowishauburn hair and strained anxious countenance came the other woman the ibsen woman concerning whose nature and attributes he had just indulged in so much analytic speculation joanna held up the front of her crape dress her feet showed as she stepped down the shallow treads and adrian standing below looking up at her hat in hand sawthough he didnt in the least want to seethat she wore black velvet slippers with square toes and no heels to them and that both her feet and hands though comparatively small were lacking in individuality and in that sharpness of outline which is the mark of fineness of breeding they might have been just anybodys hands and feet and sohe felt amusedly ashamed of himself for admitting itthey were exactly the hands and feet one would expect joanna smyrthwaite to possess taking himself to task for this involuntary cruelty of observation his manner the more persuasive and gallant because he felt himself to blame the young man advanced through the dull reds and browns of the spacious hall to the foot of the staircase ah you are here goodmorning chre cousine he said i rose early and have already been out walking in your great woods and down on the shore it is all a poem of the first days of creation before man intruded his perplexing presence upon the earth i felt quite rampantly decadent in this overcivilized twentiethcentury costume under obligation to offer the humblest apologies to the hairy mammoths and pterodactyls which at every turn of the road i instinctively braced my courage to meet but really it is rather wonderful how the desert and the sown jostle one another here in england the contrasts are so unexpected so violent so complete adrian talked on rather at random smiling his head thrown back the expression of his handsome face gay yet subtlely apologetic the general effect of him pleasantly healthy selfsecure finished and on excellently good terms both with fortune and with himself and joanna looking down at him faltered stopped in her descent let slip the folds of her crape skirt while she laid one hand hurriedly upon the balusterrail and pressed the other nervously against her left side over her heart i am afraid she said you get up and go out so early on our accounti mean so that you may devote all the rest of the day to us oh no adrian returned still smiling it is an old habit one of my very few good habits that of early rising you see i am quite a busy man in my own small way what with my review my friends my literary work i realize that and so i am very much distressed at the demands which we are making upon your valuable time i cannot justify or excuse it to myself i do not think it was proper that papa should have appointed you as my coexecutor without consulting you and asking your permission first she spoke with a suppressed violence of feeling which caused adrian to gulp down his complete agreement in these sentiments and reply in soothing tones but dear cousin surely at this time of day it is superfluous to vex yourself about that believe me you are too scrupulous too considerate i assure you as i have so often assured you before that i am touched by the confidence your father showed me in thus temporarily intrusting not only his affairs but yourself and your sister to my care my sole desire is worthily to fulfil that trust to do so constitutes in as far as my time is concerned an allsufficient reward and then after all he added gaily ten days a fortnight even should i have to go north to leeds for a brief visit will see all imperative business through and so put a term to our joint labors there he paused looking discreetly aside as he unbuttoned his overcoat since he was aware that the gladness of coming freedom might declare itself with unflattering distinctness for in imagination he sprinted once again three steps at a time up the three flights of stairs to the top story of the tall gray house overlooking the quai malaquais while high expectation at once delicious and disturbing circulated through every fiber of his being how adorable it would behow richly poignantly enchanting but just then though by no means easily open to hypnotic or mesmeric influences he became conscious that joanna smyrthwaites eyesthose tenacious prominent fadedblue eyes with redrimmed lids to them which to his seeing so perpetually gave away the inward tempest of feeling to which the compressed lips refused utterancewere fixed upon him with an extraordinary intensity of questioning scrutiny for a moment the young man felt frankly embarrassed uncertain how to comport himself for he had no answer whatever to give to that questioning scrutiny he suddenly grew wary fearing demand might create supplyof a fraudulent sortcourtesy betraying him into return glances dishonestly sympathetic in character but to his relief the sound of an opening door followed by that of two chattering feminine voiceshighpitched unmusical in tone one indeed peevish and complainingcoming from the gallery above created a diversion he felt rather than saw joanna smyrthwaite start and look impatiently upward thus the awkward minute passed resolving itself and the situationif the little episode deserved so highsounding a titlewas saved adrian backed away and slipped off his overcoat doubling it together across his arm joanna her expression and manner agitated descending the remaining treads of the staircase hastily followed and stood close by him that is margaret she said in a hurried undertone marion chase is with her as usual and mr challoner comes here at halfpast eleven it was his own proposition i had a note from him early this morning i should have been glad to put aside legal business just for today but margaret expressed unwillingness that i should refuse to receive him there is something i feel i must explain to you cousin adrian before i see him but i cannot speak of it before margaret still less before marion chase would it trouble you too much to come into the library with me we should be alone margaret would hardly attempt to bring marion in there i should think the young man assented readily though the invitation was not very much to his taste of all the rooms in this finely proportioned yet gloomy house that distinctly masculine apartment the library aforesaid was to his thinking the most depressing facing north and east its windows were darkened by the rough corrugated trunks and scraggy lower branches of a grove of weymouth pines spared when the rest of the site had been cleared for building these at close quarters and when old are doleful trees lifeless and unchanging in aspect telling of sour soil and barren unprofitable spaces two sides of the room were lined to within a couple of feet of the ceiling with mahogany bookcases the contents of which in adrians opinion only too thoroughly harmonized in spirit with the doleful grove outside they consisted of ranges of wellbound volumes upon such juiceless subjects as commercial and municipal law ethics of citizenship and political economy together with an extensive collection of pamphlets embodying the controversies of the last fifty yearssocial political ecclesiastical and religiousneatly indexed and bound not only did the complete works of adam smith david hume dugald stewart and the two millselder and youngerdecorate the shelves but portrait prints of these authors along with those of certain liberal statesmen and nonconformist divines solidly framed and glazed decorated the remaining wall spaces the carpet and curtains were of a dull brown patterned in dusky blues and greens a writingtable of huge dimensions fitted with many drawers dark leathercovered chairs various mechanical devices in the form of readingdesks and legrests and an elaborate adjustable invalid couch constituted the other appointments of the room following joannas crapeclad figure into this severely educational sanctuary adrian could not but think of the long joyless hours she must have spent there reading to or writing for that imperious old gentleman the late lamented montagu and this thought softened his attitude toward her reawakening sentiments of chivalrous pity for though rich highly educated and clever had not she poor girl every bit as much as her cautious halting lover been denied the very barest fighting chance you are tired chre cousine he said consolingly is it any wonder after the painful fatigues of yesterday see i place this chair comfortably near the fire for you sit down and while resting tell me at your leisure what it is that you wish to explain and joanna not only sat down obediently but rather to his consternation bowed her lean person together and pressed a fine blackbordered pockethandkerchiefinsisted upon by the stylish young person from grays as a necessary part of her mourning equipmentagainst her faded eyes and wept ah poor thing poor thing she was a pitiful spectacle a pitiful creature inciting all the young mans goodness of heart sense of personal success delight in living physical soundness and wellbeing to claim sympathy and forbearance toward her yes yes he declared almost tenderly i comprehend and associate myself with your grief the trial has been so prolonged you cannot expect to throw off painful impressions and adjust yourself to new conditions immediately but that adjustment will come dear cousin believe me it is merely a question of time for you are young and in youth our recuperative power is immense so do not fight against your tears if they relieve you shed them freely for a while joanna remained bowed together then she threw herself back in her chair almost convulsively you must not be too kind to me she cried i enjoy it but it encourages my want of selfcontrol dont you good english people set an exaggerated value upon selfcontrol perhaps adrian asked gently argumentatively why waste so much energy in the effort to maintain an appearance of red indian stoicism and impassivity why fear to be human sensibility is a grace rather than a fault especially in a woman he moved away and stood by one of the eastern windows looking out into the pine grove a draught of air round the corner of the house shook the stiff branches he felt sorry for her quite horribly sorry but just heaven how plain she was with that tearblotched face and those quivering lips and nostrils andrew merrimans appraisement of her appearance and the consequences entailed by it in respect of a possible suitor were not overstated adrian waited giving not only her but himself time to recover and approaching her again did so smiling ah that is well dear cousin he said already you feel better you regain your serenity well then let us talk quietly about this matter which you wish to explain to me it was about our willsmargarets and mine i mean about the disposition of our property as she spoke she clenched her right hand working it against the palm of her left like a ball working in a socket mr challoner has mentioned this subject to margaret impressing upon her that we ought to attend to it without delay our good challoner is a little disposed to magnify his office adrian put in lightly so i have thoughtsometimes joanna agreed a trace of eagerness in her flat colorless voice producedas alwaysfrom the top of an empty lung but he has great influence over margaret i do not want to be unjust but i think the ideas he suggests to her are not always suitable they tend to create difficulties between us from what margaret tells me i gather that he has discussed this subject very freely with her she refers to it and quotes him continually when we are alone i gather that he thinks i ought to make a will exclusively in margarets favor so that in the event of my death the estate may pass to papas direct descendants he tells margaret as i gather that papa wished this although he left no written instructions regarding it and hehemr challoner i meanappears to take for granted that while margaret will almost certainly marry now it is improbable i shall ever marry but adrian cried indignantly though against his convictions and his better judgment in even hinting at such a thing challoner is guilty of a very great impertinence he takes for granted that which is no concern of his and takes it for granted altogether prematurely thereby laying himself open to a welldeserved and very extensive snubbing joannas breath caught in her throat again the young man felt her eyes fix on him with an extraordinary intensity of gaze cousin adrian she said hurriedly has any one ever told youdo you knowi think you ought to knowabout our brother williamabout bibby this time adrian met her gaze steadily he felt it imperative to do so to his relief after a momentary fluttering the redrimmed eyelids were lowered i have heard a little about him poor boy he answered gently and respectfully i have heard that he caused those who loved him anxiety and trouble and humiliation and disgrace joanna whispered but what would you have dear cousin it must be so at times life is a tremendous a dangerous though in my opinion a very splendid experiment we all start as amateurs in ignorance of the laws which govern it is it not therefore inevitable that some should get off the true lines and make mistakes injurious to themselves and lamentable to others but papa did not permit mistakes he never forgave them pardon me but in not forgiving them did he not himself perhaps commit the very gravest of all mistakes adrian could not resist asking though he feared the question trenched on levity i wish i could believe that she spoke bitterly it would simplify so much for me i should be so thankful to believe it it would help to excuse bibby i know he was weak in character but he was so nervous and delicate as a child papa alarmed him he demanded too much of him and was stern and sarcastic because bibby could not meet that demand my brother did not go to a preparatory school but at thirteen he was sent to rugby it was papas old school and he believed the traditions and atmosphere of it were calculated to induce the serious sense of moral and intellectual responsibility in which he thought bibby deficient poor child adrian murmured yes she said i am thankful you understand and pity him i know papas purpose was bibbys good the improvement and development of his character but the treatment was too severe it did not brace him but only broke his spirit he was unaccustomed to associate with other boys they frightened and bullied him he was so miserable that at the beginning of his second term he ran away she waited a moment struggling against rising emotion her hands working again ballandsocket fashion it was all very dreadful for nearly a week he was lost we knew he could have very little money for his allowance was small papa held economy to be a duty for the young i think next to mamma i suffered most for i always loved bibby bestbetter than i did margaret i shall never forget that week i suppose papa suffered too in his own way he was very silent and looked angry andrew merriman traced bibby to london and brought him home mamma pleaded to keep him for a time but he was sent straight back to school about six months later papa received a request to remove him he was accused of taking money from another boys locker nothing was actually proved but suspicion clung to him and as his general conduct was reported unsatisfactory the authorities thought it better he should leave papa sent him abroad to a private school at lausanne he remained there three years until he was seventeen papa refused to let him spend the holidays at home so during the whole of that time we only saw him twice when we were traveling the monotonous colorless voice the monotonous story of wellmeaning coldblooded tyranny it narrated got upon the listeners nerves with difficulty he restrained explosive comment reflecting far from politely upon the so recently buried dead he really could not sit still under the indignation it provoked in him he got up moved away and stood leaning his shoulder against the dark polished woodwork of the eastern window his back to the light he thought it well the narrator should not see his expression too clearly it is almost inconceivable he said i am not exaggerating cousin adrian joanna returned straining her eyes in the effort to fix them upon his face all these events in their consecutive order are stamped indelibly upon my memory i am convinced you are not exaggerating my dear cousin and just on that very account it is the more inconceivable adrian declared but in your present relation to usto mei feel you ought to know all about poor bibby all about ourmyfamily history my duty is to place the facts before you i should be guilty of great selfindulgence if i concealed anything from you in that connection joanna protested with growing agitation i should do very wrong if to spare myself pain i deceived you and again that sensation of embarrassment of uncertainty how to comport himself returned upon adrian but dear cousin he said in a mildly argumentative manner dont you emphasize the obligation of truthtelling unnecessarily i am here to be of help to you to shield you in so far as possible from that which is distressing in thus reviving painful memories do you not defeat the very object of my presence oh no no joanna cried surely you realize how bitterly i might have cause to upbraid myselflaterif i now left anything untold which it was right you should have heard it is incumbent upon me a matter ofof honor to be perfectly explicit adrian raised his eyebrows the least bit how providential he stood with his back to the light he passed his left hand down over his neat black beard and his lips parted silently poor dear young woman what in the name of wonder didand then he came near laughing the idea was too preposterous and worse stillshame filled him at even momentary entertainment of ittoo fatuous he gave it unqualified dismissal no she repeated with a veiled and somber violence i should do very wrong by permitting you to remain in ignorance i should deserve any after suffering which might come to me for i have a duty to fulfil to bibby as wellthat is what i wanted to explain to you before giving instructions to mr challoner about drafting my will some day my duty to bibby may appear to clash with another duty and therefore it is necessary you should know clearly beforehand joanna flung herself back in her chair whatever it may cost me now ororin the future i must tell you the rest adrian more mystified than ever startled by the use of his christian name without any qualifying prefix at once affected and repelled by her excitement the young man moved from his station at the window and stood near her leaning his hands upon the head of the ungainly adjustable couch pray tell me any and everything which may help to procure you relief he said kindly and joanna lying back looked up at him an immense appeal a something desperate and unsatiable in her faded blue eyes which made him consciously shrink the ibsen womanthe ibsen woman in another manifestationit was not pleasant he didnt like it in the very leastthen as if at the touch of a spring she sat bolt upright looking past him out of the window at the dark windshaken branches of the pines when my brother returned from lausanne she began again in that colorless monotonous voice he was put into andrew merrimans office at the mills mamma and i were glad at first we trusted andrew merriman he had always been tactful and kind about bibby but papa decided hemy brothershould live at home so that he might exert a direct personal authority over him and the two had nothing nothing in common you can judge from the contents of this library what papas tastes and pursuits were my brother did not care anything about politics or social reform or that class of subject he was pleasureloving and i do not think his long stay abroad improved him in that respect papa supposed the discipline at m leonards school to be rigid among the elder boys i have reason to fear it was decidedly lax adrian made a slight movement of comprehension he could picture the rgime and could well imagine the nice little games these exiled young gentlemen had been at papa was stern bibby inattentive sullen and nervous at dinner wemamma and iused constantly to be in dread of collisions we were in perpetual anxiety as to what bibby might inadvertently say or not say which might provoke papas sarcasm then mammas health began to give way we went to torquay for the winter taking the servants and highdene was shut up bibby went into lodgings near to andrew merriman in the suburb of leeds in which the mills are situated papa wishing to train him in habits of economy only allowed him the salary of a junior clerk but every one there knew we were rich so the tradespeople were only too ready to give bibby credit while unscrupulous persons borrowed of him he was naturally generous and easily imposed upon and he enjoyed the society of those who flattered and made much of him it was said he frequented low company that he gambled at cards and got intoxicated i i do not know how far this was true but he did get deeply into debt more than once andrew merriman helped him but he could not afford to be responsible for bibbys continued extravagance and thenthenmy brother manipulated certain accounts and embezzled a large sum of money andrew merriman discovered this he tried to shield him and interceded with papa for him the speaker broke off pausing for breath bending down as though crushed by the weight of her recollections it was very very dreadful she said papa paid my brothers debts but he forbade him all intercourse with us he cut bibby out of our family life as a surgeon might cut out some malignant growth he regarded him thus i thinkindeed he said so onceas a diseased part the excision of which was imperative if the moral health of the family was to be preserved he gave andrew merriman a capital sum which was to be remitted to bibby in small quarterly instalments when that sum was exhausted he was to receive nothing further we never saw him again papa bought this house and we moved here he would not remain at highdene the scandal had been too great he could not forgive nor could he endure pity he made the business into a company and retired mamma had become a complete invalid the doctors thought this climate might benefit her and then this place is far away from our former friends and associations we knew no one here joanna raised herself looking not at adrian savage but past him out at the dusky pines she wiped her lips with her blackbordered handkerchief that is all cousin adrian she said but when the young man would have spoken she held up one hand restrainingly and he saw that she shivered exceptexcept this she went on papa ordered that bibby should be considered as dead later andrew ceased to hear from him and rumors came that he was actually deadthat he had died at buenos ayres where he had gone as a member of some theatrical troupe but mamma and i never credited those rumors nor did andrew merriman he does not credit them now she turned her head looking full at adrian with that same desperation of appeal i asked him yesterday she said it was dreadful to speak to him on the subject but i felt it my duty to do so i felt i ought to know where i stood in regard to my fortune becausebecause of the future andrew believes my brother is still alive and that is why i must refuse to make a will in margarets favor if as you say papa made the gravest of all mistakes in never pardoning mistakes clearly my duty to his memory is to redress the mistake he made in the case of my brother in as far as it is possible for me to do so margaret will have ample means of her own i cannot be ruled by mr challoners opinion joanna rose and walked over to the window standing exactly where adrian had stood some ten minutes before there seemed a definite purpose in her selection of the exact spot both in the placing of her feet and the leaning of her shoulder against the windowframe her back was to the light adrian could not see the expression of her face distinctly he was glad of this he did not want to see it for again he was conscious of shrinking from her after all mr challoner may be wrongas you yourself just now said cousin adrianin taking for granted i shall never marry i may marry but whatever happens i shall not leave any part of my fortune to margaret i shall leave twothirds of it to bibby and the rest smallbridge threw open the library door mr challoner maam he said and the stourmouth solicitor his mongolian countenance quite strikingly devoid of all expression ponderously entered the room ii the drawings upon the wall chapter i a waster it was still cold but the skies were clear the snow had been carted away and paris was herself again the note of her exhilarating seductive vibranta note at once curiously fiercer and more feminine than that of london ren dax crossing the place du carrousel stood for a moment listening to that vibrant note sensible of its charm and challenge looking westward meanwhile across the tuileries gardens and place de la concorde to the ascending perspective of the champslyses the superb ensemble and detail of the scene softened by lavender mist at the ground levels was crowned by the bloodred and gold of a wideflung frosty sunseta city of fire as the young man told himself built on foundations of dreams he had just come away from the press view of a oneman show of his own drawings the rooms were crowded to suffocation the success of the exhibition was already assured promising to be prodigious to amount to a veritable sensation he was aware of this yet his mood remained an unhappy one as usual the critics showed themselves a herd of imbeciles they praised the wrong things or more exasperating still praising the right ones praised them wrongly extolling their weak points rather than their fine ones misinterpreting their message and inner meaning had adrian savage been thereunluckily he was still in englandsome sense might have been spoken adrian was an austere critic but always an intelligent and discriminating one as for the rest of the confraternityren gazed mournfully at the flaming sunset splendorthey got upon his nerves they nauseated him and it all went deeper than that for those many square yards of wall plastered with his mordant verdict upon the human species got upon his nerves too and nauseated him he recoiled as he had often recoiled beforetaking it thus wholesalefrom his own merciless exposure of the follies vulgarities the mental and physical deformities and distortions of his fellowcreatures recoiled from the reek of his own rabelaisian humor of his own extravagant ribaldry and ingenious grossness it was his vocation as that of other and more famous satirists to wreak a vindictive vengeance thus upon humanity only in his care reaction invariably followed the devil of unsanctified laughter for the time satiated and cast out of him he wanderedas this eveninga very sad and plaintive little being firmly resolvingas how often beforeonce and for all to throw away his rather horrible pencil and betake himself exclusively to the construction of those delicate lyrics and rondels from which whatever minor perversions of sentiment they might exhibit the witty bestiality common to his caricatures was conspicuously absent he wanted to forget the hot close rooms packed with admirers male and though happily in a minority female also by ren dax that minority was held in particularly small respect the woman who relished or affected to relish his art ought to be ashamed of herselfsuch at least was his opinion his art was meant for men not for women and the women who couldnt arrive at that conclusion by instinct unaided were women for whom especially in his existing mood he had no use whatever didnt want in the very least that which he did want under the head of things feminine was something conspicuously differenta farremoved stately inaccessible type of womanhood and still more he wanted the child who should grow into such womanhooda tender elusive spritelike spotlessly innocent and unsoiled creature to whom moral and physical ugliness were equally unknown and equally saving the paradox abhorrent well were not the tall oldfashioned houses of the quai malaquais across the river there just opposite and was it not still early enough to pay a visit but then as he rather fretfully remembered madame st leger had been pertinaciously invisible of late he had called several times only to be told she was not receiving or that she was out he had never succeeded in seeing her and little bette never now that he came to think of it since the day of the great snow the day when adrian whose absence he had just been deploring left for england the bringing of these two facts into any relation of cause and effect had not previously occurred to him it did not do so seriously even now yet unquestionably the names of madame st leger and adrian savage took up a position side by side in his mind thereby subtly coloring his reflections he had no friend upon whom he depended and who in his capricious exacting fashion he loved as he did adrian the friendship had remained practically unbroken since the time when adrian the healthier happiernatured boy protected him the queer little tadpole from tormentors at school this friendship had been among the wholesomest influences of his life and amid many aberrations and perversities of thought and conduct he clung to it but it followed on his selfabsorption and selfishness natural and assumed that his friends interests and concerns save in so far as they bore direct relation to his own were a matter of indifference to him he had never troubled himself as to the possible state or direction of adrians affections and perhaps consequently this sudden juxtaposition of names came to him as a surprise and an irritating one slipping in and out between private cars taxis and humbler horsedrawn vehicles he crossed the roadway to the pont des saints pres the sunset glories faded while avenues of living white and glowworm green lights sprang into being still here and there red splashes as of blood stained the livid swirling surface of the seine which in half flood fed by the melted snow hissed and gurgled under the arches and against the masonry of the bridge as it happened just then a lull occurred in the crossriver traffic a break in the quickmoving throng of footpassengers so that in front of ren dax the pale arc of the righthand pavement showed empty in the whole of its length save for a single tall slouching shabby figure clothed in a blueserge suit unmistakably english in cut and in pattern as ren advanced his mind still working around those two names set in such irritating juxtaposition he saw the man in the englishmade suit first glance sharply to right and left then bend down grasping the outer edge of the parapet while slowly and as it seemed furtively drawing one knee up on to the flat of the coping was it possible that madame st legers repeated refusals to receive him were other than accidental was it possible they had some connection with adrians absence was it conceivable his friend had turned traitor had interfered saying or hinting at that which might socially justify such denial of admission suspicion resentment selfpity a lively sense of personal injury invaded him the shabby slouching loafers right knee was fairly upon the coping now he threw up both arms threw back his head his mouth opened wide as one letting loose a great cry ren dax saw his extended arms his bare head his profile with that wideopen mouth dark against a pale background of buildings and cold translucent sky the effect was of the strangest the more so that no sound came from the apparently loudcrying mouth suddenly his chin dropped on his breast his hands were lowered clutching at the edge of the parapet again and he remained thus for a few seconds immobile crouched together his left foot in a wellcut but bulging holeriddled boot still resting upon the pavement then in a flash awakening from contemplation of his own lately discovered woes ren realized what was about to occur his height and reach were insufficient encumbered as he was moreover by a thick furlined overcoat for him to get his arms round the crouching figure so he just clutched whatever came handiest the back of the fellows jacket the slack of the seat of his trousers exerting all his strength ren hauled and jerked at these wellworn garments the attack though neither very forcible nor very scientific was completely unexpected the mans grip relaxed his knee slipped and he fell back an amorphous indigo and sandyred heap upon the pallid asphalt ren pulled a scented pockethandkerchief out of the breastpocket of his coat and proceeded delicately to wipe the fingers and palms of his gray sude gloves he was unaccustomed to such exertion his heart thumped against his ribs his sight was blurred he felt slightly faint and lightheaded and was grateful for the cold backdraught of air off the rapidly flowing river it was his pride part of his pose in fact never to display emotion and he now found himself excited and shaken by no means fully selfpossessed he needed a space of quiet in which to regain his accustomed affectations of bearing and manner he was aware too that those shabby garments were decidedly unpleasant to touch therefore he stood still breathing rather hard through his nostrils and daintily wiping the neat little gray suede gloves incasing his quick clever little fingers i must express regret for my violence he said with the utmost civility to the heap on the pavement as soon as he judged his voice sufficiently steady for speech i must apologize to you for such absence of ceremony but really my dear sir it appeared to me no time should be lost you had unconsciously of course placed yourself in a highly ridiculous position from which it was clearly incumbent upon me as an amiable and sympathetic person immediately to remove you at times one is compelled to act with decision rather than politeness this was a case in point doubtless you are at present annoyed with me but a few moments reflection will i feel sure commend my action to you you will recognize how right even to the point of an apparent sacrifice of personal dignity i was the man by now had got upon all fours looking like some unsightly shambling animal limply he rose to his feet and supporting himself against the balustrade turned upon his savior a dissipated boyish countenance down which tears dribbled miserably why the devil couldnt you leave me alone he asked petulantly in english what earthly concern is it of yours arent i my own master his voice rose to a wail ive been trying toto do it all day but there have been too many people about they stared at me they suspected and followed me i could not dodge them now i thought the opportunity had come i was rid of them at last i never saw you curse you youre so short after all one doesnt think of looking on the ground except for vermin and id just pulled myself together i maynt have the nerve to try again ive lost my chance he wailed childishly his weak looselipped mouth twisted by the wretchedness of crying ive lost my chance through you you beast and youve torn my coat too its the only one i have left and i did want to look decent when they found me when i was dead he flung away passionately pressing his face down on his folded arms upon the parapet while his angular shoulders heaved and his body shuddered under the ragged blueserge jacket i shall not have the pluck again i know myself and i shant have it by now i should have been out of the whole accursed tangle the whole show would have been overoveri should know nothing more i should be quit of my misery i should be deadah my god deaddead but ren dax continued to wipe his neat little gray sude gloves for his mood had changed the taunt regarding his smallness of stature had turned him wicked so that the exquisite minor poet yearning for the companionship of things pure lovely and of good report fled away the injured friend fled away likewise and the satirist the caricaturist impure and unsimple greedy of human ugliness and degradation malignant mercilessly scoffing reigned in their stead and here in this looselimbed blueeyed tawnyheaded foreign youthwhose voice and speech coarseness of expression notwithstanding witnessed to education and gentle bloodvainly essaying to drown himself under the dying sunset skies of the city of fire built on foundations of dreams was a subject surely made to the satirists hand a subject of great price the despotism of his art came upon ren dax that necessity for vengeance upon humanity and this time for him the edge of vengeance was sharpened by personal insult for this was no common vagabond wastrel thrown up from the foul underlying dregs of the population but a person of condition once his social equal whose insolence therefore touched his honor as that of a man of the people could not you are offensive my young friend he said in careful slightly overpronounced but fluent english you are also remarkably unattractive and wanting in intelligence but i being happily none of these thingsoffensive i would say unattractive or wanting in intelligencecan afford to be magnanimous learn then that had i not intervenedat much inconvenience to myselfto prevent your projecting your unsavory carcass into the river but permitted you to carry out your thriceidiotic purpose it would not as you say have been all over by now and you quit of your misery not one bit of it were you less crude in idea less bestially ignorant you would be aware that the principle of life is indestructible choking and struggling in the black water there you would have suffered abominable discomfort but even when the process of asphyxiation was complete you yourself would have been still alive still conscious and would have discovered to your infinite chagrin that you had merely exchanged one state of being for an other and more odious one ren rested his elbows upon the top of the balustrade and putting his little tired baby face close spoke with incisive clearness of enunciation into the young mans ear be under no delusion he said once alive always alive there is no breaking out of that prison it is too cleverly constructed you cannot get away your sentence is for life and there is no term to livingnone absolutely none forever and forever you might have killed your present very unpleasing body i grant but this would not have advanced matters for your essential self the me the ego would have remained and would have been compelled by incalculable and indomitable natural forces to surround itself with another body in which to endure the shame of birth the agonizing sorrows of childhood and all that which from childhood has rendered existence intolerable to you over again or you might very probably have come to rebirth lower down in the scale of creationas a beetle to be crushed under foot a dog to be pinned out on the vivisectors table a lamb to be flayed at the abattoir a worm to writhe on the fishermans hook a formless grub to bloat itself with carrion here the wretched youth raised his head and stared at his selfconstituted mentor tearful wretchedness had given place to an expression of moral terror almost trenching on insanityterror of immeasurable possibilities of conceptions monstrous and unnatural who are you what are you he cried you mincing little devil isnt it all horrible enough already without you trying to scare me i hate you and you havent been dead how can you know ah you begin to take notice to listen and although you continue offensive that you should listen is satisfactory as it assures me my amiable attentions and instructive conversation are not altogether wasted learn then my cherished pupil ren added in a soft easy smalltalk tone that you are still in error since ii who so patiently reason with youhave unquestionably been dead scores hundreds probably thousands of times i have sampled many different incarnations just as you doubtless under less indigent circumstances have sampled dinners at many different restaurants with this distinction however that whereas in paris at all events you must have eaten a number of quite passable dinners i have never yet experienced an incarnation which was not in the main detestable a flagrant outrage on sensibility and good taste hence you see i do not speak at random but from a wide basis of fact i know all about it and therefore i just emphasize this point once more engrave it upon the tablets of your memory it is well worth remembering particularly in reckless and exaggerated moments life is indestructible to end it is merely to begin it under slightly altered material conditions with a prelude of acute mental and physical discomfort thrown in hideous disappointment moreover waiting to transfix you when your higher faculties arelike minesufficiently developed for you to have acquired the power of looking backward and visualizing the premutations of your past the speaker turned sideways leaning on one elbow he took his handkerchief neatly from his breastpocket again and held it to his nose really you do need washing rather badly my young friend he said but not down there not in the but dubiously cleanly waters of our beloved seine a turkish bath and a vigorous shampoo afterward and subsequently a change of linenhowever that for the moment must wait to return to our little lesson in practical philosophyi have rescued you from the disaster of premature reincarnation i have also striven to improve your mind to enlighten you and that at considerable discomfort to myself for i find it very cold standing and instructing you in the fundamental principles of being here on this remarkably draughty bridge i risk double pneumonia in your service be grateful then and make suitable acknowledgment of the immense charity i have shown you you are a devil and i hate you why cant you go away the young man answered in a terrified sulkiness truly you are mistaken ren returned imperturbably my charity is too great to permit me to go away until you my pupil are provided for you have so much which it would be to your advantage to learn i am not a devil nobut i admit that i am today one of the mosttalkedabout persons in paris i must therefore entreat you to adopt a more respectful tone and less accentuated manner we have ceased to be alone many people are crossing the bridge among them must be those to whom my appearance is familiar and if i am remarked pleading thus with a debauched wouldbe suicide i shall certainly read in the morning papers that m ren dax has discovered a new method of selfadvertisement a catchy puff for his pictureshow this would be disagreeable to me my work is big enough to stand on its own merits selfadvertisement in my case is as superfluous as it is vulgar compose yourself cease to be ridiculous and above all do not call me rude names in the hearing of the public ah excellentthere is an empty cab he hailed a passing taxi and as the chauffeur drew up to the curb put his arm within that of his companion persuasively even affectionately come then my child he said see my charity is really inexhaustible i will take you home with me though i confess you are a far from fragrant fellowtraveler pending that so desirable turkish bath and listeni will take you home i will also feed you and i will draw little pictures of you several little pictures because i find in you a singularly edifying example of a singularly degraded type after i have drawn as many little pictures as pleases me i will have you washed i will give you clothes i will give you money and then i will send you away without asking any questions without so much as inquiring your name he moved toward the waiting car the door of which the chauffeur held open but the young man showed a disposition to struggle and hang back get in dirty animal or i call the police ren dax ordered sharply and recount to them your recent exploit they will not give you money or clothes nor will they abstain from asking inconvenient questions ah you decide to accompany me that is well and with a roughly helping hand from the chauffeur he projected the limp wretched figure into the cab a good tip my son and drive smartly he added after giving an address in the boulevard du mont parnasse chapter ii the return of the native yes i have returned i am here veritably here chre madame et amie at last i have effected my escape from the land of egypt and the house of bondageand such a bondage ah it is an incredibly happy thing to be back adrian permitted himself to hold his hostesss hand some seconds longer than is demanded by strict etiquette his face was as glad as a spring morning tender gallantry lurked in his eyes his voice had a ring of joy irrepressible his aspect was at once that of suppliant and of conqueror and this whole brilliant effect was infectious finding readier and more sympathetic reflection in madame st legers expression and humor than she at all intended or bargained for for the moment indeed the charm and the rush of it came near sweeping her off her feet she ceased to subscribe to theory ceased to reason yielded to spontaneous feeling practice claiming herthe secular and delightful practice of he being man she woman and of both being fearless highspirited beautifully human and beautifully young in any case the house of bondage has not disagreed with you she said gaily for i have never seen you looking more admirably well ah you must not put that down to the credit of the house of bondage but to the fact of my entrancing escape from it to the fact that once more i am hereherewith you as he spoke adrian glanced round the dear roseredandcanvascolored room he wished to make sure that in every detail he found it precisely as he had left it every article of furniture every picture every ornament in its accustomed position he felt jealous of the minutest change of object or of place no nothing is altered nothing he said answering his own thought aloud in the greatness of his content gabrielle abstained from comment she owned herself moved excited uplifted by the joyful atmosphere which his presence exhaled indeed that presence affected her far more deeply than she had anticipated catching her imagination and emotions as in the dazzling meshes of a golden net some men are gross some absurd some unspeakably tedious when in love adrian was very certainly neither of these objectionable things he struck indeed an almost perfect note and that was just where the danger came in just why she dared not let this interview continue at the enthusiastic level she might suffer the charm of it too comprehensively andfor already she began to reason againthat would entail regret and only too likely worse than regret so steeling herself against the insidious charm which so worked on and quickened her she moved away from the vacant place before the fire where she had been standing with adrian savage sat down in her highbacked rosecushioned chair and picked up the bundle of white lawn and lace lying on the little table beside it she needed protectionwhether from him or from herself she did not quite care to inquireand reckoned it wiser to put a barrier of actual space and barrier of sobering employment between herself and this inconveniently moving returned guest and lover she refused to be taken by storm but adrians buoyancy of spirit was not so easily to be crushed ah only that was needed he declared to complete my satisfactionthat you should place yourself thus and shake out your pretty needlework it procures me the welcome belief that no time has really been lost or wasted it almost convinces me that i have not been away at all you cannot conceive what pleasure what happiness it gives me to be here to see you again but now that i am able to observe you calmly chre madame yes calmly calmly she put in without raising her eyes from her stitching how i value how i appreciate calm do you not appear a little tired a little pale very possibly she answered i have been troubled about my mother recently the extreme cold affected her circulation for some days we were in grave anxiety her vitality is low indeed i have passed through some trying hours and i was ignorant of her illness ignorant of your anxiety why did you not write and tell me does not the difficulty of answering letters one has never received occur to you gabrielle inquired mildly and it was not i you know who volunteered to write the young man had drawn a chair up to the near side of the little table now he leaned forward his elbows on his knees both hands extended as one who offers a petition do not reproach me with my silence or i shall be brokenhearted he said my inclination was to write reams to you volumes i did in fact begin many letters but i restrained myself i destroyed them to have sent them would have been selfish and indiscreet i was bound by my promise to you at parting not to allude to the subject which most vitally touches my happiness and i found over there so much which was perplexing and sad i asked myself what right i had to inflict upon you a recital of melancholy impressions and events i came to the conclusion that i really had none madame st leger looked at him sideways from between halfclosed eyelids the dimple showed in her cheek but her smile was distinctly ironic why not admit that i was right in foretelling that you would find those shadowy ladies and your mission to them of absorbing interest it occupied your time and thoughts to the exclusion of all elsenow was it not so was i not right yes and no chre madame he answered presently slowly and with so perceptible a change of tone that his hearer was startled to the point of finding it difficult to go on with her needlework adrian sat silently watching her the singular character of her beauty both in its subtlety and suggestion of a reserve of moral force had never been more evident to him more than ever in each gesture in the long suave lines of her body and limbs shrouded in clinging black in the gleam of her furrowed hair as she turned or bent her charming head in the abiding provocation and mystery of her eyes and lips did she appear to him unique and infinitely desirable watching her he inclined to become lyrical and cry aloud his worship in heroic fashion careless of twentiethcentury decorum and restraint but if her room the material frame and setting of that beauty to his immense content remained unchanged in every particular her attitude of mind to his immense discontent evidently remained unchanged likewise in the first surprise of his arrival she had yielded somewhat catching alight from his flame but with a determined hand she shut down those sympathetic fires becoming obdurate as before he could feel her will sensibly stiffening against his own and this at once hurt him shrewdly and whipped up passion preaching a reckless war of conquest bidding him disregard promises bidding him speak and thunder down opposition by sheer law of the strongest in every man worth the name temptation must arise at moments to beat the defiant beloved object into an obedient and docile jellythe defiant beloved object it may confidently be added would regard any man as unworthy of serious consideration did it not but in adrians case sitting watching her now though such temptation did very really arise its duration was brief less primitive counsels prevailed she was far from kind and he was hotly in love but he was also the child of his age and a fine gentleman at that to whom given time for reflection berserker methods must inevitably present themselves as both unworthy and ludicrous so if she condemned him to play a waiting game he would bow to her ruling and play it he had considerable capital of selfconfidence to draw upon in as far as the ultimate issues were concerned he wasnt a bit afraidas yet he could afford so he believed to wait only since tormenting was about all the fun of that amiable pastime shouldnt be on her side and to this end now he would make her speak first he remained silent therefore still observing her until the color deepened in the round of her cheeks and the stitches were set less regularly in the white work while uneasiness gained on her causing her presently to look up yes and no she said yes and no that is nothing of an answer i am all attention i am curious to hear your explanation and thenyes and nowhat next this he replied that on nearer acquaintance the two ladies proved anything but shadowy they proved in some respects even a little tremendous far from being absorbed in them i came alarmingly near being absorbed by themwhich is a very different matter ah that is interesting you did not like them i really cannot say they bothbut particularly the elder sister my cousin joannawere new to my experience i do not feel that i have even yet placed them in my mind the members of all nations above a certain social level can meet on common ground it is below that level national tendencies and eccentricities actually declare themselves i went over strong in the conceit of ignorance i supposed i knew all about it and should find myself quite at home i was colossally mistaken the manners and mental attitude of the provincial middleclass english were a revelation to me of the blighting effects of a sea frontier and a puritan descent the men have but three subjects of conversationpolitics games and their own importance the womenadrian paused looking full at madame st legeri am very very sorry for the women ah dear madame he added let us return devout thanks that we were born on this side the humane the amiable the artistic side of the channel you and i for they are really a very uncomfortable people those middleclass anglosaxons until i spent this agelong three weeks among them i had no conception what a convinced catholicin sentiment if not to my shame altogether in practiceand thoroughpaced latin i was during the above harangue gabrielles hands remained idle he was really very good meeting her thus halfway in the suppression of the personal and amatory note she was obliged to him of course yet in honest truth was she so very much pleased by his readiness to take the hint she could not but ask herself thatand then hurry away so to speak from the answer her fingers in her pretty ears his cue was an intelligent exchange of ideas then an excellent oneshe stopped her ears more resolutelyshe too would be intelligent increased faith and increased patriotism as the result of your journey how admirable clearly it is highly beneficial to ones morale to cross the channel were it rather later in the year and were the weather less inclement i should be disposed to take the little cure without delay myself it would not suit you in the least adrian asserted you would dislike it all quite enormously gabrielle st leger at the tower house the idea produced in him a violent unreasoning repulsion as though she ran some actual physical danger heaven forbid i should not go with any purpose of enjoyment but rather as a penance hoping the dislike of what i found over there might heighten my appreciation of all my blessings here at home whereupon adrian careless of diplomacy clutched at his chance then you are not so entirely satisfied chre madame et amie he cried laughing a little in his eagerness not so utterly happy and content is one ever as devout ever as patriotic as one ought to be she asked gravely or as sincere he returned with corresponding gravity the hot color deepened in the young womans face and she picked up her needlework again quickly iinsincere she asked is not that precisely why you find me slightly vexatious my dear mr savage that i am only too sincere a veritable model of sincerity and she rose gracious smiling to receive another guest ah ma toute belle how are you and how is the poor darling mother better thank god for that but still in her room dear dear yet after all what can one expect in such weather convalescence must necessarily be protracted i am forced to come and ask for news in person since you refuse to have a telephone just consider the many annoying intrusions such as the present which that useful instrument would spare you anastasia beauchamp overdressed and genial as ever interspersed these remarks with the unwinding of voluminous fox furs all heads and tails and feebly dangling paws the kissing of her hostess on either cheek and finally a handshake to adrian so you are restored to us my dear savage she continued i am more than delighted to see you though at this moment i am well aware that delight is not reciprocatedthere there it is superfluous to perjure yourself by a denialand you are back just in time to write a scathing criticism of your protg m daxs exhibition in the review here is matter for sincere congratulation for believe me very plain speaking is demanded the newspapers are afraid of him they cringe their pusillanimity is disgusting really this time he has broken his own record it is just these things which create a wrong impression and bring france into bad odor with other nations he is a traitor to the best traditions of the art of this country i deplore it from that point of view his exhibition is a scandal the correctional police should step in you have yourself visited the exhibition dear anastasia madame st leger inquired demurely naturally i have been to see it dont i see everything which is going isnt that my acknowledged little hobby my dear then too where does the benefit of increasing age come in unless you claim the privileges of indiscretion conferred by it still even in senile indiscretion one should observe a decent limit i went alone absolutely alone to inspect those abominable productions i wore a thick veil too andi blushed behind it needless to relate i now and then quivered with laughter one is but human after all and to be human is also to be diverted by impropriety but i could have whipped myself for laughing even though quite alone and behind the veil go and judge for yourself whether i am not justified in my disgust my dear savage and as for you ma toute belle do not i implore you go at allunless you have had the misfortune to do so alreadyeven though going would effectually cure you of any kindness you may entertain toward the artistan end in my poor opinion greatly to be desired i have not seen m daxs exhibition nor have i seen m dax himself for some length of time gabrielle remarked quietly you have dropped him i rejoice to hear it a man of so villainous an imagination is unfit to approach you i will not say that i have dropped him as she spoke she was aware that adrian looked keenly inquiringly at her and this displeased her as an intrusion upon her liberty of action m dax has a charming devotion to my little bette she continued no one whom i know is so perfect a playfellow to children his sympathy with them is extraordinary he understands their tastes and pleasures and is unwearied in his kindness to them only perhaps his games are a little overstimulating overexciting after his last visit my poor bette suffered from agitating dreams and awoke in the night frightened and crying i had difficulty in soothing her praiseworthy babe how profoundly right are her instincts miss beauchamp declared fervently but heaven help us whats this she added under her breath perfidious infant how these praiseworthy babies can fool one she nodded and beckoned to adrian still speaking under her breath as you value my friendship dont go on no account go my dear savage come and sit here by me and tell me about your time in england like the chivalrous young man you are stick to me supply me with a valid excuse for remaining for manners or no manners i am resolved not to leave her alone with that depraved little horror i am resolved to outstay him chapter iii a straining of friendship bette lightfooted sprightly in beaver cap pelisse and muff brown cloth gaiters and boots to match her face pink from air and exercise her eyes wide and bright with consciousness of temerity spricketed toward her mother leading ren dax by the hand i found him outside in the courtyard as i returned from my walk with my little friends she piped the words tumbling over one another in her pretty haste he told me that he wished so much to see us but that he never found us at home now and he looked unhappy you have always instructed me that it is our duty to console the unhappy so i informed him that i knew you were at home today because you would not leave my grandmother and i assured him that speaking in your name it would give us much pleasure to receive him and then i invited him to come upstairs with me and that was all quite proper wasnt it mamma because we do not like him to be unhappy and it does give us pleasure to receive m dax does it not assuredly it gives us pleasure to receive m dax gabrielle said her head carried high and a just perceptible ring of defiance in her voice she smiled graciously upon the young man and for an instant the three stood hand in handren dax the tadpole offering the very strangest of connecting links between the beautiful mother and delicious little girl miss beauchamp uttered a sharp exclamation which she vainly attempted to mask by a cough adrian savage looked saw and turned his back he stared blindly out of window at paris beneath sparkling in the keenedged february sunshine the sweat broke out on his forehead he had received an agonizing a hateful impression amounting sound and selfconfident though he was to acute physical pain no not that not that he cried to himself of all conceivable combinations not that one it is hideous unbearable out of nature miss beauchamp touched him on the arm her face spoke volumes talk to me my dear savage she said urgently i can imagine what you feel but talk create some any excuse for staying and take it that depraved little horror away with you when you go rally your resources my dear friend play up i entreat you play up then louder you had a deplorable crossingfog coming into calais yes february is among the most odious months of the year but i go over so seldom now you know since my poor brothers death nearly all my friends are on this side and after all one only has to wait everybody who is anybody must pass through paris sooner or latertalk my dear savage talk support meah yes in london you observed many changes i hear a mania has taken the authorities lately for improvements you did not stay in town ah no of course not stourmouthyes i remember the place vaguely interminable black firtrees and interminable perambulating pinkandwhite consumptivesi like neither yes talktalkmy own remarks are abysmal in their fatuity but no matter its all in a good cause let us keep on ren meanwhile successfully affected ignorance of any human presences save those of his hostess and his little guide why have you refused me why have you never let me see you he asked gazing mournfully at madame st leger i have not been receiving she replied my mother has been ailing and my time has been devoted to her but to see me even to be aware that i was near her would have done her good he returned she has a great regard for me and in the case of a sensitive organization the proximity of a person to whom one is attached acts as a restorative it was on that account i have needed to come here i too have been ailing my exhibition is a howling success being a person of refinement this naturally has disagreed with me inducing repeated fits of the spleen flooring me with a dumb rage of melancholy as a corrective i required the soothing society of madame your mother and of mademoiselle bette i required also to be with you madame to look at you this i believed would prove beneficial to my nerves lacerated by frenzied public admiration by excluding me you have not only wounded my susceptibilities but prolonged my ill health as i have already proved to you madame vernoiss regrettable illness is no sufficient reason for that exclusion there must have been some further reason there was a further reason gabrielle replied quietly ren gazed up at her a point of flame in his somber eyes all of a sudden with an amazingly quick very vulgar streetboy gesture and a wicked grimace tipping his thumb over his shoulder he indicated the other two guests holding uneasy converse at the other side of the room the thing was done in a twinkling and he regained his accustomed plaintive solemnity of aspect what further reason that he the janitor otherwise adrian the magnificent was away you are impertinent madame st leger said sternly at first her anger concentrated itself upon ren dax then quite arbitrarily and unjustly it took a wider sweep she called bette to her and kneeling down the train of her dress trailing out across the rosy carpet her head bowed began undoing the frogs of the childs fur pelisse pray understand she said still sternly mr savages presence or absence is a matter which in no degree affects my actions while in the pause which followed adrians voice harsh from his effort to make it sound quite disengaged and natural asserted itself forcibly yes he was saying colonel rentoul haigyou cannot surely have been so heartless as to have forgotten his existence dear miss beauchamp when he retains such enthusiastic memories of you and of the brilliancy of your conversation rentoul haig rentoul haig ah to be sure i have it at last yes certainly in the early eighties at my cousin delamere beauchamps place in midlandshire of course of coursea neat little teaparty subaltern out in camp with some militia regiment in general request for answering questions and running messages and so on qualifying even then as a walking handbook of the english landed and titled gentry he has continued in that line until his genealogical learning has reached truly monumental proportions adrian returned in the same harsh voice it possesses and obsesses him keeping him in a perpetual ferment of apprehension lest he should be called upon to associate with persons of no family in particular in this connection my arrival i fear caused him cruel searchings of heart his mother and my father were hundredth cousins hence alarms should i prove presentable to the funny old gentlemen at the local club or should i compromise him he has hardly marched with the times and pictured methis i learned from his own ingenuous lipsas some longhaired threadbare starveling bohemian straight out of the pages of henri mrger or eugne sue my personal appearance did i rejoice to say reassure him to a certain extent but your name and recollections both of your cousins fine place and of your own conversational powers did much more toward allaying the torment of his social sense he ended indeed by conveying to me that my beloved mothers alien nationality and my beloved fathers profession notwithstanding i was really quite a credit to the united houses of savage and haig are you going again to exclude me are you going to shut the door on me because i have been that which you qualify by the word impertinent ren dax asked softly and sadly as madame st legerthe little girls coat removed and her frilled white skirts straightened outrose proudly to her feet you richly deserve that i should do so she replied ah pardonbut just consider for to be cross with me to repudiate me is so conspicuously useless it only serves to accentuate my faultsalways supposing i really have any i am controlled i am led by kindness and i possess most engaging qualities in the interests of all concerned you should encourage the display of those qualities pray do not be severe with m dax any more little bette put in prettily and busily you have perhaps dear mamma been so on my account therefore it is for me to plead with you madame st legers expression softened the tadpole his big overdeveloped brain and puny body touched the springs of maternal compassion in her somehow she glanced at him surely she had exaggerated the disturbing influences which could be exercised by so quaint and relatively insignificant a creature then stooping down she took little bette up in her arms smiling her figure finely poised both in lifting and bearing the weight of that graceful burden in an ecstasy of affection the child snuggled against her cheek to cheek i am no longer afraid of his little walkingcane bette murmured in a confidential whisper that was a silly dream i assure you i shall not allow it to trouble me should it repeat itself so i entreat you mamma tell m dax he may come here again and play with me and my little friends as he used to do gabrielles smile sweetened to a tender merriment with her child pressed close against her thus she felt so satisfied so secure in the strong pure joys of her motherhood that she gave caution the slip so safeguarded what she asked herself could disquiet her soul or harm her ren dax was right moreover in saying he possessed engaging qualitiesthough it mightnt be the best taste in the world that he himself should announce the fact what a good work then to nurture those qualities and by keeping them in play strengthen and redeem all that was best in the young mans complex and wayward nature a quite missionary spirit toward the singular tadpole arose in her and something furtherthough this she did not willingly acknowledgenamely a hot desire to assert the completeness of her personal liberty before witnesses just now present she would conserve her freedom and demonstrate unequivocally to present company that she intended so doing good most precious one she said returning the childs fluttering kisses then since my little daughter wishes it the door shall remain open m dax but here adrian savage partially overhearing the conversation partially divining that purpose of demonstration smitten moreover by madame st legers resolved and exalted aspect was overcome by alarm and distress altogether too acute for further concealment miss beauchamp might wave her long thin arms and pour forth cascades of transparently artificial conversation in the effort to delay his departure but he could bear the position no longer she after all was actuated by motives of social expediency and of friendship only was merely an onlooker at this drama while he was a principal actor in it all his dearest hopes all his future happiness at stake he had reached the limits of moral and emotional endurance his handsome face was drawn and blanched to an unnatural pallor as against his black pointed beard black eyebrows and dark closecropped hair a few moments more and he felt he might be guilty of some irretrievable breach of good manners might make a scene commit some unpardonable folly of speech and action or that just simply he might collapse might faint so then and there he bounded tigerlike so to speak into the open space before the fire where his hostess still stood addressing her rapidly imperatively wholly ignoring her companion ren dax pardon me madame that i interrupt you but i have already as i fear greatly outstayed your patience and will delay no further to bid you goodby my excuse both for coming today and for remaining so long must be that i am here in paris probably for but a few days on the business of the review i may be recalled to england at any moment and it is conceivable in the press of work which demands my attention that i may not have another opportunity of presenting myself to you before i go behold vesuvius in full eruption ren murmured gazing pensively at his hostess the latter had stood little bette down on the seat of the rosecushioned chair she still held the child close one arm round her waist the unaccustomed tones of adrians voice his vehemence and air of unmistakable suffering agitated her was it the price of her independence to hurt a faithful friend so sorely as all this i was unaware you were likely to leave paris again so soon she said i supposed you had returned for good and there is so much that i wished to hear so much that i had promised myself the entertainment of having you recount to me unfortunately the claims of my venerable cousins affairs are inexorable adrian replied with a not very successful attempt at lightness looking her in the eyes while his lips perceptibly shook in death as in life he has proved himself an unscrupulously devouring old tyrant indeed i am quite unable to forecast as yet when i shall escape out of the house of bondage for good mamma dearest little bette whispered politely i like it of course but you will excuse me if i mention that you are squeezing me so very tight and thereupon somehow gabrielles gentler mood evaporated she ceased to be touched by the young mans troubled aspect or to regret her share in the production of that trouble she felt angry though not very certainly with innocent bette mockery supplanted concern in the expression of her beautiful face as she gave her hand to her unhappy lover in time the arrangement of even the richest succession must be terminated when that termination is reached we shall hope to welcome you back mr savageunless of course you have any thought of forming ties which will necessitate your settling permanently in england and before adrian had either time or heart to parry this cruel thrust ren intervened patting him delicately on the back so you are going mon vieux see i will accompany you no noindeed i gladly go with you leaving mademoiselle beauchampwho detests meas she so earnestly desires in possession of the field of battle why should i not go my dear fellow you do not hurry my departure in the least i have accomplished the object of my visit i am restored soothed comforted i have got allall that for the moment i want as the door closed behind the two young men anastasia advanced she readjusted her frisky hat pulled her long gloves up at the elbow cast the heads and tails and feebly dangling paws of her fox furs about her neck and shoulders ma toute belle at the risk of your being angry and requesting me to mind my own business i am constrained to tell you that i fear you are committing a very grave folly she said but madame st leger was engaged in caressing little bette chapter iv in which adrian sets forth in pursuit of the further reason coming from under the portecochre into the street adrian pleading a business appointment as excuse shook off his companion somewhat unceremoniously and hailing the first empty motorcab sped away to the office his review in the rue druoi the rush across the center of paris through the thick of the afternoon traffic with its lively chances of smashing or being smashed served to steady him yet he was still under the empire of considerable emotion when he entered his private room at the office and emile konski his secretary a roundabout pinkcheeked grayheaded alert little man of fifty arose bowing and beaming to relieve him of hat coat and umbrella thanks thanks my good konski he said and now just arrange the copy i have to revise will you kindly and take your own work into the outer office i am rather hurried i will call through to you should i want you perfectly sir the good konski returned obediently but he beamed no more his employer was also the god of his ingenuous idolatry and to leave the private room for the outer office was to leave the sanctuary for the court of the gentiles opportunities of devotion had been limited lately hence banishment became the more grievous once alone adrian sat down before his writingtable the fortnightly chronique of home and foreign politics awaited his revision so did literary and art notices among the latter a critique of ren daxs pictureshow remained to be written adrian having expressed an intention of dealing with it himself he meant to have passed an hour in the galleries after calling upon madame st leger this afternoon but had relinquished his purpose for he desired rightly to divide the word of truth regarding rens eccentric performances and just now for reasons quite independent of their inherent merits or demerits he feared they might stink in his nostrils to a degree subversive of any just exercise of the critical faculty he made an honest effort to settle to work and absorb himself in the affairs of morocco the last new books the last debates in the chamber but the neatly typed words and sentences proved singularly lacking in interest or meaning he read them over and over again only to find them crumble into purposeless units like so much dry sand incapable of cohesion for what matteredso in a crisis is even the cleverest of us dominated by personal feelingwhat mattered the future of morocco for instance though involving possibilities of war to all europe as against the future of himself adrian savage and that future did unquestionably present itself just now as lamentably parlous that he might fail that madame st leger might eventually and finally refuse to marry him had never really seriously entered his head before that he might have to diplomatize to lay long and patient siege to the enchanting and enchanted beleaguered city before it fell he had long ago accepted but that in the end it would most assuredly fall and he rapturously claim it by right of conquest in his triumphant masculine optimism he had never till this afternoon doubted now the doubt did very really present itself and proved a staggering one nor was this all for save during those first few delicious moments of greeting he had been sensible of a sinister element battling against him painfully affecting him yet which he failed to define or to grasp adrian stared at the copy outspread on his blottingpad and its blank unmeaning sentences never before had he realized what a terrible imprisoning stultifying thing it may be to love morocco morocco what in the name of all which makes a mans life worth living did he care about the fate of that forbidding north african coast let it stew in its own barbarous juice all the same his inability to concentrate his attention upon the subject of that disagreeable country served to increase his perturbation and distress thanks to admirable physical health he was accustomed to have his faculties thoroughly and immediately at command and this refusal of his brain to work to order fairly infuriated him there was the critique of ren daxs pictureshow to be written too adrian rose from the table and walked restlessly almost distractedly about the room for where exactly in respect of the resistance of that beloved beleaguered city did ren come in oh that tadpole of perverted genius that perniciously clever tadpole who from childhood he had protected and befriended whose fortunes he had so assiduously pushed and again now as when staring forth blindly from the highset windows of la belle gabrielles thricesacred drawingroom at paris glittering in the sharpedged sunshine adrians whole being cried aloud against the blasphemy of a certain conceivable yet inconceivable combination in a passionate agonized god forbid but verbal protest against that combination however loudvoiced and vehement ranging ineffectually within the narrow confines of his office was a transparently inadequate mode of selfexpression his native impetuosity rendered uncertainty and suspense intolerable to him he must act must make a reconnaissance must discover some means of ascertaining whether anything had occurred during his absence which served to explain the apparently existing situation but here the intrinsic delicacy of the said situation asserted itself since precisely those questions to which an answer is most urgently needed are the questions which a person of fine feeling cannot ask good breeding sensibility a chivalrous regard for the feelings of others are as he reflected at times a quite abominable handicap he sat down once again at the writingtable what should he do at his elbow stood the ebonized upright of the telephone the long green silkcovered wire of it trailing away across the parquet floor to the plug in the wainscot from a man he could not ask advice or information but from a womansurely it was different permissible adrian left off pulling the ends of his upturned mustache and meditated distraction slightly lifted and lessened he looked up an address in the directory and after an at first polite then slightly acrimonious parley with the operator at the exchange got into communication with the person wanted would she be at home tonight after dinner say about eight fortyfive might he call and with multiplied apologies might he depend upon finding her alone to these questions the replies proved satisfactory so that in a degree solaced his thirst for immediate action in a measure appeased and his scattered wits consequently once more fairly at command adrian resolutely turned his attention to the affairs of neglected morocco as to ren daxs exhibition well till tomorrow at all events it must wait ever since he could remember miss beauchamp had occupied the same handsome secondfloor flat in a quiet street just off the parc monceau adrian recalled a visit in company with his mother made to her there at a period when he still wore white frilled drawers and longwaisted holland tunics later during his early schooldays he vaguely recollected a period during which his grandmother rarely mentioned anastasia and then with a suggestive pursing up of the lips and lift of the eyebrows afterward he came to know how for some years miss beauchamps name had been rather conspicuously associated with that of a certain famous hungarian composer resident in paris but the said composer had long since gone the way of all flesh and the question as to whether his and anastasias friendship was or was not strictly platonic in character had long since ceased to interest society other stars rose and set in the musical firmament other scandals real or imaginary offered food for discussion to those greedy of such flyblown provender miss beauchamp meanwhile had become an institution was receivedas the phrase goeseverywhere report declared her rich her generosity to young musicians artists and literati was unquestionably large to the verge of prodigality the aspect of her domicile when he entered it this evening struck adrian as much the same now as on that longago visit with his mother the suite of livingrooms was lofty having coved and painted ceilings captivating to his childish fancy the rooms opened one from another in a sequence of three the two first both somewhat encumbered with furniture pictures and bricbracof very varying value and meritwere dimly lighted and vacant places of silence and shadows the atmosphere of them impregnated with a scent of cedar and sandal wood from the third the doorway of which was masked by thick curtains of oriental embroidery came the sound of a grand piano played and in masterly fashion by a mans hands adrian stopped abruptly turning to the elderly maid miss beauchamp informed me she would be alone he said mademoiselle is alone the maid answered she gave instructions no one was to be admitted save monsieur thanksi will not detain you i will announce myself adrian said he crossed the second and larger room threading his way in and out of a perfect archipelago of furniture and held one curtain partially aside while the purpose of his visit and the smart of his own distractions alike were merged in a sensation of curiosity and surprise miss beauchamp sat at a grand piano placed in the middle of the bare polished floor at right angles to the doorway adrian saw her face and highshouldered highwaisted figure in profile she wore a cinnamoncolored teagown opening over an underdress of copper sequinsewn net a veritable pagoda of fiery curls crowned her head yet though thin and bony hers were the mans hands which compelled such rich forcible music from the piano making it speak declaim sing plead touch tragedy triumphantly affirm in this so very convincing a manner the method and mind of the player in their largeness of conception and fearless security of execution held the young man captive raising his whole attitude and outlook to a nobler plane the music indeed carried his imagination up to regions heroic he was in no haste to have it cease he waited therefore when the final chords were struck anastasia beauchamp raising her hands from the keyboard rested the tips of her fingers upon the edge of the empty musicdesk and sat motionless absorbed in thought then as the seconds passed adrians position became in his opinion equivocal courtesy demanding that he should either make his presence known or withdraw he chose the former alternative and taking a step forward let the curtain fall into place behind him imperiously with a lift of the chin miss beauchamp turned her head and looked full at him and for a moment the young man was fairly taken aback for setting of flaming pagoda and frisky teagown notwithstanding he beheld a countenance no longer bizarre that of an accredited jester but sibylline that of a woman who in respect of certain departments of human knowledge has touched ultimate wisdom so that in respect of those departments life has no further secrets to reveal here was something outpacing the province of adrians selfconfident young masculine attainment and it was to his credit that he instantly recognized this accepting it with quickwitted and intuitive sympathy forgive me if i have presumed upon your indulgence dear lady he said advancing with a disarming air of admiration and modesty by remaining here unannounced i could not permit any interruption of your wonderful playing it would have amounted to profanity your art is sublime is so altogether impressively great but oh why he added as the sibylline countenance softened somewhat have you elected to let me to let your many friends remain in ignorance why have you deprived us all of the joy of your superb musical gift because that gift served its turn very fully many years ago when you my dear savage were little more than a baby she answered since then i have felt at liberty to regard my playing as a trifle of private property which i might keep to and for myself as she spoke miss beauchamp rose from her seat at the piano and began replacing a multiplicity of bracelets and rings laid aside during the performance as we grow older we most of us are disposed to practise such reservations i suppose whether openly acknowledged or not she continued they may take their rise in inclinations of a sentimental avaricious or penitential nature but however divergent their cause their object is identicalnamely to keep intact ones individuality menaced by the disintegrating wear and tear of outward things the tendency of the modern world is to render one invertebrate to pound ones character and opinions into a pulp in selfdefense one is forced to reserve and to cultivate some hidden garden wherein ones poor battered individual me may walk in assuaging solitude and recollection especiallyshe looked bravely at adrian through the shaded light while her longarmed ungainly rustygold figure and strangely wise face surmounted by that flaming topknot appeared to him more than ever impressiveespecially perhaps is this the case if that garden once representedas my music possibly once dida garden of paradise in which one did not walk altogether solitary but come you want to speak to me let us go into the drawingroom and have our talk there let us talk by all means adrian put in quickly but let it be here please this room is sympatheticfull of splendid echoes good for the soul anastasias expression softened yet more that is charmingly said we will stay here since you wish it the sofa yes this is my cornerthanks and now to be quite frank with you understand that i had lost count of time and you were inordinately punctual or you wouldnt have caught me making music and understand further that had i not been unusually moved by something which occurred this afternoon i should not have made music at all i rarely walk in the hidden garden now as one grows older one has to economize ones emotions they are too tiring liable to endanger ones sleep afterward but this evening circumstances associations were too strong for me the garden called to me andi walked chapter v with deborah under an oak in the parc monceau miss beauchamp leaned back against the piledup sofa cushions shading her eyes with her left hand and that hand must have been a little unsteady since adrian heard the bracelets upon her wrist rattle and clink shall i tell you what the something was which so moved me she asked unless i am greatly mistaken it is the main cause of our present interview so that to speak of it may help to make that interview easier for us both pray tell me adrian felt curious as to what should follow but his curiosity was tempered by deepening respect it comes to this then my dear young man i think she said for those who have once been acquainted with true lovei am not speaking of mere sexual passion still less of silly flirtations or wanton amorettesthose who have once known that uniquely beautiful and illuminating condition can neither forget nor mistake it they carry an infallible touchstone in their own eyes and ears and hearts it is my privilege to carry such a touchstone and this afternoonthere there dont wince quite quite reverently and gently i put my finger on the facti beheld true love again but true love tormented and far from happy wasnt it so yes adrian replied with a touch of bitterness it was and that brought certain events and experiencesyour dear mothers sympathy and friendship among themso vividly before me that i could only come home here to this practically deserted room and make music as long ago when another man another true lover sat where you now sit do you follow me adrians heart was somewhat full he bowed his head in silent assent the ice is satisfactorily broken then i am an old woman now many people i dont doubt describe me as a flighty prankish old spinster who apes departed youth in a highly ridiculous manner she no longer shaded her eyes with her hand but looked full at adrian through the quiet light smilinghalf sibyl half jester but as he felt wholly wise wholly kind such criticisms matter to me rather less than nothing she continued since the hidden garden knows the why and wherefore of all that and more besides and now my dear boy i have said enough i think to show you that you can unburden yourself without reserve or hesitation you will not speak to me of an undiscovered country but just then adrian felt it difficult to speak coming to this woman he had found so much more than he had asked for or expectednamely a finding of high romance of almost reckless generosity which made him feel humble feel indeed quite quaintly ignorant and inexperienced it followed that when he did speak he did so in childlike fashion protesting his innocence as though needing to disarm censure believe me i have not acted unworthily he said from the first i was charmed i was enthralled but i made every effort to restrain myself even in thought i was loyal to poor st leger i did my best to conceal my admirationi kept away as much as i could without discourtesy you see her very perfection is in a sense her safeguard for how inconceivably vile to endanger the peace of mind of so adorable a creature by any hint any suggestion it is only since st legers death that i yes yes i take all that for granted anastasia broke in doesnt it stand to reason since we are talking of true love and adrian could not forbear to smile notwithstanding his humbled condition the touch was so deliciously feminine in its assumption and nonlogic unless by chance she was laughing at him out of her larger wisdom possibly she was well she could do nothing but right anyhowso he didnt care whereupon he proceeded to pour forth the history of his affection in all its phases from its first inception to the existing moment with dramatic fervor spreading abroad his hands descriptively while the sentences galloped with increasing velocity and the mellow baritone voice rose and fell ah and can you not conceive it after that dismal time in england burying the dead contending with all manner of tiresomenesses with narrowminded overstrenuous overeducated women and menye gods such mento come back to see her was like coming from some underground cavern into the sunshine she received me exquisitely i tasted ecstasy i was transported by hope then abruptly her manner changed and that change did not appear to me spontaneous but calculatedas though in obedience to some alien influence she unwillingly put a constraint upon herself since then i have reconstituted the scene repeatedly my poor dear boy anastasia murmured yes repeatedly repeatedly i try to convince myself that her change of manner was unwilling not the result of caprice madame st leger is not capricious i am sure of it her nature at bottom is serious she reasons and obeys reason but in this case what reason not dislike of me no no my mind refuses such an explanation of her conduct it would be too horrible too desolating isnt there another rather obvious explanation of madame st legers attitudethe fear of liking you a little too much but why should she fear to like me poor adrian cried i am no devouring monster i have some talent sufficient means and no concealed vices and there the thought of ren dax invaded him scorching him with positively rampant jealousy and repulsion for could this which he had just asserted regarding himself be asserted with equal truth regarding the tadpole of genius he knew very well it could not still even so he shrank from the rle of treacherous friend or detractor she can be gracious enough to others he contented himself by saying gazing at his hostess meanwhile his expression altogether orphaned and pathetic dangerously gracious and that is why i did all in my power to delay your departure this afternoon although i knew perfectly well you were on the rack but dear god in heaven he broke out incoherently burying his face in both hands you cannot imply you cannot intend to convey to me your belief that gabrielle st leger contemplates marrying that libelous little horror m dax never in life adrian got up and walked unsteadilyfor indeed the floor seemed to shift and lurch beneath his feetacross the room without the faintest conception of what he was looking at he minutely examined a landscape hanging upon the opposite wall he also blew his nose and wiped his eyes while anastasia beauchamp her jaw set leaning back against the sofa cushions very actually and poignantly walked in that hidden garden of hersonce a garden of eden and not an adamless onewrapped about by remembrance after a time the young man came back and sat down beside her his face was white and his eyes were luminous most dear and kind friend forgive me he said very gently i have climbed giddy pinnacles of rapture and tumbled off themplopinto blackest morasses of despair today and my nerves have suffered ah it has got you she returned im not a bit sorry for you on the contrary i congratulate you for you are very handsomely and hopelessly in love adrian nodded assent pushing up the ends of his mustache with a twist of his fingers and smiling yes yes indeed i know he said it is a thing for which to be immeasurably thankful yet all the same it has its little hours of inconvenience as i have today discovered it can hold the field to the exclusion of all else and that with a quite demoralizing intensity making one feel murderous toward ones oldest friends and in respect of ones work no better than a driveling idiot such are inevitable symptoms of the blessed state i still congratulate you but you admit at least that they are practically extremely impeding and so dear mademoiselle you whom my mother loved and who loved my mother you who have done so much to help and comfort me in the last halfhourwill you do something more i suppose i shall anastasia answered with a laugh which was against herself rather than against him i seem to be pretty thoroughly committed to this business forwell for two peoples sakes perhaps yes for her sake alsofor hers as well as mine adrian cried impetuously those few words are beautifully full of encouragement for see here he went on in some ways i am just simply an obstinate pigheaded englishman you permit me to speak quite freely loosing her i cannot console myself elsewhere it is not merely a wife that i want having reached the age when a man should range himself a wellbred healthy and generally unexceptionable mother for his children dont imagine that i would not like to make my subscription to humanity in the form of charming babies of course i should still those small people however beguiling are not to the point in this connection i am not in pursuit of a suitable marriage but of la belle gabrielleonly and solely la belle gabriellethat must be conspicuously evident to the meanest intelligence anastasia put in merrily but there unfortunately we run up against the crux of the whole situation for it is only fair to tell you our exquisite young woman is even less in pursuit of a suitable marriage than you yourself are we have had some intimate conversations she and i dont imagine for an instant your name or any other name has been hinted at much less mentioned but she has been good enough to bestow her confidence upon me in as far as she bestows it upon any one fundamentally she is a mysterious creature and thats exactly why i suppose one finds her so endlessly interesting and from those conversations i gather her mind is set on things quite other than marriage ah just heavenand what things then poor adrian exclaimed distraction again threatening him she would i think have very great difficulty in telling you here distraction did more than threaten it jumped on him so that in his agitation he positively bounced balllike upon the seat of the sofa i knew it he cried i was sure of it almost immediately i detected an alien and inimical influence intrude itself between us as i have already told you and battle against me and this was the more detestable to me because i felt powerless to combat it being ignorant whence it came and what its nature actually was miss beauchamp looked at him indulgently and he distraction notwithstanding perceived that her countenance once more had grown sibylline this served sensibly to quiet and steady him i fancy that influence comes from very deep and very far she said a woman of so much temperament and so much intelligence as gabrielle st leger must of necessity be the child of the age in which she lives in touch with the spirit of it her eyes are turned toward the future and the strange unrestful wind the wind of modernity which blows from out the future is upon her face this is the influence you have to battle against my dear young man i am afraid nothing less than the spirit of the age the spirit of modernity you have your work cut out for you to combat it successfully will beto put it vulgarlya mighty tough job like king david of old id rather fall into the hands of god than into those of man adrian returned with rather rueful humor is one so very sure they are the hands of the almighty too often one has reason to suspect they belong to exactly the opposite personthe inspirernamely of so many of your friend m ren daxs unpardonable caricatures but there she added i dont want to give place to prejudice though whether modernity is veritably the highroad to the state of human earthly felicity its exponents so confidentlyand truculentlypredict or not rather to some appalling and final catastrophe some armageddon and twilight of the gods appears to me in the existing stage of its evolution open to the liveliest question fortunately at my time of life one is free to stand aside and look on passively awaiting the event without taking part in the production of it but with madame st leger as with yourself it is different you are on the active list whether you like or not you are bound to participate in the production of the eventand she at least is by no means unwilling to do so but how chre mademoiselle but how adrian questioned after a fashion you can hardly be expected to indorse enthusiastically miss beauchamp shaded her eyes with her left hand again while the many bracelets slipping up her thin wrist clinked and rattled see here my dear savage she said among all the destructions and reconstructions the changesmany of them nominal rather than real and consequently superfluousof which modernity is made up one change is very real and has i sincerely believe come to stay i mean the widespread change in thought and attitude of my sex toward yours feminism in short in short feminism a little silence followed then you take the dose very nicely anastasia said perhaps i take it so nicely because i am convinced it is innocuous on the other hand perhaps i dont take it at all really i am not certain which he shifted his position planting his elbows on his knees and his chin in the hollow of his hands the deuce the deuce he said softly tapping one longtoed boot meditatively upon the floor miss beauchamp watched him amused observant making no comment i am sorry he went on presently its all moonshine of course natures too strong for them in the end they must come into line moonshine has often proved a very dangerous because so very intangible an enemy and the end promises to be far off yes i am sorry adrian repeated very sorry we were over in england i could understand women there have an excuse for revolt all englishmen are pedants even in their games even in their sport they have been called a nation of shopkeepers they might with equal truth be called a nation of schoolmasters not because they desire to impart knowledge but because they crave to exercise power and prove to themselves their innate superiority by the chastisement of others ah i have witnessed plenty of that in the last month truly they are very disagreeable sons husbands and fathers those middleclass britons the schoolmaster so to speak permanently on top and there are not even enough of them to go round numerically they are inferior and this helps to feed their arrogance and inflame their conceit but even if there were enough they wouldntif i may so express myselfgo round on the contrary they would go in the opposite direction to their own selfish pleasures their clubs their playingfields their interminable football and cricket and golf humhum what about the british flag you waved so vigorously five minutes ago did i forget it then it was a passing aberration i repent and wrap myself once more in the folds of the tricolor most distinctly that is the flag under which a lover of your adorable sex should fight with the gallic cock set symbolic at the top of the flagstaff and why not why not who can do otherwise than behold with approval that smart wellgroomed abundantly amatory i grant you but also abundantly chivalrous fowl his absence is in a sense precisely that with which i quarrel on the other side of the channel it goes to make the revolt of the englishwoman comprehensible her countrymens relation to her is so inartistic so utilitarian so without delicate humor we hear of her freedom from annoyance her personal security but in what do these take their rise simply in her countrymens indifference to herto her emotions her mentality her thousand and one delicate needs elusive and charming necessities if he thinks about her at all it is with the schoolmasters odious design of correcting her faults of improving her the blatant conceit of the animal as if she could be improved as if she were not perfect already but stay there i pause to correct myself the englishwoman is susceptible of improvement and how by being snubbed depressed depreciated grumbled at scolded made to think meanly of herself never a bitshe has suffered generations of that treatment already by being admired reverenced playfully delighted in appreciated encouraged adrian spread abroad his hands with the most amiably persuasive expression and gesture ah believe me dear friend he cried when luther the burly renegade german monk calvin the parchmentdry middleclass picard lawyer and english king hal of grossest memory conspired to depose our blessed lady from her rightful throne in heaven they incidentally went far to depose woman from her rightful throne here upon earth so that small wonder having no eternal universal mother whose aid and patronage she can invoke in hours of perplexity and distress the modern noncatholic woman is constrained to rush around in prisonvans or any other unlovely public vehicle which may come handy invoking the aid of parliamentary suffrage and kindred dreary mechanical forms of protection against the tedious tyrannies of arrogant sullen selfish slowwitted birchrodwielding pedagogic man yes truly as over there i understand i sympathize but here where though we may have tolerated even invented revolution we have at least withstood that most timeserving and inartistic compromise reformationwith an impudent capital letterhere in the patrimony of chantecler enveloped in the folds of the gallant tricolor surely such revolt is unreasonable is out of place for here are we not all feminists every manjack of us chre mademoiselle you know that we are what more then have the members of your adored sex to ask and for the moment anastasia beauchamps usually ready tongue played her false the whirl of words had been somewhat overpowering while through the whirl his good faith was so transparently apparent his argument suggested rather than aggressively pressed home so evidently to himself conclusive that a cogent answer was far from easy to frame what more have they to ask she said presently smiling at him well just those alluring because new untried and intangible satisfactions which the spirit of the age promises so largely and which you my dear savage if youll pardon my saying dont and cant promise at all the spirit of the age now as so often in history will prove a false prophet a charlatan and juggler making large promises which he will fail to redeem adrian declared see do not art nature the cumulative result of human experience combine to discredit his methods and condemn his objects convince gabrielle st leger of that and my thanks and applause will not be wanting i will convince her adrian cried with growing exaltation i will convince her i devote my life to that purpose to that end and thereupon a certain solemnity seemed to descend upon and diffuse itself through the quiet lofty room affecting both speaker and listener causing them to sit silent as though in hushed suspense awaiting the sensible ratification of some serious engagement entered into some binding oath taken in the stillness faint fugitive echoes reached them of the palpitating life and movement of the city outside the effect was arresting to adrian it seemed as though he stood on the extreme edge the crumbling treacherous verge of some momentous episode in which he was foredoomed to play a part but a part alien to his desires and defiant of his control whileand this touched him with intimate though halfashamed shrinking and repudiationnot gabrielle st leger but joanna smyrthwaite appeared to stand beside him imploring rescue and safety upon that treacherously crumbling verge his sense of her presence was so acute so overmastering in its intensity that he felt in an instant more he should hear her flat colorless voice and be compelledhow unwillinglyto meet the fixed scrutiny of her pale insatiable eyes then startling in its suddenness as the ping of a riflebullet came a very different sound to that of joannas toneless voice close at hand for with a wrenching twang and thin piercing longdrawn vibration which shuddered through the air shuddered through every object in the room strangely setting in motion that pervasive scent of cedar and sandalwood a string of the piano broke miss beauchamp uttered an angry yet smothered cry as one who receives and resents an unexpected hurt and adrian alarmed agitated hardly understanding what had actually occurred turning to her perceived that her countenance again had changed now it was that neither of sibyl nor of jester but vivid keen with fight yet even as he looked it grew gray griefsmitten immeasurably frighteningly old natural pity and some inherited instinct of healing made the young man lean toward her and take her hand in his holding and chafing it while his fingertips sought and found the little space between the sinews of the wrist where the tides of life ebb and flow her pulse was barely perceptible intermittent weak as a thread adrian took the other passive hand and chafing both used this contact as a conduit along which to transmit some of his own fine vitality his act of willing this transmission was conscious determined his concentration of purpose great so that presently while he watched her the grayness lifted her lips regained their normal color her pulse steadied and strengthened and her face filled out resuming its natural contours then as she moved sat upright smiling an unusual softness in her expression dont attempt to speak yet he said still busy with and somewhat excited by his work of restoration rest a little i have been a shameless egoist this evening i have talked too much have made too heavy a demand upon your sympathies and so have exhausted you whatever you may have taken you have more than paid back she answered she was toucheda nostalgia being upon her for things no longer possible for youth and all the glory and sweetness of youth it is not for nothing that you are the son of a famous physician and of a woman of remarkable imaginative gifts she went on you have la main heureuse lifegiving both to body and spirit this is a power and a great one but now that thanks to you my weakness is passed we will not remain in this room you said it was full of splendid echoes good for the soul it is rather too full of them since ones soul is still weighted with a body i find them oppressive in their suggestion and demand frankly i dare not expose myself to their influence any longer helped by adrian she rose and taking his arm moved slowly toward the doorway sometimes unexpectedly the merciful dimness which holds our eyes is broken up giving place to momentary clearseeing of all which lies beyond and around the commonplace and conventional medium in which we live unless one is rather abnormally constituted that clearseeing is liable to blind rather than to illuminate flesh and blood arent quite equal to it and so with the snapping of the piano string doubtless the causes were simple enoughsome peculiar atmospheric conditions along with the fact that the instrument has been unused for many months still in me it produced one of those fateful instants of clairvoyance i knew it for the signing of a deathwarrant not my own thanks to the kindly ministrations of la main heureuse the signature of that particular warrant is postponed for a while yet nor yours either of that i am convinced i cannot say whose the clearseeing was too rapidly obscured by failing bodily strength i am not talking nonsense this has happened twice before the second time a string broke my brothers death followed within the year and the first time adrian felt impelled to ask his recent expenditure of willpower had left his nerves in a state of slightly unstable equilibrium which rendered him highly impressionable the first time miss beauchamp repeated lifting her hand from his arm the death of that other true lover who listened here to my playing of the friend who walked with me in the hidden garden followed the breaking of the first string adrian stepped forward and held aside the embroidered curtain letting her pass into the drawingroom here the air was lighter the moral and emotional atmosphere as it seemed to him lighter likewise he was aware of a relaxation of mental tension and a deadening of sensation which he at once welcomed and regretted he waited a few seconds until he was sure that in his own case too any disquieting tendency to clairvoyance was over and the conventional and commonplace had fairly come back miss beauchamp passed on into the first room of the suite here the lights were turned on and he found her seated at a little suppertable vivacious accentuated in aspect and manner flaming pagoda of curls and frisky cinnamoncolored sequinsewn teagown once again very much in evidence but these things no longer jarred on him he could view them in their true perspective as the masquerade makeup with which a proud woman electedin selfdefenseto disguise too deep a knowledge too sensitive a nature and too passionate a heart yes sit down my dear savage she cried sit down eat and drink for really it is about time we both indulged in what are vulgarly called light refreshments we have been surprisingly clever you and i and have rubbed our wits together to the emission of many sparks i am not a bit above restoring wasted tissue in this practical mannernor i trust are you moreover our lengthy discourse notwithstanding i have still five words to say to you for see very soon madame st legers period of mourning will be over she will begin to go into society again alas yes adrian sighed you dont like it probably not you would prefer keeping her like blessed st barbara shut up on the top of her tower i dare say but doesnt it occur to you that there are as insidious dangers on the tower top as in the world belowvisits from the little horror m ren dax for example anyhow she will shortly very certainly descend from the tower for we are neither of us i suppose under the delusion she has buried all her joy of living in poor horace st legers grave i have no violent objection to her not having done so adrian said with becoming gravity that first descent after her long seclusion will be critical she will need protection and advice her mother madame vernois is at hand adrian remarked perhaps rather tentatively yes a sweet person and a devoted mother but a little conspicuously with the outlook and moral standards of a past generation she is at once too charitable and too humbleminded to be a judge of characterone born to follow rather than to leadand though a woman of breeding and position always a provincial she followed professor vernois as long as he was here to follow then she followed her noble and needy relations away in chambry now she follows her beautiful daughter and the daughter in the near future is going to be a mark for the archersmale and female already i have reason to believe that archery practice has begun the sweet timid mother though perplexed and anxious hasnt a notion how to turn those arrows aside miss beauchamp gazed into the shallow depths of her wineglass its an unsavory subject she continued and i agree with you feminism has next to no legitimate excuse for existence here that is just why i imagine it has allied itself with ideas and practices not precisely legitimate it makes its appeal to by no means the most exalted elements of our very mixed human nature ah but adrian broke out in a white heat of anger it is not possible such persons would never presume they have already presumed zlie de gand helped by i dont quite know who though i have my suspicions has approached madame st leger she is crazy to recover lost ground to get herself and her clique reinstated madame st legers beauty brains and her reputationso absolutely unsullied and above suspicionrepresent an immense asset to any cause she may embrace but need she embrace any cause my dear young man miss beauchamp returned smiling rather broadly you had better take it for said once and for all that a beautiful young woman of seven and twenty who is beginning the world afresh after being relieved of a not entirely satisfactory marriage is perfectly certain to embracewellwellsomething if she doesnt embrace somebody presently after a silence anastasia spoke again gently and seriously i am altogether on your side she said but i cannot pretend it is plain sailing for you there is a reserve of enthusiasm in her nature an heroic strain pushing her toward great enterprises it may be she will suffer before she arrives will be led astray will follow delusions her mind is critical rather than creative she is disposed to distrust her instincts and to reason where she had ten thousand times better only feel and as i tell you she looks toward the future the restless wind of it is upon her face alluring exciting her nonoit is not plain sailing for you my dear young man but for heavens sake dont let true love be your undoing seducing you from work from personal achievement in your own admirable world of letters for remember the greater your own success the more you have to offer and the modern woman asks that she requires not merely somebody to whom to give herself but something which shall so satisfy her brain and her ambitions as to make that supreme act of giving worth while anastasia smiled wistfully sadly yes indeed times have changed and the fashion of them mans supremacy is very quaintly threatened for the first time in the history of the human race he finds sex at a discountbut now goodnight my dear savage whenever you think i can help you come you will always be welcome andthis last word at partingdo your possible to keep that little horror away from her in him modernity finds a most malign embodiment farewell chapter vi recording the vigil of a scarlet homunculus and aristides the just the gray lemur sat before the fire in a babys scarletpainted cane chair he kept his knees well apart so that the comfortable warmth given off by the burning logs and bed of glowing ashes might reach his furry concave stomach and the inside of his furry thighs his long ringed tail slipped neatly under the arm of the little scarlet chair lay like a thick gray note of interrogation upon the surface of the black aubusson carpet now and again he leaned his slender smallwaisted body forward grasping the chairarms with his two handswhich resembled a babys leather gloves with fur backs to themand advanced a sensitive inquisitive pointed muzzle toward the blaze his nose being cold his movements were attractive in their composure and restraint for this quadrumanous exile from subtropic madagascan forests was a dignified little personage not in the least addicted as the vulgar phrase has it to giving himself away at first sight the lemur sitting thus before the fire appeared to be the sole inhabitant of the bare whitewalled studio then as the eye became accustomed to the dusky light shed by hanging electric lamps with dark smokedglass shades to them other queer living creatures disclosed their presence at the end of the great room farthest from the door where it narrowed in two oblique angles under high shelving skylights in a glass tanksome five feet by three and about two feet deepset on a square of mosaic pavement goldfish swam lazily to and fro in the center of the tank about the rockwork built up around the jet of a little tinkling fountain small dullhued tortoises with skinny necks and slimy carapaces and blackblotched orangebellied crested tritons crawled while all round the room forming a sort of dado to the height of above five feet ran an arabesque of scenes and figures some lifesize some even colossal some minute and exquisitely finished some blurred and half obliterated in places superimposed sketched one over the other to the production of madly nightmarish effects of heads limbs trunks and features attached divided flung broadcast heaped together in horrible promiscuosity all were drawn boldly showing an astonishing vivacity of line and mastery of attitude and expression in charcoal or red and black chalk or were washed in with the brush in indian ink and light red in the dusky lamplight and scintillating firelight this amazing decoration seemed endowed with life and movement so that shamelessly in unholy mirth hideousness and depravity it stalked and pranced beckoned squirmed and flaunted upon those austerely snowwhite walls for the rest chairs tables easels even the models movable platform were like the carpet dead black two low wide divans upholstered in black brocade stood on either side of the deep outstanding chimneybreast and upon the farther one masked by a redlacquer folding screen amid a huddle of soft black pillows flat on its back a human form reposedbut whether of living man or of cleverly disposed lay figure remained debatable since it was shrouded from head to heel in a black silk resai even the face being covered and its immobility complete on taking leave of anastasia beauchamp adrian savage had found himself in no humor either for work or for sleep his search for the further reason had led him a longer journey than he anticipated and in some of its stages that journey offered disquieting episodes he admitted he was still puzzled still anxious more than ever determined as to the final result yet hardly more clear as to how the result in question might be obtained there were points which needed thinking out but to think them out profitably he must regain his normal attitude of mind and selfpossession so reckoning it useless to go home to his wellfound bachelor apartments in the rue de luniversit he decided to walk till such time as physical exercise had regulated both his bodily and mental circulation it happened to be the moment of the turnout of theaters and other places of entertainment and as the young man made his way down toward the place de lopra the aspect of the town struck him as conspicuously animated and brilliant his eyes still focused to the quiet english atmosphere and landscape were quick to note the contrast to these presented by his existing surroundings he invited impressions looking at the scene sympathetically yet idly as at the pages of a picturebook strong effects of light and color held the ground plan above which the tall manywindowed houses rose as some pale striated cliffface toward the strip of infinitely remote starpierced sky it was sharply cold and through the exciting tumult of the streets he could detect a shrill singing of wind in telegraph and telephone wires and amid the branches of the leafless trees in like manner passing from the material to the moral plane through the accentuated vivacity of the amusementseeking crowd he seemed to detect as so often in parisis not that indeed half the secret of her magic and her charma certain instability and menace a shrill singing of possible social upheaval of revolution always there close at hand awaiting her surely recurrent hour of opportunity to adrian after precedentridden firmly planted middleclass england and the english that effect of instability that shrill singing of social upheaval proved stimulating he breathed it in with conscious enjoyment while negotiating thickly peopled pavements or madly tram and motorrushed crossings for these dear parisians as he told himself alike in mind and in appearance are both individual and individualists with a positive vengeance possessing not only the courage of their physical typesand making for beauty or the reverse the very most of themand the courage of their convictions but the courage of their emotions likewise and how refreshingly many are those emotions how variegated how incalculable how explosive how articulate too ready at a moments notice to justify their existence by the discharge of salvos of impassioned rhetoric if the english might fairly be called a nation of pedants these might with at least equal fairness be called a nation of comedians not in the sense of pretending of intentionally playing a partto that affectation the english were far more addictedbut in the sense of regarding themselves and life from a permanently dramatic standpoint wasnt it worth while to have been away for a time since absence had so heightened his appreciation of racial contrasts and power of recognizing them and there he paused in his pan for on second thoughts were these psychologic determinations so well worth the practical cost of them is gain of the abstract ever worth loss in the concrete his thought turned with impatience to stourmouth to the tower house and its inhabitants and to the loss of precious time which devotion to their affairs had in point of fact caused him resultant appreciation of psychologic phenomena seemed but a meager recompense for such expenditure for this absence had made him lose ground in relation to madame st leger miss beauchamp intimated as much intimated too that while he lost ground others had gained it had done their best to jump his claim so to speak and had in a measure at least succeededtake mademoiselle zlie de gand for example whereupon adrian ceased to take any interest philosophic or otherwise in the wonderful midnight streets and midnight people becoming himself actively even aggressively individualist as he brushed his way through the throng his expression the reverse of urbane and his pace almost headlong for who in the devils name had dared give that muchdiscussed plausible very astute and clever also very much discredited arrivist and novelistzlie de gandan introduction to madame st leger miss beauchamp owned to a suspicion and then yes of course he remembered last year meeting the great zlie at ren daxs studio remembered too how ren had pressed a short story of hers upon him for publication in the review and had sulked for a week afterward whennot without laughterhe had pronounced the said story quite clearly unprintable did ren after all represent the further reason not as aspirant to la belle gabrielles thricesacred hand indeed but as her mental director inciting her to throw in her lot with agitators and extremists feminists futurists and suchlike pestilent personsenemies of marriage and of the family of moral and spiritual authority of all sane canons of art music and literature reckless anarchists in thought and purpose if not through defective courage in actual deed was this what anastasia beauchamp hinted at was it against risk of such abominable stabling of swine in his own particular holy of holiesfor the young mans anger and alarm now thoroughly aroused tended to express themselves in no measured languageshe did her best to warn him again as earlier that day a necessity for immediate and practical action laid hold on him delay became not only intolerable but unpardonable he must know and he must also prevent this campaign of defilement and outrage going further wherefore he bolted into the first empty cab had himself whirled to the boulevard du montparnasse and projected himself bomblike bursting with protest and indignation into ren daxs great dusky whitewalled studio to find in the stillness nothing more pertinent to the matter in hand than the gentle gray lemur sitting in its scarletpainted babys chair before the fire the orangeandblack blotched newts and small ancient tortoises crawling upon the rockwork of the little fountain while in the glass tank the gleaming fishes swam lazily to and fro of the owner of this quaint menagerie no signs were visible but neither rens absence nor the presence of his queer associates held adrians attention more than a few seconds for upon an easel facing him as he entered placed where the light of the hanging lamps fell strongest was a drawing in red chalk which at once fed his anger by its subject and commanded his unqualified admiration by its consummate beauty and art nearly half lifesize the figure poised the head slightly inclined proudly yet lovingly toward the delicious child she carried on her arm gabrielle st leger stepped toward him as on air from off the tall panel of ivorytinted cartridge paper the attitude was precisely that in which he had seen her this afternoon when she told ren dax the door should remain open since little bette wished it the two figures were rendered with a suavity yet precision of treatment a noble assurance of line and faithfulness of detail little short of miraculous considering the time in which the drawing must have been executedyes it was la belle gabrielle to the life and alivehow wonderfully alive the tears came into the young mans eyes so deeply did this counterfeit presentment of her move him and so very deeply did he love her he noted in growing amazement little details even little blemishes dear to his heart as a lover since these differentiated her beauty from that of other beautiful women giving the original the intimate and finely personal note and then anger shook him more sharply than ever for how dare any man save himself note these infinitely precious because exclusively personal touches how dare ren observe still more how dare he record them his offense was rank since to do so constituted an unpardonable liberty a gross intrusion upon her individuality ren knew too much quite too much and for the moment adrian was assailed by a very simple and comprehensive desire to kill him but now a wave of humiliation salt and bitter submerged this unhappy lover for not only was that little devil of a tadpoles drawing a masterpiece in its realization of the outward aspect of gabrielle st leger but of insight into the present workings of her mind and heart had not he apprehended and set forth here with the clarity and force of undeniable genius just all that which anastasia beauchamp had tried to tell himadrian savageabout her what he adrian notwithstanding the greatness of his devotion fumbled over and misinterpreted ren grasped unaided and thus superbly chronicled for here indeed to quote anastasia gabrielles eyes were turned toward the future and the strange unrestful windthe wind of modernitywhich blows from out the future was upon her face with the result that her expression and bearing were exalted a noble going forth to meet fate in them she herself as one consecrated at once the embodiment and exponent of some compelling idea the leader of some momentous movement the elect spokeswoman of a new and tremendous age beholding all which poor adrians spirits descended with most disintegrating velocity into his boots and miserably camped at that abject level for though he might declare and very honestly believe the idea in question the movement in question to be so much moonshine and the spirit of the age a rank impostor how did he propose to convince madame st leger of that the inquiry brought him up as against a brick wall yes miss beauchamp had been rather cruelly right when she told him his work was cut out for him and would prove a mighty tough job for what calmly considered had he after all to offer as against those alluring and immense perspectivesreally when he came to ask himself it made him blushonly an agreeable fairly talented and wellconditioned young manthat was all and marriagemarriage an old story to gabrielle a commonplace affair about which she already knew everything that there is to know of course she didnt know everything about it he went on plucking up a little spirit again hers had been a marriage of convenience a marriage of reason poor horace was by a whole generation her senior whereas in the present case it all would be so differenta great and exclusive passion et cetera et cetera he would have liked to wax eloquent descanting upon that difference and its resultant illuminating values but his eloquence stuck in his throat somehow himself as a husbandhumor compelled him to own with a pretty sharp stab of mortification this a rather stale and meager programme as alternative to cloudy splendors of selfconsecration to the mighty purposes of modernity and the spirit of the age she is very beautiful is she not my madonna of the future ren dax asked the question in soft confidential accents he stood at adrians elbow clothed in a scarlet japanese silk smokingsuit upon his neat bare feet he wore a pair of black afghan sandals uttering little loving crooning cries the gray lemur balanced itself upon his shoulders clasping his great domed head with thin furry arms and furrybacked blackpalmed hands the fingertips of which just met upon the center of his forehead i have been watching from behind the screen the effect she produced on you i have given up going to bed you see i wrap myself in blankets and quilts and sleep herewhen i do sleepupon one of the divans it is more artistic it is simpler the bed when you come to consider it is like the umbrella the mark of the bourgeois of the bourgeoise and of all their infected progeny it represents as you may say the battlecry of middleclass civilization the domestic hearth no no the domestic bed how far more scientific and philosophic a definition therefore i abjure itso i was lying there on the divan in meditation i am preparing illustrations for an dition de luxe of les contes drolatiques it is not designed for family reading it will probably be printed in belgium and sold at port said i lie on my back i cover my face thus isolating myself from contemplation of surrounding objects so that my imagination may play freely around those agreeable tales in the midst of my meditation i heard you burst in at first i felt annoyed then i arose silently and watched the effect this portrait produced on you i was rewarded for it knocked the bluster pretty effectually out of you eh mon vieux i saw you droop grow dejected pull your beard wipe your eyes eh and you deserved all that for your manner was offensive this afternoon you treated me disrespectfully have you now come to apologize it would be only decent you should do so but i do not press the point i can afford to be magnanimous since in any case i am even with you my madonna is my revenge i did not come to apologize but to demand explanation adrian began hotly then his tone changed truly he was very unhappy very heavy of heart you are right he added this drawing is your revenge you do not like my drawing on the contrary i find it glorious wonderful and it hurts you yes it hurts me he answered hoarsely backing away i hate it i am so glad ren said sweetly he put his hand behind his scarlet back and tweaked the tip of the lemurs long furry tail affectionately you hear you rejoice with me oh venerable aristides he murmured to which the little creature replied by clasping his head more tightly and making strange coaxing noises but therefor the moment my madonna has done precisely what i asked of her so now let us talk about something else mon vieux something less controversial why not for here after all she is fixed my madonna she cant run away happily we can always return and though she is mine i will permit you to take another look at her sowelldo you remark how i have changed my decorative scheme since you last visited me is it original startling eh that is what i intended again i felt the need to simplify i called for plasterers painters upholsterers when they will be paid i havent a conception but that is a contemptible detail i rushed them i harried them i drove them before me like a flock of geese a troop of asses work i screamed work delay is suffocation to my imagination this transformation must be effected instantly for suddenly color sickened me i comprehended what a fraud what a subterfuge and inanity it is form alone matters alone is permanent and essential color bears to form the same relation which emotion bears to reason which sensation bears to intellect it represents an attitude rather than an entity i recognized it as adventitious accidental unscientific hysterical so i had them all washed out ripped off obliterated my tender tearful blues and greens my caressing pinks my luscious mauves and purples my rapturously bilious sugarsweet yellows all my adorably morbid florescence of putrifaction in neutraltinted semitones and limited my scheme to this harshly symbolic triad see everywhere everywhere black white redthese three always and onlybeating upon my brain feeding my eyes with thoughts of darkness night death the bottomless pit despair iniquity of light day snow the colorless ether virtue the childs blank soul immaculate sterility and then redred the horrid whipperin and huntsman of us all meaning life fire lust pain carnage sex revolution and war scarletlipped scorn and mockerythe raw gaping everbleeding everbreeding wound in short upon the body of the cosmos which we call humanity the young mans affectation of imperturbability for once deserted him he was shaken by the force of his own speech his voice rose vibrating with passion taking on indeed an almost maniacal quality highly distressing to adrian and altogether terrifying to the lemur which moaned audibly and shivered as it clutched at his forehead get down aristides he cried with sudden childish petulance unclasp your hands you scratch you hurt me go back to your little chair i am tired i have worked too hard the back of my head stabs with pain i suffer i suffer so badly he came close to adrian who his nerves too very much on edge still stood before the noble drawing of gabrielle st leger i am not well he said plaintively certainly i have overworked and it is all your fault yet listen mon vieux your affection is necessary to me therefore do not let us quarrel i own you enraged me this afternoon i did not want you just then nor i you adrian returned with some asperity and your manner was at once insufferably brusque and insufferably possessive i could not let it pass i felt it incumbent upon me to administer correction but i would not descend to anything commonplace in the way of chastisement i would lay an ingenious trap for you i came straight home i seated myself here i set up this panel and i drew and drew and drew without pause without food in a tense frenzy of concentration of recollection till i had completed this portrait i was possessed inspired never have i worked with such fury such torment and ecstasy for i had at once to assure myself of your sentiments toward the subject of that picture and to read you a lesson i had to prove to you that i too amount to something which has to be reckoned with that i too have power you have commanding power adrian answered bitterly the power of genius then then ren dax cried since you acknowledge my power will you consent to leave my madonna alone will you consent not to make any further attempt to interfere between her and me to pay court to and marry her the attack in its directness proved for the moment staggering adrian stood his eyes staring his mouth half open actually recovering his breath which seemed fairly knocked out of him by the amazing impudence of this proposition yet wasnt it perfectly in the part wasnt it just exactly the egregious tadpole all over his mind swung back instinctively to scenes of years ago in playground classroom dormitory whenwhile though himself exasperatedhe had intervened to protect ren a boy brilliant as he was infuriating from the consequences of some colossal impertinence in word or deed and that swing back to recollection of their schooldays produced in adrian a salutary lessening of nervous excitement restoring his selfconfidence focusing his outlook both on events and persons to a normal perspective so that i may leave the stage conveniently clear for you mon petit he inquired quite goodtemperedly no i am sorry but im afraid i cannot consent to do anything of the kind and then he moved away across the studio leaving the egregious tadpole to digest his refusal for he did not want to quarrel either far from it that instinctive throwback into their schoolboy friendship brought home to him how very much attached to this wayward being he actually was so that of all things he wanted to avoid a quarrel if such avoidance were consonant with restraint of rens influence in a certain dear direction and development of his own nothing will turn me from my purpose mon petit he said gently even gaily over his shoulder nothingmake sure of thatnothing nobody past present or to come he proceeded with slightly ostentatious composure to study the dado of pictured figures rioting along the surface of the white distempered walls he had delivered his ultimatum very soon he meant to depart for it was no use attempting to hold further intercourse with ren tonight once you brought him up short like this for a greater or lesser period he was certain to sulk it was wisest to let him have his sulk out andhis eyes growing accustomed to the dusky lightgood heavens how superbly clever how grossly humorous those pictured figures were was there any draftsman living who could compare with ren dax no decidedly he didnt want to quarrel with the creature he only wanted to prevent his confusing certain issues and doing harm yet as he passed from group to group from one outrageous witticism to another the difficulty of maintaining an equable attitude increased upon him for it was hateful to remember that the same hand and brain which had projected that heroic portrait of madame st leger was responsible for these indecencies as well looking at some of these thinking of that he could have found it in his heart he feared to take master ren by the throat and put an end to his drawing for ever so atrocious a profanity did such coexistence such in a sense correlation appear and then moving on again he started and drew back in absolute consternation for there right in front of him covering the wall for a space of two yards or more he came on a series of sketchessome dashed in in charcoal some carefully finished in red and black chalkof joanna smyrthwaitejoanna arrayed in mans clothing a slovenly ragged jacket suit sagging from her thin limbs and angular shoulders she bareheaded moreover her hair cropped her face telling of drink and dissipation looselipped repulsive to the point of disgust in its weakness and profligate misery her attitudes degraded almost bestial as she cringed on all fours or lay heaped together like so much shot rubbish adrian put his hands over his eyes looked again turned indignantly to demand an answer to this hideous riddle but his host had disappeared only the gray lemur sat in its scarletpainted babys chair before the fire and from off the tall white panel gabrielle st leger carrying her child on her arm stepped forth to meet the future while the unrestful wind which blows from out the futurethe fateful wind of modernityplayed upon her beloved face iii the other side chapter i recording a brave mans effort to cultivate his private garden joseph challoner telephoned up to heatherleigh from his office in stourmouth that being detained by business he should dine in town tonight this seemed to him the safest way to manage it since you never could be quite sure how far your servants didnt shadow you he had put off dealing with the matter in question from day to day and week to week because in plain english he funked it true this was not his first experience of the kind but looking back upon othernever mind about the exact number of themother experiences of like nature this struck him as very much the most unpleasant of the lot his own moral and social standpoint had changed there perhapshe hoped sowas the reason in more senses than one he had come up higher so that anything even distantly approaching scandal was actively alarming to him giving himas he expressed itthe gooseskin all over yet funk or no funk the thing had to be seen to further shillyshallying was not permissible the byelection for the baughurst park ward vacant through the impending retirement of mr pottinger was imminent challoner had offered himself as a candidate the seat was well worth gaining since the baughurst park ward was the richest and in many respects most influential in the borough to represent it was with a little adroit manipulation to control a very large amount of capital available for public purposes moreover in a year or so it must inevitably lead to the mayoralty and joseph challoner fully intended one of these days to be mayor of stourmouth not only did the mayoralty in itself confer much authority and local distinction but it offered collateral opportunities of selfadvancement upon these challoner had long fixed his thoughts so that already he had fully considered what course of action in the present promised the most profitable line of investment in view of that coveted future should he push the construction of the new undercliff drive for instance but as he argued at most you could invite a duke or fieldmarshal to perform the opening ceremonythe latter for choice since it gives legitimate excuse for the military display always productive of enthusiasm in a conspicuously noncombatant population such as that of stourmouth unfortunately dukes and fieldmarshals though very useful when socially speaking you could not get anything better were not altogether up to challoners requirements he aspired he in fact languished to entertain royalty but undercliff drives were no use in that connection only justifying a little patriotic beating of drums to the tune of coast defense and incidental trottingout of the hardworked german invasion bogey the first came too near party politics the second too near family relationships to be acceptable to the highest in the land no as he very well saw you must sail on some other tack cloaking your designs with the muchcovering mantle of charity if you proposed successfully to exploit princes and after all what simpler was not stourmouth renowned as a health resort and are not hospitals the accredited highroad to royal favor a hospital evidently and since it is always safest to specializethat enables you to make play with scareinducing statistics and impressive scientific formul flavoring them here and there with the sentimental anecdotal noteclearly a hospital for the cure of tuberculosisnothing just now more fashionable nothing more popular really it suited him to a tee for had not his own poor little wife fallen a victim to the fell disease in question and had not hehere challoner just managed not to put his tongue in his cheekhad not he remained through all these long long years affectingly faithful to her memory therefore not only upon the platform but during the private pocketpickings he projected among the wealthy residents of the baughurst park ward he could give a personal turn to his appeal by alluding feelingly to the cutting short of his own early married happiness to the pathetic wreck of loves young dream all through the operation of that terrible scourge consumption yes quite undoubtedly tuberculosis was as he put it the ticket he remembered with a movement of active gratitude toward his makeror was it perhaps toward that quite other deity the god of chance so ardently worshiped by all arriviststhe big stretch of common wytch heath just beyond the new west stourmouth cemetery recently thrown on the market and certain to go at a low figure lying so high and dry the air up there must be remarkably bracingfit to cut you in two indeed when the wind was northerly clearly it was a crying shame to waste so much salubrity upon the dead true stourmouth already bristled with sanatoria of sorts but these were for the most part defective in construction or obsolete in equipment whereas his challoners new royal hospital should be absolutely up to date furnished regardless of expense in accordance with the latest costly fad of the latest pathological faddist no extravagance should be debarred while incidentally handsome measure of commissions and perquisites should be winked at so as to keep the staff both above and below stairs in good humor salaries must be on the same extensive scale as the rest later when a certain personal end had been gained it would be plenty time enough to placate protesting subscribers by discovering reprehensible waste and preaching reform and retrenchment finally royalty should be humbly prayed to declare the recordbreaking institution open during his challoners tenure of office he licked his lips not figuratively but literally thinking of it our publicspirited and philanthropic mayor to whose generous expenditure of both time and money combined with his untiring zeal in the service of his suffering fellowcreatures we are mainly indebted for the inception and completion of this truly magnificent charity et cetera et cetera let them pile on the butter bless themhe could put up with any amount of that kind of bastinguntil royalty impressed alike by the magnitude of his altruistic labors and touched by the tragedy of his early sorrowfor the sentimental personal chord should here be struck again softlywould feel constrained to bestow honors on so deeply tried and meritorious a subject sir joseph challonerhe turned the delicious phrase over in his mouth as a small boy turns a succulent lollipop to get the full value and sweetness out of it he amplified the luscious morsel almost blushingly sir joseph and lady challonernot the poor little first wife well understood with the fatal stamp of disease and still more fatal stamp of her fathers shop upon her reminiscences of whose premature demise had contributed so tactfully to the realization of his present splendor but the second the coming wife in the serious courting of whom he thirsted to embark immediately since she offered such conspicuous contrast to the said poor little first one both in solid fortune and social opportunity only unluckily before these bright unworldly dreams could even approximately be translated into fact there was a nasty awkward bit of rooting up and clearing out to be done in so to speak challoners own private back garden and it was with a view to effecting such clearance quietly unobserved and undisturbed that he elected tonight to eat a thirdrate dinner at an obscure commercial tavern in stourmouth where recognition was improbable rather than a firstrate one in his own comfortable diningroom at heatherleigh after the consummation of that unattractive meal he took a tram up from the square to the top of hill street where this joins the barryport road about threequarters of a mile short of baughurst park and the county gates here alighting he turned into the maze of roads bordered by villas and small lodginghouses interspersed with undeveloped plots of building land which extends from the left of the barryport road to the edge of the west cliff the late march evening was fine and keen and challoner whose large frame cried out for exercise after a long day of sedentary employment would have relished the walk in the moist salt air had it not been for that disagreeable bit of backgarden clearing work looming up as the ultimate purpose of it in the recesses of his mind moreover lurked an uneasy suspicion that he would really be very much less of a cur if he felt a good deal more of one this made him savage since it appeared a reflection upon the purity of his motives and the solid worth of his character he stated the case to himself as he had stated it any number of times already and found it a convincingly clear one still that irritating suspicion of insufficient selfdisgust continued to haunt him he ran through the wellworn arguments again pleading the justice of his own cause to his own conscience for when all is said and done how can any man possessing an average allowance of susceptibility resist a pretty showy woman if she throws herself at his head and mrs gwynnie had very much thrown herself at his head pertinaciously coaxed admired and flattered him whatever had taken place was more than half her doingbefore god it was he might have been weak might have been a confounded fool even but then hadnt every man worth the name a soft side to him take all your famous heroes of historywerent there funny little tales about every one of them from the royal psalmist downward if he challoner had been a fool he could quote plenty of examples of that particular style of folly among the most aristocratic company and looking at the actual facts wasnt the woman most to blame hadnt she run after him just all she knew how hadnt she subjected him to a veritable persecution but now challoner found himself at the turn into silver chine road the long yellowgray web of which meandered away through the twilight small detached houses set in little gardens ranged on either side of it shoulder to shoulder the walls of them shrouded by creepers and their lower windowswhere lights glowed faintly through muslin curtains and drawn blindsmasked by luxuriant growth of arbutus escallonia euonymus myrtle and bay now and again a solitary scotch fir relic of the former moorland raised its dense crown velvet black against the sulphurstained crystal of the western sky stourmouth is nothing if not wellgroomed and neat so that roads fences lawns and houses looked brushed up polished and dusted as some showcase exhibit only a misanthropic imagination could suppose questionable doings or primitive passions sheltering behind those tidy cleanpinafored selfrespecting gray and red housefronts in their setting of trim turf beds of justopening snowdrops and crocuses and fragrant glossyleaved shrubs joseph challoner drew up and stood in large vexation and worry contemplating the pleasant welltodo prospect the alert calm of an early spring evening held the whole scene faintly in the distance he could hear a longdrawn murmur of wind in the baughurst woods and the rhythmic plunge of the sea and he was aware thatstill to employ his own not very graceful vernacularhe funked the business in hand consciously and very thoroughly funked it he had all the mind in the world to retrace his steps board the tram again and get home to heatherleigh he took off his hat hoping the chill moist air might cool his tall brickdustred face and bare head while he fenced thus grimly with indecision for it had come to thathe had grown so ignominiously chickenliveredhad he the pluck to go on or should he throw up the game let the whole show slide in shortbaughurst park ward recordbreaking hospital probable mayoralty possible knighthood wealthy second wife whose standing and ample fortune would lift him to the top of the best society stourmouth could offerand all for the very inadequate reason that a flimsy flirtatious impecunious little angloindian widow had elected to throw her bonnet over the windmills for his sake to challoner it seemed hard beastly hard he should be placed in such a fix how could he be certain moreover that it was for his sake and not mainly for her own she had sent that precious bit of millinery flying what assurance had he that it wasnt a putup job to entangle and land him not for love of him himself of what he was but for love of what hed got challoner dragged his handkerchief out of his shirtcuff and wiped his forehead of all his amatory experiences this one did without question take the cake for allround inconvenience and exasperation of course he went on again picking up the thread of the argument if he could be convinced could believe in the sincerity of her affection be certain it was he himself whom she really loved and wanted not just heatherleigh and a decent income that would make just all the difference put matters on an absolutely different footing and radically alter his feeling toward her and then with a horselaugh he spat on the ground regardless of the stourmouth borough councils bylaw prohibiting expectoration in a public place under penalty of a fine not exceeding twenty shillings the lie was so transparent the hypocrisy so glaring that although no stickler for truth where the truth told against him he was obliged to rid himself of this particular violation of it in some open and practical manner for he knew perfectly well that her love whether for the man or merely for his possessions in no appreciable degree affected the question not doubt as to the quality or object of mrs gwynnies affections but rank personal cowardice in face of the situation kept him standing here in this contemptible attitude of indecision amid the chill sweetness of the spring dusk yet that coarse outward repudiation of inward deceit if failing to make him a better man morally had emotionally and even physically a beneficial effect it braced him somehow so that he squared his shoulders while his native bullying pluck his capacity of cynically measuring himself against fact and taking the risks of the duel revived in him for this shillyshallying didnt pay and it wasnt like him every man has a soft side to himgranted but hed be hung if he was going to let himself turn a softie all over the smart of his own gibes stimulated him wonderfully so that in the pride of his recovered strength of mind and consciousness of his brawny strength of body he found himself growing almost sentimentally sorry for the fate of his puny adversary poor little soul perhaps she really was in love with himchalloner wiped his face again with a flourish well plenty of people did call him a splendidlooking man all the same shed got to go under she must be rooted up and cleared out he was sorry for its always a nasty thing for a woman to be made to understand she is only a sideshow in a mans life only if he meant to stand for the baughurst park wardand unquestionably he did now mean to do sohis address to the electors must be printed and distributed and his canvass started within the week yes no doubt very very sorry for her still he was bound to make short work with this rooting up and clearing out of poor mrs gwynnie nor did his election supply the only reason against further shillyshally here challoner cleared his throat while the brickdust of his complexion deepened to crimson it was funny how shy the thought of margaret smyrthwaite always turned him but when once the winding up of old montagu smyrthwaites estate was completed he would no longer have a legitimate excuse for dropping in at the tower house at odd hours indulging in nice confidential little chats with margaret in the blue sittingroom or taking a ttette stroll with her around the gardens and through the conservatories miss joanna did not like him he was sure of that she certainly wouldnt give him encouragement so time pressed for the completion of the winding up of the estate could not be delayed much longer montagu smyrthwaite had left his affairs in quite vexatiously good order from challoners point of view thereby obliging the latter to expend much ingenuity in the invention of obstacles to the completion of business his object was to keep adrian savage out of england and away from his cousins as long as possible but the young manwith how much heartiness challoner consigned him and all his works and ways to regions infernalmight grow suspicious and run over from paris just to hasten matters that would not suit challoners little game in the least he must make certain of his standing with margaret before that most unwelcome descent of the enemy for the whole matter of adrian savage had become to him as the proverbial red rag to a bull by its irritating associations it acted very sensibly upon him now causing him to charge down the road headlong with his heavy lunging tread had adrian proved a bad man of business ignorant careless or bungling challoner felt his superiority in other departments might have been more easily stomached but to find this highly polished man of the world as smart a business man as his somewhat unpolished and provincial self rubbed him very shrewdly on the raw when with an eye to a not impossible future he essayed so to jockey affairs as to secure some advantage to margaret smyrthwaite in the disposition of her fathers property adrian invariably detected the attempted small swindle and promptly though politely checkmated it such encounters had occurred more than once and both his own failure and adrians adroitness in disposing of them rankled so much still that challoner walked nearly half the length of silver chine road absorbed in disagreeable remembrance then the name on a gatepost which happened to catch his eye acquainted him with the hardly less disagreeable fact that he neared the end of his journey ferndaleand he went on repeating the names of the houses as he passed them mostly by rote occasionally refreshing his memory where the light permitted by a glance at gate or gatepost ferndale then ambleside the hollies st miguel killarney followed by castlebar the moorings peshawar mon repos clovelly and next after crossing the end of st cuthberts road leicester lodge fairlawn chatsworth ben nevis santander less than a year ago these same names had been to him as milestones on loves pilgrimage each one of which brought him a few steps nearer to a hotly coveted goal now he waxed sarcastic at the expense of their farfetched highflown titles take chatsworth for instancea fortyfivepoundayear house rates and taxes included with at the outside an eighth of an acre of garden to itcould snobbish silliness go much farther but here was robins rest capping the climax in respect of its title by vulgar folly challoners large stiffjointed hands came down roughly on the top bar of the little white gate he waited a few seconds breathing rather stertorously robins restwhy not josephs coat he snarled a coat of many colors convenient that when you happen to want to turn it perhaps now no more squishsquash straight aheadgo in and win and my best wishes to you sir joseph turncoat with that he swung the gate open and tramped up the path to the front door a certain bullying swagger in the carriage of his big person and tall upright head chapter ii a strategic movement which secures victory while simulating retreat mrs spencer the train of her mauve cottonback satin teagown thrown negligently over her arm held aside the strings of the beaded chick letting her guest pass into the inner hall as she moved across to the open door of the much befrilled and bepalmed little drawingroom they rippled back into place behind her with a rattle of cane and tinkle of glass the familiar sound gave challoner who heavily deliberate deposited gloves and hat on the hall table a catch in his throat he found the first sight of mrs gwynnie in her flimsy satin cream lace and rather tired turquoiseblue ribbons upsetting she was a strawcolored insignificantfeatured fairly tall fairly plump fairly graceful uncomfortably smallwaisted woman looking at a distance fiveandtwenty at close quarters nearer fiveandthirty cheaply pretty and effective though slightly washed out and this latter quality or absence of quality in her appearance took hold of challoner now with an appeal of pathos which he resented and made an effort to ignore it did not tend to the improvement of his manners or of his temper since when have you taken to answering the front door yourself he inquired in tones of heavy banter been having the periodic rumpus with the maids again oh no the maids are quite good thank you she answered punctuating her speech with a little meaningless neighing laugh habitual to her im on excellent terms with both of them for a wonder but its the cooks evening out and i gave esther leave to go with her i didnt think we should have any particular use for them again she laughed but didnt you get my note yes i got it right enough challoner said he had followed her into the drawingroom and stood with his hands behind him and his back to the hissing gasfire looking down at his sealbrown frieze trousers the suit was almost new yet the knees showed signs of bagging already this vexed him that is why i am here you said you wanted to see me so i stayed and dined in town to save time and came on just as i was so i perceive she put in with meaning challoner continued to contemplate the knees of his trousers yet he was well aware that her eyes were fixed on another item of his costumenamely his waistcoat crocheted in red and white quarterinch squares and finished with a gray cloth border and flat white horn buttons mrs spencer had worked it for him last year as a christmas present he wished to goodness he had not happened to be wearing it tonight yes he repeated without looking up i got your note right enough but do you know i begin to think i get rather too many of those notes youve fallen into the habit of writing too frequently between ourselves it worries me a lot why she asked he shifted his weight from one foot to the other why because i have some regard for your reputation i imagine i dont care a twopenny damn on my own account of course my backs broad enough to bear the consequences of my own actions even if they are disagreeable but it is quite another matter for you and i must say youre getting very reckless thats not fair by me ive been awfully careful from the first but wheres the use of my taking extensive precautions to shield you if you go and invite gossip like this dont be cross and scold me mrs spencer said archly she had placed herself on the sofa at right angles to the fireplace drawing the train of her teagown aside so as to leave room for a second occupant of this the most solid seat in the room the rest of the furniture ran to wicker chairs colored madras muslin veiling their original cretonne coverings and tables whatnots cabinets and flowerpot stands with mottled brownandbiscuit bamboo frames and plaited straw tops brackets and shelves to them i wont write so often if you really think it is dangerous she added it is dangerous challoner asserted ignoring the invitation to share the sofa think for yourself at heatherleigh there are my servants at the office there are my clerks do you suppose they havent tongues in their mouths or eyes in their heads if that does not constitute danger ill thank you to tell me what does but you forbid me to telephone so how am i to communicate with you unless i write you call so seldom i hardly ever see you now oh come he remonstrated i was here sunday week but thats beatties afternoon at home you know i always give it up to her friends and a whole crowd of them was here sunday weekfred lawley and the busbridge boys and marion chase i didnt get three words with you challoner glanced at her in sharp anxiety fred lawley come up to the scratch yet he asked if you mean has he proposed i am sure i cant tell you i dont know myself i suppose if he had bee would have told me he seems tremendously gone on her but you never can be sure of a man till your engagement has been publicly announced it was challoner who laughed a little this time not quite invariably even then he said his chin settled into the v of the turnedback corners of his high shirtcollar while his eyes returned to contemplation of those vexatiously baggy trousers mrs spencer began to speak but he hulled down her voice by asking rather loudly by the way where is miss beattie oh shes gone over to marychurch to the quartermains they asked her to stop the night because the progressive whist club meets at their house i think those club parties awfully slow but bee wouldnt miss one on any account they dont play for money only prizes china lucky pigs or a black velvet cat homemade with a pink ribbon around its necki know the style challoner returned fred lawleys the attraction i imagine rather than those highclass works of art i dont think hell be there bee said something about his having gone to southampton to join his ship you seem very interested in fred lawley but i told you in my note bee was away tonight very likely you didi really dont remember he replied hastily for he detected or fancied he detected a suggestion in her tone and words eminently unwelcome and embarrassing he felt the brickdust red of his face and neck deepening to crimson and this both angered and alarmed him notwithstanding repudiation of sentiment was the soft side still uppermost that would not do he must buckram himself more resolutely against poor mrs gwynnies fascinations and bring matters to a head at once but that reminds mespeaking of beattie i meanwhat do you want done about the lease of this house it will be up at the end of the half quarter so far mrs spencer had lolled in attitudes of studied ease upon the sofa now she sat bolt upright clasping her small waist with both hands and advancing her bust the little neighing laugh preceded instead of punctuating her speech challoner observed a nervous ring in the quality of it oh well that rests more with you than with me doesnt it of course i hadnt forgotten the lease is nearly up it was partlypartlywith emphasisabout the house i wanted to see you tonight and i think it awfully sweet of you to ask what i want done she paused while her auditor in growing uneasiness again shifted his weight dancingbear fashion from one to the other foot yes its awfully sweet of you to put it that way she repeated and i quite know i ought to make up my mind i suppose on the whole i had better ask you to renew the lease for a year or six months unlessunless unless what challoner snapped he could have bitten his tongue out immediately after perceiving how woefully he had blundered for although he carefully abstained from looking at her he knew that the light leaped into mrs spencers eyes and the pink into her cheek while even her strawcolored hair through the intricate convolutions of which a wisp of turquoise chiffon was twisted took on a livelier tint she blossomed in short her faded crumpled playedout prettiness of person and manner transformed into the younger smarter more convinced and consequently more convincing prettiness which had raised an evil spirit of covetousness in him when he first met her and continued to provoke that covetousness untilwell until something very much more profitable socially and financially in the shape of possibly obtainable womanhood had risen above his horizon the moment was a very nasty one for joseph challoner since it could not but occur to him that while responsible for much existing damage he was about to render himself liable for far heavier damages in the near future this taxed his courage again consciously he funked it so that for some few seconds gwynneth spencers fate hung in the balance but only for a few seconds did her fate so hang ambition and a brute obstinacy in face of attempted coercion a certain animal necessity to prove to himself the fact of his own strength carried the day challoner turned his coat once and for all in as far as poor lightweight gwynnie spencer was concerned letting the underlying element of cruelty and cunning in his nature have free play unless what she echoed laughing thinly why unless you have any other plan to propose joe any arrangement which youd like better and which i should like better than just sticking on here indefinitely at robins rest challoner had moved away to a rickety little bamboo table set out with cheap flowervases and knickknacks absently he picked up a photograph in dilapidated silver frame from among these treasures and stood fingering it the coat of many colors was fairly turned yet at the sound of his pet name challoner started letting the object he held fall to the ground where to his relief silver leather glass cardboard and portrait incontinently parted company i need not put it more plainly need i she quavered an upward break in her voice but of course if you have any other plan to propose there would be no occasion to bother about the renewal of the lease challoner knelt on one knee his large hands groping over the carpet as he gathered up the dbris bless me he said the wretched things smashed what a nuisance i hope you havent any special affection for it i am awfully sorry cant imagine how i came to drop it stupid of me wasnt it i must get you a new one i saw some uncommonly tasty silver frames in a shop in the marychurch road today ill go in and buy you one the first time i pass tell your girl to be careful when she sweeps in the morning though for the glass has splintered all over the place he rose ponderously to his feet and for the first time since his arrival looked full at her peuh he went on blowing out his breath and laying one hand across the small of his back it strikes me im growing confoundedly stiff old age comes on apace eh mrs gwynnie not in your case i dont mean you are one of the sort that wears well i havent seen you in better looks for months some other plan to propose did you say yes i have otherwise i mightnt have been quite so ready to eat a beastly bad dinner downtown so as to be free to come on here early to see you his manner had become almost boisterously jocose casting out the last remnant of pity he cast out the last remnant of fear of her even in her present heightened prettiness he came round behind the sofa and perched himself on the back of it sitting sideways looking down at her flushed expectant unimportant little face and quite jauntily swinging his leg youll not forget to tell them about the broken glass he queried parenthetically or youll have somebody getting badly cut as to my alternative plan now mrs gwynnie i have been thinking things over too and i feel like you they cant very well continue as they are this robins rest arrangement which served its purpose well enough at first is pretty thoroughly played out we may regret that but it is and to tell you the truth mrs gwyn i have been troubled by some little qualms of conscience lately beatties affairs have been on my mind a lot beattie beattie she broke in shrilly what on earth has bee to do with it the question is not so much what beattie has to do with itlaying stress on the last wordas what it has to do with beattie challoner returned in a benevolent heavyfather tone in my opinion she has been a mighty good little sister to you and she must be mortally tired of keeping her eyes shut and playing gooseberry by this time i see no reason why her prospects should be sacrificed shes a perfect right to a look in of her own poor girl the answer to the above might appear obvious but challoner gauged the mental caliber of the person he dealt with mrs spencers shallow trivial fairweather nature was illadapted to meet any great crisis her small brain worked slowly and with a permanent inclination toward the irrelevant and indirect he counted upon these defects of perception and logic and he was not disappointed butbut when i marry she said essaying not very successfully to practise her little laugh i always meant to make it a condition that bee should share my home very nice and thoughtful quite right of you challoner replied still benevolently jocose only i was talking about beatties matrimonial projects just now not about yours you see and you are to blame mrs gwyn you have been careless i dont want to pile on the agony but you have been most awfully careless there is ever so much gossip going round i am afraid people are beginning to look just a little askance and what reflects on you reflects on your sister i have taken the trouble to make inquiries and from all i hear fred lawley is a very decent young fellow and will come into some money when his grandfather dies he is second officer now and stands well for promotion the pay is above the average too on that cape line his people are in a good position quite gentlefolk a solid old clerical familyone of his uncles a canon of some cathedral or other i forget which it would be a firstclass marriage for beattie but you cannot expect people like that to be best pleased at his taking up with a girl out of such a queer stable aswell as this one mrs gwyn therefore i do not think i should be acting in your sisters interests if i renewed the lease of this house for you i see that she said her aspect brightening i see what you are coming round to how you have thought it all out i seeof coursego on i shall not renew the lease of this house he repeated slowly but i propose you and miss beattie shall move bag and baggage to marychurch where marychurch why i thought you meant heatherleigh why do you want to get rid of us oh she gasped oh yes challoner said jocosity waning somewhat exactly mrs gwynnie how quick you are i do want to get rid of you for your own good and my good and beatties good as wellprincipally for hers this gossip must be stopped i cannot have it it is unpleasant for me but for you it is disastrous at marychurch beattie has the quartermains and plenty of other friends it will be handy for her young man too when his vessel is at southampton you would see ever so much more society there than you do here and i can give you an uncommonly nice house very superior in every respect to this onesunnyside the white house with a veranda opposite the new borough recreation ground in wilmer road nominally it belongs to old manby but actually it belongs to me it has been standing empty since christmas and manby will think himself only too lucky to let it to any client of mine at a low rentwhich i pay of course no one need know anything about that challoner talked on swinging his leg jauntily though every nerve in his big body was strained with the effort to apprehend and follow the workings of his hearers mind so far save for that passing outbreak she had received his admonitions and propositions more reasonably than he had anticipated so he must exercise patience must not rush her but give the idea time to sink in manbys property is mortgaged up to the hilt he went on and he is more than half a year behind with the interest if he doesnt come into my terms i shall threaten to foreclose he knows i have got him between my finger and thumb poor old chap and he goes in terror of the time i may begin to squeeze i admit it does seem rather rough on him for he is in this hole through no fault of his own his family has owned the property for three generations but his business has dwindled to nothing and that compelled him to raise money the cooperative stores at stourmouth and southampton are crushing him and oldfashioned jogalong retail tradesmen like him out of existence the same thing is happening all over the country men of his type have neither enterprise nor capital to compete with those large company concerns she sat so still listening with such apparent docility that challoner judged it safe to quit generalities sunnyside shall be properly done up and the sanitation inspected he said i am willing to spend from seventy to a hundred on the place it is bound to be my own sooner or later so any money i lay out on it will come back to me in the end too i want to do the thing handsomely for you mrs gwyn you and beattie could go out by tram tomorrow or next day and have a look at the place ill advise manby by telephone tomorrow first thing i have found him a very desirable tenant so that he may open the house better make a list of any little odds and ends you may think need doing if you like you can choose the wallpapers yourself thats awfully sweet of you but supposing i dont like the house when i see it i know i am rather fanciful and particular she put in with her little neighing laugh ill guarantee youll like it he returned its just the sort of house to appeal to your taste really high class nothing cheap or tawdry about it built somewhere in the early seventies tiptop style in its own line quite a gentlewomans house mrs spencer fingered the lace and ribbons of her teagown negligently advanced her left foot studied the pointed toe of her beaded slipper then looked up archly in challoners face but supposing she said i really dont want a house at marychurch at allwhat then supposing i really prefer to remain at stourmouth supposing i am really determined to stay on here at our dear old robins rest challoners expression darkened he descended from his graceful perch and stood behind the sofa towering above her very sorry mrs gwyn he replied but i regret to say it cant be done it doesnt suit me to have you stay on at robins rest but why she insisted challoner hesitated for an instant decided to make exact truth subservient to expediency and spoke why well if you press the point not only for the very good reasons which i have already given you at some length but because i want the house for another tenant pewsey my junior partner has asked for it for his mother i am anxious to oblige pewsey i have promised him possession some time in the june quarter you have let robins rest let our house joe our own dear little house without ever telling me let it over my head looking at her upturned face pretty scared brainless challoners memory played a queer trick on him harking back to scenes of long ago at which as a schoolboy he had more than onceto his shameassisted on the fairmead at marychurch the great flat fiftyacre grass meadow which lies on the outskirts of the little town between the river wilmer and the castle moat he saw with startling vividness of detail the agonized leaping rush of the shrillsquealing rabbits wirenetting barrier in front of them and redjawed hotbreathing dogs behind even then he had turned somewhat sick at the hellish pastime although excitement and a natural disposition to bully all creatures weaker than himself made him yell and curse and urge on the dogs with the roughest of the crowd he sickened now watching this hapless foolish bewildered woman double and turn in desperate effort to elude pursuing selfcreated fate only to find herself brought up short against the irrefragable logic of the situation as demonstrated by his own relentless commonsense yet even while he sickened excitement gained on him and his bullying instinct began to find satisfaction in the inhuman sport yes mrs gwynnie he said i own i have done just thatlet robins rest over your head i saw it was the kindest thing both by you and by your sister though it might strike you as a bit arbitrary at first my duty is to stop this infernal gossip at all costs if you wont take proper care of your own reputation i must take care of it for youisnt that as clear as mud but i dont want to go away she cried again missing the point i refuse to be sent away you have no right to interfere it isnt your place you cant order me about and push me aside like that i am a lady and i refuse to put up with such treatment it is very rude of you and quite unsuitable everybody would feel that i shall appeal to my friends i shall tell every one i know about it oh as you please of course but just what will you tell them challoner asked why the whole storythe whole truth as you please he repeated only im afraid its not a story likely when told to enlarge your local visitinglist challoner perched on the back of the sofa again domineering masterful leaning down and looking her straight in the eyes see here gwynnie he said youre in a tight place listen to reason dont be a fool and throw away your last chance in a pet i mean to expose you i will tell everybody everybody she cried no challoner said you wont i give you credit for more worldly wisdom more selfrespect more good feeling than that the injury you might do me by publishing this little lovepassage of ours would not be a patch upon the injury you would do yourself you dont want to commit social suicide do you and find every door shut in your face tell any of these friends of yours the woodfords mrs paull marion chase and theyd avoid you as they would a leper drop you like a hot potato cut you dead whether they believed your charming little tale or not you are fond of company mrs gwynniea gregarious being you would not the least enjoy being left out in the cold all by yourself and there is another point i am perfectly willing to pay for my pleasure honestly as a man should but it is not wise to tax my good nature too far doing your best to blast my reputation is not exactly the way to make me feel kindly or act generously toward you there would be no more nice houses rent free mrs gwyn rates and taxes paid no more quarterly allowance i am afraid i should cut off supplies my dear your widows pension is paid in rupees remember not in sterling and the value of the rupee is hardly likely to go up so you had better look at the question all round before you take the neighborhood into your confidence listen here i will give you a hundred a year and the marychurch house but if i tell everybody how you have treated me public opinion will force you to marry me she cried with an air of announcing an annihilating truth challoner swung his big body from side to side contemptuously faugh he said public opinion will do nothing of the sort you forget it is a case of my word against yours and that considering our relative positions my word will count a jolly sight most but you dare not deny oh indeed yes i dare challoner broke out i can deny and shall denyor rather should for it wont ever come to the testthat your accusations have any foundation whatsoever in fact if a woman is mad enough to incriminate herself she must do so but a man always denies at least every man of honor and proper feeling does no no be sensible think of beattie think of yourself dont put all your eggs in one basket you are a taking woman still mrs gwyn give yourself another chance for remember you havent a shred of evidence to offer in support of your attack you have bombarded me with notes but except as lawyer to client i have never written you two lines in my life he paused no thank goodness even at my hottest i kept my head screwed on sufficiently the right way to avoid the old letterwriting trap then from the first the very first she gasped did you never mean to marry me challoner had the grace to hesitate look down at the floor and lower his voice as he answered no my dear girl neverfrom the day i found i could get what i wanted at the cheaper rate gwynneth spencer stared blankly in front of her then as her small slowworking brain began to take in the measure of her own disgrace while the poor house of cards in which she trusted toppled and tumbled flat her silly little neighing laugh rose to a shriek beating the air with both hands she flung herself at full length on the sofa her body convulsed from head to foot and her throat torn by hysterical cries and sobs challoner turned his back put his hands over his ears the squealing of the mangled rabbits on the fairmead had been a lullaby compared with this but he found it useless to try and shut out the sounds piercing discordant rasping they echoed through the room they must be heard next door heard out in the road heard so it seemed to challoner through the length and breadth of stourmouth must resound startling the high respectabilities of the baughurst park ward must break in upon the dignified seclusion of the tower house itself searing his name with infamy he turned round leaned down over the back of the sofa he felt the greatest reluctance to touch the shrieking struggling woman but the noise was unendurable he caught both her wrists in one hand and pinned them down among the ribbons and laces at her waist the other hand he laid upon her open and distorted mouth hush he said be quiet hush you fool gwynnie be a good girl hush gwyn for gods sake dont go on like this hushpull yourself together try to control yourself my dear little womancurse you leave off your caterwauling you damned hellcat do you hear hold your infernal row gwynnie love darling chummy little sweetheart leave off will you or youll make me smother you leave offah my god thats betteroh ohouf the next thing challoner knew clearly was that he stood in the little diningroom upon the dinnertable under the dim light of the turneddowngasjets a square spirit decanter a syphon of soda and a couple of glasses were set out on a round redlacquer tray he remembered often to have seen them set out thus but for the moment he could not recall why he was there or what he came for he felt very tired his hands shook the veins stood out on his forehead and great drops of perspiration ran down his face he would be uncommonly glad of some brandy then he started with a sudden movement of disgust he might be brutal cynical callous but there were depths to which he could not descend never again could he eat or drink in this house he remembered what he came for a sound away in the offices arrested his attention the maids had come in he supposed he was glad of that he poured some brandy into a glass and crossing the hall went back into the drawingroom shutting the door softly behind him mrs spencer lay quite still the fit of hysteric violence spent her face was claycolored her lips blue her eyes closed her body limp and inert she cried a little weakly and quietly challoner knelt down beside the sofa slipped one hand under the back of her head with its elaborately dressed hair and wisp of turquoise chiffon and held the glass to her lips drink this he said in a thick whisper it will help to bring you round it will do you good then as she sipped it drawing away now and then and spluttering a little as the raw spirit burned her tongue and throat he went on you are going to be sensible and not throw away your chance noi mean yes she said you will take beattie over to marychurch to look at the house yesoh yes ill give you a hundred and fifty a yearfifty more than i promised you can do quite nicely on that yesthank youyes and as long as you keep your part of the bargain ill keep mine if you play me false and talk i shant talk she said feebly and fretfully why should i talk now its no use ah challoner returned i am very glad you have come to your senses mrs gwyn i believed give it a little thought youd see it all in a reasonable light thats right he rose and went out into the hall again carrying the glass put it down took up his gloves and hat crossed to the door leading to the offices opened it and called a young woman in a trim black serge coat and skirt and pink sailor hat appeared in the kitchen doorway with a knowing and slightly disconcerting smirk look here esther challoner said mrs spencer has been extremely unwell it was most fortunate i happened to call in tonight if i hadnt i dont quite know what would have become of her she ought not to be left alone in the house next time miss beattie is away mind both of you do not go out it is not safe he felt among the loose coins in his trousers pocket laid hold of a sovereign considered that it was too muchmight have the flavor of a bribe about it found a couple of halfcrowns drew them out and put them into the young womans hand you understand what i say never let your mistress be alone in the house once outside in the road challoner took off his hat walking slowly he was grateful for the freshness and the soothing halfdark he had gone about fifty yards when the blond road seemed to lurch that horrible shrieking laughter was in his earsor was it only the squealing of the tortured rabbits he turned giddy laid hold of the top of some garden palings for support a spasm contracted his throat he retched vomited and then passed onward homeward through the chill moist fragrance of the spring night chapter iii in which euterpe is called upon to play the part of interpreter the concert was over coming out of the rotundaa domed and pinnacled building of glass and iron half conservatory half theater set on the hillside against a crown of evergreentreesthe audience poured in a dark stream down the steep garden walks to where flanked by red and yellow wooden kiosks the turnstiles and entrance gates open on to the public road joanna smyrthwaite was among the last to leave the auditorium she did so in a dazed and almost sleepwalking condition exhausted and enervated by the tumult of her own sensations but that enervation was singularly pleasant to her since by reducing the claims of her overdeveloped intellectual and moral nature it left the emotional element in undisputed ascendancy she was indeed jealous of any interruption or curtailment of this condition therefore she lingered unwilling to leave the place where so much inward felicity had been procured her and fearing to meet any of her acquaintance dr and mrs norbiton and mrs paull had she believed occupied stalls a couple of rows behind her she wished to avoid conversation with them and still more to avoid offeringher carriage was waiting at the entrance gatesto drive them to their respective homes their comments upon the performance however intelligent and appreciative must she knew jar upon her in her present frame of mind felicity would be extinguished in irritation and for such deplorable downfall she should she knew hold her good neighbors responsible it was wiser to avoid occasion of offense since she so wanted so really needed to be alone her sister margarets musical requirements went no further than the modern english ballad for preference of the description in which roses personal pronouns cheap erotic sentiment endearing diminutives and tags of melody appropriatedwithout acknowledgmentfrom the works of early masters go to make up so remarkably meritricious a whole of this joanna while duly deploring margarets artistic limitations was really very glad it enabled her to attend the weekly wednesday and friday classical concerts at the rotunda by herself she had always wished to attend these concerts but only since her fathers demise had she felt free to gratify her wishes in respect of them since that event they had become first a permitted pleasure then an indulgence crying aloud for gratification and finally a duty of a semireligious character on no account to be omitted today the religious sentiment was conspicuously present as the programme consisted of excerpts from wagners operas reared in a creed which sublimates the deity to an inoperative abstraction joannas thought reacted just now toward an exaggerated anthropomorphism in her mind as in those of many persons deficient in the finer and more catholic musical instinct the titanic quality of so much of the great composers work excited feelings of astonishment and awe which resulted in an attitude closely akin to worship the elevation of primitive human passionsdesire remorse anger revenge bloodhungerto regions of portent and prodigy so that they stalk altogether phantasmal and gigantic clothed in rent garments of amazing and tormented harmonies across the world stage their heads threatening the integrity of the constellations while their feet are made of and squarely planted upon very common clay is undoubtedly a spectacle calculated at once to flatter human pride and provoke a species of idolatry for some reason moreover lust is less readily conceivable in the neighborhood of the pole than in that of the equator so that the bleak northern atmosphere in which the wagnerian dramas move procures for them an effect of austerity not to say of chastity almost amusingly misleading humor however is indispensable to the recognition of the above little truths and joannas composition was innocent of the smallest admixture of that merrily nosepulling ingredient she took her emotions quite seriously not only nursing them when present but finding in them later assurance of the reality of certain fond dreams vehement hopes and longings which possessed her therefore standing under the glazed marquise of the rotunda she watched with strained face and pale anxious eyes until the little company of her acquaintanceshe could distinguish dr norbiton by his height and the green felt hat cleft in the crown which he worereached the turnstiles and passed out toward the animated open space of the square this last like the flat of the valley lay in shadow faint pearlgray mist veiling the modest stream whence stourmouth derives its name and the lawns and bordersnow gay with spring flowersof the wellkept ornamental grounds through which it flows but across the valley the fir plantation upon the opposite slope and the houses and big hotelsthe streaming flags of which supplied a welcome note of crude color in the landscaperising behind the dark bar of it along with the upward curve of shops and offices in marychurch road and the three tall church spirestwo of buffgray stone the third redtiled and elegantly slenderwere flooded with steady sunshine thrushes sang loud in the grove at the back of the rotunda perched on the outstanding ironwork of the dome starlings creaked and whistled a grind of tram wheels hooting of motor horns barking of dogs and sound of voices borne on the easterly breeze arose from the square the bell of an anglican church called to evensong from the bandstand situated at the far end of the public gardens came the strains of a popular march while with these in a soft undertone mingled the murmur of the many trees and hush of the sea seeing and hearing all of which in her present highly sensitized condition realization of the inherent beauty of things the inherent wonder and delight of being pierced joanna smyrthwaites understanding and heart her whole nature was fused by the fires of a limitless tenderness and sympathy and being thus delivered from the tyranny of words and empty phrases from the false standards of thought and conduct engendered by her upbringing and from everpresent consciousness of her own circumscribed and discordant personality for the first time in her experience she tasted the strong wine of life pure and undiluted during a few splendid moments she knew the joy of genius sixth sensebecoming one with the soul and purpose of all that which she looked upon hot tears rose to her eyes she was broken by a mute ecstasy of thanksgiving but it was impossible this happy state should continue the malady of introspection was too deeply ingrained in her tormenting fears and scruples again arose innate pessimism laid its paralyzing influence upon her she felt as one in whose hands a gift of great value has been placed but whose muscles being too weak to grasp it the precious lovely thing falls to the ground and is shattered whereat tears of enraptured sensibility turned to tears of bitter humiliation drawing a blackbordered handkerchief from the silvermounted bag hanging at her waist she pressed it against her wet yet burning face and hurried down the hill at the gates the wellappointed barouche and pair of fine brown horses awaited herjohnson the coachman rotund and respectful in his black livery upon the box edwin the footman elongated and respectful her rugs and wraps over his arm at the carriage door the spring evenings still grew chill toward sundown and joannas circulation was never of the best she stood silent and abstracted while edwin put her cloaka costly garment of persian lamb lined with ermineabout her thin shoulders nor until she was seated in the carriage the fur rug warmly tucked round her had her agitation subsided sufficiently for her to speak she would not go the short way home by barryport road she disliked the traffic the trams made her nervous she would go by the new drive along the west cliff and across tantivy common obediently the carriage turned to the left through the shadow up the steep hill behind the rotunda the horses climbed straining at the collar then the top of the ascent being reached they bowled along the broad even road snorting in the sparkle of the upland air and recovered sunshine joanna sat stiffly upright shivering a little and blinking in the strong light she still held her handkerchief in her hand and it was through a blur of again upwelling tears that she saw the uninviting red and gray terraces and large straggling boardinghouses set in a sparse fringe of firtrees on either side the road this quarter of stourmouth declining from fashion is given over to cheap pensions nursinghomes and schools the footwalks were infested by hospital nurses and bathchairs while long files of girls marching two and two meandered home and seaward some of these maidens stared enviously at the young lady wrapped in furs driving along in her smart carriage and sighed for the glorious days when mistresses and lessons would have no more dominion over them but joanna remained unconscious of the interest she excited her thoughts had returned upon a subject which now constantly and all too exclusively occupied thema subject to which even the admirable playing of the rotunda orchestra and noble singing of the young dramatic sopranothough she had listened to both in a fervor of reverential emotionsupplied after all little more than a humble accompaniment in the silvermounted velvet bag hanging at her waist neatly filed and dated encircled by elastic bands to keep them perfectly flat and prevent their edges from crumpling were all the letters she had received from adrian savage even the thin french envelopes crosshatched with blue inside to secure opacity had been carefully preserved even the telegram she had received from adrian in response to the announcement of her fathers death found a place there the letters in question were discreet even ceremonious epistles dealing with business and plans expressing regret at the delays in his return to england caused by our good challoners slowness in preparing documents and accounts and making civil inquiries as to joanna and her sisters health and wellbeing quaint turns of phrase and vivacity of diction gave these letters a flavor of originality but taken as a whole less intimate or more uncompromising effusions it would be difficult to conceive by this fact however joanna was in no wise daunted as all his many friends agreed adrian savage was a dear delightful and very clever fellow who would assuredly make a name for himself but joanna went far beyond that endowing him with enough virtues graces and talents to people this naughty old earth with sages and stock all heaven with saints consequently in the graceful lightness and polite restraint of his letters alike she found food for admiration and security of hopenamely consideration for the difficulties of her unprotected position delicacy in face of her recent bereavement a highminded determination in no way to hurry her to a decision at night joanna placed the slender packet in a russialeather wallet beneath her pillow by day she carried it in the bag at her waist often when alone she drew it forth from its hidingplace and fondled it tremulously she had done so this afternoon during the concert more than once it was unnecessary for her to reread the letters she knew their contents by heart adrian had touched them he thought of her when writing them when folding the thin sheets of paper when stamping and addressing the envelopes thus they constituted a direct material as well as mental link between herself and him perpetually she dwelt on this fact finding in it a pleasure almost painful in its intensity only for a few minutes at a time indeed could she dare to hold or look at the packet then replacing it in the wallet or bag she struggled to regain her composure merely to take it out at the first favorable opportunity and repeat the whole process again in the same way although longing for the young mans return to the point of passion she hailed each obstacle which postponed that return to see him to hear his voice and footsteps meet his gallant and kindly eyes to watch him come and go about the house to listen to his clever and sympathetic talk would constitute rapture but a rapture from which she shrank in terror she felt that she could hardly endure his presence it would drain her of vitality now sitting upright in the carriage while the horses carried her forward at a spanking pace through the sea and moorland freshness and the delights of the spring sunshine a new form of these fears tortured her adrians love constant association with him participation in the varied interests and activities of his daily life and in that of the brilliant society in which he movedthis and nothing less than this in sum and in detail constituted the lovely precious gift placed in her till now so sad and empty hands by a strange turn of fortunes wheel were those poor hungry hands strong enough to close upon and hold it or would they weakly faltering and failing let it fall to the ground and be shattered the shame of such prospective failure agonized her to renounce a crown may be heroic but to have it incontinently tumble off when you are straining every nerve exerting every faculty to keep it safely balanced on your head is feeble as she felt to the point of ignominy at last the schools pensions nursinghomes and lodginghouses were left behind the carriage reached the open common tracts of gorse thickset with apricotyellow blossom broke up the silvery brown expanse of heather in sharply green grassgrown hollows ancient hawthorns their tops clipped by the sea wind into quaint shapes compact and ruddy were dusted over by opening leafbuds high in air screaming gulls circled the shadows were long for the sun drew down toward its setting then as once before today the happy appeal of outward thingsin which as in glass man may if he will catch some faint reflection of gods glorymade its voice heard awakening joanna smyrthwaite from the feverdreams of her almost maniacal egoism obeying a sudden impulse she stopped the carriage alighted and walked out on to the little promontory the neck of which the road crosses here the sand cliffs dyed all shades from deepest rusty orange to palest lemonyellow and glistening white descend almost perpendicularly in narrow waterworn shelves and ledges to the beach nearly a hundred feet below looking eastward up the wind the sea horizon stourmouth its many buildings and its pier and all the curving coastline away to stonehorse headthe dark mass of which guards the entrance to marychurch havenshowed through a film of fine gray mist westward the colors of both land and sea though opaque were warmer across the golden gorse of the common in the immediate foreground joanna saw the great amphitheater of the baughurst park woods extending far inland the rich bluepurple of the pines and firs pierced here and there by the living sunlight of a larch plantation beyond barryport harbor only the farthest coves and inlets of whose gleaming waters were visible the quiet rounded outlines of the slepe hills pushed seaward in bluntnosed headland after headland softening from heliotrope to ethereal lavender in the extreme distance under a sky resembling the tint and texture of a pink pearl joanna her fur cloak gathered closely about her stood a lonely black figure amid the splendor of the scented gorse there is an exciting quality in the east wind the harsh tang of it galvanized her into an unusual physical wellbeing making her chest expand and her blood circulate more rapidly a new thought came to her to doubt her power of meeting the demands of adrians affection and of rising to his level was really to doubt the vivifying power of that affection to doubt his ability to raise her to his own level her doubt of her own worthiness was in point of fact an accusation against his intelligence and his judgment joanna slipped one hand inside the velvet bag under her cloak and clasped the thin packet of letters with the other she momentarily covered her eyes as though in apology and penitence ah how miserably faithless i am she murmured in her flat toneless voice how wickedly ungrateful it is not to trust him as though he were not capable of supplying all that is wanting in meas though he did not know so far far best chapter iv some passages from joanna symrthwaites locked book that evening joanna went to her room early she permitted mrs isherwood to help her off with her evening dress and on with a purple lambswool kimono the color and cut of which were singularly illsuited to her pasty complexion and narrowchested figure she then rather summarily dismissed the good woman who retired accompanied by black silk rustlings indicative of respectful displeasure and protest these joanna refused to let affect her the experiences of the day had aroused an inherited though until now latent arrogance she regarded herself as sealed to that altogetherotherwiseengaged young gentleman adrian savage and set apart yet ingrained habits of obedience and selfrepression still stirred within her making her timid in the presence of any sort of established authority even in that of her old nurse she needed solitude to enable her to enjoy the luxury of such sealing to the full therefore when the door shut upon those remonstrant rustlings she followed almost stealthily and locked it stood for a moment listening to make sure of isherwoods final departure then extended both arms with a voiceless cry of satisfaction crossed to her satinwood bureau opened it and took the current volume of her diary from a pigeonhole fetched lighted candles and the silvermounted bag containing adrians letters from off her dressingtable and sat down to write april i have neglected my diary for many weeks but i have feared i might set down that which i should afterward regret indeed all my accustomed occupations and employments have been neglected they have appeared to me tedious and trivial my mind has been strangely disordered but tonight i feel this state is passed i see my duty clearly and shall not allow anything to interfere with it or deflect me from the pursuit of it i owe this to the person who has so wonderfully chosen me at this point the small neat scholarly writing became irregular and almost illegible joanna rose and paced the room pressing her hands against her high forehead presently she returned and sat down again it is unwise to dwell too much on this as yet i am unequal to any adequate expression of my feelings when rearranging the books in library last week i happened to open a volume of mrs brownings poems containing her sonnets from the portuguese they appeared to me singularly appropriate to my own case i have indeed been weakly jealous that any other woman should have felt and so exactly expressed my own thoughts and emotions yet i read and reread the sonnets daily they speak for me not only more eloquently but more truthfully than i can speak for myself but unhappily i have less terribly less to offer in return than the poetess had this has racked me with distress annihilating my peace of mind and in great measure dimming my gratitude until today i see how very wrong this has been it has its root in pride for as i now understand distrust of myself is nothing less than distrust of him i am resolved to exterminate my pride and submit to be nothing so that he may give everything already i feel relief and a growing repose of mind from this resolve already i feel my pride yielding soon i believe i shall almost rejoice in my own absence of gifts and attractions since it enlarges his opportunity for generosity the chatter of young women upon the gallery accompanied by smothered laughter not to say giggling joanna ceased writing blotted the page and returned the diary to its pigeonhole she moved into the center of the room and stood anxiously listening but to her relief no knock came at the door the two voices grew faint along the corridor and ceased joanna could not however immediately settle to her diary again the giggling had brought her down from high poetic regions to common earth with a bump pride cast out in one direction pranced in another unrestrainedas is prides wont when joanna resumed her writing subject and treatment alike were changed marion chase is staying here as usual she wrote in some ways i am glad of this it relieves me of any obligation to be constantly with margaret to be constantly with her would be very irksome to me i no longer pretend that she and i have much in common since papas authority has been removed the radical divergence between margarets character and mine becomes more and more evident marion chase has no intellectual life her pleasures are active and practical these margaret appears increasingly to enjoy sharing today she and marion have been to southampton and back in a new motorcar margaret has on trial mr challoner selected it for her in london it came down yesterday margaret is very much excited about it she is of course at liberty to buy a motorcar if she pleases though i think it would have been better taste to wait until the business connected with our inheritance was finally settled before making any such costly purchase i prefer johnson and the horses motoring would i feel sure cause me nervousness mr challoner i heard this evening met them in stourmouth and under plea of seeing how the car worked before advising margaret to keep it accompanied them to southampton and back this appears to me quite unnecessary i could not make out from marion whether his going was by previous arrangement or merely the result of a sudden thought and invitation in either case i cannot but disapprove of his joining the party he is still here very frequently and margaret quotes his opinions on every occasion those opinions are prejudiced and insular as one might expect from a man who has enjoyed few social and educational advantages papa used to say the worst enemies of patriotism were patriots this is certainly true in the case of mr challoner in as far as the effect of his conversation upon me is concerned he knows nothing of foreign countries and foreign politics and yet speaks contemptuously of whatever and whoever is not english margaret has taken to echoing him until i grow weary and irritable surely it might occur to her that reiterated depreciation of everything foreign must be displeasing to me but margaret has no perception argument is lost upon her so i am constrained to remain silent yet i cannot disguise from myself that her constant association with mr challoner and the influence he undoubtedly has obtained over her may lead to great difficulties in the futureparticularly in the event of my own marriage here once again the neat writing became erratic emotion gained upon joanna compelling her to lay down her pen rise and pace the room my own marriagemy own marriage she repeated her head thrown back her eyes shut her arms hanging straight at her sides while her hands worked opening and closing in nervous purposeless clutchings presently she walked back to the bureau and took adrians letters out of the velvet bag resting her left hand her fingers outstretched upon the flat slab of the bureau for support she held the letters in her right their contact made her wince and shrink as though she held whitehot metal instead of innocent blueywhite notepaper only by degrees could she muster sufficient composure to look at the slim little packet upon which encircling elastic bands conferred a distinctly prosaic and even billlike appearance and yet because thou overcomest so because thou art more noble and like a king thou canst prevail against my fears and fling thy purple round me till my heart her voice failed dying in her throat leaving the quotation incomplete hastily she pushed the packet of letters back into the bag snapped to the silver catch and again pressing her hands to her forehead paced the room till such time as her agitation had sufficiently subsided for her to resume her writing i must resist the temptation to dwell upon a certain subject save in silence to refer to it in words moves me too deeply that subject is the life of my life of this i am so utterly sure so utterly convinced that i can surely afford to keep silence just in proportion as i know that my heart is beating it becomes unnecessary to count the heartbeats i had better write of practical things to do so has lessened the worry they too often caused me in the past i trust it may do so again i mean this specially in connection with the anxiety margarets association with mr challoner occasions me i fear margaret is disingenuous mamma used to deplore a tendency to deceit in her deceit in little things even when she was a child margaret enjoys concealment it amuses her and gives her an idea of her own astuteness and superiority i do not wish to be unjust but i cannot help fearing this tendency to slyness is increased by her intercourse with mr challoner and with marion in addition to the fact of mr challoners drive with them to southampton something else came out at dinner tonight which disturbed me on my way home today after crossing tantivy common johnson turned along silver chine road a pantechnicon van stood before one of the small houses which i recognized as that which margaret once pointed out to me as belonging to mrs spencer as the carriage passed i saw mrs spencer herself and her young sister miss beatrice stacey directing the men who were carrying out the furniture i thought they both looked hard at me but i did not bow i sent cards to mrs spencer as to every one else who called here to inquire after papas death but i do not desire her acquaintance on the few occasions when i have met her she appeared to me a frivolous dressy person whose influence upon margaret would not be for good i do not wish to be uncharitable but her manners struck me as unladylike at dinner i mentioned the circumstances under which i saw her this afternoon marion glanced at margaret with a singular expression of face i heard mrs spencer and bee were leaving soon she said i believe they have taken a house at marychurch i observed margaret flushed but she did not speak of course i dont believe there is any real harm in her marion added again looking at margaret or i should not have gone there so often but i do think whatever talk there has been is entirely her own fault then margaret began to speak of the car and mr challoners advice to her about buying it in a rather loud tone she hardly spoke to me during the rest of the evening i certainly had no intention of annoying her by mentioning mrs spencer but she was evidently very angry with me i cannot help being anxiousyet i know my own great happiness should make me patient and tolerant even when vulgar and trivial matters are pressed upon my attention i am very weak i ought to rise above all such things and rest calmly in the one wonderful thought that i am no longer alone that i no longer belong to myself joanna put her hand over her eyes thou canst prevail against my fears and fling thy purple round me she again quoted half aloud then once more she wrote i am glad that i am rich i have never felt glad of this till today we have always been rich and though papa inculcated economy as a duty i have taken riches for granted as a natural part of my own position now i recognize their value i have at least that to givei mean a not despicable amount of wealth and the dignified ease which wealth obtains in this respect at least i can make some slight return since there has been time to look into affairs we find papas estate considerably larger than we supposed margaret and i shall each have between seven and eight thousand a year yes i am very very glad at least i do not go to him an emptyhanded beggar in material things she sat awhile looking up both hands resting on the edge of the slab her mouth was half open her eyes fixed her face irradiated by an expression of ecstasy painful in its strained intensity a little more and ecstasy might decline to idiocy joanna doted and alwaysthough particularly under such circumstances as joannasit is a mistake to dote chapter v in which adrians knowledge of some inhabitants of the tower house is sensibly increased a week of the burning midmay weather such as often comes in the fir and heather country the baughurst woods and all the coastline from marychurch to barryport basked in the strong still heat over open spaces the heat became visible dancing and swirling like the vapors off a limekiln as it baked all residue of moisture out of the light surface soil aromatic scents given off by the lush foliage and lately risen sap filled the air the furzepods crackled and snapped fircones fell softly thudding on to the deep dry beds of firneedles and films of bark scaling off the red upper branches made small ticking noises in the sunscorch all day long in the heart of the woodland turtle doves repeated their cozy crooning lament wandering cuckoos called in the gardens blackbirds and thrushes though silent at midday sang early and late great blue and green dragonflies hawked over the lawns darting back and forth from the warm dappled shade of the fir plantations where their enameled bodies and transparent wings glinted across long slanting shafts of sunlight in the shrubberies rhododendrons azaleas pink thorns and crabtrees were in flower lilac and syringa blossom was about to break the sky high and unclouded showed a deep hot blue above the darkplumed pines and firtrees and against the redtiled roofs and sextagonal redbrick towersurmounted by a gilt weathervaneof the tower house from sunrise to sunset adrian savage lay back in a long cane chair set upon the veranda around the fluted terracotta pillars of which trumpetflowered honeysuckle jasmine and climbing roses flourished he found the english heat heavy and somewhat enervating clear though the atmosphere was it made him lazy inclined to dream and disinclined to act or think he laid the times down on the wicker table beside him put his panama hat on the top of it returned a small illustrated french newspaper of questionable modesty to the breastpocket of his jacket stretched stifled a yawn and lighted his third cigarette then reclining in the chair again he contemplated the perspective of his own personclad in a suit of white flannel with a faint fourthread black stripeto where the said perspective ended in a pair of tan boots he had bought the boots in london he knew they represented the last word of the right thing so he ought to like themhe crossed and recrossed his feetbut he wasnt sure he did like them on the whole he thought not therefore he sighed meditatively pulled the tip of his closecut black beard and pushed up the rather flyaway ends of his mustache stared sadly at the tan boots raised his eyebrows and shoulders just perceptibly and mournfully shook his closecropped black head sighed again and then looked away across the gravel terrace and flowerbeds immediately below it crowded with pink mauve and paleyellow tulips to where on the sunk court at the far end of the long wide lawn four agile ruddyfaced whiteclothed young people very vigorously played tennis in the last three months adrian had lost weight la belle gabrielle had not been kind not at all kind more than ever did she appear elusive and baffling more than ever was the mysterious element of her complex and enchanting personality in evidence she frequented drawingroom meetings at which feminists male as well as female held forth she received zlie de gand and other such verminthe term is adriansat her thricesacred flat finally her attitude was altogether too maternal and beneficent toward m ren dax these things caused adrian rage and unhappiness he lost flesh in his eyes was a permanently pathetic and orphaned look happily his nose retained its native pugnacity of outline testifying to the fact that although he might voluminously sigh as a lover as a highspirited and perfectly healthy young gentleman he could still very handsomely spoil for a fight but no legitimate fight presented itselfthat was exactly where from adrians point of view the worry came in he might haunt la belle gabrielles staircase spend hours in consultation with wise and witty anastasia beauchamp exert all his ingenuity to achieve persuasion or excision of ren dax but without practicable result about as useful to try to bottle a shadow play leapfrog with an echo tie up the wind in a sack really he felt quite glad to go away to england for a time out of the vexatiously profitless wear and tear of it all the sun sloping westward slanted in under the roundheaded terracotta arches supporting the roof of the veranda adrian drew his feet back out of the scorch and in so doing sat more upright thereby gaining a fuller view of the tennis players marion chase happened to be serving she interested him as a type produced by current english methods of mental and physical culture practically unknown in france she stoodso she informed him with the utmost franknessfive feet ten in her stockings took eight and a half in shoes measured forty inches round the chest and twentynine and threequarters round the waist to these communicated details he could add from personal observation that she had the complexion of a channel pilot owned a sensible goodtempered very managing face and spoke in a full barytone voice he accredited her with being very fairly honorable irreproachably virtuous and conspicuously devoid of either the religious or artistic sensethough she frequented concerts picture galleries and church services with praiseworthy regularity and persistence he liked her rather and wondered at her muchbeing unaccustomed to the society of such largeboned athletic and sexless persons petticoated yet conspicuously deficient in haunches and busts miss chase he further remarked was permanently in waiting upon margaret smyrthwaite while a tail of youths and maidens was almost as permanently in waiting upon miss chase their relation to her was gregarious rather than sentimental a mere herding of children who follow a leader at play the said tail today consisted of the busbridge boys and amy woodfordthe former two lanky sandyheaded quite innocuous young fellows in immaculate flannels their nether garments sustained by green and orange silk handkerchiefs knottedadrian trusted securelyabout their waists the latter a rather stout darkhaired young lady arrayed in white linen who would have been very passably pretty had not her mouth been too small her nose too long and her bright bootbuttonblack eyes set insufficiently far apart idly he watched the quartette as the members of it ran leaped backed called stood breathing after a long rally with apparently as little soul or mind in their active young bodies as a mob of colts and fillies then his eyes traveled to margaret smyrthwaite sitting outside the larchbuilt heatherthatched tennis pavilion beyond the court in the shade of a grove of tall fir and beech trees if marion chase caused him wonder margaret caused him very much more though from a different angle her development in the last three months struck him as phenomenala startling example of the adaptability to environment inherent in the feminine nature from a rather negative and invertebrate being with little to say and a manner alternately peevish and silly she had grown into a selfpossessed young woman capable of making her presence pleasure and displeasure definitely felt the likeness and the unlikeness she bore to joanna had from the first appeared to adrian both pathetic and singular now on seeing the twin sisters again this likeness and unlikeness passed the bounds of pathos and became to his eyes quite actively cruel for they bore to each otherit was thus he put itthe same relation that the dition de luxe of a book bears to its original rough copyjoanna naturally representing the rough copy all the ungracious and ungrateful aspects of joannas appearance were nicely corrected in her sister fined down or filled outheavy yellowish auburn hair improved to crisp copper a pasty complexion giving place to a fair though freckled skin and bright color blue eyes no longer prominent or anxious but clear selfcontent and possibly a trifle sly at forty adrian could imagine her fat and a little coarselooking but now her figure was graceful and she dressed well though with perhaps too great elaboration for impeccable taste adrian trembled as to the flights of decorative fancy which might present themselves when her period of mourning was passed today she wore a black muslin dress and a widebrimmed black chip hat trimmed with four enormous black silk and gauze roses the whole of rather studied candor of effect yes she was quite an agreeable object to look upon but joanna oh poor poor joanna adrian lit a fourth cigarette stretched himself in his chair again crossing his legs and gazing up at the roof rafters joanna afforded him an uncomfortable subject of thought and one which he tried to avoid in so far as possible he respected her more than ever he felt a chivalrous pity toward her but he did not like her somehow ridiculous though it might sound he was a wee bit afraid of her conscious of selfprotective instincts of an inclination to erect small barricades and throw up small earthworks behind which to shelter when alone with her he was ashamed of his own sensations butand more particularly since he had seen those degraded drawings upon the wall of rens studio which so dreadfully resembled hershe to use a childish expression gave him the creeps then suddenly penetrated by a conviction that her pale eyes were at that very moment fixed upon him adrian whipped out of his chair and wheeled round very alert and upright in his tan boots and light flannel suit ah my dear cousin it is you i thought so he said quickly at last you come out to enjoy this ideal afternoon that is well is it not ravishing for quite a perceptible space of time joanna made no reply she stood on the stone step of one of the large french windows opening on to the veranda her lips were parted and upon her face was a singular expression midwayso it struck adrianbetween driveling folly and rapture this recalled to him with such vividness those evil drawings upon the studio wall that had the likeness been completed by her sporting masculine attire it would hardly have surprised him she in point of fact however wore nothing more peculiar than a modest slightly limp black alpaca coat and skirt adrian was aware of developing an unreasoning detestation of that innocent and very serviceable material i am so sorry she said at last in a sort of hurried whisper i ought not to have come out unexpectedly thus by the window i have disturbed you it was thoughtless of me and inconsiderate butnononot in the least he assured her i was doing absolutely nothing the hot weather disposes one to idleness i tried to read the times i found it a monument of dullness i looked into a little french paper i have here he patted the breastpocket of his jacket i found it quite too lively the corners of his mouth gave slightly for oh how very far away from poor joannas was the outlook upon things in general of that naughty little print have no fear he added it shall remain safely stowed away it is not i admit exactly designed for what you call family readingunsuited for example to the ingenuous minds of those excellent young tennis players ah the energy they display it puts me to shame joanna came forward slowly touching chairs flowerstands tables in passing as though blindly feeling her way i have wanted so much to speak to you alone she said yesyes adrian answered inquiringly with a hasty mental looking around for suitable barricadebuilding material ever since you told me you had lately suffered anxiety and trouble she continued ah my dear cousin you are too sympathetic too kind who among us is free from anxieties and troublesdes ennuis one accepts them as an integral part of ones existence upon this astonishing planet one even cherishes a certain affection for them perhaps ones own dear little personal ennuis joanna sank into a chair her lips worked with emotion i wish i could feel as you do she said but i am weak i rebel against that which pains me or causes me anxiety i have no large tolerance of philosophy but therefore all the more do i admire it in you now when i allude to your trouble you try to put the matter aside gracefully out of consideration for me indeed i appreciate that consideration but while it causes me gratitude it increases my regretyou will not think me officious or intrusive but i cannot tell you how it distresses me that you should endure any mental suffering that you should have troubles or anxieties i had never thought of the possibility of anything unhappy in your life or circumstances since you told me i think of it continually forgive me if i appear presumptuous but you have done so incalculably much forfor usmargaret i mean and meespecially i knowher voice faded to a mere threadi know of course for methat i have wondered whether there was not anything in which i could be of some slight use to you in which i could help you in return adrian had subsided into his long chair again he leaned sideways his legs crossed his right arm extended to its full length across the arm of the chair holding his cigarette between his first and second fingers as far from his companion as possible lest the smoke of it should be unpleasant to her his lean shapely hand and wrist showed brown against the hard white of his shirtcuff and the blue smoke from the smoldering cigarette curled delicately upward in the hot fragrant air and joanna watched his every movement watched with the fixed intentness the beatified idiocy of those who dote outwardly the young man remained charmingly debonair inwardly he labored at the erection of barricades and the strengthening of earthworks with positive frenzy distractedly apprehensive of what might be coming next sympathy so generously given as yours can never be otherwise than helpful dear cousin he said believe me i am deeply touched by the interest you take in me but the trouble i have on my mindand which it was foolish and selfish of me ever to allude to oh no joanna interrupted breathlessly do not say that pray dont it was entirely my doing both margaret and i observed that youyou looked sad that you had grown thinner i questioned you perhaps it was intrusive of me to do so yet how could i remain silent when all which affects you necessarily concerns me so profoundly notwithstanding the high temperature adrian felt something queerly like a trickle of iced water down the length of his spine he just managed not to change his position but remained leaning sideways toward her you are more than kind to me dear cousin he said really more than kind and good but i am sure your ready sympathy will make you comprehend there is a stage of most ennuis private worries and bothers when it is only discreet only indeed honorable to maintain silence yet believe me i shall never forget your amiable solicitude for my happiness some day in the future it may become possible for me to explain yesoh yesin the futurethank youi knowin the future joanna whispered pressing her hands over her eyes and adrian shrank away from her he couldnt help it mercifully she wasnt looking he uncrossed his legs sat upright then leaning forward with bent head he stared at the red and purple quarries of the pavement resting his wrists upon his knees he was about to reply but joannas toneless speech rushed onward pray pray do not suppose that i wish to crossquestion you or force myself into your confidence nothing could be further from my intention than that i am so sure you know far best what to tell and what to withhold from me i could never question your judgment for an instant in this as in everythingyes everythingi am ready and contented to wait only sometimes there are practical ways of being helpful i have lived among business people all my life and i could not help thinking that if there was any schemeconnected with your review for instanceforgive me if i am presumptuousbut any business affair in which you were interested and which might require capital might need financing adrian raised his head slightly his face was drawn and very pale his nostrils quivered he had sufficient selfcontrol to keep his eyes steadily upon the white capering forms of the tennis players there on the other side of the sunny lawn was it conceivable that she joannaof all created womenwas trying to buy him the degradation the infinite disgust of itbut no that really was too vile a thought with all the cleanness all the chivalry of his nature adrian thrust it aside refusing to dishonor her so much again he nerved himself to speak and again her speech rushed onward likeso it seemed to himsome toneless hissing of wind over a barren treeless seedless waste pray pray do not be displeased with me she pleaded i may be acting unconventionally in touching thus upon matters apparently outside my province but as i think you will admit i am at most only forestalling the right the privilege ratherfor to me no privilege could be greaterwhich will be mine later on in the future of which you just now spoke please think of it thus and if my action is premature a little unbecoming or unusual youwho understand everythingwill most surely forgive nocousin adrian do not answer me i implore younot just yet i have longed so earnestly for this opportunity of talking alone with you give me time let me finish i know i do not express myself well but be patient with me when we are together i am only conscious of your presence i become miserably deficient in courage and resource words fail me i am so sensible of my own shortcomings therefore i cannot consent to lose this opportunity there is something i so intensely need to tell you because i cannot help hoping it may lighten the anxieties which have been troubling you during this extraordinary address adrian held himself rigidly still his head again bent while he stared at the red and purple quarries he could not trust himself to move by so much as an inch lest he should betray the repulsion with which she inspired him meanwhile his mind worked like some highpowered engine at full pressure for indeed the situation was extravagant in its unpleasantness how to say anything conclusive without assuming too much passed human wit yet what more fatuous what more execrably bad taste than to assume just that too much he wanted to spare the poor woman and act toward her with as perfect charity as perfect good breeding as he might this is what i have so wanted to tell you adrian joanna went on lately i have felt quite differently about my unfortunate brother about poor bibby of whose unhappy career i spoke to you when you were here before i have learned to think differently upon many subjects in the last three months joanna paused pressing her hands against her forehead yesupon many many subjects she said that is natural inevitable with the wonderful prospect which lies before me the young man braced himself each muscle growing taut as a man braces himself for a lifeanddeath fight but he did not alter his position when we talked of my brother before i told youi thought it right to do sothat i proposed to put aside the larger portion of my fortune for his benefit i believed it my duty to do my utmost to make amends for papas harshness toward him but since then i have come to see the matter in a different light i no longer feel that my brother has the first claim upon me i no longer believe my first duty is to bibby it is to some one else and i have ceased to believe he is still living a strange and deepening conviction has grown upon me that he is dead adrians muscles relaxed he threw back his head and looked into the sky into the strong steady sunlight for hearing joannas last words he hailed salvationsalvation coming be it added from the very queerest and most unexpected quarter consequently i have decided to alter my will joanna continued i scrutinized my own motives carefully i have earnestly tried not to be unduly influenced by my own inclinations but to do what is just and right i have not yet spoken to margaret about it but i intend to make a redistribution of my property devoting that portion of it which i held in reserve for my brother to another personi mean another purpose under my altered circumstances i feel not only that i am justified in doing this but that it has become an imperative obligation were my poor brother still living the news of papas death must have reached him by this time and he would have communicated either with andrew merriman or with me as he has not communicated with either of us i am free to assume the fact of his death you agree with me adrian i am at liberty to make this redistribution of my property youyou assent since you are good enough to ask my advice dear cousin adrian said looking upon the ground and speaking quietly and distinctly i am compelled to answer you truthfully you are not free at the present time in my opinion to make any alteration in your will which affects your bequest to your brother but joanna protested with a smoldering violence but if i am certain morally certain that my unfortunate brother is dead putting a strong force upon himself adrian leaned sideways in his chair again crossing his legs turning his face toward joanna and looking gravely and kindly at her dear cousin he said perhaps i should have acted more wisely had i written or spoken to you before now of a certain discovery which i happened accidentally to make immediately after my return to france i hesitated after the exhausting experiences you had recently passed through to subject you to further anxiety and suspense or to raise hopes which might be fated to disappointment but i possess evidenceto myself conclusivethat your brother was living as lately as three months ago that in february last he was in paris yes i know i sympathizei readily comprehend he went on feelingly how greatly this information is calculated to surprise you on that account i have withheld it and i grieve it is not possible to soften the shock of it by giving a happy account of your brothers state of mind or of his circumstances here the speaker stopped for joanna raised her hand with an almost menacing gesture wait adrian she cried wait i cannot bear any more at present i must accustom myself to this idea it means so much so dreadfully much i must have time to think chapter vi which plays seesaw between a game of lawntennis and a prodigal son coming in by the wicket gate from the carriagedrive challoner sauntered with a deliberate and even proprietary tread along the shrubbery path skirting the eastern side of the lawn he was clothed with a view to sports and pastimes in a loosely fitting gray norfolk jacket white trousers and a hard white straw hat the low crown of it encircled by a band of purpleandscarletstriped ribbon the said hat set on the top of his tall upright head and neck and straight solid figure gave himin outlinean appearance remarkably suggestive of a large medicine bottle with the cork rammed well in over his shoulder he carried a racket from which dangled a pair of by no means diminutive tennis shoes only recently had challoner received invitations to the tower house of this purely social character they gave him the warmest satisfaction as marking progress toward the goal of his ambitions he had been elected to the baughurst park ward by a narrow majority it is true still he had been electedand that was the main thing since it supplied a secure basis from which to manoeuver before the next election if all went welland he would compel all never fear to go wellhe would be in a position to ride roughshod over the baughurst park ward herding its voters to the poll like so many obedient sheep his wits and professional standing plus margaret smyrthwaites fortune and social standing would make him master not only of the baughurst park ward but of all stourmouth yes sir joseph and lady challoner sons perhaps at eton daughters presented at court and marrying into the peerage such beatific visions floated before him and challoner felt then indeed he would not have lived in vain the job of uprooting and deporting mrs gwynnie had been a nasty one it hit him very hard at the time there were moments of it he didnt care to remember very clearly even now but as he sauntered slowly in the still afternoon heat through the aromatic atmosphere of the radiant garden and glanced up at the imposing mass of the big red house its gilt weathervane cutting into the blazing blue he thanked almighty god from his heart piously that he had had the pluck and forethought and resolution to go through with that nasty job of uprooting and deportation only weak men let women wreck them and thank god he joseph challoner wasnt weak meanwhilehere piety had the grace to walk out and let honest cynicism walk in winkingmeanwhile margaret smyrthwaite grew betterlooking and more accessible every day yes unquestionably providence is on the side of the clearheaded helping those who help themselves who know the chance of their lives when it comes along and dont allow sentimental scruples to prevent their fixing right on to it only the unfit go undersuch for instance as that flimsy little baggage mrs gwynnie and if you look at things all round calmly and scientifically how very much better for everybody concerned public morals included that under such very unfit little feminine baggages should very completely and finally go chewing the cud of which philosophic reflections challoner pursued his prosperous and contented way from the tennis court the players waved and called their greetings as he approached them margaret smyrthwaite leaving her seat in front of the pavilion came forward to meet him her smart black figure and enormous hat backed by a bank of crimson and pink rhododendron in full blossom she moved with the rather studied grace of a girl who expects and is altogether ready to be admired challoner had no quarrel with this for his taste she could not be too ornate he appraised her appearance her costume the general effect of her as he might a fine piece of plate for his table well didnt he propose she should be in a sense just thathis domestic and social centerpiece the more glory to him then the more expensive she looked and she could afford to look expensive thank godhere piety stepped in again momentarilyand he could afford to let her look so for once that handsome fortune of hers in his keeping be dd if he would not double or treble it he raised his hat and stood with it in his hand his eyes covered her covetously if she wanted admiration it was hers to order he could supply a perfectly genuine article in unlimited quantity and though his countenance was not an expressive one he contrived to convey the above information to her quite clearly the young lady responded she talked of the weather the heat the game and suchlike inanities but she displayed her fine plumage and trailed her wings all the while challoner began to think of a game of tennis as a wholesome corrective the temperature became high in more senses than the meteorologic one presently she made a gesture calling his attention to her sister and adrian savage sitting on the veranda smiled slyly looking up at him and then turned and sauntered a few steps beside him back along the path witnessing all which suggestive pantomime from his distant station adrian had much ado to maintain an attitude of circumspection and restraint for was it conceivable that those twomargaret and challonerin any degree shared or affected to share poor joannas infatuated delusion was ever man landed in so false a position an atmosphere of intrigue surrounded him he felt as though walking among treacherous quicksands where every step spells danger of being sucked under and engulfed inwardly he tore and plunged cursing against the hateful the dishonoring silence imposed upon him by circumstance he was tempted to rush out on to the sunbathed lawn regardless of all mercy of all decorum and shout to the four winds of heaven his unique inextinguishable devotion to gabrielle st leger his sole desire and love only by some such public loudtongued demonstration did he feel he could regain safe foothold and cleanse his honor from the detestable and insidious duplicity fathered upon him through no act or lapse of his but here joannas voice once more claimed his attention it still hissed and whispered causing him shrinking and repulsion yet he detected a change in the spirit of it some finer more wholesome chord had been struck she no longer cringed i am ready now cousin adrian she said to hear that which you have to tell me about my brother and the young man finding relief to his pentup feelings in voluminous and rapid speech told her how calling late one night upon an old schoolfellow a widely known draftsman and caricaturist he had seen certain drawingshere adrian picked his phrases a littlerepresenting a young man of six or seven and twentywho he said bore such a striking resemblance to you my dear cousin and to margaret that i was transfixed with veritable amazement i do not disguise from you that i was also pained that for the moment i was furious for these pictures were objectionable in character in many respects odious it appeared to me my friend had been guilty of an outrage for which it was my duty to administer sharp chastisement but i could demand no immediate satisfaction because he and i had already quarreled that evening and he concealed himself from me thereby rendering it impracticable that i should question him this perhaps was as well since i was heated and it gave me space for reflection i realized the extreme improbability of his ever having seen either you or your sisterthe absolute impossibility of his having done so recently as you had been at home in england for some years then i recalled the pathetic history of your brother which you had confided to me i grasped the situation i understood i called upon my friend next day still he was rancorous he flew into a passion and refused to admit me i restrained my resentment i wrote to him explaining the gravity and urgency of the case i appealed to his better nature entreated him to be reasonable and to give me information indeed i conducted myself with praiseworthy reticence while he remained obstinate to the point of exasperation upon more than one count i fear i should have derived the very warmest satisfaction from wringing his neck adrians handsome eyes danced and glittered his teeth showed white and wicked under his flyaway mustache yes i on my side also possibly harbored a trifle of rancor he said but i suppressed my legitimate annoyance i ignored his provocations i insisted at last i elicited this much that was very noble of you still it distresses me that indirectly i should have caused you this trouble though i am gratefulsome day i may find words in which to tell you how grateful joanna whispered leaning forward and working her hands together nervously in her black alpaca lap all of which served to bring adrian who had grown quite comparatively at ease and happy in his subjective belaborings of the unspeakable tadpole back to the entanglements and distractions of the immediate present with a bounce upon my word my dear joanna he replied almost brusquely i am afraid it very much remains to be proved whether i deserve your gratitude or not i labor under the ungracious necessity of communicating much to you that is painful that is sad yet having gone thus far it becomes imperative for many reasons that i should put you in possession of all the facts then it will be for you to decide what further steps are to be taken next you will know bestfar best she murmured the young man set his teeth never before had he come so near being cruel to a woman instinctively he crossed himself sancta maria mater dei in mercy preserve him from the guilt of so dastardly a sin he turned to joanna and spoke dealing out his words slowly so that the full meaning of them might reach her beclouded lovesick brain my friend ren dax found this young man whose likeness to you and your sister is so indisputable so intimate in the act of attempting his life ah bibby bibby joanna cried harshly throwing back her head yes adrian continued pursuing his advantage unnerved by the horror of his friendless and destitute condition the unhappy boy was about to throw himself from one of the bridges into the seine at his age one must have suffered very greatly to take refuge in that but from the drawings of which i have spoken one can form only too forcible a conception of his desperation they supply a human document of a deplorably convincing order ren who notwithstanding his eccentricity possesses admirable instincts struggled with him and succeeded in preventing the accomplishment of his fatal design then forcing him into a passing cabkidnapping him in shortcarried him off with him home oh wait wait joanna broke in this is all so very dreadful it is so remote from my experience from all i am accustomed to from all the habits and purposes of my life i do not wish to be selfindulgent and shirk my duty i wish to hear the whole cousin adrian but i must pause i must recover and collect myself if i am to follow your narrative intelligently just then joseph challoner having laid aside hat and jacket and put on tennis shoes came out of the pavilion and joined the group gathered around margaret smyrthwaite on the terraced grass bank of the court challoner had the reputation of being a formidable player his height and reach and sureness of eye more than counterbalancing any lack of agility it may be added that along with a losing game he had the reputation of too often mislaying his manners and losing his temper but this afternoon no question presented itself of losing either game or temper he had practised regularly lately he felt in fine form he felt in high good humor while both sense and senses called for strong physical exercise as a wholesome outlet to emotion amid discussion and laughter marion chase tossed for partners the elder of the busbridge boys fell to her lot the younger to challoners and the set began margaret returned to her chair and amy woodford lolled on the pavilion step in the shadow close beside her fanning a very pink face with a large palmleaf fan as the game progressed the two girls commented and applauded with clapping of hands and derisive or encouraging titterings and cries against this gaily explosive feminine duet the rapid thud of balls and sharp calling of the score joannas voice asserted itself withto her hearera consuming dreariness of interminable and fruitless moral effort a grayness of perpetual nonarrival perpetual frustration misconception and mistake i am composed now adrian she said my will again controls my feelings please tell me the rest i am afraid there is disappointingly little more to tell he replied for two days the unfortunate boy remained with my friend as his guest ren clothed him properly fed and cared for him and paid him liberally for his services as a model but on the third morning under plea of requiring to obtain some particular drug from a neighboring pharmacy the young man left my friends studio he did not return where did he go that is what i have asked myself a thousand times and made every effort to discover i have friends at the prefecture of police i consulted them they were generous in their readiness to put their knowledge at my disposal and aid me in my research unluckily i could only give them a verbal description of the missing man for ren refused me all assistance refused to allow any police agent to view the drawings refused even to allow photographs of them to be taken to do so he declared would constitute an unpardonable act of treachery a violation of hospitality and crime against his own good faith the unhappy fellow had trusted him on the understanding that no inquiry would be made regarding his family or his name now the episode was closed ren did not want it reopened he had other things to think about rather than have the drawings employed for purposes of identification he would destroy them obliterate them with a coat of paint when it became evident however the young man had disappeared for good rens valet less scrupulous than his master carefully examined the wretched clothes he had left behind between the lining and stuff of the jacket he found a small photograph it must have worked through from a rent in the breastpocket though creased and defaced the subject of it was still in a degree distinguishable i did not wish to agitate you my dear cousin by communicating this matter to you until i had made further efforts to discover the truth i sent the photograph to mr merriman he tells me it represents the garden front of your old house highdene near leeds joanna neither moved nor spoke though her breath sighed and caught the sounds from the tennis court meanwhile increased both in volume and in animation causing adrian to look up challoner stood as near to the net as is permissible volleying or smashing down ball after ball until his opponents began to lose heart and science and grow harried and spent and adrian watching found himself though unwillingly impressed by and admiring the force not only the great brute strength but determination of the man which bestowed a certain dignity upon the game raising it from the level of a mere amusement to that of a serious duel and across the intervening space challoner became sensible of that unwilling admirationthe admiration of a quasienemy curiously supplementing another admiration of which he was also consciousnamely that of margaret smyrthwaite of the woman who craves to be justified by public exhibition of his skill and prowess of the man to whom she meditates intrusting her person and her fate this excited challoner flattering his pride stimulating his ambition and belief in himselfyes he would show them all what he was made of show them all what he could do what he was worth so that now he no longer played simply to win a set at tennis from a harmless lanky busbridge boy and amazonlike marion chase but to revenge himself for adrian savages past distrust of him detection and prevention of his shady little business tricks played to revenge himself for the younger mans superiority in breeding knowledge of the world culture talents charm of manner and of looks he gave himself to the paying off of old scores in that game of tennis all his bullying instinct his necessity to beat down and trample opposition under foot actively militant yet since margaret smyrthwaites approval not to mention her goodly fortune came into reckoning the bullying instinct made him deadly cool and cunning rather than headlong or reckless in his play presently joanna silently motioned adrian once again to take up his sordid story and with a feeling of rather hopeless weariness he obeyed recounting his scouring of paris accompanied by a private detective told her of clues found or apparently found only again to be lost told her incidentally a little about the haunts of vagabondage and crime and vice of the seething foulsmelling festering underworld which there as in every great city lies below the genial surface of things ready to drag down and absorb the friendless and the weak so doingwhile he still watched challoner and divined much of the human dramafinding expression in his masterful manipulation of racket and balladrians imagination took fire he forgot his companion gave reign to his natural eloquence and described certain scenes certain episodes with only too telling effect but you must have been exposed to great danger she broke in breathlessly at last ah like that he cried shrugging his shoulders and laughing a little fiercely danger is after all an excellent sauce to meat i had entire confidence in the loyalty and discretion of my companion and we were armed joanna got up pushing away her chair which scrooped upon the quarries and you did all this for mefor my sake because bibby is my brother she exclaimed you risked contracting some illness receiving some injury for me because of bibbys relation to me you endangered your life but in point of fact i didnt suffer in the least my dear joanna he replied rising also i enlarged my acquaintance with a city of which i am quite incorrigibly fond which even at her dirtiest and naughtiest i very heartily love and here i am as you see in excellent health perfectly intact ready to start on my voyage of discovery again tomorrow if there should seem any reasonable hope of its being crowned with success common humanity demands that much of me one cannot let a fellowcreature especially one who has the claim of kinship perish in degradation and misery without making every rational effort to rescue and rehabilitate him joanna hardly appeared to listen she moved to and fro her arms hanging straight at her sides her hands opening and closing in nervous purposeless clutchings no she declared violently no when i think of the risks which you have exposed yourself and the shocking and cruel things which might have happened to you i cannot control my indignation when i think that bibby might have been the cause of your death no vestige of affection for him is left in me nonenonei cast him out of my heart yes it is dreadful looking back all the anguish of which my brother has been the cause is present to methe constant anxiety which his conduct gave rise to the concealments mamma and i had to practise to shield him from papas anger the atmosphere of nervousness and unrest which owing to him embittered my girlhood he was the cause of estrangement between my parents between papa and myself he was the cause of the breakup of our home at leeds of the severing of old friendships and associations of the sense of disgrace which for so many years lay upon our whole establishment it destroyed my mothers health it emphasized the unsympathetic tendencies of my fathers character and now now when so much has happened to redress the unhappiness of the past to glorify and enlarge my life when my future is so inexpressibly full of hope and promise it is too much too much that my brother should reappear that he should intervene between us adrian between you and meendangering your actual existence and he will come backi know it i feel it she added wildly i believed him dead because i wished him dead i still wish it but that is uselessuseless and as though in ironic applause of joannas passionate denunciation the two young ladies watching the game of tennis broke into enthusiastic handclapping well playedgoodgoodsplendidplayed indeed they cried their voices ringing out through the still hot air marion chase flung herself down on the terraced grassbank youre out of sight too strong for us she gasped laughingly we didnt have the ghost of a chance challoner stood wiping his face and neck with his handkerchief he was puffed up with pride almost boisterously exultant ah yes let the henbird display her fine plumage and trail her wings ever so prettily when it came to a fight the cockbird had his innings and could show he wasnt lacking in virility or spunk hed given them all a taste of his metal this afternoon he flattered himself taught them joseph challoner was something more than a common lowcaste officebred country attorney half sharper half lickspittle sneak the gray mare isnt the better horse yet awhile eh miss marion your friends the suffragettes notwithstanding he said jocosely all the same i congratulate you you and your partner made a plucky stand the elder busbridge boy lay on his back panting and tightening the supporting silk handkerchief about his lean young waist my hat that last rally was a breather though he grunted i got regularly fed up with the way you kept me bargeing from side to side of that back court challoner doubledemon allround champion terrifierthats about the name to suit you my good chap joanna had come close to adrian her prominent eyes were strained and clouded seamlike lines showed in her forehead and cheeks her poor mouth looked bruised the outline of her lips frayed and discolored her likeness to the drawings upon the wall was phenomenal just then it shocked adrian and it caused him to think they have finished playing she said they will come in to tea directly i cannot remain and meet them i must show some respect for my own dignity they are all margarets friends i do not care for them i cannot expose myself to their observation she must entertain them herself i will go to my room i must be alone until i have had time to regain my composure until i know my own thought about this cruel cruel event until i have recovered in some degree from the shock i have suffered and begin to see what my duty is chapter vii pistols or politenessfor two this is the last of the documents mr challoner yes that is the last of the lot you noted the contents of schedule d covering the period from the end of the december quarter to the date of mr smyrthwaites death among the priestly mills statement of accounts the typed onequite right yes thats the lot we may consider the whole of our business concluded that is so challoner said he stood in an easy attitude resting his elbow on the shelf of the red porphyrymantelpiece of the smokingroom at heatherleigha heavily furnished apartment the walls hung with chocolatecolored imitation leather in a raised selfcolored pattern of lozengeshaped medallions each centered with a tudor rose the successes of the afternoon still inflated him in addition to his triumphs in sports and pastimes he had managed to say five words to margaret smyrthwaite and though the crucial question had neither been asked nor answered he felt sure of her at last his humor was hilarious and expansiveof the sort which chucks young women under the chin digs old gentlemen in the ribs or slaps them familiarly upon the back there was a covert sneer in the tail of challoners eye and a braggart tang in his talk he swaggered every inch of his big body pleased with living almost brutally selfcongratulatory and content i am really under considerable obligation to you for giving up your evening to me and letting me finish our business after officehours thus it will enable me to catch the night crosschannel boat from dover tomorrow i shall be particularly glad to do so as he spoke adrian swung round the revolving chair in which he sat before the large writingtableloaded with bundles of folded papers and legal documents engrossed on vellum tied round with pink tape in turning the light from the shaded incandescent gaslamp hanging directly above the table brought his black hair and beard and white face into the high relief of some rembrandt portrait whats up with young master highty tighty challoner asked himself looks off color somehow as if hed had an uncommon nasty blow below the belt the windows and glass door stood open on to the garden and the pungent scents of the great fir woods drawn forth by the days sunshine mingled with that of challoners cigar and adrians cigarette oh so youre off at once then are you the former said thats something new isnt it i understood from the ladies you thought of stopping on here a bit and when may we hope for the pleasure of seeing you again on this side of the silver strip adrian leaned back in his chair stretching out his legs and crossing his feet at the present time i really have no idea he replied challoner could hardly conceal his glee for an instant he debated concluded he would venture on a reconnaissance flicked the end off his cigar into the fireplace miss joanna will be sorry he said both my cousins have been perfect in their amiability in their hospitality in their generous appreciation of any small services it has been in my power to render them adrian declared rolling his rs and speaking with the hint of a foreign accent common to him when tired or vexed my cousins know that they can command my cooperation at a moments notice should they require counsel or advice but my own affairs as they kindly and readily comprehend cannot be too long neglected my interests and my work are necessarily abroadin france it becomes imperative that i should return to my work not a doubt about it challoner said work stands first though i own im glad my work doesnt oblige me to expatriate myself i shouldnt relish that not a bit poor old englands good enough for me preciselyyour interests and your work are here challoner fitted the toe of his boot into the pattern of the hearthrug looking down and permitting himself a quiet laugh oh lord yes he said to be sure my work and my interests are here right enoughvery much here im not ashamed of the word local or of the word provincial either mr savage my father invented stourmouth as you may say and ive patented his invention stourmouth owes a good deal to the two joseph challoners father and son and i propose it should owe a long sight more one way and another before i join my poor old daddy under the churchyard sod it is an act of piety to devote ones talents and energies to the welfare of ones native place adrian returned and therewith judging he had made sufficient concession to the exigencies of the position in the matter of general conversation he rose to depart but challoner stopped him just half a minute will you please mr savage he said it occurs to me if were not likely to meet for some time theres one matter i ought to mention to you i dont exactly care to take the whole onus of the thing upon my own shoulders of course if youre cognizant of it theres the beginning and end of the story as far as my responsibility goes i may have my own opinion as to the wisdom andnot to mince mattersthe honesty of the arrangement but if you are aware of it and approve my mouth of course is shut has miss smyrthwaite told you of the alteration she proposes making in her will yes she spoke of it today and i dissuaded her from making it challoner sucked in his breath with a soft whistle indeed he said thats a selfdenying ordinance adrian held himself extremely erect his eyebrows were raised and the tip of his pugnacious nose was very much in the air pardon me but i do not quite follow you he said miss smyrthwaite didnt explain the nature of the alterations very fully then i take it my cousin informed me that she proposed to revoke certain gifts and bequests she had made to her brother william smyrthwaitesupposing him still to be living of this i disapproved i told her so giving her the reasons for my disapproval challoner looked down and fitted the toe of his boot into the hearthrug pattern once more you hold the property should remain in the familygo to the direct heirs the next of kin a very sound principle but one if youll excuse my saying so few persons stick to where their personal advantage is involved i repeat i fail to follow you adrian returned shrugging his shoulders and spreading out his hands with an impatient movement perhaps miss smyrthwaite omitted to explain that this redistribution of her property was exclusively in your favor all she mulcted her precious specimen of a brother of was to go not to her direct heirher sisterbut to yourself whereupon it must be conceded the younger mans bearing became not a little insolent preposterous my dear challoner utterly preposterous he cried for once your professional acumen must have quite scandalously deserted you or you could not have so misunderstood my cousins instructions it was not challoners cue to lose his temper he had too many causes for selfcongratulation tonight and then whether adrian was bluffing or not he believedthough it was annoying to find the young man so unmercenarythis repudiation of the proffered inheritance to be sincere joannamiss smyrthwaite i mean i beg her pardonis too good a woman of business to trust to verbal instructions i have got the whole thing on paper in black and white therehe pointed to the table i can lay my hand on it in half a minute possibly youd like to look at it yourself as you appear to doubt my word but for the moment adrian was incapable of reply this was what joanna had meant it was even worse than he had feared he felt humiliated hot with shame and then in spirit he clasped those infamous drawings upon the wall and the subject of them bibby the miserable wastrel bibby to his breast do you wish to look at miss smyrthwaites instructions as to the transfer of her property mr savage challoner repeated a sneer in his voice but the young man had recovered his native adroitness clearly it would be superfluous for me to do so because as i have already informed you miss smyrthwaite recognizing the validity of my arguments decides to cancel those instructions to make no alteration in the disposition of her property happily i was in a position to convince her that it is premature to assume the fact of her brothers death i have comparatively recent news of him challoners jaw dropped the devil you have he said under his breath yesthe devil quite possiblyas you so delicately put it adrian returned lightly i have been tempted at moments to put it myself so my dear mr challoner at others i have seemed to trace a really providential element in this strange affair directly the facts of william smyrthwaites reappearance came to my knowledge i placed mr andrew merriman in full possession of them oh you did did you challoner commented yes i considered this the correct course to pursue mr merriman was formerly employed by mr smyrthwaite as the channel of communication between himself and his son graceless young hound challoner snarled caution swamped by anger and chagrin it made him mad to think adrian savage had had this eminently disconcerting piece of information up his sleeve all along once more hed been checkmated mr merriman generously accepts all responsibility in the conduct of this matter adrian went on and i am sure you will feel with me that his long and intimate connection with my cousins family renders him quite the most suitable person to deal with it therefore until further developments declare themselvesi beg your pardon you express a pious hope further developments never will declare themselves possibly that might save trouble but i fear the saving of trouble is hardly the main point in the present case therefore until they do declare themselves you will i feel sure agree that it is most undesirable this subject should be spoken about discussion of it can only cause my cousins agitation and heighten their suspense this i am naturally most anxious they should be spared nothing meanwhile will be neglected i shall do my part mr merriman will do his i will ask you therefore to consider this conversation as strictly confidential oh you neednt be afraid i shall blab challoner said poor girl he went on presently pronouncing that dangerous catchword as though it rhymed with curlpoor girl poor miss margaret itll be an awful blow to her she is so sensitive shes given me to understandindirectly of coursewhen weve been talking over business what an outandout rotter this precious brother of hers was to my mind you know mr savage its not a nice thing to turn such vermin as young smyrthwaite loose on two defenseless women i dont like it honestly i dont so you neednt be afraid of my blabbing my whole object out of respect for the ladies and for poor old smyrthwaites memory will be to keep matters dark at the same time i note what you say about merriman which i take it is equivalent to telling me to keep my hands off very good mr savage what i have just said proves i think that i am more than willing to keep my hands very much off this very dirty job still there is one question which even so i imagine i am at liberty to ask are you sure of your facts to adrian savage it appeared only two alternatives were open to himnamely to treat his host with studied politeness or call him out and england perhaps unfortunately is no longer a dueling country adrians manner became elaborately sweet as far as they go he said i am dear mr challoner absolutely sure of my facts as far as they go well theres room for hope they maynt go very far thenmay be something of the nature of a scare in short and if i may be allowed one question more has this very edifying piece of family news been communicated to margaret toto whom adrian said with a civil interrogatory face raised eyebrows and a slightly elongated neck sorry i didnt speak plainly enough challoner snarled back communicated to your cousin mr savage miss margaret smyrthwaite not by me the other returned smiling affably and now my dear mr challoner he went on since these labors in which we have been associated are at an end let me thank you warmly for your able concurrence and for the priceless assistance you have given me in the administration of mr smyrthwaites estate accept also my thanks for your courtesy in permitting me to come here to your charming house tonight adrian glanced around the forbidding apartment i carry away with me so many interesting and instructive impressions he said but now i really must trespass upon your time and indulgence no longer again thanksand since i leave at a comparatively early hour tomorrow goodby mr challonergoodby goodnight chapter viii nuit de mai some halfhour later adrian turned into the garden of the tower house by the wicket gate opening off the carriagedrive and so doing the tranquil beauty of the night made itself felt during his walk from heatherleigh his preoccupation had been too great to admit of the bestowal of intelligent attention upon outward things however poetic their aspect he possessed the comfortable assurance it is true of having worsted the animal challoner in the only way possible swords and pistols being forbidden he also possessed the comfortable assurance of having scrupulously and successfully regulated the affaire smyrthwaite in as far as business was concerned and taken his discharge in respect of it but the events of the afternoon had proved to him beyond all shadow of doubt and denial the existence of a second affaire smyrthwaite compared with which regulation of hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of property was from his personal standpoint but the veriest bagatelle now the question of how to deal with this second affaire alike scrupulously and successfully racked his brain usually so direct in decision so prompt in honorable instinct and thought and it was to the young mans credit that while fully measuring the abominable nature of the hole in which the unhappy joanna had put him he remained just and temperate in his judgment of joanna herself the more to his credit because as a native of a country where certain subjects are treated in a spirit of merry commonsensewhich if it makes in some degree for license also makes for absence of hypocrisy and much wholesome delight in lifejoannas attitude offered an obscure problem were she a vicious woman his position would be a comparatively simple one but joanna and vice were he felt far as the poles asunder even that ugly matter of trying to buy himas in his first overwhelming disgust he had defined itproved on calmer inspection innocent of any intention of offense she didnt know poor dear woman she didnt know in her virtuous ignorance of certain fundamental tendencies of human nature of the correlative action of body and spirit she had not a conception of the atrocities she was in process of committing for she was essentially highminded deephearted sincere a positive slave to the demands of her own overdeveloped moral sense but heavens and earth if only those responsible for her education had taught her a little more about the nature of the genus homomale and femaleand the physiology of her own emotions and a little less about quite supererogatory theoretic ethics the burning though veiled passion from which he recoiled was he believed in great measure the result of the narrow intellectualism on which she had been nurtured working upon a naturally ardent temperament what she must have suffered what she would suffer in the coming days for it was that last which hit adrian hardest in all this distracting imbroglio giving him that uncommon nasty blow below the belt the effects of which joseph challoner had noted the more he analyzed and analyzing excused joannas attitude the more odiously distasteful did his own position become in how far was he to blame what had he done by word act or look to provoke or to foster joannas most lamentable infatuation he explored his memory and to his rather bitter amusement found it an absolute blank he had not flirted with her even within the most restrained of the limits sanctioned by ordinary social intercourse for this he did not commend himself on the contrary he felt almost penitent sincethere hadnt been any temptation to flirt positively not anythough adrian knew himself to be by no means insensible to feminine influence he loved madame st leger she constituted so to speak the religion of his heart but he found dozens of other women charming and did not scruple toas good astell them sowhy not are not such tellings the delightful and perfectly legitimate small change of a gallant mans affections and out of the farthings and halffarthings the very fractions of halffarthings indeedof such small change joanna had constructed a great and serious romance terminating in matrimony the young man could have beat his breast torn his hair poured ashes upon his thus forcibly denuded scalp and rent his uptodate and particularly welltailored garments he adrian savage the husband of joannafrom this his lively gallic imagination galloped away blushing in humorous horror utterly refusing to contemplate the picture at the same time his pity for her was immense and how oh how without gross and really sickening cruelty to dispel her disastrous delusion with the above question upon his lips adrian turned by the wicket gate into the garden where the tranquil beauty surrounding him compelled his observation high above the darkfeathered crests of the firs the moon two days short of the full rode in the southeastern sky obliterating all stars in the vicinity of her pathway she showed tonight not as a flat disk plastered against the solid vault but as a mammoth delicately tarnished silver ball traveling in stateliest fashion the steelblue fields of space the roofs and faade of the house its multiplicity of glinting windowpanes the lawns and shrubberies and allencircling woodland were alike overlaid with the searching whiteness of her light the air was dry and very mellow rich with a blending of forest and garden scents faintly to northward adrians ear could detect the rattle and grind of a belated tram on the barryport road and southward the continuous wistful murmur of the miledistant sea now as often before he was sensible of the subtle charm produced by this conjunction of a highly finished material civilization with gently savage and unsubjugated nature england is in so great measure a sylvan country even yet a country of closecoming abounding and invading trees and when as now just upon midnight its transitory human populationswhich in silly pride suppose themselves proprietors of the soil and all that grows upon itare herded safe indoors abed and asleep the trees resume their primitive sovereignty making their presence proudly evident they had no voice tonight it is true they stood becalmed and silent yet the genius of them both in their woodland unity and endless individual diversity of form and growth declared itself nevertheless for this last the infiltration of moonlight was partly accountable since it lent each stem branch and twig each differing species of foliagethe large leaves of laurel and rhododendron the semitransparent fringed and fluted leaves of the beech the finely spiked tufts of firneedlesa definiteness and separateness such as hoarfrost might each tree and bush stood apart from its fellows in charming completeness and relief challenging the eye by a certain sprightly independence of mien and aspect had they moved from their fixed places the big trees mingling in some stately procession or dance while the shrubs and bushes frisked upon the greensward adrian would hardly have been surprised a spirit of phantasy was abroadhere in the baughurst park ward local municipal government notwithstandingentrancing to his poetic sense therefore he lingered walking slowly along the path leading to the garden entrance of the house here shaded by a broken line of tall scotch firs their smooth stems rising like pillars bare of branches for some twenty or thirty feet now and again he stopped held captive by the tranquil yet disquieting beauty of the scene it reminded him strangely of gabrielle st legers beauty and the something elusive delicately malicious and ironic in the character of it her smiling unclosed lips the dimple in her left cheek those mysterious oblique glances from beneath her longshaped halfclosed eyelids full at once of invitation and reserve the untamed deliciously tricksy spirit he apprehended in her and a something majestic too as of those vast calm steelblue fields of spacethese all and severally he loverlike found mirrored in the loveliness of this may night on his left the lawns flooded by moonlight stretched away to the tennis court and the terrace walk in front of the pavilion on his right backed by the line of scotch firs aforesaid a thick wall of deciduous shrubsallspice lilac syringa hydrangea sweetbrier and laburnumshut out the carriagedrive the quaint leathery flowers of the allspice gave off a powerful and luscious sweetness as of sunripened fruit adrian paused inhaling it gazing meanwhile in fond imagination into la belle gabrielles goldenbrown eyes refreshingly forgetful of the distracting perplexities of the affaire smyrthwaite no it was a good moment at once chaste and voluptuous wherein the very finest flame of ideal love burned upon his hearts altar but it was broken up by an arresting apparition for a white owl swept phantomlike out of the plantation behind the pavilion and beat over the moonlit turf in swift and absolutely noiseless flight a soft thistledown could hardly have passed more lightly or silently than the great widewinged bird beneath it its shadow skimming the closecut surface of the grass seemed as much alive and more substantial than itself twice while adrian watched moved and a little startled it quartered the lawn in search of prey then flung itself up high in air vanishing among the treetops with a longdrawn hoohoohooing of hollow laughter and in the space of a few seconds from the recesses of the woodland its mate answered with a faroff elfin echo of its sinister note then adrian heard a window open and on to the far end of the redbalustraded balconyextending along the first floor of the house in the recess above the verandaa woman came she was dressed in a white nglig of some soft woolen material which hung straight in knifeedge pleatings from her shoulders to her feet covering themas the young man could see between the widespaced balustersand lying outspread for some inches around her upon the floor over this she wore a black cloak straighthanging too made of some fine and supple fur the fronts of it which were thrown open leaving her arms free appeared to be lined with ermine her peculiar garb and the perceptible angularity of her form and action suggested some crabbed medieval figure of church woodcarving or memorial brass the woman looked so tall standing there as in a mural pulpit high against the housefront that at first sight adrian took her to be marion chase but medieval and ecclesiastical associations were a little too glaringly out of place in connection with that remarkably healthy young amazon and athlete adrian dismissed them with a sensible sinking of the heart instinctively he moved aside seeking the deepest of the shadows cast by the firtrees pressing himself back among the bushes of sweetflowered allspice of two evils one must choose the least concealment was repugnant to him but to go forward meant to be recognized and compelled to speak and to play the part of hero in some grim travesty of the garden scene from romeo and juliet was of the two vastly the more repugnant becoming aware of a movement in the garden below the woman leaned forward and gazed fixedly in his direction showing in the bleaching moonlight joanna smyrthwaites heavy upturned hair strained prominent eyes and almost terrible face so ravaged was it by emotion the night traffics in exaggerations and adrians senses and sensibilities were already somewhat overstimulated perhaps therefore it followed that looking up at joanna she appeared to him clothed in hieratic garments as the elect exponent and highpriestess of all lovelorn unmated childless womanhood throughout the world to him just then her aspect gathered up and embodied the fiercely disguised sufferings of all the barren the ugly the ungifted the undesired and unsought of that disfranchised multitude of women whose ears have never listened to recitation of a certain song of songs her youthshe was as young as heher wealth the ease leisure solid luxury which surrounded her her possession of those material advantages which make for gaiety and security for pleasant vanities for participation in all the lighthearted activities of modern life only deepened the tragedy denied by man andsince she was without religiondenying god she did indeed offer a piteous spectacle the more so that he apprehended a toughness of fiber in her arguing a power of protracted and obstinate resistance happier for her surely had she been made of weaker stuff like her wretched brother of the vile drawings upon ren daxs studio wall adrians own personal share in this second and tragic affaire smyrthwaite came home to him with added poignancy as he stood thus in hiding amid the luscious sweetness of the flowering allspice for one intolerable moment he questioned whether he could whether he should sacrifice himself transmuting joannas besotted delusion into fact and truth but reason honor love the demands of his own rich vitality his keen value of life and of the delights of living his poetic and his artistic sense the splendid call of all the coming years his shrewdness his caution his english humor and his gallic wit arose in hot and clamorous rebellion shouting refusal final and absolute he couldnt do it death itself would be preferable it came very simply to thishe could not just then he saw joanna draw her costly cloak about her neck and shoulders as though struck by sudden and sharp cold again the sinister note of the owls in greeting and in answer came from the recesses of the great woodland and again joanna leaning forward scrutinized the shadows of the garden path with pale strained eyes then raising both hands and pressing them against her forehead as though in physical pain she turned and went indoors closing the window behind her both pity and policy kept the young man for another far from agreeable five minutes in the shelter of the allspice bushes before venturing into the open upon the veranda he waited again conscious of intense reluctance to enter the house he knew his decision to be sane and right the only one possible in respect of joanna yet he felt like a criminal a betrayer a profligate trader in womens affections he called himself hard names knowing them all the while to be inapplicable and unjust but his sympathies were excited his imagination horrorstruck by that lately witnessed vision of feminine disfranchisement and distress at his request the menservants had left the door opening from the veranda unlocked passing along the corridor into the hall he became very sensible of the silence and suspended animation of the sleeping house the curtains of the fivelight twentyfoot staircase window were drawn back through the leaded panes of thickened clouded glass moonlight filtered stamping misty diaperwork upon walls and floor painting polished edges and surfaces of woodwork with lines and patches of shining white on a small table at the foot of the stairs decanters and glasses a cutglass jug of iced water a box of cigars silver candlestick and matchbox had been placed against his return but the young man was in no humor just now for superfluous drinks or superfluous lights he felt apprehensive childishly distrustful of the quiet reigning in the house as though behind it some evil lay in wait to leap upon and capture him he felt nervous this at once annoyed him and made him keenly observant and alert he stood a moment listening then ran up the wide shallow tread of the stairs lightly three steps at a time on the level of the halfflight under the great window he paused the air was hot and heavy his heart beat a door opened from the right on to the gallery above some one came forward with a soft dragging of draperies over the thick carpet through the dim checkerings of the moonlight adrian joanna called whisperingly adrian is that you the young man took a long breath his nerves grew steady he came calmly up the remaining halfflight his head carried high his face serious his eyes a little hard and very bright childish fears exaggerations of selfcondemnation left him at the sound of joannas voice but he was sorry very sorry both for her andfor himself yes cousin joanna he answered and his speech to his own hearing had a somewhat metallic ring in it if there must be an interview at this highly indiscreet hour of the night it should at least be open and aboveboard conducted in tones which the entire household could if it chose hear plainly enough both for his own honor and joannas this was best i have just come back from heatherleigh he continued you will be glad to know that mr challoner and i have finished the business connected with your fathers property all outstanding accounts and all duties upon the estate are now paid all documents are signed receipted and in order joanna made an impatient gesture as though thrusting aside some foolish obstruction yes she said no doubt but it is not about the property i need to speak to you adrian my mind is quite at ease about that it is about something else it is about myself ah yes the young man inquired gravely i did not come down to dinner tonight i felt sure you would understand and excuse me i could not i could not have borne to be with margaret and marion chase and to listen to their trivial talk in your presence after our conversation of this afternoon i had to be alone that i might think that i might bring my temper into subjection to my will isherwood told me you had gone out after dinner but i felt i could not rest without seeing you again tonight i felt i must speak to you must ask your forgiveness must try to explain so i waited up the owls startled me and i went on to the balcony i fancied you were in the garden but i could not see you later i heard your footstepsjoanna paused breathlesslyyour footsteps she repeated upon the pavement of the veranda my courage failed i felt ashamed to meet you but it would be so very dreadful to have you think harshly of meso so i came owing to the vague quality of the light adrian failed to see her face distinctly and for this he was thankful but he knew that her arms hung straight at her sides and that under cover of her costly cloak her poor hands clutched and clutched against the white knifepleatings of her dress dear cousin he said i have no cause to think harshly of you indeed my thought has been occupied with sympathy for the trials that you have already undergone and with regret that i should be instrumental in recalling distressing events to your mind ah i deserve no sympathy she declared vehemently turning aside and moving restlessly to and fro i do not deserve that excuses should be made for me this afternoon i showed my character in a shocking light perhaps it was the true light perhaps my character is objectionable i both felt and said what was cruel and intemperate i was selfish i only considered my own happiness i repudiated my duty toward my brother i wished him dead because his return and all the anxiety and thought the probability of that return necessarily occasions interfered with my own plans with my own beautiful prospects and hopes she came close standing before the young man her hands clasped her body visibly shuddering beneath her hieratic garments now i have come to myself adrian i realizeindeed i realizethe enormity of my own callousness my own selfishness i realize too the dreadful impression of my nature which you must have received if you repudiated me i should have no valid cause for complaint my reason forces me to acknowledge that i deserve your censure that if you turn from medreadful dreadful as it would bei shall have brought that misery upon myself dreadful dreadful she moaned too dreadful to contemplateyet deserved invited by the exhibition of my own ungovernable temperdeservedthere is the sting of it butbut my dear joanna adrian broke forth carried out of himself by the spectacle of her grief you are fighting with shadows you are torturing yourself with nonexistent iniquities calm yourself dear cousin look at things quietly and in a reasonable spirit your brother is unfortunately unsatisfactory and troublesome a difficult person to deal with his errors of conduct have caused his family grave inconvenience and sorrow let us be honest let us freely admit all that he is not a young man to be proud of what more natural then than that you should recoil from the idea of his return that in the first shock of the idea being presented to you you should strongly express your alarm your distaste it is only human who but a hypocrite or pedant would condemn you for that calm yourself dear cousin be just to yourself i could not permit you to revoke your gifts to your brother my own honor was a little involved there perhaps adrian smiled at her reassuringly putting some force upon himself let us be sensible he continued let us be moderate at the present time we have no reliable information as to where your brother is we may not discover him he may never come back meanwhile i implore you dismiss this painful subject from your mind be merciful to your own nerves dear joanna remember andrew merriman and i engage to do our best to exercise all care all delicacy in the prosecution of our inquiries when necessary we will consult with youhe spread out his hands his head a little on one side consolatory debonair charmingah dear cousin be adviseddo not agitate yourself further leave it all at that joanna sighed once or twice put up her hands pressing them against her forehead her body swayed slightly as she stood her hands dropped at her side again she looked fixedly intently at adrian savage her mouth was a little open the ecstatic expression so nearly touching upon idiocy had come back then nothing is changednothing is altered between us she whispered the young man took her hand and bowing low over it kissed it as he raised himself he looked her full in the face no nothing my dear cousin he said there were tears in his eyes and his voice shook he was filled with apology with immeasurable concern and regret with an immeasurable craving for her forgiveness in that he spoke actual and literal truth for nothing was changedno nothinghe never had loved he did not love he never could love joanna smyrthwaite he stayed for no further word or look practically he ran away but there is just one thing on the face of the earth from which a brave man may run without smallest accusation of cowardicenamely a woman who loves him and whom he does not love once in his room adrian bolted the door on the inside as well as locking it and began to pack he would take the midday rather than the night crosschannel boat tomorrow then with relief he remembered that it was already tomorrow in a few hours the servants would be about twice before dawn he fancied he heard footsteps and a soft dragging of draperies over the carpet of the corridor he opened the windows wide and let in the singing of birds greeting the morning from the woodland for the sound of those footsteps and softly dragging draperies cut him to the heart with sorrow for womanhood unfulfilledwomanhood denied by man and not having religion denying god iv the folly of the wise chapter i reenter a wayfaring gossip the last of miss beauchamps receptions for the season drew to a vivacious close sunday would witness the running of the grand prix then the world would begin to scatter leaving paris to the inquiring foreigner the staggering sunshine some few millions of the governing classesnew stylethe smells the sparrows and the dust as a woman consciously looking threescore and ten in the face anastasia felt very tired her throat was husky and her back ached but as a hostess she felt elate gratified even touched for everybody had come had worn their smartest new summer clothes had been animated complimentary appreciative had drunk china tea or iced coffee eaten strawberries and cream sweetmeats ices and wonderful little cakes and declared mademoiselle beauchamps ravishing fiveoclock to be entirely different from and superior to any other fiveoclock of the whole of their united and separate experience art and letters were of course fully represented but politics and diplomacy made a fair show as well anastasia greeted three members of the chamber two of the senate a cabinet minister and a contingent from the personnel of both the english and the italian embassies the coveted red ribbon was conspicuous by its presence and all these delightful people had the good sense to arrive in relays so that the roomsthe furniture of them disposed against the wallshad never throughout the afternoon been too crowded for circulation had never been too hot delicious nanny legrenzi of the opra comique sangand lookedlike an impudent angel ludovico mller played like a whirlwind a zephyr a lost soul a quite rampantly saved soulwhat you will and every one talked heavenly powers how they had talkedtheir voices rising from a gentle adagio through a tripping capriccioso to the magnificently sustained fortissimo so welcome so indescribably satisfying to the ear of the practised hostess yes all had gone well excellently well and now they were in act of departing anastasia weary but genial and amused on capital terms with her fellowcreatures and with herself stood in the embrasure of one of the windows in the second room of the suite behind her red and pink rambler roses and ferns in pots formed a living screen against the glass pleasantly tempering the light ludovico mller had just made his bow and exit leaving the musicroom empty while in the first and largest room madame st leger who helped her to receive today bade farewell to the guests as they passed on into the cool lofty hall i have entertained him the best i know miss beauchamp lewis byewater said but he did not appear keen to converse on general topics seemed to need to specialize wanted to have me tell him just who every one present was his talent always lay in the direction of biographical researchmodern biography well understood and so like a dear kind young man you told him who everybody was within the limits of my own acquaintance i did so but you see in this crowd quite a number of persons were unknown to me byewatera clean fair ingenuous and slightly unfinishedlooking youth with a candid shining forehead carefully tooled and gilded teeth a meager allowance of hair a permanent pincenez and a pronounced transatlantic accentexplained conscientiously i did my best and when i got through with my facts i started out to invent i believe i thickened up the ranks of the french aristocracy to a perfectly scandalous extent but the colonel appeared thirsty on titles a form of thirst entirely unknown to your side of the atlantic anastasia retorted never mind if you have done violence to the purity of your republican principles by a promiscuous ennobling of my guests you have sinned in the cause of friendship my dear byewater and i am infinitely obliged to you but where is colonel haig now in the outer parlor i believe watching madame st leger wish the rearguard goodday he proposes to remain to the bitter end of this reception miss beauchamp he confided as much to me he is sensible of having the time of his life re parisian society people so he proposes to stick but you must be pretty well through with any wish for entertaining by this the kindly fellow went onso you just tell me truly if you would prefer to have me go off right now or have me wait awhile till the colonel shows signs of getting more satiated and take him along too i intended proposing to dine him somewhere anyway tonight you are the very nicest of all nice young men and unquestionably i shall meet you in heaven anastasia asserted heartily and as i shall arrive there so long before you you may count on my saying all manner of handsome things to st peter about you oh yes stay my dear boy and carry the titlethirsty colonel away with you by all manner of means stay byewater flushed up to the top of his shining forehead he looked at her shyly out of his clear guileless eyes i do not feel to worry any wearing amount over the apostle miss beauchamp he said slowly i believe it is more mr adrian savage at the present who stands to break up my rest if you could say some favorable things about me to him i own it would be a let up he accepted my articles upon the eighteenthcentury stage but i do not seem any forwarder with getting them positively published i suppose he is holding them over for the dead season well i presume there is appropriateness in that for seeing the time it has lain in his office the manuscript must be very fairly motheaten by this oh trust me anastasia cried genially ill jog his memory directly i see himwhich i shall do as soon as he returns from england never fear ill hustle him to some purpose if youll stay now and deliver me from this military genealogical incubus lookhow precious a contrasthere they come madame st leger entered the room talking smiling while rentoul haig short but valiantly making the most of his inches his chest well forward neat as a new pin his countenance rosy furiously pleased and furiously busy with something between a marching and a dancing step paraded proudly beside her la belle gabrielle had discarded black garments and blossomed delicately into oystergray chiffon and a silk netted tunic to match finished with selfcolored silk embroideries and deep sweeping knotted fringe the crown of her widebrimmed gray hat was massed with soft drooping ostrich plumes of the same reposeful tint which lifted a little waving slightly as she advanced a scarlet tinge showed in the round of her charming cheeks mischief looked out of her eyes and tipped the corners of her smiling mouth she was indeed much diverted by the small and pompous british warrior strutting at her side he offered example of a type hitherto unknown to her she relished him greatly she also relished the afternoons experiences they were exhilarating she felt deliciously mistress of herself and deliciously lighthearted it is comparatively easy to despise the world when you are out of it but now the seclusion of her mourning being over returning to the world she could not but admit it a vastly pleasant place this afternoon it had broadly smiled upon her and she found herself smiling back without any mental reservation in respect of ideas and causes at seven and twenty though you may hesitate to circumscribe your personal liberty by marriage with one man the homage of many menif respectfully offeredis by no manner of means a thing to be sneezed at gabrielle st leger did not sneeze at it on the contrary she gathered admiring looks nicely turned compliments emulous attentions veiled ardors of manner and of speech into a bouquet so to speak to tuck gaily into her waistband the sense of her own beauty and of the power conferred by that beauty was joyful to her under the stimulus of success her tongue waxed merry so that she came off with flying colors from more than one battle of wit and for some reason all this went to make her think with unusual kindliness of her absent lover in this vivacious mundane atmosphere adrian savage would be so eminently at home and in place his presence moreover would give just that touch of romance that touch of sentiment to the sparkling present whichand there gabrielle thought it safest to stop ah it has been so very very agreeable your party most dear friend she said in her pretty careful english taking her hostesss hand in both hers i find myself quite sorrowful that it should be at an end i could say and please how soon may we begin all over again like my little bette when she too is happy dear child dear child anastasia returned affectionately almost wistfully for nostalgia of youth is great in those who though bravely acquiescent are no longer young gray hair happened to be the fashion in paris this season about a week previously miss beauchamp had mysteriously closed her door to all comers today she emerged grayheaded this transformation at once perplexed and pleased her many friends if it admitted her age and by lessening the eccentricity of her appearance made her less conspicuous it gave her an added dignity strangely softening and refining the expression of her largefeatured slightly masculine face just now in a highly ornate black lace and white silk gown and suite of ruby ornaments set in diamondswhereby hung a tale not unknown to a certain hidden gardenanastasia beauchamp in the younger womans opinion showed not only as an impressive but as a noble figure ah yes and you should know colonel aig the latter continued the aspirate going under badly in her eagerness since you have not for so long a time seen her that it is always thus with mademoiselle beauchamp at her parties she produces a mutual sympathy between her guests so that while in her presence they adore one another it is her secret she makes all of us at our happiest at our best we laugh but we are also gentlehearted we desire to do good that is so byewater put in nasally i indorse your sentiments madame st leger when i came over i believed i should find i had left the finest specimens of modern woman behind in america but i was mistaken miss beauchamp is positively great andand me mr byewater gabrielle asked with a naughty mouth oh well youmadame st leger the poor youth faltered turning away modestly his countenance flaming very bright red i require no assurances regarding our hostesss brilliant social gifts rentoul haig declared mouthing his words so as to make himself intelligible to this foreign or semiforeign audience my memory carries me back to the year one my dear colonel the year one anastasia interruptedthe old days at beauchamp sulgrave great changes there alas since my poor brothers death between death duties and land taxes my cousin cant afford to keep the place up or thinks he cant which amounts to much the same thing he is trying to sell a lot of the farms at beauchamp st annes hear england is being ruined by those iniquitous land taxes i give you my word miss beauchamp simply ruined take beauchamp sulgrave for instance perfect example of an english countryhouse amply large enough yet not too large for comfort and really lovely grounds just the type of place that always has appealed to me i remember every stick and stone of it i give you my word i find it difficult to speak with moderation of these radical nobodies whose thieving propensities endanger the preservation of such places on the old hospitable and stately basis i remember my regiment was in camp at beauchamp st annesi am afraid it was in the seventiesand your party from sulgrave used kindly to drive over to tea regimental sports and impromptu gymkhanas charming summer how it all comes back to me miss beauchamp he cleared his throat pursing up his lips and nodding his head quite sentimentally really i cannot say what a resuscitation of pleasant memories it gave me when our mutual friend savage mentioned your name one day at my cousin the smyrthwaites house at stourmouth this winter directly my doctor ordered me to aixlesbainsa touch of gout nothing more serious my health is and always has been excellent i am thankful to sayi determined to remain a few days in paris on my way out in the hope of renewing our acquaintance savage told me gabrielle had dropped her friends hand ah these climbing roses are they not ravishing she exclaimed advancing her nose to the pink clusters daintily see then m byewater if you please can you tell me the name of them i think i will buy some to decorate my own drawingroom the colors would sympathizearmonizeis it that yesso prettily with my carpetyou recall the tone of my carpetand of my curtains though whether it is worth while since i so soon leave paris is that so madame st leger byewater asked rather blankly savage is a delightful fellow a really delightful fellow rentoul haig asserted largely for the summer oh yes la belle gabrielle almost gabbled i take my mother and my little girl to thehow do you sayto the seabathings on the norman coast i have rented a chalet the climate is invigorating it will benefit my mother whose health causes me anxieties and my little girl will enjoy the society of some little friends whose parents rent for this season a neighboring villa ah precisely that is what i want to talk to you about come and sit down colonel haig anastasia raised her voice slightly hereyeson the settee and now about adrian savage i confess i begin to look upon this executorship as an imposition it is not quite fair on him poor dear fellow it occupies time and thought which would be expended much more profitably elsewhere he is as good as gold about it all but i know he feels it a most inconvenient tie it interferes with his literary work which is serious and with his social life herewith his friendships yes i do not usually go to the coast i accompany my mother to her native provinceto savoymadame st legers voice had also risen to chambry where we have relations you are not acquainted with chambry m byewater ah but you make a mistake you should be it is quite the old france very original quite of the past ages i love it but this year in my opinion it is quite time savage was set free anastasias tone waxed increasingly emphatic you must forgive my saying the smyrthwaite ladies are very exacting colonel haig they appear to trade upon his chivalry and forbearance to a remarkable extent doesnt it occur to them that a young man in his position has affairs of his own in plenty to attend to this year the seabathing will certainly be more efficacious no doubt the mountain air in savoy is also invigorating but the changes of climate are so rapid so injurious perhaps there are other attractions of a not strictly business character one cannot help hearing rumors you know and recently i have been a good deal at the miss smyrthwaites myself as a connection of their mothers in their rather unprotected condition i have felt it incumbent upon me to keep my eye on matters rentoul haig settled himself comfortably upon the settee beside his hostess inclining sideways a little toward her he spoke low confidentially as one communicating state secrets his nose inquisitive his mouth puckered his whole dapper person irradiated by a positive rapture of gossip he simmered he bubbled he only just managed not to boil over in his luxury of enjoyment anastasia listened now fanning herself now punctuating his discourse with incredulous ejaculations and gestures descriptive of the liveliest dissent incredible my dear colonel she cried you must be misinformed savage is regarded as a most desirable parti here in paris he can marry whom he pleases impossible i know better then do you tell me it is unhappily quite true that m ren dax is ill m byewater gabrielle st leger inquired in unnecessarily loud clear accents well i would hesitate to make you feel too badly about him madame st leger the conscientious youth returned cautiously i cannot speak from firsthand knowledge since i would not presume to give myself out as among m daxs intimates he has been a made man this long time while i am only now starting out on schemes for arriving at fame myself way off in the far by and by never in life anastasia cried in response to further confidential bubblings you misread our friend savage altogether if you suppose his heart could be influenced by the ladys wealth he is the least mercenary person i know the modern fortunehunting madness has not touched him i am delighted to say then he is really quite comfortably off already he has every reasonable prospect of being rich eventually he is very shrewd in money matters and he has friends whom i can undertake to say will not forget him when the final disposition of their worldly goods is in question he is a man of sensibility of deep feeling capable of a profound and lasting attachment she paused glancing at la belle gabrielle i would not like to have you think i underrate mr daxs talent this from byewater i recognize he is just as clever as anything but i am from a country where the standards are different and much of mr daxs art is way over the curve of the world where my sympathy fails to follow this being so i have never made any special effort to get into direct personal contact you may take it from me my dear colonel that profound and lasting attachment is already in existence but i was lunching with lenty b stacpole our leading blackandwhite artist yesterday maybe you are not acquainted with his work madame st leger most of the time he puts it right on the american market and does not show here and lenty told me mr dax is so badly broken up with neurasthenia that if he does not quit work and exercise more and cultivate normal habits generally he risks soon being just as sick a man as any but a coroners jury can have use for it is a matter of fact i may almost say of common knowledgefatigue and huskiness notwithstanding anastasias voice rang out in a veritable warcry all his friends are aware that for years he has been devotedhonorably and honestly devotedto a most lovely woman here in paris she paused again looking the bubbling little warrior hard in the eye here she repeated but that pains me so muchgabrielle also spoke for the benefit of all and any hearers without doubt i did know that m ren dax was ailing but that he was so very illnono miss beauchamp laid her fan lightly upon colonel haigs coatcuff silently drawing his attention to the somewhat unfinished american youth and the perfectly finished young frenchwoman standing together in the embrasure of the window backed by the trellis of red and pink rambler roses again she looked him hard in the eye now does it occur to you why any other affair of the heart in mr savages case is preposterous and unthinkable she inquired he swallowed nodded upon my wordindeed most interesting and most convincing my dear lady is it necessary to ask that question in face of such remarkable charm and beauty enviable fellow upon my word is it convincing but here la belle gabrielle conscious alike of their scrutiny and the purport of their partly heard conversation advanced from the window the ostrich plumes upon her hat lifted and waved as she moved the scarlet tinge in her cheeks had deepened and her eyes were at once troubled and daring rentoul haig got upon his feet in a twinkling enviable fellow he repeated feelingly then added ii am at liberty to mention this very interesting piece of information miss beauchamp cry it aloud from the housetops if you will i vouch for the truth of it anastasia replied rising also all her friends wish him success i say advisedly friends in such a case as you can readily imagine there are othersshe turned to madame st leger why ma toute belle is anything wrong you appear a little disturbed disquieted m byewater has just communicated a very unhappy news to me she replied heartless young man as punishment let us send him packing instantly anastasia smiled at the perplexed youth in the kindest and most encouraging fashion i am ever so mortified to have caused madame st leger to feel badly he said oh she will get over it in time she will forgive you leave her to me i will reason with her you must be going too colonel haig anastasia held out her hand cheerfully enforcing farewell ah well it has been very nice very nice indeed to see you and talk over old times and so on dont fail to look me up whenever you pass through paris i give you a standing invitation youre sure to find me i am as much a fixture as the bois or the river as the two men passed from the outer room into the hall anastasia sank down on the settee again just heaven she said but i expire with fatigue simply expire gabrielle looked at her mutinously then sitting down beside her she kissed her lightly on the cheek you are malicious she said you are very obstinate perhaps i too am obstinate you will not succeed in driving me intointo marriage never a bit i trust your own heart dearest child to do the driving ah my hearthave i any left save where my mother and bette are concerned i sometimes wonder you dont give your heart the chance to speak you are afraid of it because you know beforehand what it would say what it is already saying madame st leger rose shaking her head big hat waving plumes and all with captivating petulance how can i tell how can i tell she exclaimed is not marriage for me ancient history did i not read it all years ago when i was still but an infant that is exactly the reason why you should read it again now that you are no longer an infantconceivably but i do not care to read again that which i have already read i have learned all the lessons that particular ancient history has to teach her tone and expression were not without a point of bitterness i want to go forward to learn a new science rather than to repeat discredited fables anastasia sighed raising her shoulders smiling keenly and sadly ah you are still a baby she said very much a baby stretching out soft eager fingers toward any and every untried thing which sparkles or jiggets or rattles poor enough stuff my dear for the most part when you do contrive to grasp it not new at all either save for the highsounding modern names with which it is labeledonly old clothes made over to ape new fashions believe me the love of a clever and handsome young man is a thousand times more satisfying more entertaining than any such sartorial reconstructions from the worldold ragbag of social experiment ah vastly more entertaining she added placing her fan against her lips and looking at the younger woman over the top of it with meaning m byewater informs me that m ren dax is really really ill gabrielle remarked rather hastily her eyes turned upon the roses umphand pray what my dear has that precious piece of information to do with it he may perhaps even die i for one should survive his loss with conspicuous resignation and fortitude but for the past week he has written to me almost daily an impertinence which makes me the more resigned to his speedy demise yespiteous eloquent little letters telling me how he suffers and i have not answered i take that for granted ma toute belle i did not reply becausei am sorry nowi did not quite believe him his eloquence was affecting but it was also misleading i thought it improbable any person would write so very well if he were so very ill i lament my suspicions i have added to his sufferings he implores me in each letter since it is impossible he should at present visit me that i should go if only for a few moments to see him out of all questiona monstrous and infamous proposal so i myself thought at first but if it is true that he may die listen dear friend tell me with a rapid sweeping movement gabrielle again sat down beside her friend again kissed her lightly on the cheek manoeuvering the widebrimmed hat skilfully so as to avoid scrapings and collisions listen she repeated coaxinglyfor really i find myself in a dilemma i cannot consult my mother she is timid and diffident before questions such as these of what is and is not socially permissible her charity dear sainted being is limitless it conflicts with her natural timidity between the two she becomes incapable of exercising clear judgment she does not comprehend modern life few of us do anastasia commented and her health is alas still far from being reestablished i desire to spare her all physical as well as all moral exertion therefore i cannot propose that she should accompany me to visit m ren dax that would render my position comparatively simple but the excitement and fatigue of such a proceeding are practically prohibitive for her am i then to understand anastasia inquired somewhat grimly that you kindly propose i should play duenna and call on that singularly objectionable young man in company with you ah if it only could be arranged but i fear he might not improbably refuse to receive you execrable taste on his part of course yet i thank him for it disposes of the matter since you cannot go alone but if he should be dying ah forgive me she cried with charming penitence i weary i even annoy you most dear anastasia most cherished most valued friend it is unconscionable to do so after you have given me the enjoyment of so charming so inspiriting an afternoon you should rest i will ask nothing more of you i will go but not to call on m ren dax she caught la belle gabrielles two hands in hers my darling child you must surely perceive the impropriety the scandal of such a dmarche on your partat your age with your attractions well known as you areand putting prejudice aside with his reputation whether deserved or not for libertinism for grossness of ideas for reckless indiscretion madame st leger had risen the elder woman still held her hands imprisoned she stood looking down the brim of her hat forming a gray halo about her abundant burnished hair and pale grave heartshaped face i perceive all that she answered quietly i have thought carefully of it i did so while i yet was doubtful of the actuality of his illness but now that i am no longer doubtful that i am assured he is practising no deceit upon me i ask myself whether iwho embrace the nobler and larger conceptions of the office of womanam not thereby committed to disregard such conventions whether it is not of the essence of the reforms the ideals for which we work that we should each one of us have the courage when occasion arises to defy tradition only to talk is silly to make a protest of action gives the true measure of our faith our sincerity the making of such a protest against current usages cannot be agreeable i do not make it lightheartedly with any satisfaction in my own audacity to gratify myself to obtain amusement or frivolous pleasure i would never risk outraging the accepted code of conduct the accepted proprieties but for the sake of one who suffers of one to whomwithout vanityi believe my friendship to have been helpfulfor the sake of one whose attitude toward me has been irreproachable and who though so gifted is in many ways so greatly to be pitied she bent her head and kissed her hostess farewell she said gently i shall not in any case go today it is now too late but beyond that i make no promises for fear i may perjure myself yes i have been so happy so happy this afternoon for this most dear friend all my thanks regardless of aching back and aching throat anastasia beauchamp went to the telephone first she told the operator at the exchange to ring up the number of adrians bachelor flat in the rue de luniversit from thence no response was obtainable nothing daunted anastasia requested to be put into communication with the office in the rue druot here with polite alacrity the good konskis amiable voice answered her alas no to the desolation of his colleagues m savage had not yet returned but in a few days he would without doubt do so the conduct of the review compelled it without him the machine refused any longer to work his presence became imperative madame would write precisely her letter should receive his the good konskis most eager attention let madame repose entire confidence in his assiduity resting assured that not an instants delay should occur in the delivery of her distinguished communication chapter ii in the track of the brainstorm at last you have arrived through an interminable progression of hours i have waited the days and nights mixing themselves into one abominable salad of expectation disappointment rage against those whom i pictured as interfering to detain you and as dressing and sauce to the whole infernal compound a yearning for the assuaging repose of your presence which gnawed like the undying worm at my entrails this address although delivered in the young mans accustomed unemotional manner with studied carefully modulated utterance was hardly calculated to allay the embarrassment or disquietude aroused by the uncompromising stare of the concierge and very evident though more deferential curiosity of giovanni the brighteyed velvetspoken italian manservant who admitted her nor were other sources of discomfort lacking madame st leger like all persons of temperament in whom mind and body the soul and senses are constantly and actively interpenetrative instinctively responded to the spiritual influences which reside in places and even in material objects now coming directly into it from the glitter and movement the thousand and one very articulate activities of the sunbathed city the vivid foliage of whose many trees tossed in the crisp freshness of the summer wind ren daxs studio struck her as the strangest and perhaps most repellant human habitation she had ever yet set foot in struck her too as belonging to a section of that exclusively mans world in which womans part is at once fugitive and not a little suspect the black hangings and furniture stared at the bare immaculately white walls bluffed her only a mournful travesty of the splendid daylight reigning out of doors filtered down through the gathered blackstuff blinds drawn across the great sloping skylights and contended languidly against the harsh clarity of a couple of electric lightswith flat smokedglass shades to themhanging spiderlike at the end of long black cords from the beam supporting the central span of the arched ceiling notwithstanding the height of the room and its largeness of area the atmosphere was stagnant listless and dead this constituted madame st legers initial impression this and a singular persuasionreturning upon her stealthily persistently though she strove honestly to cast it outthat the studio although apparently so bare and empty was in point of fact crowded by forms and conceptions the reverse of wholesome or ennobling which pushed upon and jostled her while by their number and grossness they further exhausted the already lifeless air the sense of suffocation thus produced so oppressed her that her heart beat nervously and her pulse fluttered though unwilling to discard the modest shelter it afforded and gain closer acquaintance with the details of her surroundings gabrielle untwisted the flowing gray veil which she wore over her hat and around her throat and threw it back from her face then for a while all else was forgotten in the thought of the sight of ren dax and although that thought and seeing was in itself painful it tended to restore both her outward serenity and her inward assurance and strength ah my poor friend she said soothingly had i understood how suffering you were how greatly in need of sympathy i would have put aside obstacles and come to you sooner thoughthough you will still remember it is no small concession that i should come at all only by concessions is life rendered supportable he answered i too have made concessions if you defy conventional decorum for my sake i on the other hand have sacrificed to it for your sake very royally i have destroyed the labor of months have obliterated priceless records to safeguard your delicacy to insure you immunityshould you at last visit mefrom all offense and la belle gabrielle listening was moved and touched but she asked no explanationshrank from it indeed divining the sacrifice in question bore vital relation to that unseen yet jostling unwholesome and ignoble crowd she therefore rallied the mothering ministering spirit within her resolving to let speech action and feeling be inspired and controlled by this and this alone for one thing was indisputablenamely that ren dax caricaturist and poet was as the cleanly young american yesterday told her just as sick a man as any man need be his puny person had wasted he looked all headall brain rather since his tired little face seemed to also have dwindled and to occupy the most restricted space permissible in proportion to the whole the full black linen paintingblouse which he wore in place of a coat produced along with his lowness of stature a queerly youthful and even childish effect to stand on ceremony with this small sad human being still more to go in fear of it to regard it as possibly dangerous its poor little neighborhood as in any degree compromising was to gabrielle st leger altogether absurd and unworthy let the overpunctilious or overworldly say what they pleased she congratulated herself she was glad to have disregarded opposition glad to have come where custom and humanity conflictso she told herselflet it be custom which goes to the wall therewith she drew herself up proudly and carrying her charming head high looked bravely around the strange and somewhat sinister place noted the wide divans on either side the fireplace and the diminutive scarlet cane chair set on the hearthrug the fivefold red lacquer screen the trophy of armsswords rapiers simitars daggers and other such uncomfortably cutting ripping and stabbing toolsupon the chimneybreast above the mantelpiece noted not without a shudder of disgust the glass tank and its slimy swimming and crawling population the tables loaded with books materials and implements of the draftsmans craft the models platform the array of portfolios canvases drawingboardssurely the place had been very scrupulously swept and garnished against her coming it was minutely even rigidly clean and neat this pleased her as a pretty tribute of respect finally her eyes sought the nearly lifesize redchalk drawing set on an easel in the center of the studio immediately beneath the electric light ren dax stood beside her she tall noticeably elegant in her shortwaisted longcoated palegray braided walkingdress he reserved and weary in bearing but very watchful and very intent you observe my drawing he inquired softly i have been waiting for thatwaiting for you to grasp the fact that there is nothing new nothing extraordinary in your being here with meyou and mademoiselle bette for months now you are my companions all day and all nightyes then very sensibly also look i lie there upon the divan i fold the red screen backit is loot from the imperial palace at peking that screen grotesquely sanguinary scenes figure upon it but i forget them and the entertainment they afford mei fold the screen back i turn upon my side among the cushions and i look at you i look until on those nights when my will is active and yours in abeyance or perhaps a little weak you step off the paper and cross the room therebetween the platform and the long tablealways carrying mademoiselle bette on your arm and coming close you bend down over me you never speak neither do you touch me but i cease to suffer the tension of my nerves is relaxed the hideous pain at the base of my skull where the brain and spinalcord form their junction no longer tortures me i am inexpressibly soothed i become calm i sleep gabrielle st leger had grown very serious for this small sad human being to whom she proposed to minister and to mother had disconcertingly original and even consternating ways with it should she resent the said ways soundly snubbing him or making allowance for his illhealth and acknowledged eccentricity parley with and humor him to steer a wise course was difficult i willingly believe your intention in making this drawing was not disloyal she said quietly yet i cannot but be displeased before making it you should have asked my approval and obtained my consent which you would have refusedno i knew better than that but dismiss the idea of disloyalty rise above paltry considerations of expediency and etiquette you can do so if you choose accept the position in its gravity in its permanent consequences both to me and to yourself in making this drawing i thought not merely of the ease and relief i might obtain through it i thought of you also for i perceived the perversion which threatened you i decided to intervene to rescue you i decided to cooperate with destiny to interest myself in the evolution of your highest good so now it amounts to no less than thisthat your future and mine are inextricably conjoined intermingled incapable of separation henceforth gently gently my poor friend gabrielle said are you not then sorry for me he asked quickly with very disarming and childlike pathos is it a fraud a heartless experiment coming today to see me thus have you no real desire to console or bring me hope from my heart i pity and commiserate you gabrielle said then where is your logic where is your reason for iiren daxi and my recovery my welfare constitute your highest good i am your destiny your being here today regardless of etiquette your stepping off the paper there upon the easel crossing the room and bending over me at night carrying the little maiden child the flower of innocence in your arms these are at least a tacit admission of the truth of that a point of fear came into madame st legers eyes outward serenity inward assurance were not easy of maintenance the more so that again she was very sensible of the unseen crowd of ignoble forms and conceptions peopling the room tainting and exhausting the air of it pressing upon andas she feltderiding her you speak foolishly and extravagantly she said steadying her voice with effort i pardon that because i know that you are suffering and not altogether master of yourself but i do not enjoy this conversation i beg you to talk more becomingly or i shall be unable to remain i shall feel compelled to leave you for an instant ren dax looked up at her with a positively diabolic expression of resentment then his face was distorted by a sudden spasm it is only too true that i suffer he cried bitterly my head achesthere at the base of my brain it is like the grinding of iron knuckles i become distracted very probably i speak extravagantly my sensations are extravagant and my talk matches them but do not leave me i will not offend you i will be altogether good altogether mild and amiable only remain place yourself here in this chair your presence comforts and pacifies mebut only if you are in sympathy with me let your sympathy flow out then do not restrain it let it surround and support me buoying me up so that i float upon the surface of it as upon some divine river of peace ah madame pity me i am so tired of pain reluctantly out of her charity and against her better her mundane judgment gabrielle st leger yielded she sat down in the large black brocadecovered chair indicated her back was toward the drawing upon the easel she was glad not to see it glad that the electric light no longer glared in her eyes she clasped her hands lightly in her lap trying to subdue all inward agitation to maintain a perfectly sane and normal outlook thereby infusing something of her own health and sweetness as a disinfectant into this morbid atmosphere the young man sat down too upon the edge of the divan just opposite to her he set his elbows upon his knees his big head projected forward his eyes closed his chin resting in the hollow of his hard clever little hands for a time there was silence save for the dripping of the fountain in the glass tank and the ticking of a clock presently very softly he began to speak my art is killing mekilling meand only you and mademoiselle bette can save me he said and i am worth saving for not only am i the most accomplished draftsman of the century but my knowledge of the human animal is unsurpassed moreover that i should die is so inconceivably purposeless death is such a stupidity such an outrage on intelligence and commonsense gabrielle remained passive to reason with him would she felt be useless as yet she would wait her opportunity yes my art is killing me he went on it asks too much more than once i have tried to sever myself from it but it is the stronger it refuses amputation long ago when as a childunhappy devoured by fancies by curiosity about myself about other children about everything which i sawi found that i possessed this talent i was both shy and enchanted it gave me power everything that i looked at belonged to me i could reproduce it in beauty or the reverse i could cover with ridicule those who annoyed me by means of my talent i could torment i played with it as naughty little boys play together ingenious in provocation in malice in dirty monkey tricks then as i grew older i enjoyed my talent languorously i spent long days of dreams long nights of love with it that was a period when my heart was still soft i believed the trivial vices of the little boy were left behind the fullblooded vices of manhood were untried as yet later ambition took me i would study i would know i would train my eye and my hand to perfect mastery in observation and in execution my own mechanical skill my power of memorizing of visualizing intoxicated me i reviewed the work of famous draftsmen i recognized that i was on the highroad to surpass it both in effrontery of conception and perfection of technique i refused my art nothing shrank from nothing i had loved my art as a companion in childish mischief then as a youth loves his first mistress now i loved it as a man loves his career loves that which raises him above his contemporaries i stood above others alone i was filled with an immense scorn of them i unveiled their deceit their hypocrisy their ignorance their vileness the degradation of their minds and habits i whipped them till the blood came no one could escape i jeered i laughed i made them laugh too between the cuts of the lash even while the blood flowed they laughed how could they help doing so my wit was irresistible they cursed me yet shouted to me to lay on to them again for a minute or more silence save for the dripping fountain the ticking clock and a bubbling sucking sound as one of the blackandorange blotched newts dived from the rockwork down to the sandy pebbly floor of the glass tank madame st leger leaned back in her chair she pressed her handkerchief against her lips she felt as one who witnesses some terrible drama upon the stage which holds the attention captive she could not have gone away and left ren dax until the scene was concluded even if she would that was the period of my apotheosis when i appeared to myself as a godlast year the year before last even this winter he said presently before the pain came and while still i myself was greater than my art but now now today i do not laugh any more nor can i make others laugh my art is greater than i it has grown unruly arrogant i am unequal to its demands it asks of me what i am no longer able to give it hounds me along it storms at mego further yet imagine the unimaginable pass all known limits you are too squeamish too fastidious too modest too nice there yet remain sanctities to be defiled shames to be depicted agonies to be stewed in the vitriol juice of sarcasm go forward you are lazy exert yourself discover fresh subjects invent new profanities turn the spit on which you have impaled humanity faster and faster draw betteryou grow lethargic indolentdraw better and better yetbut i cannot i cannot ren dax said the corners of his mouth drooping like those of a tired baby we have changed places my art and i it is greater than me it masters me instead of my mastering it like some huge brazen moloch with burning brazen arms it presses me against its burning brazen breast scorching me to a cinder it has squeezed me drydryi am no longer able to collect my ideas to memorize that which i see my imagination is sterile my hand refuses to obey my brain my line my beloved my unexampled line wavers is broken uncertain loses itself i scrabble unmeaning nonsense upon the paper he unbuttoned the wristband of his blouse and stripped up the sleeve of it see he went on how my muscles have deteriorated my arm resembles some withered sapless twig soon i shall not possess sufficient strength to hold a pencil or a bit of charcoal yes yes i know what you would say others have already said it travel try change of scene rest consult doctors but pah butchers carrionfeeders what can they tell me which i do not know already forfor he rose came nearer to gabrielle st leger pointing to the inner corner of the great room in a line with the door there he said with a singular sly gleefulness thereyou see madame behind the port foliowagon yesit has its lair there its retreat in which it conceals itself it always says one thing and it always tells the truth it has once been a man now it has no skin you can observe all the muscles and sinews in action which is extremely instructive but naturally it is redred all over and it is highly varnished otherwise of course it would feel the cold too much it places its red hands on the edges of the portfoliosthusand it vaults into the room it is astonishingly agile i think it may formerly have been by profession an acrobat it runs so very swiftly its contortions are infinite it avoids the pieces of furniture with extraordinary dexterity sometimes it leaps over them the rapidity of its movements excites me the painhere at the base of my skullalways increases when i see it i cannot restrain myself i pursue it with frenzy i hurl books pictures firewood anything i can lay hands upon at iteven my precious daggers and javelins from off the wall but it sustains no injury theythese objects which i throwpass clean through it yet they leave no aperture no mark my servant afterward finds them scattered upon the ground quite clean and free from moisture and as it runs it screams to me over its red shoulder in a rasping voice like the cutting of stone with a saw you are going mad ren dax you are going madmad madame st leger raised both hands in mute horror pity protest her lips trembled the tears ran down her cheeks the young man watched her for some seconds the strangest expression of triumph upon his solemn little face then with a great sigh he backed away and sat down on the divan once more ah ah he said quite calmly and gently it is so adorable to see you weep better even than that you should step down off the easel as you sometimes do at night and crossing the room bend over me and give me sleep still the red man speaks truth madame accurate unassailable truth it comes just to this very soon now the final act of this infernal comedy will be reached i shall be madunless chapter iii in which the storm breaks unlessunlesswhat gabrielle st leger asked the question not because she wished to ask it but because outward things forced her all disease is actually infecting if not actively infectious since contact with it disturbs the emotional and functional equilibrium maintenance of which constitutes perfect health such disturbance is most readily and injuriously produced in persons of fine sensibility just now madame st legers faculties and feelings alike were in disarray ren dax his genius and the neurosis from which he suffered his strange dwellingplace all that which had happened in andmorallyadhered to it combined to put compulsion upon her in a sense she knew the world she was not inexperienced but the amenities of a polished and highly civilized society whose principal business it is to veil and mitigate the asperities of fact had stood between her and direct acquaintance with the fundamental brutalities of life now she consciously met the shock of those brutalities and met it singlehanded this exclusively mans world the gates of which she had forced with wilful selfconfidence produced in her humiliation and helplessness a sense of having projected herself into regions where accustomed laws are inoperative and directionpostsfor guidance of wandering feminine footstepsagitatingly nonexistent under this stress of circumstance her initiative deserted her the vein of ironyrunning like a steel ribbon through her mentalitybecame suddenly and queerly worked out she could not detach herself from the immediate position stand aside review it as a whole and deal with it that which made for individuality had gone under only her womanhood as womanhooda womanhood sheltered petted moving ever in a gracefully artificial atmospherewas left she had come intending to console to minister sagely to advise it looked quite anxiously much as though tyrannized by rude unfamiliar forces she would remain to yield and to obey thus taking up the tagend of ren daxs speech she asked unwillingly almost fearfully unlessunless what unless you consent to save me madame he replied with insinuating gravity and sweetness unless you consecrate yourself to the work of my recovery you and the delicious mademoiselle bette but my poor friend she reasoned how is it possible for me to do that in a way very obvious and simple wholly consonant to the most exalted aspirations of your nature he returned i have planned it all out no serious difficulties present themselves good will madame on your part some forethought on mine and all is satisfactorily arranged as to mademoiselle bette she will find herself in a veritable paradise you know her affection for me and putting aside my own gifts as a comrade i have most pleasing little animals for her to play with you have seen those in the aquarium there is also aristides to my anguish i struck him last night with a hearthbrush during my pursuit of the red man and giovanni has charge of him in hospital today the affair was purely accidental i am convinced that he bears me no malice poor cherished little cabbage yet it cuts me to the quick to see his empty chair but to return to your coming madame for it is thus that you will save meby coming here to remain permanently by devoting yourself to me unremittingly exclusivelyby coming herehere to live the color rushed into madame st legers face and neck then ebbed leaving her white to the lips deathly white as against the black brocade of the chairback here was a directionpost at last with information written upon it ofas it seemed to herthe very plainest and ugliest sort the road which it signalized leading to wellknown and wholly undesirable places though trodden only too frequently by wandering feminine feet for the moment she doubted his good faith doubted whether he was not playing some infamous trick upon her doubted whether his illness was not after all a treacherous fabrication her mouth and throat went dry as a limekiln she could barely articulate monsieur she said sternly i fear it is already too late to save you in making such a proposition you show only too convincingly that you are already mad but the young mans expression lost nothing of its triumph or his manner of its sweetness madame that is a very cruel speech he said you deserve it should be cruel she answered indeed ren replied looking calmly at her indeed i do not you rush too hastily to injurious conclusions it is an error to do so you cause yourself unnecessary annoyance you also cause me a waste of tissue which in my existing condition of health i can ill afford it is irrevocably decided that you come here to live evidently it has to be i make no disloyal proposition to you as i have told you i earnestly consider your good it is to rescue you from threatening perversions of office and of instinct from declension to a lower emotional level that i invite you require you to make your home with me for i crave your presence not as other men crave for association with so beautiful a personthat is sensually for gratification of the beast within thembut spiritually as an object of faith an object of worship as a healing and purifying aura a divine emanation efficacious to the exorcism of that devouring devil my art mistresswifepahmadame my art has been all that to me and more than thatnot to mention those more active amatory excursions common to generous youth in which i do not deny participation but my art has never been to me that thing so far more sacred more humana mother ren dax leaned toward her both arms wide extended his somber eyes glowing as though a red lamp shone behind them his features contracted by spasms of pain this he pursued is what i ask what in the depths and heights in the utmost sincerity of my being i need and must havethe madonna of the future the perfect woman whose experience as woman is at once passionless and complete human yet spiritualthe everlasting mother a mother moreover such as in the entire course of the uncounted ages no man has ever yet possessed still young young as himself unsoiled untired still in the springtime of her charm yet mysterious in a sense awful so that she is hedged about with inviolable reverence and respect the intimate wonders of whose beauty never fully disclose themselves but continue adorably unknown and remote this is what i need and this you only can give it is your unique and commanding destiny you must rallying your fortitude and virtue rise to it he stood up his head thrown back his arms still extended as he indicated the extent and appointments of the studio with large sweeping gestures see he cried in increasing excitement here is the temple prepared for your worship i had decorated the walls of it with obscenities which have caused rapture to the most emancipated intellects in paris to spare you offense when i decided that you should come to me i sent for plasterers for whitewashes who even while they worked rocked with laughter at the masterpieces of humor they were in process of destroying the more intelligent of them mutinied declaring it vandalism to obliterate such expressions of genius i seized a brush i myself worked hailing invectives upon them i never rested till my purpose was achieved then when the temple was cleansed i wrote to you he sank down squatting on the carpet a queer black lump amid the surrounding blackness his shoulders resting against the front of the divan his hands clasped behind and supporting his pale unwieldy head ah ah he cried plaintively the pain the painagain it pierces me it becomes extravagant surely madame i need not explain to you any further you witness my sufferings terminate them it is in your power to do so you cannot refuse a request so wholly reasonable and natural you consent to remain with methere need be no delay giovanni my servant is a good fellow trustworthy and intelligent he will take a motorcab and proceed immediately to the quai malaquais after informing madame your mother that you remain here permanently he will return accompanied by mademoiselle bette within the course of half an hour the thing is done it becomes an accomplished fact your welfare is assured and i madame i am rescued from the bottomless pit from a hell of unspeakable disgustthe pain ceases the brazen moloch no longer presses me to his burning breast i am recreated my childhood is given back to mebut a childhood of such peace such innocent gaiety as no child ever yet experienced i sleep in exquisite content i wake not merely to find and pray for help from your image reflected there upon paper but to find you yourself my guest and my savior you here moving to and fro among my possessions breathing speaking smiling making day and night alike fragrant by your presence distilling the healing virtue of a deified maternity of an enshrined and consecrated life as he finished speaking the young man rose to his feet he came near to gabrielle and stood looking down at her solemn imploring yet with a strange flickering impishness in his manner and his face he clasped his hard little hands turning the palms of them outward alternately bowing over her and rising on tiptoe holding himself stiffly erect can you hesitate madame softly and sweetly he asked noassuredlyit is inconceivable that you should hesitate gabrielle had stripped off her gloves thrown back the fronts of her coat her bosom rose and fell with an abrupt irregular motion under the lace and chiffon of her blouse more than ever was the air dead the atmosphere suffocating more than ever did those depraved forms and conceptions defying expulsion by plaster and whitewash crowd in upon and oppress her supernatural moral and physical terror joining hands created a very evil magic circle around her isolating her cutting her off from all familiar amusing pleasant tender and gracious everyday matters dear to her social and domestic sense she no longer entertained any doubt about the young mans mental condition shut away with him here alone behind closed doors beneath blackmuffled skylights with only claycold fish and reptiles as witnesses the situation began to appear alarming in the extreme how to effect her escape how to temporize until rescue should in some form come to her her circumstances were so incredible so nightmarish in their improbability their merciless reality their insane logic that her brain reeled under the strain wordlessly but passionately she prayed for strength guidance help it is inconceivable madame that you still hesitate ren repeated insinuatingly making a supreme effort gabrielle rose from her chair she felt braver more mistress of herself standing up with an assumption of ease and indifference she buttoned her coat and began drawing on her long gloves you are right she replied but without looking at him i no longer hesitate you have made your meaning clear you have also said many affecting and poetic things to me but as you will be the first to admit there are certain filial obligations i am bound to discharge and to discharge personally my beloved mother has been my companion and my constant care for so long that it is imperative i should go with giovanni and in a few words tell her myself of the decision we have arrived at to commit the communication of such news to a servant however excellent who is also a stranger would be both cruel and impertinent you who reverence motherhood so deeply will sympathize with this mother from whom you propose to take away those dearest to her the sobs rose in gabrielles throat but she swallowed them courageously if she once gave way once lost her headwell moreover she continued unless i myself go unless i myself claim her my mother will and rightly refuse to part with my little bette a pause followed during which the young man appeared immersed in thought during that pause a faint sound of footsteps seemed to reach gabrielles fearquickened hearing but whether from the common stairway the flat underneath or here nearer at hand she could not determine she prayed with all the fervor of her spirit while deftly daintily smoothing out the wrinkles in the wrists of her long gloves you appreciate the force of that which i say regarding my mother and my little bette she asked glancing at him i domost incontestably i do the answer came so spontaneously and in so perfectly natural a tone that gabrielles glance steadied upon the speaker in swift inquiry and hope had the cloud lifted leaving his mind clear permitting an interval of lucidity of reason and normal thought ah my poor friend then all is well she cried a great thankfulness irradiating her face perhaps yes he returned in the same quiet and natural manner personally i should have preferred the other plan to relinquish it disappoints me all promised so well but i put it aside for toward madame your mother i am believe me incapable of an unsympathetic or discourteous act gabrielle continued her little preparations for departure she began to arrange her veil raising both hands she drew the edge of it forward over the crown of her hat later reaction would set in safe in her own home she would break down paying in physical and mental exhaustion the price of this very terrible act of charity but just now she felt strong and elate in her thankfulness for answered prayer and prospect of release never had family affection the love of friends all the wholesome sentiments of human intercourse appeared to her so delightful or so good delicate color tinged her cheeks kindness and pity softened her goldenbrown eyes standing there with upraised hands and gently smiling lips her beauty was very noble full of soul as well as of victorious health and youth for some seconds ren dax gazed at her as though fascinated studying every detail of her appearance then once more a flickering impishness crossed his sad little face he went down on one knee laid hold of the hem of her dress and bowing his great head to the ground kissed and again kissed it accept my worship my homage oh madonnamadonna of the future he said he sprang upright clasping his little hands again the palms turned outward yes he went on reflectively honestly i prefer the other plan yet this one as i increasingly perceive possesses merits let us dwell upon them they will console us for after all what i am about to carry out is also a masterpiecedaring voluptuous merciless at once lovely and hideousand conclusive yes amazingly conclusive unmitigatedjust that it will set the public imagination on fire all paris will seethe with it all paris which can gain admittance will rush fight trample to obtain a look at it it will represent the most scathing of my revenges upon the unfathomable stupidity of mankind but it will do more than that it will constitute my supreme revenge upon my art thus i sterilize the brazen moloch rendering him voiceless eyeless handless denying him all means of selfexpression in myself dying i make him worse than deadthough he still exists art being eternal necessarily still exists yet what an existence i who have so long parted company with laughter could almost laugh yes veritably i draw his teeth by depriving him of my assistance as interpreter by depriving him of the vehicle of my unrivaled technique i annihilate his power blind deaf maimed impotent yesyesis it not beyond all words magnificent let us hasten madame to accomplish this ren had delivered himself of his harangue with growing indications of excitement his voice rising finally to a scream throughout the nerveshattering jar and rush of it madame st leger in deepening terror listened for any sound of delivering footstepslistened and prayed now his manner changed became cool matteroffact rather horribly busy and businesslike see madame he said the divan on the left will certainly be the most suitable you will place yourself at the farther end of it there are plenty of cushionswhen giovanni has filled the large bronze bowlyou see which i meanthere upon the ebony pedestal he pointed with one hand with the other he laid hold of madame st legers wrist the hard short fingers closing down like the teeth of a steel trap to struggle was useless might god in his mercy hear and send help when giovanni i repeat has filled the bowl with warm waterwarm not too hotand set it upon the center of the divanthusi will instruct him to draw the screen across concealing us you understand we shall place ourselves on either side of the bowl plunging our arms as far as the elbow into it the warmth of the water at once soothes the nerves and accelerates the flow of bloodah do not draw back from me he pleaded do not render my task more difficult obey your highest instincts be perfect in grace and in beneficence to the close the pain racks my head do not by opposition or reluctance oblige me to concentrate my brain upon further explanation or thoughtconsider only that from which i save you the degradation of marriage of the embraces of a loverof adrian my old schoolfellowthe impious assumption of the beastof adrian savagefrom the shame of old age toofrom the anguish of tears shed beside the bedside of possibly your child your little betteof certainly madame your mother and as against all these tragedies to what does the other amount i give you my word it will not hurt you will barely be sensible of that which is occurringthe merest scratchin my student days i obtained bodies from the hospitals with minute and faithful accuracy i dissected them out i know precisely where to cut what portion of the arteries and sinews to severand we shall sit here alonealoneyou and i behind the red screen while our veins empty themselves of their red liquor and slowly serenely life ebbs our vision growing dim and yet more help gabrielle called aloud help for truly the sound of voices and of footsteps came at last the studio door was thrown open a man entered who he was she did not know but with a strength born of despair and of hope she wrenched herself free from ren daxs grasp ran across the big room flung her arms round the mans neck her beautiful head crushing down upon his breast while her breath rushed out in great strangled panting cries ah and again ah ah chapter iv on the heights adrian stood on the edge of the pavement beside his wellappointed blueblack automobile the door of which the chauffeur held open the hinged top of the limousine was folded back and the sunshine slanting down over the roofs of the high white houses on the right brought the pale grayclad figure of its occupant into charming relief as against the oatmealcolored upholstering of the inside of the car in tones at once blending and standing finely apart an itinerant flowerseller bareheaded shortskirted trimly shod her flat wicker tray heaped up with vivid blossoms held out a graceful bunch of crimson and yellow roses with the smiling suggestion thatmonsieur should assuredly present them to madame who could not fail to revel in their ravishing odor monsieur however showed himself unflatteringly ignorant of her presence while martin the chauffeur dissembling his natural inclination toward every member of the sex motioned her away with so to speak a front of adamant adrian put one foot on the step of the car and there paused hesitating at last with a point of eagerness piercing his constraint he said instead of going directly to the quai malaquais will you permit me to take you for a short a quiet drive madame the air may refresh you i shall be grateful gabrielle replied briefly and hoarsely adrian delivered himself of rapid emphatic directions to his chauffeur swung into the car and placed himself beside her arranging the thin dustrug carefully over the skirt of her dress then his nostrils quivering slightly his face noticeably drawn and set he leaned back in his corner of the luxurious vehicle martin slipped in behind the steeringwheel and with a preliminary snarl and rattling vibration gaining silence and smoothness as it made the pace the car headed up the glittering perspective of the wide treebordered street somewhere in the back of his consciousness when he had bought this car a few weeks prior to his last visit to stourmouth there floated entrancing visions of circumstances such as the present at that time his affair of the heart promised lamentably ill and realization of such visions appeared both highly improbable and most wearifully distant now a wholly unexpected turn of events had converted them into actual fact through the delight of the brilliant summer afternoon the caressing wind and clear brave sunlight he bore gabrielle st leger away whither he would verily he had his desire but leanness withal in his soul for god in heaven what a question squatted there upon the biscuitcolored seat interposing its hateful presence between them poisoning his mind with an anguish of suspense and doubt he was still even physically under the dominion of the almost incredible scene in which he had recently taken part he had carried rather than led madame st leger down the five flights of stairs from ren daxs flat and had just only not required the help of the chauffeur to lift her into the waiting car his heart still thumped sledgehammer fashion against his ribs every muscle was strained and taut not his eyes only but the whole temper and spirit of him were still hot with desire of vengeance that loud hardly human cry of gabrielles as lost to all dignity lost almost to all modesty she flung herself upon him still rang in his ears the primitive savagery of it coming from the lips of so fastidious elusive quickwitted a creature from those of so artistic a product of our complicated modern civilization at once horrified and filled him with vicarious shame in that wild moment of impact the dormant violence of the young mans passion had been aroused yet a gross and cynical query was scrawled across his remembrance of it all for what could in point of fact have happened previous to his arrival to produce so amazing a result and to adrian not the least cruel part of this business was the duty so clearly laid upon him of rigid selfrestraint of maintaining for her protection as sparing and shielding her his ordinary air of courteous unaccentuated and friendly intercourse good breeding and fine feeling alike condemned him to behave just as usual not assuming by so much as a hairs breadth that closer intimacy which the events of the last halfhour might very reasonably justify unless she herself chose to speak this whole astounding episode must remain as though it never had been and was notand here his lovers and artists imagination crimped him projecting torments of unsatisfied conjecture extending throughout the unending cycles of eternity yet in uncomplaining endurance of such torment as he perceived must the perfection of his attitude toward her declare itself must the perfection of his loyalty come in meanwhile as the car hummed along the upwardtrending avenues toward the southern heights leaving the more fashionable and populous districts of the city behind the air grew lighter and the breeze more lively adrian still sitting tight in his corner trusted himself to look at his companion through the fluttering gray veil as through some tenuous drifting mist he saw her proud delicate profile saw also that though she remained apparently passive and strove to hold all outward signs of emotion in check the tears ran slowly down her cheek while the rounded corner of her usually enigmatic smiling mouth trembled nervously and drooped presently as he still watched she slipped the chain of her gold and gray vanitybag off her wrist and essayed to open it but her fingers fumbled ineffectually with the gilt snap the beautiful capable hands he so fondly loved shook having suddenly grown weak tears came into adrians eyes also to him the helplessness of those dear hands stood for so very much silently he took the little bag opened and held it while she pulled out a lacebordered handkerchief and pushing it beneath the fluttering veil wiped her wet eyes and wet cheeks he kept the bag open waiting for her to put the handkerchief back but without speaking gabrielle shook her head slightly in token that further drying operations might not improbably shortly be required adrian obediently snapped to the gold catch yet since he really shut up such a very big slice of his own heart within it was it not after all but natural and legitimate that he should retain possession of the little bag this trifle of service rendered and accepted bore fruit bringing the two into a more normal relation and lessening the tension of their mutual constraint after a while gabrielle spoke but low and hoarsely her throat still strained by those hardly human cries adrian found himself obliged to draw nearer to her if he would catch her words amid the clatter of the street and humming of the engines of the car there is that i feel i should without delay make you know she said speaking in english for it comes easier sometimes to clothe the telling of ugly and difficult things with the circumscriptions of a foreign language yes adrian put in as she paused you should know that he is insane possibly my visiting him contributed to precipitate the crisis i do not know but he is now no longer responsible therefore truly i commiserate rather than feel anger toward him again the handkerchief went up under the fluttering veil again when it was withdrawn adrian saw as through thin drifting mist the proud delicate profile i should make you know she went on resolutely it was my lifeyes my lifebut my honor noneverwhich was in jeopardy thank god thank god for that the young man almost groaned bowing himself together while his grasp tightened upon the pretty little gold and gray bag almost mercilessly he sat upright took a deep breath staring with unseeing eyes at the bright variegated prospect of shops houses trees traffic people scampering past on either side the rushing car only now did he begin to gauge the vital character of his recent misery and the tremendous force of the love which in so happily constituted and circumstanced a man as himself could render such a misery possible until today until indeed this thriceblessed minute when he learned from her own lips that no shame sullied her he had never really gauged the depth of his love for gabrielle st leger or quite realized how all the many ambitions interests satisfactions of his very agreeable existence were as so much dust froth garbage burntout cinder in comparison to that love he had told anastasia beauchamp in the course of a certain memorable conversation he would devote his life to that love but he now discovered it was quite unnecessary that he should take active steps toward the production or maintenance of it since his life was already almost alarmingly devoted leaving room in truth as he now perceived for nothing outside that same love and thereuponthe balance essaying to right itself as in sane healthy natures it instinctively must and willpoor joanna smyrthwaites face and its expression of semiidiot ecstasy as he had seen it only two nights ago at the tower house on the gallery in the checkered moonlight arose before him adrian was conscious of pulling himself together sharplyloveif you willand with all the strength all the vigor of his nature but to dote devil take the notionno thank you never if he knew it would he dote wherefore it followed that his wits were very thoroughly if very tenderly about him when next gabrielle st leger spoke i see now she said the method by which he proposed wehe and myselfshould die amounted to an absurdity since it involved the concurrence of his servant covered by the noise of the car adrian permitted himself the relief of cursing a little quietly under his breath but at the time i could not reason i found myself too confused and terrified by the extraordinary and horrible things he told methings in themselves demented extravagant yet as he told them so apparently sensible his poor disordered brain was so fertile in expedients that from moment to moment i could not foresee what fresh unnatural demand he might make on me what new scheme he might not devise for my destruction alone with a maniac no degree of fear can be excessive adrian asserted warmly for he perceived her pride was touched so that her selfesteem called for support and encouragement to his hearing her words conveyed a rather pathetic hint of apology both to herself and to him for that moment of wild selfabandonment it doesnt require much imagination he went on to understand the danger you ran was appallingin every way appallingsimply that and good heavens why didnt i know he broke out slapping his two hands down on his knees in sudden fury why didnt my instinct warn me thickheaded fool that i am why didnt i get to that hateful carrionbirds roost of a studio an hour half an hour earlier pardon me dear madame he added moderating his transports if i shock you by my violence but when i consider what you must have endured when i picture what might have happened i confess i am almost beside myself with rage and distress la belle gabrielle had turned her head she looked straight at him the timid ghost of her mysterious finely malicious smile visited her lips yet seen through the mist of her fluttering veil her eyes were singularly soft and lovely wistfulso at least it seemed to adrianwith the dawning of a sentiment other than that of bare friendship whereupon the young mans heart began to thump against his ribs again while the engines of the car broke into a most marvelous sweet singing i am not sure she commenced speaking with engaging hesitation whether perhaps since i am thanks to le bon dieu here in safety and about to return unhurt to my child and my mother it is not well i should have had this trial for you did come in timeyes mercifully in time i doubt if i could have endured much longer there were other things she went on hurriedly besides those which i consciously heard or saw which combined to disgust and terrify me you too believe do you not that thoughts may acquire a separate existencethoughts purposes imaginationsand that they may inhabit particular places i cannot explain but by such things i believe myself to be surrounded i felt they might break through whatever restraining medium withheld them and become visible a little longer and my reason too might have given way she paused but you cameyou came yes i came adrian repeated quietly and that being soi being mercifully spared the worst being unhurt i mean yes preciselyunhurt he repeated with praiseworthy docility this experience may be of value it may help to make me revise some mistaken ideasshe turned away and though her head was held high tears as adrian noted were again somewhat in evidencesome perhaps foolishly selfwilled andhow shall i sayconceited opinions in the last few minutes the car had traversed one of those unkempt and in a sense nomadic districts common to the fringe of all great cities spaces of waste land littered with nondescript rubbish and materials for new buildings in course of noisy construction alternated with rows of lowclass houses off the walls of which the plaster cracked and scaled with long lines of hoardings displaying liberal assortment of flaming posters wineshops at once shabby and showy crude reds greens and yellows adorning their wooden balconies and striped flapping awnings gaudyfronted dancingbooths and shootinggalleries tailing away at the back into neglected weedgrown gardens all these with a sparse population male and female very much to match while here and there some solitary shuttered dwelling standing back from the wide avenue in an inclosed plot of ground betrayed a countenance suggestive of disquieting adventures as madame st leger finished making her to adrian very touching confession the automobile quitting these doubtful purlieuswhich however thanks to a charm of early summer foliage and generous breadth of sunshine took on an air of jovial devilmaycare vagabondage inspiriting rather than objectionableheaded eastward along the boulevard skirting the grassgrown slopes and mounds of the dismantled fortifications and drew up opposite the entrance to the parc de montsouris here adrian proposed they should alight and stroll in the treeshaded alleys as a relief from the dust and noise of the streets but once on her feet gabrielle discovered how very tired she still was weakkneed and tremulous to the point of gladly accepting the support of her companions arm this renewed contact though of a comparatively perfunctory and unofficial character proved by no means displeasing to adrian in truth it gave him such a lively sense of happiness that to his dying day he will cherish a romantic affection for those remote and unfashionable pleasuregrounds upon the southern heights happiness is really the simplest of gods creatureseasily gratified large in charity hospitable to all the minor poetry of life whence it came about that this critical traveled shrewd and smart young gentleman had never surely beheld trees so green flowerborders so radiant walks so smooth and wellswept statues so noble cascades so musical lakes so limpid and so truthfully mirroring the limpid heavens above even the rococo and slightly ridiculous reproduction of the palace of the bey of tunis now used as an observatory which crowns the highest ground its domes cupolas somberly painted mural surfaces peacockblue encaustic tiles and rows of horseshoeheaded moorish archeslooking in its modern western surroundings about as congruous as a camel in a cabbagepatchpresented itself to his happy eyes with all the allurements of some geniiandgembuilt palace from out the immortal pages of the arabian nights gabrielle st legers hand rested upon his arm her feet kept step with his feet the folds of her dainty gown swept lightly against him as he walked past and future fell out of the reckoning nothing obtained save the beatified present while his heart and his senses were at once sharply hungry and exquisitely at peace the grounds were practically deserted only a few employees from the observatory bluehabited gardeners a batch of cooks touristsenglish and americanweary with sightseeing and some respectable french fathers of families imparting al fresco instruction in local natural science topography and art to their progeny were at hand to greet the passing couple with starings sympathetic selfconsicous or envious as the case might be among the first ranked the french fathers of families who paused in frank admiration and interest for was not the lady arrestingly elegantsapristi if ever a young man had luck yet after all why not for he too repaid observation truly a handsome fellow and of a type of male beauty eminently gallicrefined yet virile perfectly distinguished moreover in manner and in dress she appeared languid well what more easily comprehensible sincea marriage of inclination without doubt whereupon in the intervals of anxiously retrieving some strayed all too adventurous mimi or toto the fond parental being beheld in prophetic vision adrian the magnificent also shepherding a delicious little human flock how did you know or was it by chance that you came gabrielle presently inquired and in reply adrian explained that the affairs of the smyrthwaite inheritance being completed sooner than he anticipated he had advanced his returnah shade accusing shade of joanna but with la belle gabrielles hand resting confidingly upon his arm he could hardly be expected to turn aside to appease that unhappy phantom unfortunately i missed the connection in london and failed to catch the midday channel boat consequently i only reached paris early this morning i had passed two practically sleepless nightsagain accusing shade of joanna sound of footsteps and dragging of draperies upon the corridor outside his bedroom doorto my shame he continued i made up for my broken rest today it was already past three oclock when i went to my office i had omitted to warn my people there of my return picture then chre madame my emotion when my secretary handed me a letter from our friend miss beauchamp so it was anastasia madame st leger murmured but whether resentfully or gratefully her hearer failed to determine i flung myself into the automobileandenfinyou know the rest yes she agreed i know the rest and thereupon she gave a little cry of astonishment for turning the eastern side of the wouldbe moorish palace and passing on to the terrace in front of it the whole of paris was disclosed to view outspread below along the valley of the seine in intermingling finely gradated tones blond and silver the immense panorama presented itself squares gardens monuments worldfamous streets and worldfamous buildings seen in the splendid clarity of the sunpenetrated atmosphere purplestained here and there by the shadows of detached highsailing clouds upon the opposite height crowning montmartre the church of the sacr coeur rose ivorywhite its dome and clocktower seeming strangely adjacent to the vast blue arch of the summer sky while in the extreme distance both to right and left beyond the precincts of the laughing city a gray angular grimness of outlying forts struck the vibrant and masculine note of the peril of war for quite a sensible period of time gabrielle st leger gazed at the scene in silence then she took her hand from adrians arm and moved a step away but he could not quarrel with this since she put up her veil and looked frankly yet wistfully at him a great sweetness in her charming face ah she said stretching out her hand with a gesture of welcome to the noble view this is a thing to do one good to renew ones courage ones sanity and hope i am grateful to you it was both wise and kind of you to bring me here and show me this by so doing you have washed my mind of dark and sinister impressions you have made me once more in love with the goodness of god in love with life but come she added quickly almost shyly i must ask you to take me home to the quai malaquais i can meet my mother and child now without betraying emotionwithout letting them suspect the grave and terrible trial through which i have passed and upon this speech adrian savage being an astute and politic lover offered no comment he had gained so much today that he could afford to be patient making no attempt to press his point restraining his natural impetuosity he rested in the happiness of the present and spoke no word of love only his eyes perhaps gave him away just a little and undoubtedly on the return journey in the merrily singing car he permitted himself to sit a little closer to la belle gabrielle than on the journey out at the foot of the shining waxed wooden staircase within the doorway at the corner of the courtyard where backed by her bodyguard of spindly planes and poplars the lichenstained nymph still poured the contents of her tilted pitcher into the shellshaped basin below adrian left madame st leger no i will not come farther chre madame et amie he said his air at once gallant and tender standing before her hat in hand it will perhaps be easier in face of the pious fraud you propose to practise upon madame your mother that you should meet her alone he backed away it was safer farewells are treacherous all had been perfect so far he would give himself no chance of occasion for regret mount the stairs slowly though dear madame he called after her moved by sudden anxiety remember your recent fatiguethey are steep then the beloved gray gown and floating gray veil having passed upward out of sight he turned and went and now for that poor unhappy little devil of a tadpole he said chapter v de profundis just now he is quieter i have a hope that he sleeps but per bacco monsieur what a month what a six weeks since i had the honor of speaking with you last my poor master all the while going from bad to worse becoming more exacting more eccentric in his habits showing tendencies toward cruelty quite foreign to his nature and today what a scene after you left i had been on the alert all the afternoon since he displayed signs of febrile excitement i remained here in the passage not far from the door prepared notwithstanding his violent prohibition to enter the studio should any sound of a disturbing character reach me but his voice appeared calm i trusted the visit of the signoraah dio mio what charm what divine gracewas producing a beneficial effect soothing and pacifying my poor master upon my honor i declare to you it was only at the actual moment of my admitting you those heartrending cries for help arose then afterward pouring forth words which made even my ears tingle hardened old reprobatethe saints forgive methough i am he rushed upon the drawing of the signora which has been a glorious adornment of our studio for so long tore it from the easel and reduced it to a thousand fragments whichsince i have not yet dared to remove themmonsieur will still find scattered upon the carpet this work of destruction had the effect of appeasing his fury he flung himself among the pillows of the divan and has remained there ever since in a silence which justifies the hope that he sleeps the spare brighteyed velvetspoken giovanni folded his hands as in prayer monsieur will take command he will intervene to help us otherwise a catastrophe may ensue and the unrivaled genius of my poor master may be lost to the world as adrian crossed the dusky studio in the now fading light ren dax moved among the cushions and raised himself on his elbow mon vieux is that you he asked feebly they told metheyit does not matter whosome one told me you had come back i am glad for i need attention i apprehend some lesion of the brain my memory plays me false this causes inconveniences something here at the base of my skull seems to have given way to have snapped i think it would be well that i should leave paris for a time and take a cure of some description it is not prettyhe looked up at adrian with a childlike candor wholly disarmingno very certainly it is a far from pretty request but i shall be indebted to you if you will make it your business to discover a private hospital for the insanea civilized one mind youwhere i can be accommodated with a comfortable suite of rooms i have money enough my illustrations to the contes drolatiques will pay for this agreeable little jaunt but civilized i repeat where no objection will be made to receiving wellconducted domestic animals since i shall require to take both giovanni with me and aristides the just adrian sat down upon the divan his speech was somewhat thick and broken as he answered yes mon petit rest content that i will do my very best to find you such a place as you want and you will come often to visit me indeed i will come very constantly to visit you adrian said ren dax raised himself higher and looked long and searchingly at his friend from head to foot the red lamp began to glow behind his somber eyes again you do not possess onetenth of my talent he declared but you possess ten times my physique therefore you will obtain you will prosper you will lie soft from the most fastidious to the vilest all women are the same the moslems are right women have neither soul nor intellect only bodies bodies bodies all they want in a man is physique his tone changed to a wheedling one he crawled over the soft black silk cushions and put his arm coaxingly about adrians neck see mon vieux see be amiable do not loiter come at once let us search together diligently every corner every nook to recover it would fill me with rapture and there is still time before the schoolbell rings for class come help me to find my lost laughter he said and at that moment with a startling emotion of hope and of relief adrian observed for the first time that the infamous drawings upon the walls had been painted out leaving the whole from floor to ceiling white v the living and the dead chapter i some passages from joanna smyrthwaites locked book the drought was slow in breaking day after day raggedheaded thunder pillars boiled up along the southeastern horizon and drifting northward inland in portentous procession as the afternoon advanced massed themselves as a mighty mountain range against the sulky blue of the upper sky about their flanks later sheet lightning streaked and quivered making the hot night unrestful as with the winking of malevolent and monstrous eyes owing to the lie of the land and the encircling trees this aerial drama was not visible from the tower house but the atmospheric pressure and nervous tension produced by it very sensibly invaded the great woodland the french window of joanna smyrthwaites bedroom stood wide open on to the balcony she had drawn an easychair close up to it and dressed in her white woolen nglig sat there in the halfdark she left the nglig unfastened at the neck it being an unsuitably warm garment to wear on so hot a night she was aware it caused her discomfort despite which she wore it the pristine freshness of it was passed it was slightly soiled and the knifepleatings losing their sharpness of edge sagged irregularly in places like the bellows of an old concertina more than once mrs isherwood had declared miss joanna ought to buy herself a new wrapper or at any rate let this poor old object go to the cleaners but joanna refused almost angrily to part with it even for a week she gave no reason for her refusal but locked the insulted garment away in a drawer of her wardrobe whence she extracted it with jealous tenderness after isherwood had left her at night then she wore it if but for half an hour and wearing it she brooded fondling her right hand which upon two occasions adrian savage had kissed at the opposite end of the lawn in front of the tennis pavilion figures sauntered to and fro and voices were raised in desultory talk amy woodford giggled the elder busbridge boy whistled yipiaddy and losing his breath coughed the odor of cigarettes mingled with that of the trumpethoneysuckle and jasmine encircling the pillars of the veranda below the window joanna neither looked at nor listened to the others her eyes were fixed upon the circle of firtrees where the dense plumed darkness of their topmost branches met the only less dense darkness of the sky and she brooded once she kissed the hand which adrian savage had kissed but the figures and voices came nearer amy woodford her oxford undergraduate brother and the two busbridge boys were saying goodnight their feet tapped and scraped on the quarries of the veranda somebody ran into a chair toppled it over gave a yelp and the whole company laughed these playful goingson came between joanna and her brooding she rose impatiently crossed the room to her bureau lighted the candles and sat down to write august we are never alone i try not to be irritable but this constant entertaining wears me out it is contrary to all the traditions of our home life i cannot help thinking how strongly papa would have condemned it even mamma would have disapproved i fear i am wanting in moral courage and firmness in not expressing disapproval more often myself but margaret always imputes wrong motives to me and inverts the meaning of that which i say she cannot be brought to see that i object on principle and accuses me of a selfish attempt to shirk exertion she says i am inhospitable and elusive she even accuses me of being niggardly and grudging my share in the increased household expenditure this is unjust and i cannot help resenting it yesterday i remonstrated with her and our discussion degenerated to a wrangle which was painful and unbecoming today she has avoided speaking to me unless positively obliged to do so i feel i have failed in regard to margaret and that i ought to have kept up a higher standard since papa died and i became virtually the head of the house margaret is entirely occupied with amusement and with dress this must be in part my fault though dear mamma always feared frivolous inclinations in margaret it is all very trying i doubt whether marion chases influence is good for her i am sure mr challoners is not marion is fairly well educated but is without cultivated tastes mr challoner is not even well educated they both flatter her and defer to her wishes far too much other people flatter her too even serious persons such as the norbitons and mrs paull i do not think i am jealous of margaret but i will scrutinize my own feelings more closely upon this point i am afraid the servants observe that she and i are not on happy terms this worries me i dread the household taking sides isherwood and johnson and i believe smallbridge are quite faithful to me so is rossiter though i cannot help attributing that mainly to her dislike of the increased work in the kitchen but margarets new maid and her chauffeurwhose manner i consider much too familiarcreate a fresh element in our establishment they both are showy and i mistrust the effect of their companionship upon the younger servants i no longer really feel mistress in my own house my position is rendered undignified sometimes i regret the old days at highdene or here before papas death but that is weak of me even hypocritical since it is dread of responsibility rather than affection for the past which dictates the wish i must school myself to indifference and try more earnestly to rise superior to these worries i must look forward rather than look back joanna laid down her pen held up her right hand kissed the back of it just above the ridge of the knuckles thrust it within the open neck of her nglig and placing her left hand over it pressed it against her meager bosom i must look forward she said half aloud nothing is changed between us he told me so himself the night before he left i must rest in that she got up and paced the length of the room for a while repeatingi must rest in that must rest in that a sound of voices still rose from the garden now a mans and a womans in low and evidently intimate talk joanna stood still the note of intimacy excited subconscious unacknowledged envy within her she did not distinguish nor did she attempt to distinguish the words said the tones were enough it got upon her nerves to hear a man and woman speak thus a little longer and she felt she should be unable to bear itshe must command them to stop she went back to her bureau again here at a distance from the window the voices were less audible she sat down and forced herself to write this is the second dinnerparty we have given or rather which margaret has given within a week i absented myself pleading neuralgia and remained upstairs in the blue sittingroom with the exception of marion and mr challoner it was a boyandgirl party i do not feel at my ease in such company i fail to see the point of their slang expressions and their jokes and i do not understand the technical terms regarding games which they so constantly employ no doubt my dining upstairs will be a cause of offense but i cannot help it if margaret invites her own friends here so often she must at least contrive sometimes to entertain them without my assistance i will try to dismiss this subject from my mind to dwell upon it only irritates me i really needed to be alone tonight i live stupidly from day to day i feel that i ought to have a more definite routine of reading and of selfculture i ought to spend the present interval in educating myself more thoroughly for my future occupations and duties i will draw up some general scheme of study and i will keep my diary more regularly i so seldom write now yet i know it is good for me writing obliges me to be clear in my intentions and in my thought i am selfindulgent and allow myself to be too indefinite and vague to let my mind drift papa always warned me against that he used to say no woman was ever a sufficiently close thinker the inherent inferiority of the feminine intelligence was he held proved by this cardinal defect i know my inclination has always been toward too great introspection and i regret now that i have not striven more consistently after mental directness and grasp i have been reading the rvue de deux mondes lately feeling it a duty to acquaint myself with modern french literature the luminous objectivity of the french mind impresses me very stronglyan objectivity which is neither superficial nor unduly materialistic when listening to adrian i was often struck by this quality joanna laid down her pen once more she sat still her hands resting upon the flat space of the desk on either side the blottingpad her head thrown back and her eyes closed the voices in the garden had ceased and the silence save for the shutting of a door in a distant part of the house and the faint grinding of wheels and bell of a tramcar on the barryport road was complete for some minutes she remained in the same position her body inert her inward activity intense at last she raised her hands as though in protest and bending down fell to work upon her diary again with a smothered violence i have resisted the temptation to write about it till now i have been afraid of myself afraid for myself but tonight i feel differently i feel a necessity to refer to itto set it down in words and to relieve myself of the burden of the thing unspoken on former occasions when i have been greatly harassed and troubled i have found alleviation in so doing i want to make it quite clear to myself that i have never doubted consideration for me a desire to spare me distress and agitation dictated adrians silence regarding his sudden and unexpected departure he knew how painful it would be to me to part with him particularly after our conversation regarding bibby seeing how overwrought i had been by that conversation he wished to put no further strain upon me i want to make it quite clear to myself that the letter he left for us with smallbridge was all that good taste and courtesy demanded yet it hurt me it hurts me still he took pains to thank us for our hospitality and to express his pleasure in having helped us through all the business connected with our succession to papas property he said a number of kind and friendly things few persons could have written a more graceful or cousinly letter i know all this i entertain no doubt of his sincerity still the letter did hurt me margaret appropriated it it was addressed to her as well as to me so i suppose she believed herself to have a right to take possession of it and i am not sure i wished to keep it i could not have put it with his other letters since it only belonged to me in part yet i often wonder what margaret has done with itthrown it into the wastepaper basket most likely and it is very dreadful to think any letter of his has been thrown away or burned just because it was only half mine i feel so bitterly about it i am afraid i have allowed this bitterness to affect my attitude toward margaret but it is very painful that she should share in any degree the correspondence which is of such infinite value to me i do accept the fact that he acted in good faith without an idea how deeply so apparently simple a thing would wound me i excuse him of the most remote wish to wound me but i was and am wounded and his letters since thenthere are five of themhave failed to heal the wound it is dreadful to write all this down but it is far more dreadful to let it remain on my mind corroding all my thought of him not that it really does so in my agitation i overstate nothing is changed between us no nothing adrianbelieve me nothing yet in those last five letters i do detect a change they have not the playful frankness of the earlier ones i detect effort in them they are very interesting and very kind i know still there is something lacking which i can only describe as the personal note they are written as a duty they lack spontaneity he tells me he has been detained in paris all the summer by the illnessnervous breakdownof a former schoolfellow he tells me of his continued efforts to trace bibby but these are outside things of which he might write to any acquaintance i read and reread these letters in the hope of discovering some word some message actual or implied addressed to me as me the woman he has so wonderfully chosen but i do not find it so the wound remains unhealed yet how ungrateful i am to complain to do so shows me my own nature in a dreadful lightgrasping impatient suspicious innumerable duties and occupations may so readily interfere to prevent his writing more frequently or more fully why cannot i trust him more is it not the very height of ingratitude thus to cavil and to doubt overcome by emotion joanna left the bureau and paced the room once more her arms hanging straight at her sides her hands plucking at the pleatings of her nglig the heat seemed to her to have increased to an almost unbearable extent notwithstanding which she clung to her woolen garment crossing to the washingstand she dipped a handkerchief in the water and folding it into a bandage held it across her forehead she blew out the candles and returning to the open window sank into the easychair the sky remained unclouded but in the last hour had so thickened with thunder haze that it was difficult to distinguish the treetops from it joanna gazed fixedly at this hardly determinable line of junction presently she began to talk to herself in short hurried sentences i know i told him i would wait i believed i had strength sufficient for entire submission but i am weaker than i supposed i despise myself for that weakness but i cannot wait he is my life without him i have no lifenone that is coherent and progressive my loneliness and emptiness apart from my relation to him are dreadful and lately jealousy has grown shockingly upon me i think of nothing else i am jealous of every person whom he sees of every object which he touches of his literary work because it interests himjealous of the old schoolfellow whom he is nursing jealous of bibby for whom he searches jealous of the very air he breathes and ground on which he treads all these come between him and me stealing from me that which should be mine since they are close to him and engage his attention and thought joanna stopped breathless and closing her eyes lay back in the chair while drops oozing from the wet bandage trickled downward and dripped upon her thin neck and breast now at last i am honest with myself she whispered i have spoken the truththe hateful truth since it lays bare to me the inner meanness of my own nature i no longer palliate my own repulsive qualities or attempt to excuse myself to myself i admit my many faults i call them by their real names now possibly i shall become calmer and more resigned the completeness of my faith in him will come back and then some day in the future when i tell him how i repent of my suspicions and rebellious doubts he will forgive me and help me to eradicate my faults and make me more worthy of the wonderful gift of his love then she lay still exhausted by her paroxysm of selfaccusation here you are at last you do take an unconscionably long time saying goodnight i nearly gave up and went indoors to bed this chaffingly from the terrace outside the veranda in marion chases hearty barytone i imagine people in our situation usually have a good deal to say to each other rustlings of silk and creakings followed occasioned by the descent of a wellcushioned feminine body into a wicker chair and pray how far did you go with him still chaffingly only to the end of the carriagedrive and then into the road for a minute to see the lightning really its too oddquite creepy looking toward the county gates the sky seems to open and shut like the lid of a box i shouldnt mind its opening wider and giving us some rain its too stuffy for words tonight and then he proceeded to walk back with you i suppose no he didnt because i dismissed him i can be firm when i choose you know and i am sure it is wisest to begin as i mean to go on i intend to be my own mistress and his master doesnt that follow as a matter of coursea necessary corollary as joanna would say too i didnt want to run the risk of meeting any of the servants coming in he is liable to be a little demonstrative when we are alone dont you know margaret well why not i take demonstrations quite calmly so long as they are made in private it would be silly to do otherwise theyre just of course part of the whole show yes if you like to be vulgar marion and quote the busbridge boysi limit my quotations to joannaof the whole show after a short pause maggie did you settle any dates tonight i thought he seemed preoccupied as if he meant business of some sort you dont mind my asking not in the least he says he is bothered because his position is an equivocal one so it is this very sensibly from marion chase people begin to think you are simply mean to keep him dangling do they how amusing not for him poor beast and both young women laughed he is wild to have the announcement made at once in the papers do you mean yes the times and morning post of course and two local ones he suggests the stourmouth and marychurch chronicle and the barryport gazette i should have thought the courier ranked higher but he says its not nearly so widely read as the chronicle then we ought to put it in a yorkshire paper as well i think how awfully thrilling at first to joanna at the open window above still laboring with the aftermath of her gloomy outbreaks of passion this conversation had been but as a chirping of birds or squeaking of bats such slipshod telegraphic chatterings between the two young ladies obnoxious alike to her taste and scholarship were her daily portion joanna had scornfully trained herself to ignore them she could not prevent their assailing her ears but she could and as a rule did successfully prevent their reaching her understanding tonight however strained and on edge as she was her will proved incapable of prolonged effort and indifference was unsustainable gradually the manner of the speakers and significance of that which they said mastered her unwilling attention surprise followed on surprise she knew how the two friends talked in her presence was this how they talked in her absence disclosingespecially in the case of her sisteran attitude of mind let alone definite purposes and actions of which she had been in total ignorance andto carry the question a step fartherdid this connote corresponding ignorance on her part in other directions was she joanna living in worlds very much unrealized where all manner of things of primary importance remained unknown to or misinterpreted by her the thought opened up vistas packed with agitation and alarm selfdefense admits few scruples and it appeared to poor joanna just then that every mans hand was against her living in the midst of deceptions what weapon except deceitand in this case deceit was tacit onlyremained to her her sense of honor and along with it the selfrespect in which the roots of honor are set went overboard instead of leaving the window and refusing to hear more joanna stayed a morbid desire to know to learn all that which was being kept from her to get at the truth of these lives lived so close to her own to get at the truth of their opinion of her seized upon her she took the moist handkerchief off her forehead and slipping noiselessly out of her chair knelt upon the rug laid along the inner side of the windowsill craning her neck forward so that no word of the conversation might escape her personally as i told him i was in no particular hurry pleasant news for him marion chase returned but im not there are several good reasons for waitingour mourning for one thing and then the question of a house heatherleighs not large enough or smart enoughall very well for a bachelor establishment i dare say what i should like is this house but i doubt whether joanna would give it up though it really is altogether too extensive a place for her alone i dont mean that she could not afford to keep it up she could afford to but it would be ostentatious ridiculously out of proportion for an unmarried woman joannas indignation nearly flamed into speech she moved impatiently causing the chair behind her to scrape on its casters what was that from marion chase a fircone falling probably its hotter than everno i havent the smallest intention of not going through with this business but im in no hurry things are quite amusing as they are i believe you enjoy taking people in you wicked old thing if keeping quiet about my own affairs is taking people in i suppose i do enjoy it and then of course you see i am bound to tell joanna first theres no help for that magsie you know her windows are open you dont think we can be overheard no its all right i looked when i came back theres no light either shes still in the blue sittingroom or shes gone to bed too i must do her the justice to say joanna is not the sort of person who listens she would consider it wrong joanna drew back and was on the point of rising again the chair scraped and then she would never condescend to listen to anything i might happen to be saying there is a compensating freedom in being beneath notice joanna remained on her knees at the open window i own i most cordially dislike the idea of telling her margaret continued i know she will be unreasonable and say things which will lead to all sorts of disputes and disagreeables between us oh but she must know perfectly well already only she means to make you speak first the other returned its too absurd to suppose she hasnt spotted whats been going on why his state of mind has been patent for ages she cant be off seeing i dont believe for a single moment she does see shes so frightfully selfabsorbed and selfoccupied you know yourself marion how extraordinarily obtuse she can be she lives in the most hopeless state of dream joanna swayed a little as she knelt and laid hold of the folds of the striped tabaret windowcurtain for support i know she always has been inclined to dream but recently it has grown upon her for me to say anything to her about it is worse than useless she only sits upon me and then we have words as isherwood says at bottom joanna is awfully obstinate in many ways she reminds me very much of papa only being a woman unfortunately one cant get round her as one could round him people are beginning to notice what an odd moody state she is in mrs norbiton said something about it when they dined here on monday she said joanna seemed so absentminded and asked whether i thought she wasnt well and colonel haig mentioned it to me the afternoon we had tea with him at the golf club that really led to his telling me what he had heard in paris telling youoh i remember what he had heard about mr savage marion chase remarked joanna got on to her feet went out on to the balcony and hung over the red balustrade into the hot thick darkness margaret she called margaret i must speak to you please come to my room it is something urgent come at once chapter ii recording a sisterly effort to let in light when margaret smyrthwaite entered her sisters bedchamber she brought the atmosphere of a perfumers shop along with her under the elder and sterner reign scentsprays and scentcaskets were unknown at the tower house montagu smyrthwaite holding such adjuncts to the feminine toilet in hardly less abhorrence than powder or paint itself a modest whiff of aromatic vinegar or of eaudecologne touched the highwater mark of permitted indulgence but in the use of perfumes as in other matters margaretso mrs isherwood put ithad broke out sadly since the poor old gentleman went the intellectual streak common to the smyrthwaite family had from the first been absent in the young ladys composition while the morbid streak also common in the family was now cauterized if not actually eliminated by the sunshine of her seven thousand a year a northcountry grit a rather foxy astuteness and a toughness of fiberalso inheritedremained however very much to the fore in her with the result that she would travelwas indeed already travelingthe grand trunk road of modern life without hesitation or apology or any of those anxious questionings of why wherefrom and whither which beset persons of nobler spiritual caliber in the past few months she had shed the last uncertainties of girlhood she had filled out and was in act of blossoming into that which gentlemen of the challoner order in moments of expansion not without a cocking of the eye and moistening of the lip are tempted to describe as a dd fine woman now the light of the candle she carried showed the rounded smoothness of her handsome neck and arms through the transparent yoke and sleeves of her black evening blouse touched the folds and curls of bright auburn hair upon her forehead and brought the hard bright blue of her eyes into conspicuous evidence a deficiency of eyelash and eyebrow caused her permanent vexation this defect she intended to remedysome day not just at present however as both joanna and isherwood were too loyally wedded to the aromatic vinegar and eaudecologne rgime for such facial reconstructions to pass without prejudiced and aggravating comment advancing up the room all of a piece and somewhat solid in tread she offered a notable contrast to joanna who awaited her palpitating and angular ravaged by agonies and aspirations indignantly trembling within the sagged knifepleatings of her soiled white nglig the rough copy and dition de luxe as adrian had dubbed them just then very forcibly presented their likeness and unlikeness yet possibly to a discerning eye the rough copy though superficially so conspicuously lacking in charm might commend itself as the essentially nobler of these two human documents what is the matter joanna the dition de luxe inquired why couldnt you send isherwood to say you wanted to speak to me its fortunate marions and my nerves are steady for your calling out gave us both an awful start i did listen the other returned in a breathlessness of strong emotion i was sitting at the window in the dark when you began talking at first i paid no heed but as your conversation went on i found it bore reference to matters which you are keeping from me and with which i ought to be acquainted i found it concerned memyself i offer no apology i acted in selfprotection i listened deliberately margaret laid the magazines and illustrated fashion papers she carried under her arm upon the slab of the open bureau she set down her flat candlestick beside them thus creating a triad of lighted candlesunlucky omen then nannie she said coolly you did something which was not at all nice the word stung joanna by its grotesque inadequacy either to the depth of her sufferings or of her transgression against the laws of honor to range at the tragic level in relation to both would have afforded her consolation and support margaret denied such consolation by taking her own stand squarely upon the conventional and commonplace joannas transgression began to show merely vulgar this compelled her to descend from tragic heights am i to understand that you really are engaged to mr challoner she therefore asked without further preamble if you listened you must have gathered as much i imagine margaret said i didi did but i refused to believe it i thought i must be mistaken i was unprepared for such news it came to me as such a shock such a distressing surprise really its quite your own fault joanna margaret returned what did you suppose hed been coming here for constantly not for that thank you margaret said you know i have always objected to his being here so much i tried to prevent it i feared it might lead to gossip i felt you did not consider that seriously enough it is so dreadful that what we do or say should be commented upon until the business connected with the property was settled i recognized a necessity for mr challoners frequent visits but not since then not for the last three months i am quite willing to admit his good points i quite believe he has served us faithfully in businesspray do not suppose i underrate his services in that respect but i never supposed he could presume to propose to you margaret i dont see anything presumptuous in his proposing he admires me very much is it such an unheardof thing that he should wish me to marry him nonobut that you should give him encouragementfor you must have encouraged him andwith disconcerting composure from the dition de luxewhy not joanna began to pace the room restlessly in her trailing draperies becausebecauseshe saidyour own instinct must tell you what an unsuitable marriage this would be for youfor our parents daughter for my sister i dont want to be selfish margaret but i have a right to consider my own future to some extent and mr challoneri dislike to seem to deprecate himit is invidious to do soindeed it is intensely distasteful to me to point out his peculiaritiesbut when i think of him as a brotherinlawhis antecedents his standard of manners and conversation strike me as so different to those to which we have always been accustomed i cannot avoid seeing this it is so very palpable others must see it toomembers of our family i mean with whom we are or may in the future be intimately associated in her excitement clearness of statement failed somewhat margaret stood listening calmly obstinate her head a little bent while she straightened the magazines and picture papers lying on the slab of the bureau with her fingertips i didnt for one moment imagine you would be pleased at my engagementthats why i have not told you sooner i was sure youd be disagreeable about it and you are disagreeable joanna very disagreeable indeed like most people who plume themselves on being very highminded you end by being very vulgarminded and worldly i quite expected this tone from you and so i put off telling you as long as possible even now you must remember you have surprised my confidence i have not given it voluntarily useless discussions such as this bore me useless joanna interrupted quite useless unless i happen to change my mind which i shall not do i have considered things all round i have talked everything over with marion you must make what you like of it joanna but i am going to marry challoner the scriptural christian name annoyed her as suggesting possibilities of humorous retrospect the mister under existing romantic circumstances savored of underbred middleclass ceremony so she struck for the surname pure and simple thereby conferring in some sort the noble conciseness of a title upon her admirer i dont share your very exalted opinions of our position and importance she continued papa was a successful yorkshire mill owner challoner is the head of a firm of successful southcountry solicitors you talk of his antecedents his father was a very enterprising man who built up the business here which he has carried on and developed everybody in this part of england knows who challoner greatrex pewsey are the firms reputation is above suspicion they opened a branch office four years ago at southampton and one last year at weymouth really i cant see what you have to object to on the score of position joanna andrew merrimans grandfather was only a millhand you need not have alluded to that the other cried sharply then fighting for selfcontrol she added you know quite well it is a marriage you would never have thought of making while papa was living and you know equally well nannie it was utterly hopeless to think of any marriage whatever when papa was alive we hardly ever saw a man papa snubbed every one who came near us no one dared propose even if they wished to do so remember all the andrew merriman business pray dont refer to that again joanna said i only wanted to give you an instancenannie would you mind sitting down it makes me so dreadfully hot to watch you roaming about in that way we could talk ever so much better if you would only keep stilland there is a great deal which has to be talked over some time as we have begun tonight we may as well go on and get through with it the heat makes me fidgety im not inclined to go to bed thus admonished joanna sank into the easychair once more she doubled herself together working her hands nervously ballandsocket fashion in her lap the perception that this was a new margaret a margaret wholly unreckoned with grew upon her and along with that perception an apprehension of fronting things unknown yet of vital significance things which when known must inevitably color all her future outlook grew upon her likewise as yet the screen of ignorance dense though impalpable as the dense thunderthickened sky there outside interposed between her and those fateful things veiling them but margaret the new composed practical highly perfumed margaret was in act of drawing that screen aside then what would she joanna see what concourse of cruel verities lurked behind waiting to jump on herasking herself this she shivered notwithstanding the heat of the atmosphere and of her woolen gown with premonition of coming chillchill of loneliness chill of disaster of which such loneliness was at once the bitter flower and the root her sister had followed her to the window and stood just within it nonchalant and comely fanning herself with a little fan hanging by a ribbon from her waistband the silver spangles upon the black gauze sparkled sharply in the candlelight and the ebony sticks ticked as she waved it to and fro i do so wish you wouldnt make a tragedy of all this nannie she said but of course i knew you would because you always think it your duty to get into a wild state of mind over everything i say or do it would be so much more comfortable for both of us if you could get it into your head once and for all that youre not responsible for me in any way we are equals were the same ageyou always seem to forget thatand im quite as competent to manage my affairs as you are to manage yours you have no authority over me of any description legal or moral none whatsoever you know i am only too well aware that i have failed to influence you margaret joanna returned while waves of scented air set in motion by the black and silver fan played upon her face i had been thinking of that tonight before i overheard your and marions conversation i had been reproaching myself i know we are the same age but our dispositions are different and i have always occupied an elder sisters position toward you it is very distressing to me to realize how entirely i have failed to influence you this contemplated marriage of yours gives the measure of my nonsuccess oh dear me influencefailurereally you know nannie you are most awfully provoking the other exclaimed i dont want to lose my temper and be cross but i am so frightfully sick of this whole responsibility mania its been the bugbear of our lives ever since we were children papa and mamma sacrificed themselves and sacrificed us to it with the result that weve always been in an unnatural attitude like dogs trying to walk on their hind legs margaret margaret joanna protested scandalized by the filial profanity of the suggested picture so we have nannie and in what has this everlasting preaching of responsibility ended why simply in making papa believe he was doing right by being rude and arrogant and dreadfully disagreeable over trifles in making mamma a hopeless invalid in ruining bibby body and soul making him untruthful and dishonest and inclined to do all sorts of horrid ungentlemanly things hush no i am not going to hush joanna you asked me to come here and you asked me a question now you really must listen till i have said all i have to say in answer i want to get it over its far too unpleasant to go through twice and this mania about responsibility has been disastrous for you tooyou know that perfectly well it has spoiled your life by keeping you in a perpetual state of fuss and worry and of dissatisfaction with your own conduct and everybody elses as for me it made me hysterical and fretful and deceitful too how could one help being deceitful when one was always dodging some silly trumpedup faultfinding or bother i believe it would have broken up my nerves altogether if it had gone on much longer and what on earth does it all mean what were we responsible for who were we responsible to she went on contemptuously i dont know and i dont believe you know either joanna if you would only use your commonsense and give up worshiping words and phrases the whole thing is nonsense and rather lying nonsensejust a pretending to oneself that one is better and cleverer than other people when you come to think of it this craze for superiority is so frightfully conceited for who cares or ever has cared whether we smyrthwaites were intellectual and highminded and cultured and wellread and all the rest of it or not in my opinion the system on which our parents brought us up and on which their parents brought them up is nothing but an excuse for selfadulation and pharisaism i am sick to death of the whole thing and i mean to break away from it and the simplest way to do so is to marry challoner hes about as far away from it all as anybody well can bejust a modern practical man who cares for real things not for advanced thought and reform and political economy and questions of morals and so on he isnt a bit intellectual he only reads the newspapers or an occasional novel in the train when hes traveling i am thankful to say and i am awfully glad he belongs to the church of england for i mean to break with the unitarian connection joanna i dont care about doctrine one way or another but i can see how narrowminded and exclusive it makes people when they belong to a small sect unitarians are always so frightfully pleased with themselves because they believe less than other people theyre always living up to their own cleverness in not believing and it does make them awfully hindleggy and boringand then of course being a nonconformist cuts one out of a lot socially it is no end of a disadvantage to one it didnt signify so much in the north but here it has stood horridly in our way lots of nice people would have called on us when we first came if we hadnt been dissenters and please understand i mean to know everybody now and be popular i should enjoy giving away prizes and opening bazaars and entertaining on a big scale and taking part in all that goes on here it would amuse me i can give large subscriptions and i mean to give them as i say i intend to be popular and to be talked about i intend to make myself a power in the place and then joanna theres something morei dare say youll think it necessary to be scandalizedbut theres this she stopped fanning herself and looked out into the hot darkness smiling a certain luster upon her smooth skin and a fullness about her bosom and her lips her voice took on richer tones when she spoke i want to marry and i mean to marry i am nine and twenty and im tired of not knowing exactly what marriage is so im not going to wait and hawk myself and my fortune about on the chance of a smarter match i have decided to be sensible and make the best of what i havenamely challoner i dont pretend he is perfect i take him as he stands after all he is only just forty and he is in excellent health i care about that for i dislike sickly people especially men theyre always horridly selfish and fanciful either they oughtnt to marry at all or ought to marry hospital nursesthen challoner is making a good income weve talked quite frankly over the money question and thenthen for the first time she showed signs of slight embarrassment laughing a little pursing up her lips and fanning herself again lightly then she repeated he is desperately in love with me and i enjoy that i want more of it it interests and amuses me it is exciting to find one can twist a great hardheaded fellow like challoner round ones little finger make him go hot and cold grow nervous and all of a tremor just by a word or a look he is like so much dough in my hands i can shape him as i like theres nothing he wouldnt do to please me oh yes he is desperately in love with me this drawing back of the interposing screen and exhibition of the smyrthwaite tradition and system stripped to the skin stripped indeed to an almost primordial nothingness had been richly distressing to poor joanna for was not she intrinsically the product and exponent of the said tradition and system did it not stand for the loom upon which the whole pattern of her character and conduct was woven in thus stripping the system she was painfully conscious that margaret stripped her also to a like miserable nakedness and nothingness for admitting the laws which she had been brought up to reverence and to obey which she had trained herself with such unsparing diligence were nugatory what remained to her for guidance or inspiration admitting her strenuously acquired mental attitude and habit to be but senseless posturing as of dancing dogs how deplorably she had wasted herself upon that which profiteth not if the formative processes of her education and culture represented nothing better than laborious subscription to exploded fallacy must she not make a return with all possible speed upon whatever remnant of unalloyed instinct and spontaneous purpose might still be left in her but how to make such a return how to reform to recreate her attitude and outlook these questions assailed joanna bewildering alike in their multiplicity and intricacy the wheels of her overtaxed brain whizzed and whirred for the curse of the systemridden of the pedant of the doctrinaire is loss of clearseeing simplicity of initiative of that power of direct and unaided action which is the reward of simplicity stripped of encompassing precept and precedent deprived of sustaining prejudice joanna found herself naked and helpless indeed she ran wildly in search of fresh precept and precedent in which to clothe herself and found them after a fashion normal and natural enough had they happened to be grounded in fact instead of in most pitiful illusion for as distressedly watching her sisters rather cynical exposure of the family tradition she asked herselfin face of the said exposurewhat to her personally remained she answered that adrian savage remained and thereupon proceeded with all the intensity and pentup passion of her morbidly introspective nature to fling herself upon the thought of that delightful young man and his matrimonial intentions hounding out doubts furiously repressing misgivings she grappled herself to belief in adrian with hooks of iron chained herself to it with links of steel drank from the well of splendid promise which it offered to the verge of inebriety in him she hailed her savior adrian would make good the wasted years adrian would teach her where she had been mistaken and where her intelligence had gone astray adrian would instruct and counsel her would supply her with a rule of living at once just and distinguished adrian would be gentle to her errorshad he not shown himself so already on more than one occasionwould be sympathetic playful and charming even in merited rebuke she heard his voice once again saw him in his habit as he lived gallant courteous eager yet debonair and seeing her poor heart spilled itself upon the ground like water at his conquering feet joanna could sit still no longer her agitation was too vital too overmastering she left the chair by the window and began to roam to and fro her hands plucking at the pleatings of her dress her pale prominent eyes staring fixedly her lips parted her expression rapt because thou art more noble and like a king she quoted silently turning to the sonnets from the portuguese for adequate expression of her emotion thou canst prevail against my fears and fling thy purple round me the consequence of all of which was that she paid scant attention to the concluding portion of her sisters comprehensive argument in favor of her projected espousal of joseph challoner and only awoke from the state of trance induced by her access of adrianworship when the repetition of margarets assertion of the violent character of challoners affection and the slightly ambiguous laugh following that assertion struck her ear then she turned upon the speaker with the righteous wrath of one who hears sacred words put to unworthy uses desperately in love she said harshly and do you intend me to understand margaret that you are desperately in love with mr challoner in return oh dear no the lady addressed replied calmly enough though if i were i see no occasion for your scolding me about it nanniewhat does make you so restless and cross tonight however if youre determined to be uncomfortable im notso i shall sit down here in your chair did you see the lightning then no im not the least silly about challoner but then i should be very sorry to be silly about any man i dont think it dignified for a woman to be in a wild state of mind about her fianc its not nice i like challoner well enough to marry him and well enough not to mind his making love to me thats quite sufficient i think jealous curiosity pricked joanna she stopped in her agitated walk and stood stretching out her right hand and gazing abstractedly at it whatwhat precisely do you mean when you speak of his making love to you margaret she said in a thin urgent whisper really for a person who plumes herself upon being particularly refined you do say the most singular things joanna the other exclaimed laughing you can hardly expect me to go into details making love is making love kissing your handdo you mean joanna gasped in awestruck accents a dry sob rising in her throat ones hand why anybody might kiss ones hand challoners proceedings im afraid are considerably more unrestrained than that but i positively cant go into details how extraordinary you are nannie doesnt it occur to you there are questions which one doesnt ask streaks of pain shot across the back of joannas right hand as though it were struck again and again with a rod moaning just audibly she thrust it within the open bosom of her white nglig and laid her left hand upon it fondling it as one striving to soothe some sorely wounded creature margaret leaned back in the easychair fingering her little fan a sleekness a suggestion of almost animal content in her expression and attitude no really i cant explain any further she said laughing a little im quite hot enough as it is and refuse to make myself any hotter you must wait till somebody makes love to you im afraid nannie if you want to know exactly what the process consists in an objectlesson would be necessary and i am hardly equal to supplying that joannas roamings had taken her as far as the door leading on to the gallery she waited leaning against it the back of margarets chair was toward her so that she was safe from observation for this she was not sorry as the pain in her hand was acute particularly upon the spot where adrians lips had once touched it there it throbbed and smarted as though a live coal were pressing into the flesh her face was drawn with suffering she dreaded to have her sister ask what ailed her but that young ladys thoughts were quite otherwise engaged she spoke presently over her shoulder her voice sounded curiously cozy this evening when he said goodby to me challoner lifted me right off my feet when he was kissing me he had never done so before i liked it it showed how strong he is i felt a wee bit nervous but i enjoyed it too i revel in his strength my ribs ache stillthere nannie is that little sample of lovemaking illuminating enough and leaning against the polished surface of the door joanna shivered nursing and fondling her burning hand chapter iii in which joanna embraces a phantom bliss the obscure psychological relation existing between twins necessarily produces either peculiar sympathy or peculiar opposition of tastes and sentiment the record of these twin sisters was of the discordant sort unspoken rivalry and jealousy had divided them unconsciously yet unremittingly they had struggled for preeminence at the present moment in joannas case these feelings combined to produce a sensation approaching active hatred as she leaned shivering against her bedroom door in the oppressive warmth of the summer night all her petty griefs and grudges against her more attractive and popular sister complained in chorus as a child margaret had been pretty and taking at school though lazy and by no means clever she had been petted and admired such affection as montagu smyrthwaite was capable of displaying he had displayed toward her margaret was sensitive margaret was delicatewhich meant that margaret knew just when to cry loud enough to excite pity just when to announce tiredness or a headache so as to escape unwelcome exertion she had in short reduced the practice of selfishnessso joanna thoughtto a fine art and now finally tonight not timidly with disarming apology but with flaunting assurance margaret dared to infringe herjoannascopyright in the wonderstory of a mans love thereby capping the climax of offense her transcript of the said story might be of the grosser sort yet on that very account it showed the more convincing no misgivings no agonized suspense no tremulously anxious reading between the lines were demanded it was printed in large type and in language coarsely vigorous as joseph challoner himself morally it repelled joanna although inflaming her imagination with vague drivings of desire her whole poor being indeed was swept by conflicting and but halfcomprehended passions from amid the tempest of which this one thing declared itself in a rising scale of furious insistencenamely that margaret should not once again best her that no marriage margaret might elect to make should endanger her own marriage with adrian savage that by some means any means fair or foul margaret must be prevented tasting the fullness of mans lovenever mind how poor an edition of love this might be how unpoetic bow vulgaras long as she joanna was denied loves fullness yet so deeply were tradition and system ingrained in her that even at this pass she paid homage to their ruling since instead of making a direct attack and owning anger as the cause of it she tricked herself with a fiction of moral obligation margaret she began presently from her station at the door speaking with such selfcommand as she could muster i dislike alluding to the subject very much no doubt you will be annoyed and will accuse me of interference still there is something i feel i ought to say to you if i do not say it now there may not be a suitable opportunity later then pray say it now as i have told you i want to get the whole thing thoroughly thrashed out tonight so that we may avoid odious discussions in the future what is it joanna i cant help observing that it is only since papas death mr challoner has paid you so much attention before then margaret rose and faced round upon the speaker her manner remained composed but her blue eyes held the light of battle you mean it is not me but my fortune challoner is in love with i quite expected you would tell me that joanna sooner or later but i am bound to say it is not a very elegant compliment either to him or to me i did not intend to bring such an accusation against him joanna protested it would be very dreadful to suppose any ones affection any ones choice could be seriously influenced by the fact we have money im afraid my views are less romantic than yours it seems to me quite natural money should prove an attractionparticularly in cases where other attractions are rather wanting for some reason joanna felt the stroke of a rod across her hand again the pain excited her she came forward a step or two you do not give me time to explain myself margaret before papas death mr challoners name was very freely associated with that of mrs spencer both you and marion chase spoke of an engagement between them as certain others spoke of it also the probability of a marriage was accepted i cannot forget this margaret laughed really its too funny that you of all people should champion wretched little mrs spencer why joanna you invariably intimated she was quite beneath your notice and have lost no opportunity of snubbing her ive had to be nice more than once simply because i felt so awfully ashamed of your rudeness to her i do not like her she is unladylike still i think mr challoners change of attitude requires explanation do you margaret retorted here is the explanation then simply that challoner is too kindhearted to save himself at the expense of a woman even when she has treated him badly he told me all about her months ago he felt i had better hear it from him but he did his best to excuse her he showed wonderfully nice feeling about it all i was not prepared for his being so scrupulous and it made me admire him for she is the sort of person who spends her time in extracting money and presents from every man she can get hold of challoner admits he was taken in by her at first and was foolishly weak with her she pretended to be almost penniless and worked upon his feelings so much that he let her live in that house of his in silver chine road rent free for nearly two years and when her demands became too extortionate and she persecuted him so disgracefully that he was compelled in selfdefense to get rid of her he found her another house at marychurch and i believe pays half the rent of it for her still i know he gave her sister beattie staceywho is engaged to an officer on one of the cape linersa beautifully fitted travelingbag as a wedding present marion saw it only last weekthose are the facts joanna i hope now your conscience is easy she stood looking down pressing back an upturned corner of the rug upon which joanna had knelt earlier in the evening with the pointed toe of her beaded slipper of course i shant receive her she said i told challoner my magnanimity wouldnt carry me as far as that after the abominable way in which shes exploited him all the same im rather grateful to the wretched little woman but for her i mightnt have known how generous challoner could be i really believe the satisfaction of rescuing him from her clutches is among my chief reasons for accepting himthat and then of course cousin adrian savage with a sort of rush joanna came closethe violence of some halfstarved creature in her pale eyes her drawn face and her parted lips adrian she cried adrian what possible connection can there be between cousin adrian and your engagement to mr challoner for some seconds margaret smyrthwaite looked hard and thoughtfully at her sister then holding the skirt of her dress aside she pressed the upturned corner of the rug into place again with the pointed toe of her slipper i shall be so thankful she said when you give up wearing that frightful old dressinggown nannie decidedly it is not as clean as it might be and it looks so horridly stuffy i never have understood your craze for hoarding butbutadrian joanna insisted adrian surely you must have seen nannie its just one of those things which arent easy to put into words but which i should have thought even you must have grasped though you are so different to most people i sometimes have wondered lately though whether you really are so different to other people or whether youre only extraordinarily secretivebut naturally having a young man like cousin adrian staying so long in the house this winter put ideas into ones head and made one think a good deal about marriage and so on i took for granted papa had some notion of that kind when he appointed adrian his executor he had a great opinion of him and would have liked him as a soninlawor fancied he would of course he wanted to bring us togetherthat was the object of the appointment you think so joanna questioned joy anxious but great arose in her i havent a doubt about it all the same i couldnt out of respect for papas wishes make advances to a young man who showed quite clearly he didnt care a row of pins about me he was always kind and civil to you margaret joanna interrupted restrainingly jealousy folded its beating wings betaking itself to most unaccustomed repose civil and kind i dare say butwell of course there are signs one cant mistake unless one blinds oneself wilfully to their meaning she tossed her head her eyes hard and bright joannas expression meanwhile became increasingly ecstatic yes there are signs one cannot mistakesigns which it would be weak and faithless to mistake she whispered i dont deny i felt rather enraged margaret continued too busy with her own vexation to remark the others singular aspect i could have been very much upset about it all if i had let myself go i am sorry joanna murmured touched by unexpected pity indeed margaret i am sorry oh you werent to blame in any way nannie and you see i didnt let myself go i just turned my attention to challoner there is nothing ambiguous about his admiration and nowshe glanced curiously at her sisternow she continued as things have turned out im most uncommonly glad i didnt allow myself to get into a state of mind about adrian as things have turned outi understand i am pleased you do not blame me margaret yes as things have turned out joanna repeated excitedly for here as she saw it was the hour of her triumph of assured and splendid victory the room seemed too small to hold her rapture hardly aware of that which she did she brushed past her sisterstill standing fan in hand beside the chair at the windowand went out on to the balcony she required to be alone so as to savor to the full the heady sweetness of her own emotion she wanted to forget every one everything save that only she wanted to abandon herself without reserve to the thought of adrian savage to gloat over every incident of her intercourse with him and project her imagination onward to the closer the continuous and exclusive intercourse of the future for had not margarets confessionthe more persuasive because reluctantly madeamounted to an admission that adrians affection belonged to her and to her only did it not supply reasonable confirmation of her sorely tried faith in him and ratify all her hopes by setting the seal of witness upon the fact of his love for her such was the meaning she read into the recent conversation piecing evidence together into a coherent whole never before had she been absolutely certain now as she told herself she was certaincould safely be so in that margaret had admitted the fact if not in so many words yet implicitly her fathers wish and purpose had been that the young man should marry one of his two daughtersmargaret had perceived this and she joanna was the one he had chosen thereby justifying all her past efforts and labors and rehabilitating the poor cynically denuded family system into the bargain was not the whole habit and conduct of her life vindicated inasmuch as it led to this superb result the years had not been wasted but were on the contrary the patient seedtime of this welcome harvest she had been right from the first right in every particular so that not upon her or her methods but upon those who differed from undervalued or slighted her rested the onus of proof and here the intellectual and moral arrogance latent in joanna smyrthwaites nature upheaved itself mightily and stood aggressively erect overweening selfesteem as on giant wings sustained her for to such disastrous inflations of pride are introspective persons liable when they failas they do so frequently failto discriminate between deeds and emotions between the barren power to feel and the fertile the lifegiving power to act of all traps set by satan for the catching of souls the trap of feelings is perhaps the wiliest and the worst and into this trap poor joanna walked head in air careless of consequence she felt deified lifted above the crawling common ways of common men defiant of all opposition all criticism since being the chosen and desired of him whom she so dotingly worshiped she became an object worthy of worship in and to herself and the nightplaying into the devils hands somewhat as at times the aspects of nature willin its windless silence and opaque hot darkness appeared queerly reflective of and sympathetic to joannas mood of portentous selfexaltation the planes rather than the forms of all which composed the scene were perceptible joannas eyes detected the slope of the veranda roof immediately beneath the balcony the flat outspread of the gardens and lawns and the vertical palisade of lofty trees encircling them but no single object detached itselfall were fused by and soaked in that thick broth of thundersmoke and this heated obscurity she welcomed because it ministered to the sense of solitude and of aloofness which she craved nothing visible interfered to distract her attention from herself and the thought of her high destiny only once or twice the sky opened for the distant storm had moved westward striking the black canopies of the firs their stems and many branches into vivid and instantaneous relief while behind and above them midway to the zenith lightning licked and flickered like some miracle of soundless sardonic laughter playing over the livid features of a corpse nine days dead it was in the moment of one such disquieting celestial display that margaret smyrthwaite stifling an audible yawn strolled on to the balcony she had gathered up her magazines and papers again and tucked them under her arm if you dont intend to come in and talk any more nannie she said rather irritably i may as well go im getting frightfully sleepy and ive promised challoner to motor him over to weymouth tomorrow we make an early start too marions sure to be waiting to hear how my talk with you has gone off and ive a conscience about keeping her up any longernow you do quite understand dont you that i am going to marry challoner and that opposition is absolutely no good it would look ever so much better and be so very much more comfortable for every one concerned if you could only make up your mind to be nice about it youre always saying how you hate people talking over our affairs why give them occasion to talk then by being disagreeable and contrary about a thing which is really no business of yours and which you are quite powerless to prevent contemptuously joanna turned from contemplation of that strangely flickering sky and contemplation of her ownsubjectiveglory she resented the intrusion of margaret with her perfumes and fashion papers her complacent utilitarianism her motorcar and underbred lover but resented it halfpityingly as the weakness of an inferior being behaving according to the manner of its kind i may be powerless to prevent your marriage she said still i most deeply object to it i cannot do otherwise i consider it unsuitable and most unfortunate i cannot disguise from myself that it will stand between us in the future and render intercourse difficult there can be little sympathy between two persons whose aims and interests are as far apart as yours and mine must inevitably be i feel it my duty to mention this to you margaret although i know that i have ceased to exercise any influence over you it is all very sad it is painful to me that you should repudiate our parents teaching all the more painful because i never understood as fully as i now do how noble that teaching is and how much it has done to form my character and tastes thus preparing me for the position and duties to which i am called she drew her breath sharply raising her hands to her forehead greatly moved by the thought of that high calling this for us is the parting of the ways margaret she added a singular effect of dramatic tension in her manner her pale ungracious face and figure against the redbrick background of the housefront momentarily illuminated by a swift amazement of lightning rippling and shuddering behind the firtrees in the west the parting of the ways she repeated you go yours i mine i deplore your choice can i do otherwise seeing how different my own prospects are but as after due consideration you have made that choice all further argument must i fear be wasted upon you very well thentheres an end of the matter as she spoke margaret crossed the balcony and leaning upon the balustrade looked down into the gloomshrouded garden the candlelight streaming outward through the open window touched her shapely back and shoulders and her bright curled and folded auburn hair theres an end of it then she repeated coldly rather bitterly we agree to part you might easily have been kinder and nicer to me but i bear you no illwill i suppose you cant help being disagreeable certainly its nothing newonly nannie though i dont want to upset you or make a quarrel there is something i should like to be quite clear about because i own ive been half afraid lately that you were getting yourself into a silly state over adrian savage she stood upright looking full at joanna i know youve corresponded with him a good deal so of course you may know already colonel haig told me he met her in paris on his way to carlsbad and was awfully smitten with her has cousin adrian ever spoken to you about madame st leger silence followed a distinct menace was perceptible in joannas tone when she at last answered i have never attempted to force myself into adrians confidence to do so would be the worst possible taste under existing circumstances i should never dream of asking him questions regarding hishis former friends then you dont know about madame st leger nannie i do not know nor have i the least wish to hear anything respecting any acquaintance of adrians except what he himself may choose to tell me joanna spoke violently her back against the wall both in the literal and figurative sense thats all very proper but i really think you ought to hear this in the end it may save everybody a lot of misunderstanding and worry im pretty sure colonel haig meant me to pass the information on to you that was why he told me joanna stretched her arms out on either side the palms of her hands toward the wall as her fingers worked opening and closing her nails gritted upon the rough surface of the brick i do not wish to hear anything margaret not anything she repeated vehemently but evidently theres no secret about this whatever every one so haig says knows the whole story in paris the affair has been going on for ever so long only until madame st legers husband died of course there couldnt be any question of marriage i dont mean to imply the smallest harm haig says there never has been the slightest scandal but her husband was years and years her senior and she is very beautifulhaig raves about her i have never heard him so enthusiastic over any one and he was told adrian has been in i refuse to hear anything more i will not margaretnonoi will not this is a wicked fabrication i do not believe it it is not true i tell youit is not true joanna panted her fingernails tearing at the brickwork but what possible object could haig have in repeating the story if it wasnt true im awfully sorry to put you in such a fuss nannie but haig believes it implicitly himself there isnt the least doubt of that and when one comes to think it does explain adrians behavior when he was with us one sees of course how improbable it is that a young man like him should not have some attachment which joanna quitted the sheltering wall and came toward the speaker holding up her handsthe fingertips frayed and reddenedwith a threatening gesture go away margaret she cried passionately go away leave me aloneyou had much better this story is falseit is false i tell you and i forbid you to repeat it i will not listen i will not have it said goor i may do something dreadful to you goand never speak to me again about thisnever dare to do soneverneverdo you hear really you ought to be ashamed of yourself nannie the other protested half angry half frightened im positively astonished at your making such an exhibition of yourself but joanna laid hold of her by the shoulders and pushed her back forcibly through the open window into the center of the quiet softly lighted room take your candle and go she said and her face was terrible forbidding argument or rebuke this is a wicked falsehood concocted by some jealous person who is trying to alienate adrians affection from me who that person is i do not know i had better not know it is all very cruel very dreadful but i want no explanations or questions or advice above all i want no sympathy i only want to be aloneand i warn you margaret if you ever betray what has happened here tonight i will take my own life i shall be certain to find you out sooner or later and i will not survive betrayal so my death will lie at your door remember that if you are tempted to gossip about me with mr challoner or marion chaseand now pray go away and leave me to myself that is all i ask of you dont call isherwood and send her to me i want nothingnobody if she came i should not let her in go awayhere is your candlego away and leave me alone joanna locked the door behind her sister came back to the middle of the room and stood there motionless her arms stiffly extended she had no words no thoughts but an ache through mind and body of blank misery at once incomprehensible and deadening from its very completeness presently she blew out the lights they irritated her as showing her definite objects her own reflection in the cheval glass beside the dressingtable her diary and silver writingset upon the slab of the open bureau all the ornaments and fittings of her bedroom she called on the darkness to cover her and to cover these things also blotting remembrance of them out she needed to make her loneliness more lonely her solitude more unmitigated and absolute an intolerable restlessness seized on her she began to range blindly aimlessly to and fro more than once she knocked against some angle or outstanding piece of furniture bruising herself but she was hardly sensible of pain at last treading upon the trailing fronts of her pleated nglig she stumbled fell her length face downward and lay exhausted for a time then slowly dragging herself into a sitting position she remained there massed together stupidly upon the floorwhile through the large wellordered soberly luxurious house the clocks chimed the hours and halfhours to be answered by the chime of the stable clock out of doors as the night drew toward morning the lightning became faint and infrequent behind the firtrees in the west for the drought still held and the refreshment of rain would not be yet but in the gray of the dawn a cool breathing of wind came up from the sea then for a minute or so the great woodland stirred finding its lost voice and the treetops swayed singing together to hail the sunrising and the coming day the cool draught of air sweeping in at the still open window aroused joanna somewhat from her stupor in the broadening light she looked about her the room was in disorderchairs pushed aside a table thrown down wellbound books fragments of a gold and glass bowl sprigs of lemon verbena and fading roses the wallet in which she kept adrian savages letters lying open alongside its contents scattered broadcast upon the ground joanna stared at these treasured possessions apathetically she put up her hands to push back her hair which hung down in heavy strands over her face and shoulders her fingers felt sticky they pricked and smarted she examined them the nails were nicked and jagged in places the tips were raw i will wait until they have healed she said half aloud in her thin toneless voice then i will write to adrian and ask him if it is true but i must wait till they are healed i think now i had better sleep there is nothing else left for me to do she staggered to her feet walked unsteadily across the intervening space and threw herself unkempt and halfdressed as she was upon the fine embroidered linen sheets and delicate lace coverlet of the satinwood bed chapter iv come unto these yellow sands a thousand times welcome my dear savage anastasia beauchamp cried taking adrians hand in both hers and looking up at him affectionately from beneath a broadbrimmed brown hat crowned by a positive vineyard of purple and white glass grapes and autumn foliage the whole inwrapped cloudily in a streaming blue gauze veil you have played the good samaritan quite long enough in my opinion and its high time you bestowed some attention upon the rest of us though we are neither insane nor conspicuously immoral and here we all are thats to say all of us who matter in this really quite tidy comfortable hotel plus the amiable family bernard my devoted despised little byewater and his compatriot lenty b stacpolenote the inevitable transatlantic initial i beseech you clever excellent fellows both of them though a trifle slight temperamentally and here to complete our circle you arrive as the god in the car anastasias smile bore effective testimony to her appreciation of adrians handsome looks and gallant bearing yes very much the god in the car my dear boy she repeated you are the picture of health playing the good samaritan it must be conceded hasnt damaged youand i honestly believe though i wont swear to it for fear of committing an indiscretion that every one every one mind yousave possibly our excellent americans to whom your near neighborhood may reveal their own temperamental deficiencieswill be as genuinely happy to see you as i am myself kindest and most sympathetic of friends adrian returned touched both by her words and warmth of manner how inexpressibly good you are to me i only pay an old debt your mother was good to me oncewell she caught at an end of her streaming veil and brought it to anchor under her chin wellwhen i stood in need of a wise and sweet counselor very badly and i never forget gratitude can bemind i dont say it always is but it can bea very delightful sentiment to entertainbut now you are expiring for a detailed account of a certain dear lady at this moment she is down on the beach with the rest of our company they will be back shortly for tea so come here with me on to the piazza while we wait for them and ill give you all the news i can adrian the brave song of the engines still in his ears his eyes still dazzled by the seventymile rush along the white roads of the rich and pleasant norman country followed miss beauchamp and her somewhat bacchanalian headgear from the large lightcolored hotel saloon into the arcade found her a comfortable seat and stationed himself beside her from thence he commanded a comprehensive view of the opposite side of the shallow valley dotted with modest greenshuttered villas and rustic chalets set in ledges of roughly terraced garden of the rutted road bordered by elms and sycamores leading down from the fertile uplands through the straggling gray village of ste marie to the shore of the high chalk cliffs forming the headland which closed the view westward and the quartermilewide sweep of grass running up the back of it stunted bronzed oak and thorn thickets filling in the rounded hollows of the curving beach its rows of gaily painted wooden bathingcabins and chairs arranged in friendly groups along the foreshore occupied by women in airy summer costumestheir docile menkind assisted in some cases by whitecapped nurses dealing meanwhile with a slightly turbulent infant population upon the near shingle and the dark mussel and seaweed covered reef of rocks just below upon that same friendly grouping of chairs adrians glance directed itself eagerly seeking a feminine presence acutely interesting to him but without result open parasols and hats of brobdingnagian proportions rendered their charming owners practically invisible wistfully he relinquished the search then looking at the scene as a whole his poetic sense was fired by the spaciousness and freedom of the expanse of gleaming sands for which ste marie is celebrated furrowed in places and edged by rare traceries of blue shadow traversed by sparkling bluegreen waterways interspersed with broad smooth lagoonswhere the rather overdefined forms of pinkarmed pinklegged bathers clad in abbreviated garments swam splashed and floatedthe sands ranged out under a translucent clearness of early afternoon sunshine to the first glinting ripples of the gently inflowing tide farther still along the horizon the solid blue of the intervening belt of deep sea melted by imperceptible gradations into lowlying tracts of furrowed semitransparent opaline cloud those gold and silver shimmering levels washed by and rimmed with heavenly blue commanded adrians imagination he found the strong air sweet to breathe the keen scent of the brine pleasant to his nostrils disease age death and kindred ugly concomitants of human experience lost their vraisemblance and meaning only glad and gracious things were credible these in multitude innumerable and along with them making audible the note of pathos without which even perfect beauty still lacks perfection the haunting solicitation of the beyond and of the unattained forever beckoning the feet of man onward with the promise of stranger and more noble joys hidden from him as yet within the womb of the coming years whereupon anastasia beauchamp divining in some sort the trend of her companions meditations proceeded to pat him genially upon the arm my dear young god come down off that roof right away as little byewater would put it and listen to my recital of sordid domestic woes recently suffered by our belle gabrielle adrian became practical his nose at once pugnacious and furiously busy on the instant great heavens he exclaimed who has dared to offer her annoyance mice my dear savage beetles and to be quite plain with you drains yes you may well make a grimace that mildlooking little chalet yonder across the valleythe one with the parterre of marigoldswhich she had rented without preliminary inspection proved a veritable pesthouse when i arrived in julymainly with a view to safeguarding your interests since frankly i hold most seaside places in abhorrence how can i ever be sufficiently grateful to you the young man murmured fervently i have no childandperhaps at my age even the ghost even the fiction of motherhood is better than nothingbut this is a digressionsentimental or scientific which to return i found madame vernois nervous and debilitated little bette with a temperature and sore throat the indispensable maid henriette drowned in tears and sulks and our poor beautiful gabrielle in a most admired distraction harrowed by which description her hearer gave way to smothered imprecations exactly at the time i too made little remarks then i sniffed oncetwice twice was quite sufficient better sacrifice a months rent than be poisoned without ceremony i bundled them over here bag and baggage since when dear creatures they flourish the bernards who had taken the villa next door to the pesthouse also had cause for dissatisfaction they joined us this addition to our party i could have dispensed with i entertain the highest respect for m bernards acquirements only i could wish he had learned early in life that imparting information and making conversation are by no means synonymous never am i alone with him for over five minutes but he positively lapidates me with the remains of the architectural past conversation should be interchange of opinions ideas experiences not a bombardment with facts which one is perfectly competent to read up for oneself if ones a mind to should you ever be tempted to start a hobbywe none of us know what we may come toavoid archology my dear savage i implore you out of retrospective tenderness for my sufferings during the last few weeks yesand then i must record one truly alarming episode the great zlie and a horde of her nauseating adherents threatened a descent upon madame st leger promptly i engaged all the vacant rooms in the hotelfortunately they werent very numerousuntil the peril was overpast you are not only the kindest and the most superb of friends but you are a great general you should command armies adrian declared forever shall archology be anathema to me saving the proposed raid of the objectionable zlie our history has been of the simplest anastasia continued people pleasant and unpleasant have come and gone we remainand theres the sum total of it now tell me about yourself how long do we keep you alas only until this evening i must go back to rouen where my letters await me we have been moving daily from place to place as inclination suggested tomorrow i must rejoin ren daxfor a few days a week probably to observe how the new treatment prospers it is decided that he shall remain in the countryhouse near caen of an intelligent young doctor who has been in attendance upon him during our touring his manservant of course is with him and there he can also have his pet animals will he recover adrian raised his shoulders and spread out his hands god knows he answered he is quite gentle quite tractable at moments he is irresistibly entertaining on his good days he composes little poems of an exquisite fancifulness and fragilityiridescent flowers as of spun glass but whether he will ever draw or paint again is an open question it is pathetic miss beauchamp put in musingly what a sequel to his extravagant popularity and both lapsed into silence looking out across the immense expanse of gleaming sands adrian was the first to speak he did so with uncertain hesitation you said it was high time i came tres chre mademoiselle does that imply that i have stayed away too long i feared to be precipitate lest i might appear to take unfair advantage of the the studio escapadeprecisely and employ it to further my own interests on that account i have resolutely effaced myself to do so has constituted a severe penance but to do otherwise would in my opinion have shown an odious lack of imagination and of delicacy i venture to doubt whether in affairs of the heart delicacy has not more miscarriages of happiness to answer for than precipitancy the word too much as between man and woman is more easily forgiven than the word too little it is inconceivable adrian broke out hotly all of a fume and a fluster that madame st leger should mistake my motives take it from me my dear savage anastasia replied with a finely humorous smile that exactly in proportion as a woman is indifferent is she just and clearsighted let her care for one of you tiresome male creatures ever yes ever so little and those praiseworthy qualities suffer instant suspension reason and probability pick up their petticoats and scuttle she develops a positively inordinate ingenuity in misconstruction and mistake adrian turned an eagerly inquiring countenance upon the speaker his whole soul in his eyes but dearest most deeply valued friend tell me tell me may i believe that she does then care and asking it he bared his head instinctively doing homage to that most lovely idea miss beauchamps smile changed in character softening to a sweetness which held something of relinquishment and farewell ah the good years the good years she said when love and all the world is youngmay you believe that she cares my dear boy well without its being the least unnatural she very well might care i fancy but you really must find that out for yourself listenthe chirruping of the children here they all come she rose and went forward and adrian an odd tingling sensation in his blood went forward too and stood beside her under the central arch of the arcade watching the little procession winding its way by the rough path up the broken grass slope from the beach first slenderlegged shortkilted fresh as flowers frisking lambkinlike and chattering in highpitched clear little voices came bette and her two little friends next m bernard dignified serious robust wearing lightbrown tweeds panama in hand decidedly warm expounding recounting archologically dilating to madame vernoisrefined fragile dressed in blackwho leaned upon his arm at a little distance madame bernard small fairhaired neatfeatured pretty inclining to stoutness her person rigorously controlled by the last word in corsets and clothed in the last word of mauve linen costumes and mauve and white hats she was not an ardent pedestrian and mounted laboriously with the help of a longhandled parasol uttering reproachful little ejaculations and complaints the while for the benefit of the two young americans who goodnaturedly loaded up with the ladies folding chairs rugs and cushions followed close behind and there apparently was an end of the procession whereupon adrian turned to anastasia with a deeply injured countenance and a quite lamentably orphaned look in his handsome eyes madame st leger is not with them what can have occurred where then can she be he demanded in tones of childlike disappointment and distress therethere anastasia returned merrily see no illchance has befallen your goddess my dear distracted young god looklooknear the cliff edge to the right then noting the change which came over adrians expression and bearing as his eyes followed her pointing hand miss beauchamps broadly amused smile faded she shook her head sighed turned away while the witty largefeatured face grew gray aged sibylline beneath the shadow of her broadbrimmed vinecrowned slightly rampageous hat like to like she murmured however others before now have gone through that enchanted and perilous gate only may the almighty permit these two not to cram their romance into one flimsy purplepatched paperbound yellowback but print it openly and honestly in three good stout volumes of which all save the first twenty or thirty pages deal with the married state chapter v in which adrian makes disquieting acquaintance with the long arm of coincidence adrian sat well back in the car the tires ate up the long perspectives of white road while the brave music of the engines made accompaniment to the lyrics of his thought on either side the lines of poplars galloped and behind them the great gold green and rustyred squares of the crops marked only by the nature of their respective growths innocent of dividing fence or hedgerow swished back half the circle as on a turntable in the valleys herds of oxen and stoutbuilt whitebellied tortoiseshell cows moved leisurely through the rich meadowgrass prosperous gray homesteads flanked by mellow wideranging barns and sheds orchards of reddening apples and yards containing a cheerfully garrulous population of poultry calves and pigs came into view only to vanish backward along with the rest in places tracts of forest the trees crowded and for the most part very tall and slight as is the habit of northern french woodlands made a dark stain amid the gilded brightness casting long shadows across the downwardsloping pastures at their foot a note of pastel blue in farmers and peasants clothing now and again of lustrous dappled gray in the barrel or buttocks of some wellshaped draughthorse of orange or rose in a childs frock or walled garden close of white in airing linen struck momentarily into observation but dominant was the gilt of the level sunlight the gold of the harvest and the silver powdering dust of the highway all these found sublimated repetition in the iridescence of a sunset modulated to rare halftones by the near neighborhood of the sea and adrian sat well back in the car restful yet keen affected sensuously and passively rather than consciously and actively by the fair fruitful landscape fleeting to right and left of him revising his impressions of the past day those impressions were as he told himself in a high degree both stimulating and poetic he had been happy very happy but his happiness was of the traveling rather than the stationary order no touch of satiety showed in it rather much haunting solicitation of the unattained and the beyond from pisgah height he had beheld the land of promise for the first time reasonably secure of entrance into that ardently coveted and most delectable country but the waters of jordan still rolled between and whether these would pile themselves politely apart bidding him cross dryshod or whether a pretty smart bit of swimming would be required before he touched the opposite bank he was as yet by no means sure enfinhe could swim for it if all came to all and would swim for it gaily and strongly enough as that afternoon he first caught sight of gabrielle st leger standing tall and svelte in her light summer dress upon a grassgrown mound on the turn of the slope her strong yet pliant figure detaching itself in high relief against the immense expanse of ste maries blue lagoons and gleaming sands adrian apprehended that she too suffered those solicitations of the unattained and the beyond her attitude indeed was eloquent of questioning expectation it recalled to him the superb and illfated drawing of her uplifted amid the cruel and witty obscenities of poor ren daxs studiothe exalted madonna of the future her child upon her arm going forth from things habitual and familiar in obedience to the call of modernity of the new and tremendous age resemblance was there yet as he looked a difference in her todays attitude soon disclosed itself to this analytic though ardent lover for assuredly the sentiment of this second and living picture of her was less abstract more warm and directly human not devotion to a cause to an impersonal ideal or idea inspired that outlooking of questioning expectation across the shimmering levels to the freedom of the open sea but some stirring of the heart some demand of her sweet flesh for those natural joys which were its rightful portion this differenceand then another which even here by himself in the rapidly running car adrian approached sensitively and with inward deprecation in todays picture she had been alone she had not carried her child on her arm so that only the woman beautiful and youthful not the already made mother was present and the above fact it must be owned contributed in no small degree to the young mans content a thousand times notwithstanding his love of analysis he had refused and shied away from analysis of precisely thisnamely the feeling he entertained toward little bette she was a delicious being granted but she was also poor horace st legers child and from much which this implied adrian did quite incontestably shrink la belle gabrielle might still be as he sincerely believed still was essentially la belle au bois dormant just as he himself was the princely adventurer selected by providence for the very agreeable task of waking her up yet during that protracted sleep of hers things had happened primitive and practical things to the actuality of which delicious mademoiselle bettes existence bore indubitable witness hence to carry away with him that other picture of gabrielle as seen today interrogating the fair sunlit spaces unaccompanied gave him quite peculiar satisfaction in the glow of which his thoughts now turned affectionately to the memory of poor horace st leger for wasnt la belle gabrielle after all his and not adrians discovery and wasnt he adrian consequently under a gigantic debt of gratitude to horace for so speedily taking his departure and leaving the coast clear he might have lived onagonizing reflectionten twenty evensince centenarians are at present so conspicuously the fashiona good thirty years longer lived on indeed until it ceased to matter much whether he took his departure or not thinking over all which adrian forgave the poor man his abbreviated enjoyment of paternity and in so doing made his final peace with the existence of little bette not to have done so would in his opinion have betrayed a culpably ungenerous and churlish spirit the more as whenher attention attracted by the pretty outcry of little bette herself and of madame vernoisgabrielle turning her gaze landward became aware of his presence the light in her face and quick welcoming gesture of her hand showed his advent as far from displeasing to her both expression and action struck him so spontaneous and unstudied that without undue vanity he might well believe himself to count for something in those allurements of the beyond and the unattained delightfully certain it was in any case that she descended with haste from her grassy monticule andhe could most joyfully have swornput some restraint upon herself so as to advance and offer her greetings with due soberness and dignity all through his visit her manner had remained gentle serious touched even with a hint of embarrassment from these signs he drew most hopeful auguries after tea under the quite perceptibly outofjoint noses of the two excellent young americans she had drawn him aside and plied him with questions respecting his nursing of ren dax in response he gave her a detailed account of the last two months with the artists happy faculty for playing two mutually destructive parts at one and the same time in all sincerity he mourned rens mental affliction and felt the pity of it while looking into gabrielles eyes watching her every change of expression and reveling in the emotion his eloquent recital evoked her quickness of sympathy and comprehension were enchanting never had he found her so responsive never had he felt so closely united to her in sentimentand that the egregious tadpole of all living creatures should prove so excellent a stalkinghorse putting aside the high delight of having madame st leger as a listener he found sensible relief in speaking freely of the subject for the responsibility of his position had been severe and wearing especially had it been so during those at first frequently recurrent periods of acute mania when his affection and philosophy alike were strained to breakingpoint making him doubt whether the protracted struggle to keep wayward soul and distempered body together was either merciful or obligatory if this unhappy lunatic of genius was so passionately desirous of letting loose that same wayward soul of his through a gaping wound in his throat why the deuce should he adrian in company with three or four other strong and healthy men be at such tremendous pains to prevent it mightnt the poor tadpole know very much best what was best for him and wouldnt it therefore be more humane and intelligent to leave nicely sharpened razors within easy reach ignoring the probable consequences of such intentional negligence are there not circumstances which render connivance at suicide more than permissible time and again he had argued the vexed question with himself as to the binding necessity even the practical morality of preserving human life when through disease life has so cruelly lost its distinctively human characteristics and values and gabrielle st leger remarked with a smile edged by engagingly gentle mockery then invariably ended against your better judgment by still carefully removing the razors that same smile dwelt in the young mans memory as singularly rich with promise justifying the belief that a lifetime spent in la belle gabrielles society would fail to exhaust her power ofto put it vulgarlyjumping the unexpected upon you and bracing your interest by the firing off of all manner of fine little surprises monotony he thanked heaven would very certainly not be among the dangers to be feared in marriage with madame st leger but while his imagination played about these agreeable matters the music of the engines changed its tune the brakes gripped under martin the chauffeurs bootsole and the car slowed down to a crawl in passing a flock of sheep two large dogs bobtailed and shaggy their red mouths widely open as they raced barking to and fro rounded up the scared and scattering flock into a compact bleating palpitating mass of bister color picked out with rusty black upon the dustwhitened strip of turf by the roadside the shepherd tall and lean a long staff in his hand his felt hat hawknosed face unkempt beard ragged cloak and stringgirt leggings presenting a study in rich browns and umbers under the last glinting gold of the sunset gesticulated and shouted directing the evolutions of the racing dogs in a harsh and guttural patois the scene a somewhat violent pastoral stamped itself as a picturesque inset upon the widemargined page of adrians reflections the sheep once safely cleared and the pace again quickening his thought centered complacently upon the moment of his farewells for surely these showed handsomely on the credit side of his days pleasure the friendly little companynot exclusive of the forgiving though cheapened americanshad gathered at the hotel entrance to witness his start anastasias voice and manner were rich with meaning and affectionate admonition as she invited him speedily to return in the expression of madame vernoiss refined face he seemed to read something approaching appeal as she gracefully seconded that invitation while gabrielle herselfshe standing a little apart from the rest nearer to the waiting automobileanswered not lightly but with a sweet and grave dignity on his asking her and you chre madame et amie have i your invitation also may i soon come back without your sanction it would perhaps be preferable be wiser more desirable for me to stay away i too hope you may find it possible soon to return here if your doing so depends in any degree upon my sanction i give that sanction readily and thus speaking she had looked him full in the eyes whereupon though furiously unwilling to quit the dear sight and sound of her this very modern young god mounted up into his very modern car in quite celestial serenity of spirit but as the dusk deepened and the lights of rouen multiplied in the distance happy retrospect gave place to happy onlooking since at nine and twenty no sound and wholesome man seriously questions the existence of earthly bliss yes a week possibly even a few days would suffice to assure him all went well with ren in his new quarters then he might reckon himself at liberty to return to ste marie and the dear people there and once there no overstrained delicacy should withhold him from putting it to the touch with gabrielle st leger bowing to anastasias advice he would risk saying the word too much so as to avoid the greater danger of saying the word too littlerisk it the more gladly because he gratefully believed it mightnt prove the word too much but the word acceptable even the word actually though silently and proudly waited for the immediate consequence of which belief was that the car striking into the town through the faubourg beauvosine and traveling the boulevard and the rue st hilaire successively it appeared to adrian in act of traversing an altogether heavenly city whose now poetic ancient buildings now stately new ones were alike built of silver and whose deepresounding streets in the growing brilliance of the lamplight were paved with gold such extravagant tricks even in this machinemade mammonworshiping twentieth century can love still contrive to play upon the happy lover on the way to the hotel where he had left his light traveling baggage when passing through from caen in the morning adrian alighted at the central postoffice in the rue jeanne darc to claim his twodays mail forwarded from paris coming out he stood awhile at the edge of the pavement verifying the several items two consignments of proofsthis pleased him a slim one from the office containing as he knew his fortnightly chronique of current home and foreign politics for the forthcoming number of the review the otherand his glance settled upon it affectionatelywas stouter holding the slips of a story of some forty pages into that story he had put all the imaginative and verbal skill of which he as yet felt himself capable it was a drama at once pathetic and brutal of the paris underworld which he had this year so intimately investigated during his unsuccessful search for bibby smyrthwaite he felt keen to know how it looked and read in print for in the back of his mind lurked a hope that just conceivably it might prove a little masterpiece and assure his place among those writers of contemporary fiction whose literary output really counts and here for the moment it must be owned the lover was called upon to make room for the artist while adrian promised himself the best of good hours after dinner tonight in revising punctuation correcting misprints and leisurely making those carefully considered alterations in wording so absorbing to one emulous of combining grace and high finish with pungency and vivacity of style tenderly he laid the packet down on the seat of the waiting car and raised his eyes as in invocation to the starpierced blue of the summer sky roofing the perspective of silvergray houses and silvergilt street for mightnt he take it as a fortunate omen that the proofs should come to hand on this so fortunate day omen that the story would strike home and its readers acclaim him as a doer of notable and living work he glanced rapidly at the envelopes of his private letters and while thus occupied became aware that martin the chauffeur was engagedas not infrequentlyin an altercation the man was a clever driver and to him adrian a willing and trustworthy servant but his temper was inconveniently inflammable and he inclined to pick quarrels with half the men and make amorous overtures to more than half the women he met thus involving both himself and his master in superfluously dramatic incidents under provocation his language became variegated and astonishingly ripe epithets of the latter description he was now in process of discharging upon some individual who had knocked up against him in passing as he stood at the edge of the pavement bending down to examine the tire of the near front wheel of the car martin stop that if you please adrian said warningly over his shoulder and returned to the survey of his letters there was one from anastasia beauchamp bless the dear woman wasnt she indeed a jewel of a friend and there was one blackbordered and addressed though less neatly than usual in joanna smyrthwaites small scholarly handwriting adrian was conscious of impatience of an unreasoning sense of injury for why of all days in the year should he hear from joanna today he had thought of her seldom lately owing to preoccupation with and anxiety regarding ren dax and it struck him as a rather wanton smirching of his delightful days record and subtle menace to the success of his precious little story that the rather unpleasant matter of poor joanna should thus obtrude itself undefinable apprehension of coming trouble flashed through his mind all this was a matter of seconds but during those seconds the voice of the choleric chauffeur had risen from a gusty snarl into the screech of a blazing skyrocket bursting finally into a starshower of unrecordable invective adrian imposingly tall in his long dustcolored frieze motorcoat wheeled round upon the man angrily ah par exemple but this is intolerable he exclaimed have i not already commanded you to be silent do you propose to disgrace me as well as yourself by fighting in the open street behave respectably not like an idiot do you hearget in behind your steeringwheel and keep quiet until i am ready to start but monsieur the fellow has grossly insulted me he cannoned into me by design the thrice filthy animal the sodden ass and would have rolled me in the gutter had i not skilfully braced myself clearly his intention was robbery he is a danger to society a thief a pickpocket only let monsieur look for himself and declare whether a more verminous gaolbird has ever been presented for his inspection and looking adrian beheld the chauffeur fieryeyed with bristling black mustache and struggling in his vicious grip joanna smyrthwaite herselfjoanna dissipated degraded with prominent blear blue eyes and weak hanging underlip masquerading in mans attire as in those infamous now obliterated drawings upon ren daxs studio wall disgust and a vague apprehension of something unnatural and outside reason seized on adrian savage the sight was loathsome to a degree both in suggestion and in fact then he understood and understanding suffered a moment of acute indecision but a crowd was collecting the police might arrive upon the scene making a strong effort to surmount his disgust he said let him go martin i know him i will explain to you presently now i require your help then he added rapidly in english pardon my servants rudeness in the end you shall not have cause to regret it you are william smyrthwaitebibbyare you not martin relinquished his hold sulkily his victim dazed and breathless stood at bay a ring of curious contemptuous faces behind him and adrian stern yet excited and with difficulty repressing evidences of his repugnance in front and if i am bibby smyrthwaite what the devil is that to you he answered petulantly in english i never set eyes on you before why should you interfere with me havent i as much right to the pavement as that liveried brute of yours ive got a job as cabwasher if im late at the yard i shall forfeit my pay and i want my pay his looselipped mouth twisted miserably and tears began to dribble down his sunken cheeks let me go he blubbered i havent done you any harm and i want my pay then adrian moved by compassion came close to him and spoke kindly see here my poor boy he said i am commissioned by persons who have a regard for you to provide for you you need not worry about your pay i will take care of all that for months i have tried to find you to tell you this i am adrian savage a cousin of your late father and his executor the tears ceased and the young mans face was overspread by an expression of almost imbecile rapture adrian turned sick exactly thus had joanna looked more than once is my father dead then bibby asked yes he is dead adrian replied in bewilderment bibby reeled forward and squatted on the broad footboard of the car his head thrown back holding his sides his thin loosejointed limbs and body writhing with and shaken by hysterical laughter dead he quavered outdead by god theyve got him at last thengot him the stinking slavedriving old hypocrite and please god theyre cooking him nownowat this very identical minutecooking him to a turn down in hell chapter vi concerning a curse and the manner of its going home to roost the room furnished in dark walnut was upholstered in red utrecht velvet the walls hung with a striped fawnandred paper a mirror in a florid gilt frame was fixed above the low mantelshelf the atmosphere held odors reminiscent of cigarettes patchouli and food in process of cooking the dinnertable had by adrians orders been placed near the central window the two casements of which stood open to the ground after so many hours spent in the open air dining in present company he felt the necessity of such freshness as he could by any means get in the center of the long flagged courtyard the big palmate leaves of a row of pollarded chestnuts caught the light coming from the offices on the left whitecoated whitecapped chefs and scullions passed to and fro an old livercolored bitch basset as to her legs and pointer as to her body waddled after them her nose in the air sniffing permanently hopeful of scraps on the flags just outside the salon window three tabby kittens playedstalking one another round pots of fuchsia and musk bouncing out leaping in the air spitting galloping sideways highly diabolic with teapothandle tails farther along the courtyard hidden by the lower branches of the intervening trees a stablehelper sang and whistled as he washed down the hotel omnibus the servants talked laughed scolded over their work almost incessantly from the rue jeanne darc came the longdrawn rattle and swish of the electric trams and opposite to adrian at table clad in a complete outfit of his adrians clothesa white flannel suit with a faint fourthread black stripe on it a soft pale blue shirt an immaculate collar and narrow black tiesat william smyrthwaite outwardly at all events surprisingly transformed adrian had hesitated to propose him as an inmate but an uptodate motorcar a ruffling chauffeur a wellbuilt suitcase and kitbag bearing an english name a very good paris address are calculated to promote not only faith but charity the hotel proprietor a short fat bland little man with a dancing step and a shrewd rapacious norman eye was sympathy itself that monsieur should remove his effects and seek another an inferior hotel would desolate him was not to be thought of he would arrange the affair on the instant such lamentable lapses will occur at timesare there not alas members of the most respectable the most distinguished families who turn badly let monsieur then rest assured he was infinitely touched by the confidence monsieur reposed in him and seetapping his forehead with a fat forefingerthe little suite at the back on the ground floor giving upon the courtyard became precisely this morning vacant true these were not the rooms he should have selected for monsieurs occupation but under the circumstances it was conceivable they would serve they were comfortable though modest they were retiredtwo bedchambers connected by a salon there monsieur and his guest could dine in private secure from the intrusive observation of strangers but indeed nomonsieur was too amiable he himself was undeserving of thanks since did it not become evident that monsieur was engaged in a work of the highest benevolencethe attempted reclamation of an unhappy fellowcreaturewith which work to be associated even in the humblest capacity could not but be esteemed by any person of feeling as a privilege then with a rapid change of manner becoming autocratic napoleonic gustave he cried over his shoulder portez les bagages de ces messieurs aux numeros sept et huitand waving adrian to follow he bounced lightly away down the corridor his eyebrows drawn together as he inwardly debated how many francs extra he dared charge for the utrechtvelvet upholstered suite without seeming too flagrantly extortionate after that first outbreak of unseemly rejoicing at the announcement of his fathers death young smyrthwaite subsided into a state of acquiescent apathy he did as he was bid but with what mental reservations what underlying thoughts or emotions adrian failed to discover somewhere in this weak slipshod creature he suspected a bedrock of obstinacy he also suspected predatory instincts or was it only that the instinct of selfpreservation had takenas under the stress of poverty it almost must takea predatory form at the beginning of dinner smyrthwaite spoke little but sat his elbows upon the table his head bent low over his plate putting away food with the sullen haste of an animal suspicious of its fellowanimals intentions and appetite and when adrian to whom this exhibition of gluttony proved anything but agreeable hinted civilly there was no cause for hurry he looked across the nicely ordered table with a halfsneering yet oddly boyish smile oh its all very well for you he said youre safe enough to have your solid three meals tomorrow and all the other blooming tomorrows as long as you live but i tell you i mean to make jolly sure of this meal while i can get it ive learned not to put much trust in tomorrows i want to be on the safe side so that if the wind changes as far as this meal goes anyhow i shall have nothing to repent of but my good fellow the wind will not change that is exactly what i have been trying to assure you adrian interposed pity and repulsion playing seesaw within him to a bewildering extent for the future you can be just as secure of three meals a day as i myself am if you choose bully smyrthwaite said i wonder the old man cut up well he added his face again bent down over the table your father left a large fortune adrian replied repulsion now very much on the top to me not likely to your sisters and joannaadrian hesitated conscious of a singular distaste to using the christian nameat once devoted a considerable sum of money to be employed in the event of your return for your maintenance with his coarse thickjointed fingers smyrthwaite rubbed a bit of bread round his plate sopping up the remains of the gravy thats no more than right he said if you come to think of it why should the girls have all the stuff his hand went out furtively across the table to a dish of braised beef and richly cooked vegetables which he proceeded to transfer to his own plate all the same its nice of nannie we were rather chummy in the old daysthe blasted old days which ive nearly forgot but i didnt suppose she cared still poor old nannie what a beastly hash my father made of our lives nannie ought to have married merriman then i should have had a home andrews a bit peachy but hes a rare good sort he slushed in the food silently for a while and adrian anxious to avoid observation of the details of that process watched the kittens sporting round the flowerpots on the flags just outside he had searched for bibby spending time money even risking personal safety in that search he had found bibby he had brought him here to civilized quarters he had clothed him from head to footadrian felt a pang for they were such nice clothes he was rather fond of that particular flannel suit really it cost him not a little to part with it and he could almost fancy hanging now upon bibbys angular narrowchested frame that it bore the plaintive air of a thing unkindly treated consciously humiliated and disgraced he apologized to it half sentimentally half humorously in spiritand then because the small things of life whip ones sense of the great ones into higher activity the trivial matter of the illused flannel suit brought home to adrian with disquieting clearness the difficulties of this whole third affaire smyrthwaite in which he had as it now occurred to him rather recklessly embarked as if the two first affaires those of father and daughter hadnt been enough he must needs go and add that of the degenerate son and brother and who after all would thank him wasnt he very much a fool then for his pains psychologically and in the abstract as an example of lapse and degradation smyrthwaite presented an interesting and instructive study but in the concrete as a guest a companion as a young man a relation moreover to be reclaimed from evil courses and socially reinstated the situation took on quite other color looking across the table now as his plate again empty bibby sank back in his chair slouched together his hands in his trousers pockets his blue eyes turned upon the door anxiously awaiting the advent of the garon with the next course adrian was tempted to deplore his own philanthropic impulse all hope of pulling the boy up to any permanently decent level of living seemed so unspeakably remote and as though some silent transmission of thought had taken place between them bibbys next speech went to confirm adrians fears you say if i choose he began but the question is can i choose you see im so beastly out of the habit of all thatnow im getting full i seem to understand things so id best talk at once i ask nothing better than that you should talk adrian put in goodtemperedly for heavens sake let him at least gain whatever scientific knowledge of and from bibby he could presently i shall turn sleepy the other continued with a curiously unblushing directness of statement i always do when im first filled up after going short you see ive never set eyes on you before and you come along and tell me some blooming fairy story about poor old nannie and her money it may be true or it may be false but anyhow i dont seem to tumble to it i fancy these clothes and i fancy this feed but i dont feel to go much beyond thatchickenyes rather leave me the breast golly i do like white meat two or three years ago it would have set me on fire i should have felt like bucking up and making play with itrepentant prodigal dont you know and all that kind of rot but now i dont seem to be able to bother much if it was winter i suppose i should be more ready to fix on to it because im afraid of the cold when youre empty half the time cold makes you so beastly sick and then i get chilblains and my skin chaps but in the summer id just as soon lie outsay can i have the rest of the fowl by all means adrian replied handing him the dish you see its like this he went on picking up the bones and ripping off the meat with his teeth ive knocked about so long its grown second nature i have to move on i cant stick to one job or stop in one place i suppose thats left over from the old days when my father was always down on me with some infernal row or other he hated me like poison its a trick englishmen have with their sons theyve not got the knack of paternity like you french i got into the habit of feeling id best run because he was sure to be after me and thats a sort of feeling you cant be quit of it keeps you always looking over your shoulder to see whats coming next people havent been half nasty to me on the whole and i mightnt have done so badly if i could have stuck a little mincing devil of an artist with a head like the dome of st paulsdraws for the comic papersyou may know himren dax yes i know him adrian said he picked me up this winter when i was just pitching myself into the river it was cold you see and id been drinking its silly to drink when youre empty it gives you the hump he took me home with him and drew funny pictures of me they were pretty low down some of them but they made me laugh he did me very well as to food and all that but two or three days of it was enough i couldnt stand the confinement i pinched what i could and left adrian raised his eyebrows and passed his hand down over his black beard meditatively a sweet youth a really sweet and promising youth thisren had never mentioned the thieving incident to him and it explained much it also showed rens conception of the duty entailed by hospitality in an admirable light even active exercise of the predatory instinct must be passed over in silence in the case of a guest what he paid me with what i took kept me going quite a good while smyrthwaite said stretching and yawning audibly but im turning thundering sleepy i told you i should ill be shot if i can sit up on end jawing any more like this he added querulously you might let a fellow have ten minutes nap ten minutes twenty minutes all the minutes of the unnumbered ages spent by bibby in slumber would adrian just then felt supply a more than grateful respite he lit a cigarette and stepped out of the open window on to the flags thereby startling the tabby kittens who with arched backs and frenzied spittings vanished behind the flowerpots an arc lamp was fixed to the wall just over the kitchen entrance one of the whiteclad chefs brought out a chair and sat there reading a flimsy little twopage evening paper the heavy foliage of the chestnuts hung motionless in the distance a bugle sounded to quarters and adrian thought of gabrielle st leger standing on the grassgrown monticle looking across the gleaming sands of ste marie into the beckoning future when next they met he would speak she would answerand adrians eyes grew at once very gay and very gentle he pushed up the ends of his mustache and smoothed the tip of his pointed beard then he remembered on a sudden that in the houroosh over the finding of bibby he had forgotten all about his letters so he took them out of his pocket and looked at them it wasnt necessary to read dear anastasias letter now since he knew pretty well what it must contain having seen her so lately but here was joannas blackedged envelope he shrugged his shouldersoh this interminable famille smyrthwaite why the dickens had his greataunt committed the maddening error of marrying into it with an expressive grimace followed by an expression of saintly resignation adrian tore the envelope open the letter was a long one worse luck he read a few lines and moved forward to where the arc lamp gave a fuller light par exemple he said once or twice also very softly sapristi drawing in his breath then all lurking sense of comedy deserted him he straightened himself up his face bleaching beneath its brown coating of sunburn and his eyes growing hot the old dog waddled across from the offices and planted herself in front of him wagging a disgracefully illegitimate tail looking up in his face sniffing and feebly grinning he paid no heed to her feminine cajoleries paid no heed to the fact that his cigarette had gone out or to the antics of the again emergent kittens or to the intermittent sounds from the courtyard and city or to the allpervasive stable and kitchen smells dear cousin adrian joannas letter ran i find it difficult and even painful to write to you yet i can no longer refrain from writing in refraining i might be guilty of an injustice toward you this nerves me to write i have suffered very greatly in the past week i know suffering may purify but i am not purified by this suffering on the contrary the tendencies of my nature which i least approve are brought into prominence by it i owe it to whatever is best in me i owe it to youyes above all to youto take steps to check this dreadful florescence of evil in myself but before explaining the principal cause of my suffering i must tell you this you may have heard from margaret in that case forgive my repeating what you already know she has engaged herself to mr challoner the news came to me as a great shock from every point of view such a marriage is displeasing to me i have regretted mr challoners influence over margaret already i cannot but see she is deteriorating and adopting a view of life dreadfully wanting in elevation of feeling and thought i know you will sympathize with me in this and that you will also deplore margarets choice indeed the thought of the effect that this news must have upon your mind has caused me much sorrow you may so reasonably object to mr challoner entering our family i have never considered that he appreciated your great superiority to himself both in position and in attainments or treated you with the deference due to you mr challoner is not a gentleman and i am humiliated by the prospect of his becoming nearly connected with you by marriage you are too just to visit this upon me but it must color your thought of me and of all our future relation i speak of our future relation and there the agony of suspense in which i have lately lived overcomes me i can hardly write believe me adrian i do not doubt you i know you are incapable of an inconsiderate still more of a cruel action my trust in you is as deep as my affection it is myself whom i distrust knowing my absence of talent and beauty knowing my own faults of character from the first the wonder of your love for me has been almost overpowering almost incredible adrian folded the thin sheets together and walked back and forth over the flags looking up at the fair night sky above the bigleaved chestnuts my god poor thing poor joanna what can one do poor thing he said then he stood still again in the lamplight and reopened the letter and hence when gossiping reports reach me however contrary to my knowledge of you and however unworthy of credence they may be aware as i am of my many shortcomings they torture me i cannot control my mind it places dreadful ideas before me i realize my utter dependence upon you for all that makes life desirablei could almost say for all that makes its continuance possible before you came to us at the time of papas death this winter i was unhappy but passively unhappy as one born blind might be yearning for a sense denied and unknown to him now when fears regarding our relation to each other assail me i am like one who having enjoyed the rapture and glory of sight is struck blind or who learns that sightlessness absolute and incurable awaits him a horror of great darkness is upon me only you can relieve me of that horror therefore i write to you col rentoul haig tells margaret he heard from acquaintances of yours in paris this summer that you have long been attached to a lady there who would in every respect be a suitable wife for you i know that this cannot be true indeed i know it but i implore you to tell me yourself that it is not true set my mind at rest the limits of my endurance are reached misery is undermining my health as well as all the nobler elements of my character i am a prey to insomnia and to obtain sleep i am obliged to have recourse to drugs i grow afraid of my own impulses dear adrian write to me forgive me comfort me reassure me yours joanna smyrthwaite adrian folded up the letter slowly returned it to his pocket and stood thinking thanks to his strong dramatic sense at first the thing in itself the isolating intensity of joannas passion filled his imagination every word was sincere dragged live and bleeding out of her heart baldness of statement only made it the more telling this was what she actually believed regarding herself what she really felt and meantthe limits of my endurance are reached i suffer too much i grow afraid of my own impulses this was not a way of talking rhetoric a pose it was reasoned and accurate fact and if he understood joanna aright her capacity of suffering was enormous if the limit of endurance had now been reached about all which lay short of that limit it was terrible to think she had been tortured and only in the extremity of torture did she cry for help but here adrians dramatic sense gave before the common instinct of humanity the most callous of men might very well be moved by joannas letter and adrian was among the least callous of men especially where a woman was concerned therefore for him practically what followed this question struck him as quite the ugliest he had ever been called upon to answer in the whole course of his life to use poor joannas favorite catchword a dreadful questiona very dreadful question as he saw it just now taking the warmth out of the sunshine and the color out of life he recalled those extremely disagreeable ten minutes spent among the sweetscented allspice bushes in the garden of the tower house he had argued out the question or the equivalent of the question thenand as he had believed answered it fully and finally once and for all but apparently he hadnt answered it finally since on its recurring now the consequences of either alternative presented themselves to him with such merciless distinctnessthe fact that his conscience was clear in respect of joanna that she was the victim of selfinvented delusionin as far as reciprocal affection on his part wentmade little appreciable difference to the situation indeed to prove his own innocence was merely to cap the climax of her humiliation with conviction of presumptuous folly indescribably perplexed and pained shocked by the position in which he found himself adrian passed absently back from the courtyard into the salon he had forgotten the third affaire smyrthwaite in the storm and stress of the second here the third affaire presented itself to him under a guise far from encouraging bibby the whiteness of the flannel suit bringing out his limp slatternly yet boyish figure into high relief as against the red utrecht velvet lay crumpled sideways in the largest of the chairs his legs dangled over one arm of it his head nodded forward sunk between his pointed shoulders his chin rested on his breast an illconditioned hopeless irreclaimable fellow yet still the family likeness to joanna remainedto the degraded joanna of the funny pictures upon ren daxs studio walla joanna wearing his adrians clothes moreover whose mouth hung open as he breathed stertorously in almost bestial afterdinner sleep adrian looked once picked up his hat and fled for the ensuing three or four hours he walked aimlessly up and down the streets of rouen along the pleasant treeplanted boulevards and the quays beside the broad silentflowing seine he was aware of lights of blottings of black shadow of venerable buildings rich in beautiful detail of the brightly lighted interiors of wineshops and cafes open to the pavement of people loudvoiced and insistent and of vehiclesthese in lessening number as it drew toward midnightpassing by but all his impressions were indefinite his vision strangely blurred he walked as a living man might walk through a phantom city peopled by chaffering ghosts for all that his surroundings meant to him his thoughts concentrated upon the overwhelming personal drama and personal question raised by joannas letter must he taking his courage rather brutally in both hands disillusion her and risk the results of such disillusionment chivalry pity humanity the very honor of his manhood protested as against some dastardly and unpardonable act of physical cruelty how he wished she hadnt employed that illustration of blindness and sight the thought of her pale eyes fixed on him doting imploring worshiping hungry with unsatisfied passion starving for his love pursued him making itself almost visible to his outward sense how was it possible to sear those poor eyes extinguishing light in them forever by application of the whitehot iron of truth before god he could not do it it was too horrible and yet the alternativeto lie to her to lie to love to be false to himself to be false to the hope and purpose of years didnt his manhood every mental and moral andvery keenlyevery physical fiber of him protest equally against that he saw gabrielle as he had seen her only this afternoon in her fresh grave beauty the promise of hidden delights of enchanting discoveries in her mysterious smile saw as he so happily believed a certain awakening of her heart and sense toward the joys which man has with woman and woman with man how could he consent to cut himself from all this and take joannas meager and unlovely body in his arms it wasnt to be done he turned faint with loathing and unspeakable distress staggered as though drunk nearly fell bibby smyrthwaite and joseph challoner for brothers margaret smyrthwaite for sister joanna for bridethis all which went along with it and which of necessity it implied was more than he could face he would rather be dead rather ten thousand times he said so in perfect honesty knowing that were the final choice offered him now and here notwithstanding his immense value of life and joy in living he would choose to die but in point of fact no such choice was offered him since in his opinion it is the act of a most contemptible poltroon to avoid the issue by means of selfinflicted death no he must take the consequences of his own actions and poor joanna must take the consequences of her own actionsin obedience to the fundamental natural and moral law which none escape and among those consequences both of her and of his own past actions was the cruel suffering which he found himself constrained to inflict he shrank he sickened for to be cruel was hateful to him a violation of his nature in a sort of despair he went back upon the whole question arguing it through once more wearily painfully point by point adrians aimless wanderings had now conducted him to a small public garden laid out with flower borders shrubberies and carefully tended islands of turf beneath the shadow of a chaste yet florid fifteenthcentury church clerestory windows glinted high above touched by the lamplight and flying buttresses thick with fantastic carven flowers and little lurking demons formed a lacework of stone against the sky he sat down on one of the garden benches laying his hat beside him on the seat he doubled himself together his elbows upon his knees pressing his hands against either side of his head he was very tired he was also desperately sad never before had he felt the chill breath of a trouble from which there seemed no issue save by the creation of further deeper trouble never before had heso it now appeared to himgauged the possibilities of tragedy in human life and the present situation had grown out of such wholly accidental happeningswellmeant kindnesses and courtesies an overstrained delicacy in admitting the reality of poor joannas infatuation and making her understand that his affections were engaged elsewhere in his fear of assuming too much and appearing fatuous he had let things drift he had been guilty of saying that fatal word too little against which dear anastasia beauchamp today fulminated there he was to blame there was his real error his real mistake it gnawed mercilessly at his conscience and his sensibility it would continue so to gnaw whatever the upshot of this disastrous business as long as he lived in the restrained and conventional intercourse of modern civilized life the difficulty of avoiding that fatal word too little is so constant and so great his mind spent with thought and emotion dwelt with languid persistence upon this point in this particular he had shirked his duty both to joanna and to himself with the terrible result that he was doomed to inflict a cruel injury upon her or to wreck his own life and at that moment dully without any quickening of interest amiable or the reverse he perceived that a young woman sat at the farther end of the bench when he came to think of it he believed she had followed him through the streets for some little time now she coughed slightly and moved rather nearer to him fidgeted pushing about the loose shingly gravel which made small rattling noises with her foot adrian still sat doubled together pressing his hands against either side of his head presently she began to speak making overtures to him praising his handsome looks his youth his dress his bearing his walk flattering and wheedling him after the manner of her sorry kind while expressing admiration and offering endearing phrases her voice remained toneless and monotonous and this peculiarity rather than what she said aroused adrians attention he looked round and received a definite impression notwithstanding the dimness of the light her reddish hair was turned loosely back from her forehead her face was gaunt and worn under its layer of fard her mouth was large and the painted lips though coarse were sensitiveher soul had not yet been killed by her infamous trade her eyes were pale desperate with shame and with entreaty and these were the eyes which if he would save all which made life noble and dear to him adrian must strike blind during some few seconds he looked straight at her then feeling among the loose coins in his pocket he found a gold twentyfranc piece and put it into her hand it is no use he said gravely and very sadlyspeaking whether to her or to joanna smyrthwaite he could not tell i do not want you my poor woman i do not want you it is not possible that i ever should want you i am bitterly grieved for you but you waste your time and he rose and moved away having suddenly regained full possession of himself he had ceased to doubt in respect of joanna that passing of money was to him symbolic setting him free he understood that to marry joanna would be a crime against godgiven instinct against godgiven love against the godgiven beauty of all wholesome and natural things the sour pedantic manimagined deity of some protestant sect might demand such hideous almost blasphemous sacrifice from its votaries but never that supreme artist almighty god the creator maker of mans flesh as well as of his spirit le bon dieu of the divinely reasonable and divinely human catholic church to marry joanna would in the end constitute a blacker cruelty than to tell her the whole truth for he couldnt live up to that lie and keep it going he would hate her and sooner or later show that he hated her he would inevitably be unfaithful to her and leave her thereby ruining her life as well as his own he went back to the hotel the little red utrechtvelvet upholstered salon still smelled of cooking patchouli and cigarettes plus the dregs of a tumbler of brandy and soda and a something human and insufficiently washed smyrthwaites door was shut and no sound proceeded from behind it for which adrian returned thanks and betook himself to bed he was dogtired he slept till broad day on making a morning reconnaissance he found smyrthwaites door still locked nor did knocking elicit any response somewhat anxious he went out into the courtyard the window was ajar the room vacant the bed undisturbed then he remembered to have seen a tall slight loosely made figure wearing whitish garments flitting hastily away down a dim sidestreet as he turned into the rue jeanne darc on his way home later adrian discovered that a pair of diamond and enamel sleevelinks a set of pearl studs some loose gold and a hundredfranc note were missing from his suitcase of which the fastening had been forced true to his predatory and roving instincts bibby had pinched what he could and left chapter vii some passages from joanna smyrthwaites locked book the long drought broke at last in an afternoon and night of thunder and scourging violence of rain drowning out summer a week of chill westerly weather followed lowering gray skies a perpetual lament of wind through the great woodland combined with a soaking misty drizzle which forced the firs and pines into their blueblack winter habit and rusted the pink spires of the heather the flowergarden dashed by the initial downpour became daily more sodden its glory very sensibly departed water stood in pools on the lawns leaves dessicated by the continuous sunscorch fell in dingy brown showers from the beeches and a robin perching upon one of the posts of the tennisnet practised the opening plaintively sweet notes of his autumn song on the thursday evening of this wet week joanna smyrthwaite went to her room immediately after dinner and lighting the candles sat down at her bureau the rain beat against the windows she heard it drip with a continuous monotonous tapping off the edge of the balcony on to the glass and tile roof of the veranda below she heard the intermittent sighing sweep of the wind through the near trees and the wet sucking sob of it in the hinges and fastenings of the casements nature wept now petulantly now as it seemed with the resignation of despair and joanna sitting at the bureau with her diary open before her listened to that weeping it offered a fitting accompaniment to her gloomy concentration and exaltation of mind august i supposed that i should have received an answer to my letter in the course of today at latest but none has reached me she wrote i am not conscious of regretting the delay the reply when it does come can only confirm that which i already now know i am no longer in suspense and i wait to receive the reply merely to prevent the possibility of its falling into other hands than my own that i could not permit although it can modify neither my intention nor my thought it is mine it belongs to me alone and i refuse to allow the vulgar curiosity of any third person to be satisfied by perusal of it i am sure that i do not regret the delay it gives me time to reckon with myself and with all that has occurred it also gives me time to test myself and make sure that i am not swayed by impulse but that my will is active and my reason unbiased by feeling i am quite calm i have been so all day for this i am thankful although whether my calmness arises from selfcontrol or from physical incapacity of further emotion i cannot decide i do not know that the cause really matters yet i should prefer to believe it selfcontrol joanna paused leaning upon her elbow and listening to the sobbing of wind and rain i suppose finality must always produce repose however dreadful the cost at which finality is obtained only so can i account for my existing attitude of mind i want if i can to put down clearly and consecutively exactly what happened last night i think it may be useful to me in face of this period of waiting for the answer to my letter also i wish to live through it again step by step i have learned very much during the last twentyfour hours i have learned that pain selfinflicted pain can be voluptuous even a few days ago i should have been scandalized by such an admission i am no longer scandalized torture has emancipated me from many delusions and overnice prejudices i have not time now even had i still inclination to be overnice margaret and marion chase dined in town and went to the theater with mr challoner last night a london touring company is giving some musical comedy at stourmouth when they returned i was still awake i had not taken any of the tabloids doctor norbiton gave me to procure sleep i did not care to sleep i preferred to think margaret and marion remained some time upon the gallery laughing and talking rather excitedly they kept on repeating scraps of a frivolous song which they had heard at the play and of which so margaret told me todayshe apologized for the thoughtless disturbance they had madeneither could remember the exact tune their voices and the interest they evidently took in so senseless and trivial a thing jarred upon me i felt annoyed and resentful their behavior offered such a startling contrast to my own trouble and to the whole tenor of my life that i could not but be displeased by their lightmindedness i felt my own superiority i did not attempt to disguise the fact of that superiority from myself i despised them i may have done wrong in despising them but i did not care the ambition to assert myself in some striking and forcible manner which should compel recognition not only from margaret and marion but from the whole circle of our acquaintance took possession of me i have always shrunk from publicity and been weakly sensitive to criticism and remark i have been disposed to efface myself to rule others has been an effort to me any influence i may have exercised has been exercised in obedience not to inclination but to my sense of duty now i felt differently i felt my nature and intelligence had never found their full expression that the strength of my character had never fully disclosed itself i desiredi still desireto manifest what i really am of what i am capable i even crave after the astonishment and possible alarm such a disclosure would create thinking steadily i came to the conclusion this desire for entire and arresting selfexpression is not actually new in me i saw that i have always implicitly though silently entertained a conviction that the opportunity for selfexpression would eventually present itself this conviction has supported me under many mortifications in the events of the last six months that opportunity appeared in process of taking tangible and very perfect shape more than my imagination had ever dared suggest was in process of being granted me if i married adrian joanna raised her hand from the paper or rather it raised itself with a jerk refusing further obedience she sat stiffly upright listening to the wind and the rain the steady drip off the edge of the balcony on to the roof below sounded indescribably mournful in its single muffled reiterated note taken in connection with the words she had just written that mournfulness threatened her composure the muscles of her poor face twitched and her winged nostrils quivered in her effort to repress an outbreak of emotion after a struggle she turned fiercely to her open diary if i married adrian savage she wrote this in itself would bear indisputable witness to the fact of my superiority would justify me to myself and command the respect of others but last night i saw it was necessary to go beyond that and ask myself a question which even in my worst hours of doubt i have never had sufficient fortitude to ask myself before i am anxious here to state positively that i did ask myself the said question and that i answered it deliberately and calmly before certain things happened which i shall presently set down if i did not marry adrian again joannas hand jerked away from the paper while every nerve in her body was contracted by a spasm of almost intolerable pain she put her left hand over her heart gasping the agony for the moment was so mercilessly acute yet during that same moment the old doting ecstatic expression overspread her face in a sense she welcomed she gloried in this visitation of pain if i did not marry adrian she went on what then the need for selfjustification the need for entire selfexpression would in that very dreadful event become more than ever desirablethe only solace indeed which could remain to me therefore what had better happen whatbecause i definitely and irrevocably willed itmust and should happen i answered the question last night and my purpose has never wavered today i have spent some time in examining the stock arguments against this purpose of mine they do not affect my determination as i find that each one of them is based upon some assumption which my reason condemns as unsound and inadequate or which is not applicable in my peculiar case i know what i am going to do the relief of that knowledge was immediate it continues to sustain me here joanna rose and paced the room she still wore the black silk and lace evening gown she had worn at dinner her hair was dressed with greater care than usual plain flatbosomed meager hard lines seaming her cheeks and forehead yet there was nothing broken or weak in her bearing or aspect rather did she show as a somewhat tremendous creature pacing thus solitary the familiar and soberly luxurious room bearing with indomitable pride the whole realized depth and height of her troublea trouble to the thought of which even while it racked her she clung with jealous obstinacy as her sole possession of supreme and splendid worth her restlessness being somewhat assuaged she went back and sat down to write i do not attempt to account for what followed i only set it down in good faith and with such accuracy as my memory permits my memory has always been good and since now i have nothing left to gain or to lose i have no temptation either to invent or to falsify about an hour after margaret and marion chase returned from the theater and without any intervening period of unconsciousnessmy mind indeed still occupied with the decision i had arrived at regarding my future actioni found myself walking through the streets of some foreign city i was anxiously following a person of whose name and character i was ignorant but who i was aware had a message of great importance which he needed to deliver to me and to whom i felt an overpowering wish to speak he walked apparently without any particular destination in view yet so rapidly that i found it difficult to keep him in sight being tall however and of fashionable appearance he fortunately for me was easily distinguishable from all other persons whom i met i say iyet i am conscious dreadfully even infamously conscious that throughout i shared this experience with a woman of different antecedents of a lower social position and inferior education to myself our two personalities inhabited one and the same body for independent possession and control of which we contended without intermission sometimes i sometimes she gaining the advantage this association was very frightful to me i felt soiled by it and not only did i in myself feel soiled but hopes emotions aspirations which until now i had believed to be pure and elevated assumed a vile aspect when shared by this womans mind and heart still i knew that of necessity i must remain with her continue to be in a sense part of her if i was to get speech of the man whom iwefollowed and to receive the message which he had to deliver after long wandering through streets some modern and reminding me of paris others narrow crooked and lined with ancient houses i came to a small formally laidout pleasure garden in the center of the town dominated by a singularly beautiful gothic building probably a church benches were placed at intervals round the garden along the shingled paths between massed shrubs and beds of heliotrope and roses upon one of these benches being overcome by fatigue and by a conviction of unescapable fate i sat down so doing i perceived that at the far end of the bench the man whom i had so long followed already sat his attitude was expressive of extreme dejection his figure was bowed together his elbows rested upon his knees his hands were pressed against the sides of his head i felt drawn to him not only by a very vital attraction but by pity for i could not doubt that for some cause he had recently suffered severely and was suffering severely even now i saw that this suffering blinded him to the outer things rendering him quite indifferent to or unaware of my presence notwithstanding which ior shethe woman to whom my personality was so horribly unitedafter making some vulgar efforts to arouse his attention began to speak to him pouring forth to my utter and inextinguishable shame a gross travesty of my love for adrian savage of my most secret thoughts and sensations in relation to that love of my joy in his presence of my admiration for his talents even for his person employing words and phrases meanwhile of a nature revolting to me which outraged my sense of propriety and selfrespectwords and phrases which i was utterly incapable of using and of which i had never indeed gauged the actual meaning until they passed her lips a considerable time passed before the man gave any sign that he heard what shewhat isaid he remained immersed in thought his head bent his hands supporting it at last and joanna closed her eyes waiting for a space listening to the sobbing of wind and dripping of rain he looked round at me his face she wrote was that of adrian but of an adrian whom i had never seen before it was worn and very pale there were blue stains beneath the eyes all the gaiety the beautiful selfconfident strength and hopefulness were banished from his expression which was very stern though not actually unkind then i knew that he had received and read my letter that the marks of suffering which he bore had been caused by the contents of my letter i knew that the message which he had to deliver to me and to obtain which i had followed him through the streets forcing myself into union with this vicious womanin whose speech and actions i so dreadfully participatedwas nothing less than his answer to that letter at last looking fixedly at me he said very sadly it is no use i do not want you poor woman i do not want you it is not possible that i should ever want you i am bitterly grieved for you but you waste your time as he spoke he placed some money in her hand and having finished speaking he rose and went away not once did he hesitate or look back but held himself erect and walked as a man whose decision is deliberate she clutched the money tightly whimpering but i had no part in her tears i had no disposition to cry then nor have i had any since i understood what that piece of money meant it was the price of adrians freedom from my love he paid me to go away i remember noticing the fantastic carven stonework of the church outlined against the night sky while shame and despair devoured meshame and despair intimate merciless unmitigated still clutching the piece of money the woman got up i do not know anything more about her what she did or who she was or where she went for a time as far as i am concerned the pulse of the world ceased to beat and then i lay here at home in my own room at the tower house and heard the rain and wind in the trees just as i hear them tonight when isherwood brought me my tea at halfpast seven she expressed concern at my appearance i told her i had not slept and that i felt tired and faint she insisted upon sending for doctor norbiton i let her do so it was matter of indifference to me whether i saw him or not nothing can change either facts or the event but isherwood has always been kind and faithful to me i did not want to hurt her by opposing her wishes doctor norbiton sounded my heart he told both isherwood and margaret it was in a weak state but added that he believed such mischief as exists to be functional rather than organic he recommended me to take the tabloids which he gave me for insomnia sparingly as their effect upon the heart is depressing i listened and agreed margaret expressed regret at my condition she offered to see rossiter for me and spare me the trouble of housekeeping i let her do so it has rained all day but i have been fully occupied in going through papers and accounts and making sure that my own affairs and those of the household are in perfect order this almost mechanical work is soothing i have always been fond of accounts i remain quite calm why should i be otherwise i know the truth and have nothing left therefore either to fear or to hope the following evening joseph challoner was due to dine at the tower house pleading a return of faintness and disinclination for conversation joanna remained upstairs in the blue sittingroom and retired early to bed the next entry in her diary reads thus the tower house august pm i let isherwood undress me i asked her for my white pleated nglig which i found she had sent to the cleaners during the time my hands were hurt and i had been obliged to give her my keys i am glad to wear it tonight isherwood was very kind and attentive to me i could almost think she suspected something but i did what i could to dissipate any suspicion she might entertain i promised her i would call her if i wanted her during the night but all that i really needed is quiet this is perfectly true i do need quiet unbroken quiet still i must try to put down events in their proper orderand first i feel it is only just that i should note how much i have thought of papa during these last two very dreadful days i have felt singularly near to him in spirit and in sympathy i know that i have rebelled against his methods and have both thought and spoken harshly of him i am sorry for this i see now that in his position and possessing his authority i should have acted as he did he valued wealth as lightly as i do though he was interested in the acquisition of it business to him was an occupation rather than an end in itself he craved for entire selfexpressionas i have craved for it and it was impossible for him to find such expression in business in public affairs economic or social reform he might have found it and to the last i believe he hoped some opportunity of entire selfexpression would present itself that i think was why he disliked the idea of dying he was ambitious of impressing himself upon the mind of his generation in the manner he inwardly felt himself capable of doing it hurt and angered him to leave life with his personal equation unrecorded he knew himselfas i have known myselfto be superior to others both in intellect and in the nature of his aims and ambitions he despised weakness he despised what is common trivial ignorant he could not tolerate that those about him should run after cheap pleasures in which the mind has no part this morning about twelve oclock the rain lessened i ordered the carriage and drove by myself to the west stourmouth cemetery leaving the carriage at the entrance gates i walked to his grave the cemetery is still but partially laid out patches of heather remain making the tombstones and monuments look bare and white i am glad papas grave is on the highest ground standing by it i saw through scuds of driving mist the baughurst woods sloping to the shore and beyond them the sea the loneliness of this growing camp of the dead was sympathetic to me i am leaving instructions that i am to be buried beside papas grave if not in it i have never been so much of a companion or help to any one as to him he at least wanted me though he often frightened and wounded me so i will go back to him in death and lie beside him in the rain and snow and wind and sunshine out there under the barren gravel of the moor i received adrians answer to my letter by the sixoclock post this evening i feared giving way to emotion on opening it but i experienced very little emotion of this i am glad i am glad too infinitely glad that i determined what i would do before i so strangely saw adrian and spoke with him the night before last if i had not determined my state of mind would have been far more agonizing calmness and selfrespect would have been impossible margaret was with me in the blue sittingroom when edwin brought me my letters i do not know whether she observed that i received one from adrian i fancy not i waited until she had gone before reading it it proved just such a letter as i might have anticipated written with every intention of kindness it exhibits his character in a very agreeable lightaffectionate courteous penetrated by regret on my account he does his utmost to spare my feelings and soften the blow he is compelled to deal me i appreciate all this he praises my intelligence and points out to me very gracefully the advantages of my education and of my wealth he points out too the endlessly varied interests of life he admits that he has loved madame st leger for many years and he reproaches himself deeply with not having spoken to me about his affection for her when he stayed here in may and when i pressed him to tell me whether he was suffering from any anxiety in which i could be helpful to him that is the answer of the man of society the wellbred man of the world the man moreover of sensibility and nice feeling i quite appreciate the tone and tact of his letter but i had already received the answer of the man himself it was simpler so simple as to need no supplementit is no use i do not want you my poor woman i do not want you it is not possible that i should ever want you i am bitterly grieved for you but you waste your time he has never wanted me i have wasted my timethat is all and assuredly that is enough and more than enough i will waste no more time adrian i will go where time thought love and the rejection of love are not the rain has come back it drips and drips upon the veranda roof i have burned all your letters no one has ever seen or touched them save myself this volume of my diary i leave to you i shall seal it up and direct it to you at least read iti am no longer ashamed i want you to know me as i really am life is already over i am already dead so i am not afraid i welcome the darkness of the everlasting night which is about to absorb me into itselfi wear the white gown i wore the second time you kissed my handi do not blame you adrian it is just as natural that you should not love me as that i should have loved you i understand that and very soon now all my trouble will be over and passed soon i shall sleep in the arms of the lover who has never failed man or woman yetin the arms of death joanna smyrthwaite chapter viii in which a strong man adopts a very simple method of clearing his own path of thorns challoner stood turning up the collar of his mackintosh looking back between the lines of dark windagitated trees the red mass of the house through a dull whiteness of driving rain showed imposing both in height and in extent challoner measured it with a satisfied even triumphant eye its large size suited his own large proportions capitally this evening though early and still light all the blinds were drawn down this was as it should be he favored the observance of such outward conventional decencies then as he moved away with his heavy lunging tread the rain and wind took him roughly on the quarter this rearward onslaught caused him no annoyance however since his thoughts were altogether selfcongratulatory circumstance had played and was playing into his hands in the handsomest fashion well every one gets his deserts in the long run so he could but suppose he deserved his present good fortune only in this case the run had proved such an unexpectedly short and easy one for hadnt he arrived practically arrived feeling every bit as fresh as when he startedhere a turn of halfsuperstitious halfcynical piety took him the lord helps those who have the nous to help themselves he praised the lord having offered which small tribute or bribe to the judge of all the earth who cannot do other than right he proceeded to check off a few of his wellearned blessings the announcement of his engagement to margaret smyrthwaite had appeared about three weeks previously in the society columns of local and london papers stourmouth buzzed with the news to a loudness which he found both humorous and flattering in private challoner laughed a horselaugh more than once at thus finding how he had made his fellowtownsmen sit up he enjoyed the joke of his own social elevation and prospective wealth hugely and mrs gwynnie had been quite good thank the powers if the rest of his acquaintance had been made to sit up by the news sheto quote his own graceful manner of speechhad taken it lying down really he felt very kindly toward her shed given no trouble but then the world was going a lot better with mrs gwyn than shed any right to expect her rent and her quarterly allowance were paid with absolute regularity not every man would have done as much for her after the dance shed led him beattie stacey was safely married last week to her young rms second officer and so challoner heard mainly on the strength of the said young officers excellent reputation gwynnie herself had taken out a new lease of social life since her installation in the white house opposite the marychurch borough recreation ground shed been cute enough to throw herself into that department of anglican religioparochial activity which busies itself with variety entertainments rummage sales concerts happy evenings bazaars and suchlike contrivances for providingunder cover of charityaudiences for idle amateurs ambitious of publicity curates waxed enthusiastic over mrs spencers splendidly unselfish helpfulness and wonderful organizing powerthe thought of that poor little earnest lightweight impecunious baggage of an angloindian widow in the character of a churchworker tickled her exlover consumedly but now challoner felt constrained to put a term to the slightly ribald mirth induced by this checking of his welldeserved blessings and bestow himself within the four corners of an appropriately blackedged manner for as he turned out of the gates at the end of the carriagedrive he caught sight of col rentoul haigs unmistakable figure pompous and dapper even when clothed in an aquascutum and carrying a streaming umbrella walking briskly down the avenue making a pretense of deep abstraction challoner passed him then drawing up suddenly wheeled round you colonel he said i beg your pardon for the minute i didnt recognize you my thoughts were elsewhere he looked on the ground as one who struggles with manly pride against strong emotion you may have heard of the trouble we are in at the tower house he added rentoul haig disapproved the we but then he warmly and articulately disapproved the whole matter of the challonersmyrthwaite alliance nevertheless he hungered for firsthand news thirsted for retailable detail and who could supply these better than challoner he pocketed disapproval and answered with fussy alacrity peering upward into the younger mans curiously noncommittal countenance from beneath the shelter of his umbrella very fortunate to run across you like this challoner he said i was coming to leave cards and inquire shocking news this most shocking i heard the report from woodford at the club after luncheon and i give you my word it quite upset me im not surprised colonel challoner put in gloomily why only yesterday morning i saw her out driving between twelve and onejust upon the halfhour it must have beenas i was crossing the square on my way to the club when woodford told me i said god bless my soul its incredible challoners lips parted with an unctuous smack incredible or not colonel it is only too sadly true in the midst of life we are in death you know i dont set up to be a serious man but an event like this does bring the meaning of those words home to youmakes you think a bit reminds you what an uncommonly slippery hold even the healthiest of us has on life watching the effect of these lugubrious moralizings upon his auditor challoner had the pleasure of seeing the latters face grow small and blue in the shade of the wet umbrellalooks like a sick frog under a toadstool he reflected well let snobby old froggy turn blue feel bluethe bluer the better it served him jolly well right hadnt he said no end of nasty things about his challoners coming marriage then he proceeded with the amiable operation commonly known as rubbing it in ah yes he said i knew how youd feel it colonel without being oversentimental it is a thing to break up ones sense of personal security and a relation of yours too only nineandtwentya mere child compared to you of course colonel its always painful to see the younger generation go first yes i knew how youd feel it kind of you to come off at once like this to make inquiries it will please margaret poor dear girl she sent for me directly they made the discovery this morning and ive been with her ever since looking after her and putting things through you see joanna always kept the management of the establishment in her own hands and the whole household fell to pieces like a bundle of sticks today all the servants lost their heads somebody had to step in and lay hold margaret is behaving beautifully this bearing up is all very well at first but im afraid shes bound to pay later however thank god ive the right now to take care of her quite sono doubtyes exactly haig responded in rather chilly accents of course but i have heard nothing but the bare fact challoner quite sudden was itquite unexpected yes and no he spoke slowly as one weighing his words i sincerely trust there isnt any question of an inquiry from his superior height challoner looked down at the speaker in momentary and sharp suspicion what story was current in stourmouth he wondered could the servants have talked had the empty tabloid bottle and the tumbler with a film of white sediment clouding the inside of it become a matter of common knowledge he found rentoul haigs expression reassuring certainly notquite uncalled for i am thankful to say he replied largely no no colonel nothing of that sort an inquest is a pretty sickening business under ordinary circumstances but it amounts to a positive insult in my opinion in the case of a refined sensitive gentlewoman rentoul haig came near dancing with impatience true true he murmured so pray put that idea out of your head and out of everybody elses head colonel youll be doing margaret a kindness doing poor joanna a kindness too people are awfully unscrupulous in the reports they circulate but then of course i know we can count on your gentlemanly feeling and good taste a moment more and colonel haig believed he should burst he was being patronizedpatronized he the bright particular star of the most elect circle of stourmouth society and by joseph challoner the fact is she hasnt been in a good state of health for some time margaret has spoken to me about it and a lot of people have remarked upon it her peculiarities seemed to grow upon her lately and she was not an easy person to deal within some ways very like our poor friend her father margaret hasnt said much to me but i fancy shes found her sisters temper a little trying health i dare say as much as anything norbiton has been treating her for sleeplessness and general debilitynerves you know she always was highly strung yesterday morning they tell me she looked appallingly ill and complained of having fainted in the night they had norbiton in and he sounded herwas not at all satisfied with the hearts action i am not surprised at that you remember how peculiar her eyes wereglobular challoner looked down with rich enjoyment at the popeyes so he gracefully phrased it staring eagerly angrily up from beneath the streaming umbrella globular he repeated and with that pale circle round the edge of the iris which invariably in my experience indicates a weak heart norbiton prescribed for her and told her to keep quiet margaret poor dear girl did her best but joanna insisted on driving out i was dining there last night and she didnt come down they told me norbitons opinion but i supposed it was just a case for care and then when her maid went to call her this morning she found her stone cold she must have been dead several hoursdied in her sleep and both men stood silent awed in spite of themselves by the thought of joanna smyrthwaite lying dead shocking occurrence very shocking indeed colonel haig remarked presently fussily clearing his throat you say peculiarities had grown upon poor miss smyrthwaite recently one would be glad to know whyto have some clue to the reason for that there were rumors i believe a few months back of anerof an attachment on her part whichit is a delicate subject to approachwas in fact rather misplaced andwellyou know one cannot help putting two and two together oh as to anything of that sort challoner returned somewhat roughly throwing his big body back from the hips and moving a step aside as though to conceal justifiable annoyanceyou really must excuse me colonel standing in the relation i do to both the smyrthwaite ladies it is a subject i hardly care to discuss i cant help knowing a good deal and i cant help what ive noticed but i dont feel at liberty to speak mr savage stayed twice at the tower house this year as you are aware andpeople have eyes in their heads i dont mind telling you he and i came to loggerheads over the division of the property thats what first really brought margaret and me together i had to protect her interests or she would have come off a very bad second and though its early days to mention it i dont mind telling you in confidencethe strictest confidence you understand colonel you know by this time i hope challoner how entirely you can trust me the other remonstrated at once famished for further information and bristling with offended dignity to be sure i dowell then it may interest you to hear that margaret has the old home secured to her i am pleased on her account for shes fond of the place personally there are several houses in baughurst park i prefer however thats neither here nor there if shes pleased im pleased naturally but exclusive of the house and its contents she hardly benefits at all under her sisters will in his excitement rentoul haig lost control of his umbrella which tilting in a gust of wind discharged a small cataract of water down the back of his neck bless my soul he exclaimed you dont say so what ungodly weather where on earth does all her money go to you may well ask challoner replied grimly in the case of her dying unmarried her share in the mills and the rest of the yorkshire property is left to mr andrew merriman the partner and managera selfmade man who had the wit to get round old mr smyrthwaite hes feathered his own nest very tidily it strikes me one way and another and the bulk of the invested propertyprepare yourself for a pleasant surprise coloneljoanna leaves on trust to her scrapegrace rascally brother a flashlight hope of a solid legacy had momentarily illuminated rentoul haigs horizon but the light of hope was extinguished almost as soon as kindled giving him just time to be mortally disappointed his face fell while challoner watching could barely repress his glee but but he bubbled every one has been assured for years that the goodfornothing boy was dead i dont want to be inhuman but i can only say that for the sake of my future wifes peace of mind i most sincerely and cordially trust he is deaddead and done with judging by what you told me yourself colonel from a child he has been a downright bad lot a regular waster you may also be interested to hear we owe this precious bit of business to mr adrian savage he came to joanna when he was over last with some cockandbull story about young smyrthwaites turning up halfstarved in paris last winter worked upon her feelings no end with a whole lot of frenchified false sentimentbrother and sister the sacredness of family and that sort of fluffstuff i am bound to say plainly i date the breakup of her health from that moment he spoke to me about young smyrthwaite but of course i refused to touch it gave him a piece of my mind which i fancy he didnt quite relish as he packed up and took himself off on the quiet next morning as i told him if he and merriman wanted to dump the young scoundrel upon his two unfortunate sisters they mustnt look to me for assistancethe job as i told him wasnt in joseph challoners line not at all now colonel i ought not to detain you any longer im pleased to have had the chance to set your mind at ease on one or two points and youll do both margaret and myself a favor if you will tell every one it was heart just simply hearta thing that might happen to any one of us you or me for instance any day margaret will feel it very kind and thoughtful of you to call like this at once to inquire now i really must be off goodevening to you let you know the date of the funeral of coursegoodevening and he swung up the avenue in the shrinking light under the swaying dripping trees highly elate choked old froggy off neatly he said to himself and got my knife into hightytighty cousin adrian too i wonder if he did carry on with joanna id give something to knowdare say itll come out in time anyhow he wouldnt touch her money though it would have been bad policy to acquaint old haig with that little fact better take the shortcut home stiff from standing so long in the wet but its worth while if only for the fun of making old haig feel so confoundedly cheap supported by these charitable reflections he turned off the main road into a footpath which after skirting the gardens of a large villa facing on to the avenue struck northwestward across an as yet unreclaimed portion of the baughurst park estate by following this route challoner took the base instead of the two sides of a triangle thus saving about a quarter of a mile in his walk home to heatherleigh a dark plain of high straggling heather broken here and there by a thicker darkness of advancing ranks of selfsown firs lay on either side the grayness of the sand and flint strewn track even in sunshine the region in question was cheerless and as seen now in the driving rain and fading daylight it bore a positively forbidding aspect but to this challoner having returned to enumeration of his welldeserved blessings was sublimely indifferent and among those blessingshere alone free to disregard conventional blackedged decencies and be honest with himselfjoanna smyrthwaites death although an ugly suspicion of suicide did hang around it might he felt be counted making the admission he had the grace to feel slightly ashamed of his own cynicism in the first shock of the tragedy when marion chase sent for him in the morning he had been genuinely troubled and overset but as the day wore on the advantages of the melancholy event disclosed themselves more and more clearly joanna smyrthwaite never liked him considered him her social inferior didnt mince matters in expressing her objection to her sisters engagement ignored him when she got the chance or snubbed him distinctly shed done her best to make him feel awkward and there was bound to be friction in the future both in their family relation and in the management of the smyrthwaite property joanna was uncommonly strong he for one had never underrated the force of her character he even owned himself a trifle afraid of her afraid of some pullas he expressed itthat she might have over margaret now he would have margaret to himself exclusively to himselfand challoners blood grew hot notwithstanding the chill dreariness of wind and wet thinking of that for his feeling toward margaret smyrthwaite had come to be the master power of his life of all his schemes of selfaggrandizement after the somewhat coarse and primitive manner of his kind he was over head and ears in love with her he was proud of her almost sensitively anxious to please her ready for all his burly bullying roughness to play faithful dog fetch and carry and slave for her no woman had ever affected him or excited his passions as she did in food he relished highly seasoned dishes to apprehend the flavor of which you do not need to shut your eyes and listen and margaret smyrthwaites attractions were of the highly seasoned order the effect of her fullfleshed slightly overdressed and overscented person presenting itself without any baffling reserve frankly assailing and provoking the sensesoh hed treat her like a queen work for her buy her jewels motorcars aeroplanes if she fancied them pet amuse make stourmouth bow down to make himself a great man for hersir joseph and lady challonera loftier flight than thatwho could tell maybe a peerage lord and lady baughurstwhy not after all if you play your cards cleverly enough such apparently improbable things do happen particularly in this blessed twentieth century when money is the prime factor and there was money in plenty would be more unless he was uncommonly out of his reckoning at the start so he calculated their united incomeshis own and margaretswould amount to getting on for twelve thousand all to the good too since there was no drain of a large landed estate absorbing more than half its yearly revenue in compulsory outgoings they would be married soon quite soon her sisters death and her present loneliness supplied ample reason for pushing on the wedding it must be a quiet one of course out of respect for blackedged decencies but he didnt object to that the thing was to get herand then hed carry her away right away shaking her free of the dismal oldfashioned smyrthwaite rut altogether theyd take a three months honeymoon and travel somewhere anywhere go a yachting trip say up the mediterranean never since he was a boy at school had he taken a holiday it had been grind grind scheme scheme climb climb without intermission not but what hed climbed to some purpose since hed got high enough at forty to pluck such a luscious mouthful as margaret off the appletree against which hed set up his ladder now he would take a holiday if only to show other men what a prize joseph challoner had won in the shape of a woman amorous uxorious his whole big body tingling with emotion he forged along the path across the darkling moorland breasting the winddriven sheets of cold rain hi slow up there you great lumbering greasyskinned elephant and tell me where the devil ive got to in this blasted old wilderness a voice shouted at the same time he was aware that a narrow strip of the gray pathway in front of him reared itself up on end assuming human forma human form moreover oddly resembling that of adrian savage the style of the address was scarcely mollifying and challoner had all a practical mans hatred both of being taken by surprise and of encountering phenomena which he could not account for at once in a quite satisfactory and obvious manner he came straight to the baffling apparition and looked it steadily insolently up and down the bully in him stirred into rather dangerous activity the ridicule of his personal appearance wounded his vanity the interruption of his dreams of love and glory infuriated him while the fancied likeness of the speaker to adrian savage sharpened the edge of both offenses i advise you to keep a civil tongue in your head or you may happen to find this wilderness an even more blasted and blasting locality than will at all suit you he said threateningly at close quarters the slouching figure was certainly not that of adrian savage nor was the weak dissolute blueeyed face yet although seen indistinctly in the waning light the said face struck challoner as unaccountably familiar what on earth who on earth was the fellow not an ordinary tramp for his speech though thick with drink and his clothes though illkept and dirty were those of a man of education and position challoner continued to scrutinize him and under that unfriendly and menacing scrutiny the young mans tone changed declining to petulant almost whining apology you neednt bluster he said i meant no harm and you know you did look awfully funny and shiny i want to know where i am i came across from havre to barryport in an onionboat because it was cheapest im not overflush of cash so ive come to look up some of my people who live about here charming surprise for them challoner said and it blew like blazes all last night between the motion and the stench of the onions i was as sick as jonahs whale nothing left inside of me except just myself one of those breton sailor chaps hawking his beastly vegetables came a bit of the way from barryport with me he told me to cut across these commons and i should be sure to come out all right but i expect he lied just to get quit of me more than possible challoner said i ought to have stuck to the tramlines but my heads rather light i havent got over the jonah business yet i lost my bearings altogether somehow through feeling so awfully slack ive been sheltering in under those mangy old firtrees for i dont know how long hoping somebody might pass and im wet to the skin and as cold as charity very interesting indeed but no earthly concern of mine so if youve got to the end of your tale ill continue my walk goodday challoner commented preparing to resume his homeward journey the young man caught him by the arm say but you cant leave me alone in this godforsaken hole oh yes i can challoner answered kindly take your dirty paw off my sleeve will you else i may be compelled to have a word with the local authorities about a case of assault attempted robbery with violence and such sweet little games however it wouldnt be the first time youve made acquaintance with the inside of a police cell unless im much mistaken i dont mean any harm i only want you to tell me the way i cant lie out here in the wet all night it would rot me with chills and fever the wind had increased in force now the tumult of it was loud it rushed through the firs bending them low tearing off dry branches and tufted tassels then fled on screaming across the dark plain of heather like some demented thing let loose the speaker craned his neck upward and raised his voice to a quavering shout in the effort to make himself heard his face was close to challoners and again the latter was puzzled by something unaccountably familiar in the features and general effect of it whereupon the bullying instinct gave place to caution see here he said you must behave like a reasonable being not like a driveling sot if you want me to take any trouble about you tell you your way you young fool your way where to the tower house something parkbaughurst parkthats the blooming name of it where my people live challoner started he could not help it then he waited till the next gust of wind had spent its fury and in the lull which followed spoke very slowly so thats the blooming name of the blooming place where your people live is it and who may your people be if you please and what is your business with them what the deuce does that matter to you the other answered trying to ruffle yet shrinking away nervously while the wind gathering force again whipped his legs and back showing the lines of his wasted largeboned frame through his thin lightcolored clothing as it happens it matters very much to me challoner retorted because some very particular friends of mine live at the tower house it may amuse you to hear i have just come from there and that you very certainly cant gain access to the tower house without my permission and that i very certainly shall not give that permission young gentlemen of your particular kidney arent required there the menservants would kick you out and quite properly we know how to treat loafers and tippling impostors who try to sponge upon gentlewomen here in englandnow come along with me ill see you as far as the tramline and pay your fare to barryport and you can go on board your onionboat again also ill telephone through to the central police station directly i get home and give the stourmouth and barryport police a little description of you so step out if you please no malingering as he finished speaking challoner grasped the young man solidly by the shoulder propelling him forward but the latter slippery as an eel wriggled himself free let go you great hulking beast he cried im not an impostor im william smyrthwaite and my sister joanna means to provide for me i know all about that a chap who i ran across three days ago in rouen told me we always were chummy in the old days nannie and i shell tell you im speaking the truth fast enough and make you look dd silly shell recognize and acknowledge me see if she dont upon my word im afraid shes not likely to have an opportunity of doing anything of the kind poor lady challoner returned and he laughed at his own rather horrible joke so come along mr whoeveryouare alias william smyrthwaite esq i begin to think id better see you safe on board your precious onionboat myself and have you affectionately looked after till she sails it may save both of us trouble you beast you cursed great shiny black devil bibby shouted and he clawed and struck at his tormentor passionately the first touch of those striking clawing hands let the underlying wild animal loose in challoner a primitive lust of fight took him along with a savage joy in the act of putting forth his own immense physical strength still at first his temper remained fairly under control and he played with his adversary feinted and parried but the wretched boy did not fight fair he indulged in sneaking tricky dodges learned amid the moral and social filth of the paris underworld and in south american gambling hells and dosshouses soon challoner lost his temper saw his chance took it delivered one blow straight from the shoulder which landing on bibbys temple dropped him like so much lead on the rainwashed flints of the crown of the pathway then he stood breathing heavily his eyes bloodshot the veins standing out like cords on his forehead the intoxication of battle at once stupefying and maddening him presently bibbys limbs twitched and as though moved by a spring he sat bolt upright his elbows set back his hands the thickjointed fingers wide apart raised to the level of his shoulders hes done me in the clumsy murderous brute he panted then childishly whimperingnannie he wailed poor old nannie so youre dead too golly what a sell never mind im just coming he lurched and fell sideways rolling over face downward into a long sandy puddle edging the pathway five minutes nearly ten minutes passed while challoner remained standing stockstill in the volleying wind and blinding rain and forlorn fading light of the moorland at last he shook himself went forward and knelt beside the motionless thing lying close against the black ragged fringe of heath upon its stomach in the sandy wetness for some time he couldnt bring himself to touch it then putting strong constraint upon himself he turned it over and bent low staring at it it reminded him of the big white yellowheaded maggots he used to pick out of the decaying wood of the old summerhouse in the little garden at home as a boy and use for bait when he went fishing in the river at mary church yesit was queerly like those maggots but somehow it wore the clothes of adrian savage and its poor face was that of joanna smyrthwaite as he had seen her this morning in the agitated silence of her room stretched cold and lifeless beneath the fine lace coverlet of her satin wood bed only her eyes were shut and this things eyes were wide wide open now its loose lips parted its mouth opened too while a dark thread trickled slowly down its chin into the hollow of its throat inside its dirty crumpled collar challoner tumbled up hastily and waited breathing hard and brushing the rain and sweat off his face with the back of his hand gradually his mind began to work clearly his sense of ordinary everyday happenings their correlation and natural consequences of his own identity his business his hopes of worldly advancement wealth and titles came back to him he understood that he must decide act cover up what he had done get rid of this accusing motionless thing lying openeyed openmouthed in the pathway he knelt down again put his arms round the limp body with a mighty lift and heave flung it sacklike across his shoulder staggered on to his feet and heading southwestward in the teeth of the gale laboring under the weight of that which he carried plowed his way doggedly across the desolate outstretch of rough resilient heather down into the heart of the straining bellowing stormswept woodland it was late long past his usual dinnerhour when challoner reached heatherleigh to his own surprise he accounted for himself to his servant as the man helped him off with his mackintosh hed been detained had got a chill he believed didnt know that he wanted any dinner yeslet them send whatever theyd got readyhot and the plainer the better hed have it when he came downin ten minutes he must change first he was so confoundedly wet for the sake of appearances he made an effort to eat but the sight and smell of food turned his stomach still complaining of chill he left the table and went into the smokingroom though an abstemious man both from habit and policy he mixed himself a remarkably stiff brandy and soda set it down on the large writingtableloaded with bundles of folded papers documents engrossed on vellum and tied with pink tapeand forgot to drink it went round the room turning all the incandescent gaslamps full on the chocolatecolored imitation leather paper with which the walls were hung made the room dark and challoner felt a strong aversion to the dark he wanted to see every object quite plainly and in its entirety he took a cigar from the cedarlined silver box margaret smyrthwaite had given him standing on the revolving bookcaselooked at it and put it back somehow he couldnt smoke sank down in an armchair and sat glowering like some sullen savage trapped animal into the empty grate more than once fatigue overcoming him he dozed only to wake with a start crying out loud it wasnt my fault i didnt begin it he hit me first then clearer understanding returning he continued i struck him in selfdefensebefore godas i hope to be saved i did at most they could bring it in manslaughter i did it for margarets sake to save her from being exploited and sponged on by the drunken young rotter ah my godbut if it was true if as he claimed to be he was her brother how can i go to her with his blood on my hands margaretim in hell forgive medont believe it never knowmy own poor splendid darlinggod how i love hermargaretmargaretnever knowi cant i cant lose you and challoner broke down sobs shaking his great amorous body and tearing his bull throat toward morning at the turn of the tide the gale abated and the rain ceased when daylight came but not until then challoner went upstairs to his bedroom the windows of which faced east he drew back the curtains pulled up the woodenslatted venetian blinds and watched the brightness widen outward and upward behind the ragged crests of the stone pines as a rule he had not time or care to waste on the beauties of nature but he found vague inarticulate solace in the gaudy colors of this wild sunrise he was calmer now and the strong daylight helped to drive out exaggerations of sentiment and fearful fancies in short his impregnable health and physical courage his convenient coarseness of moral fiber and indomitable tenacity of purpose began to assert themselves he began to argue and not unably to plead his own cause to himself for look at the ghastly episode what way you pleased how could he be blamed for it the whole thing was accident accident pure and simple which he could not foresee and equally could not prevent it had been sprung on him out of a clear sky he was rushed not given an instants breathing space for consideration and that was manifestly unfair any man might lose his head and be betrayed into violence by such vile provocation his spirits revived and when all came to all there was not a tittle of evidence against him after parting with haig he had not met a soul he could swear no one had seen him turn out of the avenue into the footpath the rain would have obliterated all traces of the struggle by this time and wet heather thank goodness doesnt show tracks though why he should trouble about such details he didnt know it was blitheringly silly for who the devil would be on the lookout for tracks a thousand to one the body would not be found until the estate foresters cut the bracken in november and by then sweat broke out on challoners forehead and he was not sorry the sun stood high behind the pines throwing slanting shafts of light between their dark stems across the rainswamped garden where the blackbirds and thrushes patroled wormhunting on the turf by that time whatever was left would be in no condition to tell tales painful discovery in the baughurst park woodshe could see the headlines in the local papersmysterious deathno clue to the identity of the remainsnone thank the lord none none but for a couple of francs and a few english coppers the boys pockets were empty challoner praise to god had mustered sufficient spunk to ascertain that all the sameand here callousness failed him a littlehis and margarets honeymoon should be a long one long enough to insure their being far away from stourmouth when the foresters cut the bracken in november distance travel new scenes and new interests are said to draw the sting of remembrance and it was best immeasurably best not only for himself but indirectly for margaret also that remembrance should be blunted that he shouldif he only couldforget for after allhis spirits in the honest sunshine reviving yet furtherwhat proof had he the miserable drink and vice corrupted wastrel had spoken the truth wasnt it much more probable haigs story was the right one and that this was some low blackmailing scoundrel trading upon scraps of hearsay information hed happened to pick up a lying misbegotten whelp in short of whom society at large was extremely well ridreally to expend sentiment upon the summary removal of such refuse came near being maudlin as to any fancied resemblance he bore to joanna smyrthwaite one couldnt attach any serious importance to that in the ghostly twilight it was impossible to see distinctly and after the uncommonly nasty upset of the morning and the bullying hed been obliged to give that old grannie norbiton before the latter would consent to ignore the empty tabloid bottle and certify the cause of death simply as syncope it was hardly surprising if hed got poor joannas personal appearance a little upon his brain noit is an awful misfortune no doubt to be however accidentally the means of taking a fellowcreatures life but looking at the whole occurrence coolly hechallonercame to the comforting conclusion that he was hardly more to blame more responsible than he would be if some reckless fool had blundered across the road under the nose of his motor and got run down whereupon the sun having now cleared the crests of the pines and it being imperative not to give the servants any handle for gossip challoner undressed and went to bed he succeeded in advancing the date of the wedding but during the five weeks which elapsed before it took place his moods caused some perplexity and no small discomfort to his poorer clients junior partners and clerks at moments he indulged in boisterous mirth but for the most part was abominably badtempered irritable and morose colonel haig however noted unexpected signs of grace in him concerning which he spoke to mr woodford one day at the club challoners coming more into line he said he is less noisy and selfassertivevery much less so a good deal of the improvement in his manner is due to me i flatter myself i have been at the trouble of giving him some very strong hints if you propose to associate with gentlemen you must learn to behave like a gentleman his election to the club vexed me at the time too much countryattorney sharp practice in the methods he employed i thought so i am relieved greatly relieved he has taken my friendly admonitions to heart it would have annoyed me extremely if his membership had lowered the social tone of the club too its pleasanter for me personally as i am bound i suppose to see a good deal of him in the future on my cousin margaret smyrthwaites account when alone with his fiance during this period of waiting challoners attitude alternated between anxious almost servile humility and extravagant making of love margaret however being a young woman of limited imagination put down both humility and demonstrations to the potent effect of her own charms thus remaining altogether sensible selfcomplacent outwardly composed inwardly excited and in fine very well content while unknown to her unknown indeed to all save the man who so slavishly obeyed and fiercely caressed her the unsightly thing which had once been her playmate and brother lay out below the evertalking trees among the heath and sedgegrass and bracken the tragedy and unspeakable disgrace of its decomposition not hidden by so much as a paupers deal coffinlid chapter ix wherein adrian savage succeeds in awakening la belle au bois dormant in consequence of the bad weather every one returned to paris early that autumn anastasia beauchamps first receptionthe fourth thursday in septemberproved a crowded and animated function each guest expressed rapture at meeting every other guest and at being back yes once again veritably established in our dear good brave inexhaustibly interesting intelligent and entertaining paris how theythe speakersever mustered sufficient fortitude to go away still more to stay away they could really now form no conception but it was finished thank heaven the mortally tedious exile and they were restored to the humanities the arts the sciences in short to civilization of which last dear mademoiselle beauchamps hospitality represented so integral and so wholly charming a part this and much more to this effect the french mind and french diction rarely fumble but arrive with graceful adroitness squarely on the spot lightness of touch and finish of phrase effectually safeguarded these raptures against any suggestion of insincerity or absurdity they were diverting captivating as were the retailers of them and anastasia listened retorted sympathized capped a climax with further witty extravagance heartily pleased and amused nevertheless to her this yearly rentre was not without an element of pathos in the matter of reminiscence and retrospect miss beauchamp was the least selfindulgent of women her tendency to depress her juniors by exaltation of the past at expense of the present being of the smallest to hours of solitary communing in her hidden garden she restricted all that still this joyous homing when the members of her acquaintance taking up their residence once again in paris blossomed into fullness of intellectual and social activity left her a little wistful a little sad recognition of the perpetual shifting of the human scene of the instability of human purpose oppressed her how few of those who greeted her today with such affectionate empressement were precisely the same in thought circumstance or character as when they bade her farewell at the end of may she could not but note changes those changes might be slight infinitesimal but they existed not only do things as a whole march on but the individual marches on alsomarches on too often out completeness of sympathy completeness of comprehension or through the ceaselessly centrifugal scattering action of the social machine marches on actually out of hearing and out of sight and this thinning of the ranks these changes in those who remained did cause her sorrow she could not bring herself to acquiesce in and accept them with entire philosophy arrayed in a dress of clove carnation satin veiled with black ninon de soie miss beauchamp stood near the door opening from the first of the suite of receptionroomsin which tea had been servedon to the entrance hall she had taken up her position there when bidding her guests adieu in the second room two persons were talking lewis byewaters slow detached slightly nasal accents making themselves clearly audible lenty stacpole feels madame vernois is just the loveliest mature french feminine type he has yet encountered he would be gratified to work up those thumbnail sketches of her he made at ste marie into a finished portrait for exhibition with his other work in new york this winter with an unconscious but very expressive little gesture of reprobation anastasia moved across to the embrasure of the near window pleasant from the fresh pungent scent of a bank of white and lemoncolored chrysanthemums she looked up into the limpid clarity of the twilight sky seen above the houseroofs on the opposite side of the quiet street yes the perpetual shifting of the human scene the instability of human purpose and as concrete example of all that a portrait of gentle shrinking timid preeminently oldworld madame vernois on exhibition in new york the shouting incongruity of the proposition would her daughter la belle gabrielle entertain it and there as anastasia confessed to herself she ran up against the provoking cause of her quarrel with existing conditions and tendencies for of the two living persons whom she had recently come to hold dearest wasnt the one changed and the other absent since that pleasant afternoon at ste marie she had neither sight nor word of adrian savage the young man appeared to have incontinently vanished she rang up his office in the rue druot the good konski replied over the telephone monsieur was alas encore en voyage she rang up his home address in the rue de luniversit only to receive the same response supplemented by the information that adrian had not notified the date of his return nor left orders as to the forwarding of his letters what did this mean she became anxious lenty has worried quite a wearing amount byewater was saying whether it would be suitable he should ask you to let him work up a portrait i tell you madame st leger lentys silverpoint is just a dream do not go thinking it is because i am his friend i judge it so mr dax positively enthused when he saw some samples last fall and lenty has broken his own record since then anastasia still consulting the calm evening sky began to play a quite other than calm little fantasia with the fingers of one hand upon the windowpane for why in the name of diplomacy of logic of eros himself had adrian savage elected to vanish at this moment of all conceivable moments the goal of his ambitions was in sighthadnt she told him as much at ste marie eros awaiting as she believed to crown him victor in the long faithful fight and then that he the dear exasperating young idiot should gallop off thus the lord only knew whither instead of claiming the enchanting fruit of his victory really it was too wildly irritating for la belle gabrielle wasnt pleasednot a bit of it she resented his absence at this particular juncture as any woman of spirit not unreasonably must only too probably she would make him pay for his apparent slight of her and to what extent would she make him pay faster and faster grew the time of the fantasia upon the windowpane for this question greatly disturbed anastasia for if adrian must be cited as an example of the absent la belle gabrielle must be cited as among the changed miss beauchamp who watched her with affectionate solicitude perceived something was a little bit wrong with her she was not quite contented not quite happy her manner had lost its delightful repose her beauty though great its high serenity her wit had a sharp edge to it she avoided occasions of intimacy today she had helped anastasia receive and the latter remarked that during the whole course of the afternoon men had gathered about her and that she flirtedgracefullyyet undeniablywith each and all in turn since her return to paris she had discarded the last outward signs of mourning the smokegray walkingsuit she wore today was lavishly embroidered in faint pastel shades of mauve turquoise and shellpink the pattern outlined here and there in silver thread which glinted slightly as she moved the same delicate tones tipped the panache of smokegray ostrich plumes set at the side of her large black hat in this donning of charming colors anastasia read the signing of some private declaration of independence some assertion not only of her youth and youths acknowledged privilege of joyous costume but of intention to make capital out of the admiration her youth and beauty excited after the manner of other fair mondaines clearly madame st leger had arrived at a definite and momentous parting of the ways her mourning all which it implied and which went along with it was a thing of the past her nature was too richlet it be added too normal and wholesomefor the senses not to play their part in the shaping of her destiny she had coquetted with feminism it is true but such appeals and opportunities as feminism has to offer the senses are not of an order wholesome natures can accept to gabrielle those appeals and opportunities were briefly loathsome while in her existing attitude an exclusively intellectual fanaticismsuch as alone can render advanced feminism morally innocuousno longer could control or satisfy her against it her ironic and critical humor rebelled making sport of it it followed therefore as anastasia saw that la belle gabrielle would inevitably seek satisfaction scope for her young energies for her unimpaired joy of living elsewhere and this signaled possible danger for just now being piqued as anastasia believed and pushed by wounded pride she might commit a folly she might marry the wrong man marry for position merely or for money plenty of aspirants judging by this afternoon needed but little encouragement to declare themselves she had borne the trials of one loveless marriage bravely without faintest breath of scandal or hint of disaster throughout she had been admirable both in taste and in conduct but what about a second loveless marriage made now in the full bloom of her womanhood miss beauchamps fingers positively drummed upon the window for she had come to love them both so closely love them foolishly even weakly muchperhapsthis very attractive young couple of whom the one just now was absent the other changed beyond measure would it grieve her if the consummation of their romance should be frustrated or should come about other than quite honest and noble lines why oh why in heavens name did adrian savage absent himself why at this eminently psychologic moment was he not here anastasia could have wept then becoming aware of footsteps and some presence entering from the hall behind her she turned round hastily to find herself confronted by adrian himself enfin she cried enthusiastically what an inexpressible relief to see you my dear savage you discover me in the very act of exhaling my doubtfully pious soul in prayers for your speedy return you are late in some respects perhaps dangerously late but better late than neverimmeasurably better in this connection only pardon me where on earth have you been the young man held her hand affectionately in a land which possesses no frontiers alas he said a land which bears no relation to geography hum hum anastasia responded just a trifle impatiently shaking her head and in addition to its other peculiarities is this famous country devoid of a postal system may i ask practically yes adrian answered unless one is prepared to make oneself a really unpardonable bore some people call it the land of regrets dear friend others call it purgatory the two names are synonymous for most of us i imagine i have spent several weeks there and the atmosphere of the accursed place still so clings to me that although i needed immensely to see you i shrank from coming here today until as i supposed all your other guests would have gone then anastasia looking at him perceived that this delightful young manher great fondness for whom she did not attempt to disguise or denymust also be added to the number of the homing parisians who had suffered change since she saw them last to begin with he was in mourning of the correct french order which in mans attire only in a degree less than in womans prescribes uncompromising severity of black but the change in him as she quickly apprehended went deeper than such merely outward acknowledgment of mournful occurrence some profound note had been struck since she saw him at ste marie of the gleaming sands and alluring horizons revealing tremendous and vital issues to him and in view of those same issues revealing him to himself from the effect of this revelation his whole being was still vibrant anastasias heart went out to him in large and generous sympathy but she abstained from question or comment the matter whatever it might be was grave not to be taken lightly or played with if he intended to give her his confidence he would find an opportunity for doing so himself men as she reflected in their dealings with women are made that way express no desire to learn what troubles them and they hasten to tell you show however discreetly your anxiety to hear and they roll like hedgehogs prickles outward at once so she merely said smiling at him i am afraid you should have waited even longer my dear savage if your object was to avoid all my guests two in any case still linger listenwe cannot hope for solitude deux just yet for once more byewaters slow penetrating accents made themselves audible if you feel not to be able to entertain lenty stacpoles proposal madame st leger i would not have you hesitate to tell me i believe i catch on to your objection though in america our ladies do not have such strong prejudices against publicity i will explain to lenty the way you feel i would not wish to put you to any worry of refusing his proposal yourself eh par exemple and pray what next adrian said under his breath with raised eyebrows looking his hostess inquiringly in the face ste marie offered only too many fatally magical quarters of an hour they are both very hopelessly far gone the two poor innocents both but it is preposterous incredible dearest friend you do not say to me bothnot both adrian cried in a rising scale of heated protest to which anastasia hailing these symptoms of militant jealousy as altogether healthy replied genially taking his arm if you doubt my word come and judge for yourself lewis byewater his hands clasped behind him leaned his limp height against one of the few wallspaces unincrusted with pictures mirrors china and other liberal confusion of ornament madame st leger stood near him smoothing out the wrinkles in the wrists of her long gloves to adrian as he entered the room her charming person presented itself in profile he perceived and this gave him a curious turn in the blood half of subtle alarm half of high promise that she once more wore colors anastasia beauchamp felt his arm tremble yes she murmured a certain enchanting woman puts on her armor and takes the field again believe me it is time high time you came back you are so very good to try to spare me the pain of making mr stacpole a refusal gabrielle was saying sweetly to the young american but you do always show yourself so very amiable so thoughtful i think your countrymen are of the mosthow do you saythe most unselfish of any turning her headah she exclaimed quite sharply living red leaping into the round of her cheeks and living light into her eyesit is you mr savage but even while the answering light leaped into adrians eyes very effectually for the moment dissipating their melancholy her expression hardened becoming mocking and ironic you have the pleasure to know my kind friend m byewater she asked with a graceful wave of the hand toward that excellent youth who had ceased to lounge against the wall and stood rather anxiously upright the blankness of unexpected discomfiture upon his ingenuous countenance incontestably i have the pleasure of knowing m byewater adrian replied i have also had the pleasure of reading and further of publishing two of his a littleyes i fear perhaps just a littlelengthy articles i did condense all i knew byewater put in ruefully addressing his hostess but i presume i was overweighted by the amount of my material quite so and the whole secret both of style and of holding your readers attention lies in selection in the intuitive knowledge of what to leave out adrian declared his eyes fixed with positively ferocious jealousy upon la belle gabrielles partially averted face that poor inoffensive byewater should receive this public roasting was flagrantly unjust anastasia felt still she abstained from intervention the silence which followed was critical she refused to break it the responsibility of doing so appeared to her too great one or other of the two principal actors in the little scene must undertake that she really couldnt at last coldly unwilling as though forced against her inclination to speak madame st leger turning to adrian savage said it is long since we have any news of him how is m dax adrian shrugged his shoulders i have not heard chre madame he replied whereupon miss beauchamp satisfied that whether for good or ill relations were safely established between this altogether dear and not a little perverse young couple called cheerfully to the american youth come here come here mr byewater i have hardly had one word with you all this afternoon and there is something i greatly wish to ask you what is this that i hear about our good clever mr stacpoles leaving for new york it is so miss beauchamp lenty is fairly through with the work for his winter exhibition and he looks to start the first of the month but i do not comprehend how it is you do not bring any news of m dax have you not then been with him all the time since we have last seen you i have been abroad adrian replied my cousin of whom you may remember to have heard me speakjoanna smyrthwaite he hesitated and his companion though stoutly resolved against all yielding and pity in his direction could not but note the melancholy and extreme pallor of his handsome face but certainly i remember she returned rather hastily is she ill then poor lady one of those pensive abstractions whom it has been your interesting mission to materialize and rejuvenate she is no longer ill he answered she is dead ah quel malheur inattendu truly that is most sad gabrielle said in accents of concern then for a moment she looked at adrian with a very singular expression i offer you my sympathy my condolences mr savage upon this unhappy event and turning aside she began to move toward the doorway of the outer room upon the threshold of which her hostess stood talking to byewater but adrian arrested her impetuously stay madame he cried joining his hands as in supplication stay i implore you and permit me a few minutes conversation by this you will confer the greatest benefit upon me for so and so only can misunderstandings and misconstructions be avoided thus admonished gabrielle paused her aspect and bearing were reserved as those of one who yields in obedience to good manners rather than to personal inclination but adrian nothing daunted followed up his advantage i came here today chre madame he said as soon as possible after my return my idea was to consult our friend miss beauchamp to ask her advice and enlist her assistance i feared my conduct might have appeared erratic inexplicable i proposed begging her to act as my ambassadress asking her to recount to you certain things which have taken place since we parted at ste mariethings very grievous in a way unexampled and unnatural but as i have the good fortune to find you here i entreat you to wait and hear me while i acquaint you with those occurrences myself you will remain yes let us go over there then out of earshot of the insupportably recurrent mr byewater i need to speak to you alone chre madame without frivolous interruptions and mr byewater is forever at hand he annoys me he is so very far from decorative he reminds me of a fishof an underdone filet de sole madame st legers reserve gave slightly unhappy mr byewater she murmured yes indeed unhappy since you too observe the likeness adrian pursued darting positively envenomed glances in the direction of the doorway yet is it not unpardonable in any man to resemble the insufficiently fried section of a flat fish you recognize it as unpardonable sit down here then trs chre madame at the farthest distance possible from that lanky poisson damrique ah i am grateful to you he added with very convincing earnestness for in listening you will help to dissipate the blackness of regret which engulfs me you will hear and you will judge yes it is for you for you only and supremely to do thatto judge i fear you will be no end fatigued miss beauchamp standing all this long time talking the excellent and fortunately quite unconscious byewater was meanwhile saying i believe i ought to go right now i had promised myself i would escort madame st leger home to the quai malaquais but i dont believe i stand to gain anything by waiting recent developments hardly favor the supposition that promise is likely to condense into fact he nodded his head indicating the couple ensconced at the opposite end of the room in two pillowed caneseated canebacked gilt chairs of pseudoclassic pattern the wall immediately behind them carried a broad tall panel of lookingglass the border of which blossomed on either side at about half its height into a cluster of shaded electric lamps the mellow light from these covered the perfectly finished figures of the young man and woman sitting there in such close proximity and created a bright circle about them as anastasia beauchamp noted curiously isolating them from all surrounding objects save their own graceful images repeated in the great lookingglass her eyes dwelt upon them in indulgent tenderness might they prosper and therewith very genially she turned her attention to the fishlike byewater once more but that same bright isolation and close proximity worked strongly upon gabrielle st leger her pulse quickened a subtle excitement took possession of her which just because of her anxiety to ignore and conceal it obliged her to speak your cousins death has evidently pained you you mourn her very truly very much i cannot mourn enough indeed she said dwelling upon the word with a peculiar and slightly incredulous inflection no he repeated i cannot mourn enough but to make my state of mind intelligible to youand it is vitally important to me to do soit is necessary you should know what has happened i cannot deny that i am very sad he bowed himself together setting his elbows on his knees pressing his hands against either side of his head i have cause to be sad he continued involuntarily i have contributed to the commission of a crime all the values are altered i am become a stranger to myself therefore i ask just this of you to hear me and to judge surprised impressed alarmed even gabrielle st leger gathered herself back gravely in her gilded longseated pseudoclassic chair the young mans genuine and undisguised trouble combined with his actual physical nearness to threaten her emotional equilibrium more eagerly than she cared to admit even to herself had she looked forward to his return to ste marie her disappointment was proportionate causing her anger the thought of the slight he had put upon her rankled she was or rather wished to be angry still but just now wishes and feeling ranged themselves in irritating opposition and conflict and during the silence following his last strangely sorrowful and selfaccusing wordshe so very near to her dejected abstracted with bent headfeeling gained waxing masterful and intimate the personal charm of the man his distinction of appearance his quick brain and eloquent speech his unimpeachable sincerity his virilityrefined but in no degree impaired by the artificial conditions of modern lifeeven his boyish outbreak of jealousy toward lewis byewater stirred and agitated her proving dangerous alike to her senses and her heart the culminating moment of that terrible experience in ren daxs studio when half beside herself from the horror of madness and death she had flung herself upon adrians breast there finding safety and restoration to all the dear joys of living presented itself to her memory with importunate insistence was it conceivable that she craved to have that moment repeat itself mr savageyou asked me to listen i listen she said and her voice shook in response the young man looked up at her a rather pitiful smile on his white face thank youit was like this then chre madame et amie he said pushed by certain sinister fears without waiting to communicate with you or with any one i went straight to england on receiving from her sister the announcement of my cousins death letters had passed between us during the previous fortnight which rendered that announcement peculiarly and acutely distressing to me adrian bent his head again and sat staring blindly at the floor she had asked a pledge of me which neither in honor nor in honesty could i give he said bitterly my cousin was an admirable woman of business i knew that all her worldly affairs were scrupulously regulated i was in no way concerned in the distribution of her property i went to attend her funeral as a tribute of regard and respect i also went in the hope the sinister fears of which i have spoken might prove unfounded i stayed in london merely going down to stourmouth for a few hours it was a wretched wretched day the weather cold and wet he ceased speaking for at this momentwhether through some inward compelling some mental necessity to arrive at a just and comprehensive estimate of the history of the last eight months or whether through some external influence emanating from the unseen world of spirit and striving to dominate and coerce him he could neither then nor afterward determinethe whole gloomy affaire smyrthwaite in its entirety from start to finish presented itself to his mind the slightly bizarre yet charming room its crowded furniture subdued gaiety of lights and flowers even gabrielle st legers wellbeloved and ardently desired presence became strangely unreal to him and remote while his mind fixed itself in turn upon the autocratic selfcentered husband and father warping the lives of wife and children in obedience to coldblooded theory upon the interruption of his own work and prosecution of his fair romance by the tedious labors of the executorship of his long fruitless search amid the filth of the paris underworld for the wastrel degenerate bibby of the squalid finding the still more squalid redisappearance of the wretched fellow and the disquieting uncertainty which even now covered his whereabouts and his fate and lastly with sharp inward shrinking upon the commencement the progress the extinction of joannas infatuation for himself and as sum total and result what remained what was there to show in the way of harvest for all that strenuous and painful sowing only thisthat now very strangely he himself at once participant and spectator he saw in the mournful chill of the rainswept september day a dark straggling illassorted procession passing up a trampled puddlepocketed road between ranks of pale and vulgarly commonplace monuments set against a backing of somber firtrees and heather margaret smyrthwaite composed callous and comely swathed in abundance of brandnew crape walked beside him immediately behind a coffinthe hard polished lines of which were unsoftened by pall or by flowerscarried shoulder high the big yorkshireman andrew merriman followed in company with joseph challonerthe latter oddly subdued and nervous obsequious even in bearing and in speech next came fussy little colonel haig doctor norbiton and the amazon marion chase a contingent of servants from the tower house headed by smallbridge the butler johnson the portly coachman and mrs isherwood brought up the rear isherwood alone of the company wept silently but heartbrokenly mourning not only a mistress who was to her as a daughter but the passing of an order of things which had filled and molded her life and in the service of which she had grown old to adrian the faithful womans tears supplied the one sincere and human note in the otherwise cruelly barren and perfunctory performance and to his seeing her desolation found sympathetic echo in the desolation of the autumn moorland of the bare coffin and the gray curtain of drifting mist blotting out the distancethe vast amphitheater of the baughurst park woods the streets and buildings of stourmouth and all the noble freedom of the sea the hopelessness of that desolation clutched at him still penetrating him even now and here with conviction of failure and futility with doubt of any eternal and reasoned direction and purpose in things human and with very searching doubt of himself his fine and healthy optimismin other words his faith in gods goodnesssuffered bitter eclipse i would not be surprised if i concluded to take the trip with lenty the first of the month miss beauchamp as he spoke lewis byewaters mild and honest eyes half humorously half reproachfully sought the delightful young man and young woman sitting silent in their gilded chairs i am ever so grateful to you for all the splendid times you have given me he continued rather irrelevantly but i begin to have a notion it would prove healthier for me to leave paris this fall again his eyes sought the silent couple enthroned before the tall mirror yes he said i feel pretty confident i will accompany lenty seems as though this gay city had turned ever so lonesome and foreign tonight europe is enervating for a continuance i know others who have found it affect them that way there is too much atmosphere over here i have a notion my moral system is in need of toning up and i believe our bright american climate might help me some if i took a spell of it madame st leger threw back her head and loosened the lace scarf about her rounded throat return mr savage again i remind you that i wait to hear that which you ask to tell me that i listen return lest i grow too impatient of waiting she said adrian straightened himself his looked dazed absorbed he passed his hands across his eyes and forehead as one who awakens from a feverish sleep ah forgive me chre madame he answered but that is precisely what i need what i desirejust thatto return to come back and to come back by your invitation at your calling i ask nothing better nothing else he spread out his hands leaning sideways in his chair looking at her forgive me i am very stupid incoherent but the events of the last three weeks are still so vividly present to me that they confuse and distract me i cannot see my way clearly i find it difficult to tell you what is necessary just what i should see then it had been the habit of my cousin to keep a journal daily from early childhood the last volume of that journal she had i found left as a legacy to me her sister gave it to me after the funeral i took it back with me to london the night was wet and i was in no humor for amusement i remained indoors in my room at the hotel the sinister fears which i entertained in connection with my cousins death had not been allayed by my visit to stourmouth a certain mystery appeared to surround the circumstances attending it i perceived a great unwillingness to answer my inquiries on the part of those most nearly concerned that night after dinner i opened the packet containing the journal unwillingly i own i would rather have delayed but i could not do so with the muffled roar of the ceaseless london traffic in my ears i sat and read the journal from cover to cover having once begun i could not leave off i did not go to bed that night in the morning early i left london i left england i traveled i hardly know where i went madame i wanted to escape i wanted to get away from every person i knew whom i had ever seen above all i wanted to get away from myself but i was obliged to take myself along with me and i found myself a dreadful companion i hated myself madame st leger moved slightly in her gilded chair my poor friend she murmured almost inaudibly yes i hated myself adrian repeated that journal is the most poignant the most convincing human document i have ever read my cousin had the misfortune to love a person who did not return her affection in the pages of her journal with uncompromising truthfulness with appalling selfscrutiny selfrevelation and unflinching courage with i may add the amazing abandon possible only to a rigidly virtuous woman she has recorded the successive phases of that love from its first unsuspected and almost unconscious inception to the hour when by an act of will so extraordinary as to be little short of miraculous she sent her soul out of her body across land and sea in pursuit of the man whom she loved and forced from his own lips the confession of his indifference to her again madame st leger moved slightly you tell me this soberly mr savage she asked in good faith adrian looked fixedly at her her beautiful face her whole attitude was tense with excitement in absolute good faith madame he replied i have not only the detailed testimony of her journal but the perfectly independent and equally detailed testimony of the person whom she loved the two statements agree in every particular still gabrielle cried a sudden yearning in her eyes still i cannot count her as altogether unfortunate your poor cousin for it is not given to manyit is the mark of a very strong a very great nature to be capable of such love and when she had obtained this mans confession she decided to live no longer adrian replied hoarsely she had no religion no faith in almighty god or in the survival of human personality and consciousness no hope of a hereafter to restrain her from taking her own life she made her preparations calmly and silently with the dignity of sincere and very impressive stoicism the concluding words of the terrible book in which she has dissected out all the passion and agony of her heart of her poor tortured body as well as her poor tortured soul are words of pity of tenderness toward the man who found himself unable to return her affection for a time both remained silent while in the outer room miss beauchamp bade a genial farewell to the disconsolate byewater yes go my dear young man go she said and breathe the surprising air of your very surprising native land i shall miss you but i understand the position and give you my blessing later you will return to usfor europe is full of illumination and of instruction you will return and be very sure we shall all be delighted to see you be sure also that you leave an altogether pleasant and friendly reputation behind you but but gabrielle said presently with a certain protest and hesitancy it pains it angers me to think of so great a waste for it is no ordinary thing the bestowal by any woman of so magnificent a gift of love that a woman young and rich should die for loveand now at the present time when our interest moves quickly from person to person when we console ourselves easily with some new occupation new friendship when our morals are perhaps a littlehow do you sayeasy is it not particularly surprising is it not indeed unique to reject such affection is not that to throw away in a sense a positive fortune how could such devotion fail to attract fail to create a response why monsieur could not this man of whom you tell me return your cousins great love adrian savage spread out his hands with a gesture at once hopeless and singularly appealing because madame because the man already loved you he said and that being so for him there could be no possible room no conceivable question of any other love madame st leger remained absolutely motionless expressionless for a moment then she threw back her head closing her eyes ah she sighed sharply ah and adrian waited watching her a sudden keenness in his face for what indeed did it betoken where did it lead to this praise and advocacy of joanna smyrthwaites tragic devotion followed by that singularly unrestrained and unconventional little outcry the said outcry struck right through him giving him a queer turn in the bloodcarrying him back in sentiment moreover to the horrible yet perfect experience in ren daxs studio when he had felt the whole weight of gabrielles beloved body flung against him and the clasp of her arms about his neck he straightened himself took a deep breath his nostrils dilated his lips parted he emerged from the confusion and lethargy which had oppressed him quickened by that same outcry into newness and fullness of life to him all this was as the drawing aside of some gloomy jealously impenetrable curtainthe curtain of desolate gray mist was it blotting out the distance the town the great woods and the noble freedom of the sea when he walked in that illassorted funeral procession up the wet road behind joannas coffina drawing of it aside and letting the glad and wholesome sunlight shine on him once more he no longer felt a stranger to himself the pastall which had happened all which went to shape his character and inspire his action all which he had desired and held infinitely dear before the affaire smyrthwaite imposed itself upon himlinked up with the present in sane and intelligible sequence of cause and effect thus chastened it is true a little older sadder wiser but fearless ardent purposeful as ever did adrian the magnificent come into his own again he drew nearer to her laid his right arm somewhat possessively upon the arm of madame st legers chair and spoke softly yet with much of his former impetuosity see chre madame see he said do you perhaps remember this winter in the week of the great snow when i came to tell you i was summoned to my cousins home in england you were not quite quite kind you mocked me a little suggesting a solution of the problems raised by my impending visit the solution you proposed was as i ventured to explain to you impossible then it remained impossible to the end the cruel end and for the same reason his manner changed his voice deepened yet believe me when by degrees against my will against my respect for my cousin and sincere desire for her happiness the fact of her unfortunate partiality was brought home to me i tried with all my strength to command my heart twice i faced the situation without reserve and tried to submit to sacrifice myself rather than cause her humiliation and distress adrian looked away across the crowded pleasant room with its scent of autumn flowers cedar and sandalwood and its many shaded lights his lips worked but at first no sound passed them i could not do it he said i could not i loved you too much he raised his hand from the arm of la belle gabrielles chair turning proudly upon her as a man who on his trial fiercely protests his own innocence i had given her no cause for her disastrous delusionbefore god madame i had not and my passion too has its authority its unalienable rights i could not i dared not betray them it may be that the happiness to which i aspire will never be granted me very well i shall suffer but i shall know how to accommodate myself but to cut myself off voluntarily from all hope of that happiness by marriage with another woman was like asking me to mutilate myself i refused could the situation repeat itself i should again refuse although when i read her terrible journal and learned the reason of my cousins suicide i was consumed by remorse by grief and selfreproach adrian paused now i have told you everything madame he added quietly i leave myself in your hands it is for you to condemn or to acquit me to judge whether i have behaved as an honorable man whether i have done right after a silence a pathetic bewilderment in her mysterious eyes gabrielle st leger answered brokenly i do not know i do not know i cannot presume to judge what you tell me is all so difficult so sadonly i may say perhaps that i am glad you did not sacrifice yourself you are glad then adrian stammered then you will marry me eh but la belle gabrielle cried and her voice shook though whether with tears or with laughter she herself knew not you go so quick so very quick you are mistakenpardon me i do not go quick but slow slow as the centuries as ons as innumerable and cumulative eternities have i not served for you tres chre madame a good seven years so long as that yes as long as that ever since the day i first saw you you had but recently come to paris much has happenedfor both of ussince that date yes i can still describe to you the gown you wore the manner in which your hair was dressed can recall the subjects of our conversation can repeat the words which you said madame st leger gathered herself back in her gilded chair her head bent for a quite perceptible space of time she remained absolutely still the inclination of her head and the shadow cast by the brim of her hat concealed her face adrians heart thumped in his ears his breath came short and thick at last he could bear the suspense no longer he leaned forward again madame madame he called softly urgently think of the seven years remember that i am young and that i am on fire since i love as the young love do not prolong my trial give me my answeryes or nonow here at once thus adjured madame st leger raised her head looked full at him with wideopen eyes something profound exalted in a way desperate in her expression she shivered slightly and holding out both her hands i surrender she said the young man took her extended hands in his bent down and kissed them reverently then looked back at her gravely resolutely though he was white to the lips but not under compulsion not out of pity he said now even now with the consummation of all my hopes and desire within my grasp i would rather you sent me away than thanthat la belle gabrielle shook her head gently smiling no no she answered not under compulsion not out of pity mon ami but because i find nature is too strong for me because i find i too love and findsince you will have me lay bare my heart and tell you everythingit is you precisely and solely you whom i love and from the inner roominto which anastasia beauchamp had passed unperceived by her two guests during this for them momentous colloquycame strains of heroic music good for the soul the end
