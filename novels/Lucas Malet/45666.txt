opinions of a cat and the sorrows of a charcoal burner the pine forest is a wonderful place the pinetrees stand in ranks like the soldiers of some vast army side by side mile after mile in companies and regiments and battalions all clothed in a sober uniform of green and grey but they are unlike soldiers in this that they are of all ages and sizes some so small that the rabbits easily jump over them in their play and some so tall and stately that the fall of them is like the falling of a high tower and the pinetrees are put to many different uses they are made into masts for the gallant ships that sail out and away to distant ports across the great ocean others are sawn into planks and used for the building of sheds for the rafters and flooring and clapboards and woodwork of our houses for railwaysleepers and scaffoldings and hoardings others are polished and fashioned into articles of furniture turpentine comes from them which the artist uses with his colours and the doctor in his medicines which is used too in the cleaning of stuffs and in a hundred different ways while the pinecones and broken branches and waste wood make bright crackling fires by which to warm ourselves on a winters day but there is something more than just this i should like you to think about in connection with the pine forest for it like everything else that is fair and noble in nature has a strange and precious secret of its own you may learn the many uses of the trees in your school books when men have cut them down or grubbed them up or poked holes in their poor sides to let the turpentine run out but you can only learn the secret of the forest itself by listening humbly and reverently for it to speak to you for nature is a very great lady grander and more magnificent than all the queens who have lived in sumptuous palaces and reigned over famous kingdoms since the world began and though she will be very kind and gracious to children who come and ask her questions modestly and prettily and will show them the most lovely sights and tell them the most delicious fairy tales that ever were seen or heard she makes very short work with conceited and impudent persons she covers their eyes and stops their ears so that they can never see her wonderful treasures or hear her charming stories but live all their lives long shut up in the dark fusty cupboard of their own ignorance and stupid selflove and selfsatisfaction thinking they know all about everything as well as if they had made it themselves when they do not really know anything at all and because you and i dislike fusty cupboards and because we want to know anything and everything that nature is condescending enough to teach us we will listen to begin with to what the pine forest has to tell when the rough winds are up and at play and the pinetrees shout and sing together in a mighty chorus while the hoarse voice of them is like the roar of the sea upon a rocky coast then you may learn the secret of the forest it sings first of the winged seed and then of the birth of the tiny tree of sunrise and sunset and the tranquil warmth of noonday and of the soft refreshing rain and the kindly nourishing earth and of the white moonlight and pale moist garments of the mist all helping the tree to grow up tall and straight to strike root deep and spread wide its green branches it sings too of the biting frost and the still dumb snow and the hurrying storm all trying and testing the tree to prove if it can stand firm and show a brave face in time of danger and trouble then it sings of the happy springtime when the forest is girdled about with a band of flowers while the birds build and call to each other among the high branches and the squirrel helps his wife to make her snug nest for the little brown squirrelbabies that are to be and the dormice wake up from their long winter sleep and sit in the sunshine and comb their whiskers with their dainty little paws and then the forest sings of manhow he comes with axe and saw and hammer and iron wedges and lays low the tallest of its children and binds them with ropes and chains and hauls them away to be his bondservants and slaves and last of all it sings slowly and very gently of old age and decay and death of the seed that falls on hard dry places and never springs up of the tree that is broken by the tempest or scathed by the lightning flash and stands bare and barren and unsightly sings how in the end all things shrink and crumble and how the dust of them returns and is mingled with the fruitful soil from which at first they came this is the song of the pine forest and from it you may learn this lesson that the life of the tree and of beast and bird are subject to the same three great laws as the life of manthe law of growth of obedience and of selfsacrifice and perhaps when you are older if you take care to avoid that spirit of conceit and impudence which as we have already said gets people into such trouble with nature you may come to see that these three laws are after all but one bound for ever together by the golden cord of love once upon a time just on the edge of the pine forest there lived a little boy he lived in a big brown wooden house with overhanging eaves and a very deep roof to it which swept down from the high middle gable like the wings of a hen covering her chickens the woodsheds and haybarn and the stable where the browneyed sweetbreathed cows lay at night and the clean cool dairy and the cheeseroom with its heavy presses were all under this same wide sheltering roof before the house a meadow of rich grass stretched down to a stream that hurried along over rocky limestone ledges or slipped away over flat sandy places where you might see the little fishes playing at hideandseek or puss in the corner among the bright pebbles at the bottom while on the shallow marshy puddles by the stream side where the forgetmenot and brooklime and rushes grow the waterspiders would dance quadrilles and jigs and reels all day long in the sunshine and the frogs would croak by hundreds in the still spring evenings when the sunset was red behind the pinetrees to the west and in this pleasant place little peter lived as i say once upon a time with his father and mother and his two brothers and eliza the servantmaid and gustavus the cowherd he was the youngest of the children by a number of years and was such a small fellow that susan lepage his mother could make him quite a smart blouse and pair of trousers out of antonys castoff garments even when all the patches and thin places had been cut out he had a black curly head and very round eyesfor many things surprised him and surprise makes the eyes grow round as everybody knowsand a dear little red mouth that was sweet to kiss and nice fat cheeks which began to look rather cold and blue by the way as he stood on the threshold one evening about christmas time with cincinnatus the old tabby tomcat under his arm he was waiting for his brother antony to come home from the neighbouring markettown of nullepart it was growing dusk yet the sky was very clear the sound of the wind in the pine branches and of the chattering stream was strange in the frosty evening air so that little peter felt rather creepy as the saying is and held on very tight to cincinnatus for fear ofhe didnt quite know what come in little man come in cried his mother as she moved to and fro in the ruddy firelight helping eliza to get ready the supper you will be frozen standing there outside and we shall be frozen too sitting here with the door open antony will get home none the quicker for your watching that which is looked for hardest they say comes last but peter only hugged cincinnatus a little closerthereby making that longsuffering animal kick spasmodically with his hind legs as a rabbit does when you hold it up by the earsand looked more earnestly than ever down the forest path into the dimness of the pines just then john paqualin the charcoalburner came up to the open door with a couple of empty sacks across his shoulders now the charcoalburner was a great friend of little peters though he was a queer figure to look at for his red hair hung in wild locks down over his shoulders and his eyes glowed red tooas red as his own smouldering charcoal firesand his back was bent and crooked while his legs were so inordinately long and thin that all the naughty little boys in nullepart when he went down there to sell his sacks of charcoal used to run after him up the street shouting hurrah hurrah heres the grasshopper man again hey ho grasshopper give us a tunehavent you brought your fiddle but when paqualin got annoyed as he sometimes did and turned round upon them with his glowing eyes they would all scuttle away as hard as their legs could carry them for like a good many other people they were particularly courageous when they could only see the enemys back you may be sure our little peter never called the charcoalburner by any offensive names and therefore having a good conscience had no cause to be afraid of him eh but what is this he cried in his high cracked voice as he flung down the sacks and stood by the little lad in the doorway remember my ears are so quick i can hear the grass grow just now i heard the best mother in the world call her little boy to go indoors and here he stands still on the threshold if you do not go in do you know what will happen eh no what will happen please tell me said peter illustration what will happen please tell me page the charcoalburner stretched out one long arm and pointed away into the forest and sunk his voice to a whisper the old grey shewolf will assuredly come pitapat pitapat over the moss and the stones pitapat over the pineneedles and the fallen twigs and branches pitapat out of the wood andsnaplike that catch your poor cincinnatus by the tail and carry him off to make into soup for her little ones picture to yourself poor cincinnatus in the wolfs great black steaming souppot and all the wolfcubs with their wicked little mouths wide open sitting round with their wooden spoons in their hands all ready to begin peter retreated hastily into the kitchen cat and all and took up his stand rather close to his mother is it true mother he said but where do the wolves buy their wooden spoons do you thinkin the shop at nullepart nay how should i know said susan lepage as she stooped down and kissed the child and then looking up kindly nodded to the charcoalburner you must ask the old shewolf herself if you want to know where she buys her spoons and her soup pot too for that matter she is no friend of mine little one after a moments pause she added you will stay to supper john paqualin my husband and sons will be in soon and there is plenty for all thank god you will be welcome but paqualin shook his head and the light died away in those strange eyes of his welcome he said the pretty false word has little meaning for me and yet perhaps in your mouth it is honest susan lepage for you are gentle and merciful as a saint in heaven and the child here takes after you but for the rest who welcomes a mad misshapen halffinished creature on whom nature herself has had no mercy master lepage will come in hungry will he like to have his stomach turned by the sight of the humpbacked charcoalburner no no i go home to my hut goodnight little peter i will tell the grey wolf to look elsewhere for her supperah i see wonderful things though sometimes for all that i live alone and in squalor the red fire and the white moon tell me stories turn by turn all the night through and with that he swung the empty sacks across his back again and shambled away into the growing darkness illustration a good riddance muttered eliza as she set the cheese on the table it is an absolute indignity to ask a respectable servant to wait at table on a wild animal like that but susan lepage sighed as she turned from the doorway poor unhappy one she said god gave thee thy fair soul but who gave thee thy ungainly body then she reproved eliza for her conduct in various matters which had nothing in the world to do with her remarks upon the charcoalburner even the best of women are not always quite logical meanwhile little peter had sat down on his stool by the fire for a little while he sat very still for he was thinking over the visit of his friend john paqualin he felt rather unhappy about him he could not quite have said why but when we are children it is not easy to think of any one person or one thing for long together there are such lots of things to think about that one chases another out of our heads very quickly and so peter soon gave up puzzling himself about the charcoalburner and began counting the sparks as they flew out of the blazing crackling pine logs up the wide chimney unfortunately however he was not a great arithmetician and though he began over and over again at plain one two three he always got wrong among the fifteens and sixteens and never succeeded in counting up to twenty at all nothing is more tedious than making frequent mistakes so he got off his stool and began hopping from one stone quarry in the kitchen floor to the next suddenly he became entangled in elizas full petticoatsshe was whirling them about a good deal it is true being in rather a bad temperand nearly tumbled down on his poor little nose bless the child what possesses him cried eliza peter retired to his stool again in a hurry and after thinking for a minute pulled a long bit of string with a crossbar of stick at the end of it out of the bulging side pocket of his short trousers and drew it backwards and forwards and bobbed it up and down just in front of cincinnatus nose but cincinnatus would not play cincinnatus sat up very stiff and straight with all his four paws in a row and his tail curled very tight over them blinking his yellow eyes at the fire for cincinnatus was offended even cats have feelings and on thinking it over he came to the conclusion that he had not been treated with sufficient respect souppots and wooden spoonsfiddledeedee he said to himself in the catlanguage why pervert a childs mind with such inane fictions for you see cincinnatus was not a common cat being first cousin once removed indeed to the sacristans cat at nullepartwho knew all the feast and fast days in the church calendar as well as the sacristan himself and had not eaten a mouse on a friday for i cannot say how long when you have a scholar in the family it obliges you to be dignified and so poor little peter as nothing and nobody would help to amuse him and pass away the time pressed his two fat little hands together in a sort of despair and gave a terrible sigh bless the child what possesses him cried eliza again ah my heart how you made me jump what is the matter peter asked his mother oh i dont believe antony will ever come home said the boy while the great tears began to run down over his chubby cheeks and i am so tired of waiting and i want so badly to know whether they have dressed the stable in the big church at nullepart and whether we shall really go there on sunday to see the dear baby jesus and the blessed virgin and good st joseph and the donkeys and cows you told me about i have never seen them yet and i want so dreadfully to go then his mother took up peter in her arms and sat down in the wooden chair in the chimneycorner and held him gently on her lap there there she said as she stroked his pretty hair what cause have you to fret the stable will be dressed all in good time and the donkeys and cows certainly wont run away before sunday and st joseph and the blessed virgin will be glad that a little lad like you should come and burn a candle before themnever fear if the day is fair we will certainly all go to church on sunday what is to be will be and antonys coming late or early can make no difference patience is a great virtue dear little oneyou cannot learn that too soon but cincinnatus sat up very stiff though he was growing slightly sleepy and still winked his yellow eyes at the fire he was not at all sure that it was not incumbent upon him to spit at the charcoalburner next time he saw him it was an extreme measure certainly and before adopting it he would have been glad to take his cousin the sacristans cats opinion on the matter social position brings its responsibilities yet all the same it is a fine thing to have a scholar in the family illustration chapter ii which introduces the reader to an admirer of the ancient romans now peters father was a person of some consequence or to speak quite correctly thought himself of some consequence which as you will probably find when you grow older often comes to much the same thing he had his own piece of land and his own herd of cows which the boys in the spring time would help gustavus to drive along with the cows of their neighbours to the wide grass lands that border the forest on the west where the blue salvias and gentians and campanulas and st brunos white lilies grow in the long grass but years ago peters father had been a soldier in the french army and had fought in great battles and had been in italy and even across the sea to africa he could tell surprising stories of sandy deserts and camels and lions and arabs and a number of other remarkable things that he had seen during his travels and when he went down as he frequently did and sat in the wine shop at nullepart everybody treated him with deference and distinction and called him not plain lepage but master lepage and listened respectfully to all that he had to say then master lepage was very well pleased and he would take his pipe out of his mouth and spread out his hands like some celebrated orator and give the company the benefit of his views upon any subjecteven those he did not very well understand for the great thing is to talk if you want to make an impression upon societythe sense of that which you say is quite a secondary consideration lepage was a handsome man with a bright grey eye and a nose like a hawks beak and a fine grey moustache the ends of which curled up till they nearly touched his eyebrows he held himself very erect so that even in his blue blouse and pegtop trousers with a great brown umbrella under his arm he still looked every inch a soldier illustration but master lepage notwithstanding his superior knowledge of the world did not always contrive to please his friends and companions for he wasso he saida philosophic politician and like most other philosophers and politicians he sometimes became both tedious and irritable on such occasions his voice would grow loud and he would thump the table with his fist till the plates danced and the glasses rattled again and the more the person with whom he was conversing smiled and apologised while he differed from him in opinion the louder his voice would grow and the more he would thump the table and stamp and violently declare that all who did not agree with him were idiots and dolts and traitors he had two fixed ideas he venerated the republican form of government and he despised the prussians if one of his sons was idle loitering over his work or complaining that he had too much to do master lepage would say to him sternlysluggard you are unworthy to be the child of a glorious republic or if one of the cows kicked when gustavus was milking her he would cry outhey then thou blue imbecile recollect that thou art the cow of a free citizen and do not behave like a cutthroat prussian and during the long evenings of all the winters that little peter could rememberthey were not so very many though after allwhen the supper was cleared away and the hearth swept his father after putting on a big pair of goldrimmed spectacles and drawing his chair close up to the table so that the lamplight might fall full on his book would read to himself the history of the famous roman republic and always once or twice during the course of the evening he would lay down the book and take off his spectacles and as he rubbed the glasses of them with his red pockethandkerchief would sigh to himself and say quite gentlyah but those were times worth living in they had men worth looking at in those days the elder of little peters brothers was named antony he was a smart brisk young fellow he was always in a little bit of a hurry and full of business he liked to go down to the town to market he liked to drive a sharp bargain and when he had nothing else to do he would roam away to the railway station and hang over the blue wooden railings at the back of the platform staring at the crowded passenger or heavily laden freight trains going through to paris or over the frontier into switzerland and if he ever happened to catch sight of any soldiers on the trains his eyes grew bright and his face eager and he would whistle a stirring march as he walked home through the forest and would chatter all the evening about the glorious fun he meant to have when the time came for him to serve his term in the army and at that master lepage would look up from the pages of his roman history book and nod confidentially to his wife and say eh our antony is a fine fellow he will help some day to thrash those rascally prussians but she would answer rather sadly that will be as the lord pleases there is sorrow and sin enough in the world already it seems to me without war to make it greater then lepage would shrug his shoulders with an air of slight disgust and say my wife you are no doubt an excellent woman but your mind is narrow only a secular education and above all a careful study of ancient history can enable us to speak intelligently on these great questions then he would wipe his spectacles and return once again to the campaigns of the romans illustration paul the second boy was very different to his brother he was tall and lanky with quiet brown eyes and straight black hair he had a great turn for mechanics and made little peter all manner of charming toysmillwheels that turned all splashing and sparkling in the clear water of the stream or windmills to set up in the garden and scare the birds away from the fruit with their clatter and many other pretty ingenious things paul did not talk much about himself he was a quiet silent fellow but he was always busy with his fingers making little models of all the machinery he could see or get pictures of and though his father was not quite so partial to him as to antony he would sometimes say eh our paul too will distinguish himself and bring credit upon his family and country now on the particular evening that i was telling you about in the last chapter antony did not come in till quite late the rest of the family had had their supper and eliza was grumbling to gustavus as she rummaged about in the back kitchen why cant people be punctual she said it would vex a saint to be kept muddling about till just upon bedtime unable to complete the days work and wash up the plates and dishes those who come in late should go to bed supperless if i had my way umph said gustavuswhich was a remarkably safe answer since it meant chiefly nothing at all master lepage sat studying the story of the gallant horatius how he and two others defended the falling bridge over the river tiber against all the host of clusium and the allied cities paul with a pocketknife and a number of bits of wood on the table before him was making a model of a forcepump and susan lepage sat in the chimney corner knitting little peter on a stool at her feet resting his head against her knees he was getting so sleepy that his eyes would shut though he tried very hard to keep them open sometimes his poor little head nodded over all on one side and then he woke up with a great start dreaming that he had tumbled out of the old peartree in the garden bump on to the ground and the dream was so vivid that it took him quite a minute and a half to remember where he was and to realise that he was sitting on his own little stool in the kitchen instead of lying on the asparagus bed under the peartree but sleepy or not peter was determined not to go to bed till he had heard the news from nullepart the longest waiting must needs end at last there was a sound of brisk footsteps the door was thrown open and antony entered the kitchen with the rush and bustle of a healthy young whirlwind peter was wide awake in a moment he jumped up and caught hold of the skirt of his brothers blouse oh tell me tell me he cried have they dressed the stable in the church and can i go on sunday and see it now it is always a great mistake to rush at people with questions when they are full of their own affairs and so little peter found in this case for antony had some money to pay over to his father and a great many things to say on his own account and then too he was very hungry and wanted his supper so he pushed poor peter aside rather roughly and told him to get out of the way and mind his own business and intimated generally that he was an inconvenient and superfluous person peter retired to his stool again feeling very small between sleepiness and disappointment he was very much inclined to cry perhaps indeed he would have done so had not cincinnatus got up and rubbed gently against his legs with a high back and a very upstanding tail purring very loud too and saying as plain as catlanguage could say it console yourself i cincinnatus regret what has occurred i am your friend confide in me all will yet go well for cincinnatus was a cat of feeling and never lost an opportunity of making himself agreeable if he could do it without loss of dignity however when antony had transacted his business and eaten his supper and bragged a little about his own performances of one sort and another he became a trifle ashamed of having behaved so roughly to his little brother he did not say so for few people have courage to make a public confession of their faults but he described with great animation how the workmen and the good sisters were busy in the church how bright everybody said the virgins blue mantle would be how there was real straw in the stable how charmingly natural the cattle and the donkey looked and how ingeniously a lamp would be arrangedjust like the star in factto shine above the manger peter felt satisfied again but he was still a little hurt so he sat quiet and rubbed cincinnatus head in silence though there were a hundred and one questions he was longing to ask you will come with us mon ami said susan lepage looking across at her husband who had just laid down his book and was wiping his spectacles with his red handkerchief your sons will take good care of you he answered as for me i will keep house it is the first time we take our little peter she said and there was a pleading tone in her voice the little boy loved both his father and mother though perhaps he loved his mother best for he was rather afraid of his father sometimes but now for some reason he grew very bold he jumped up and trotted across the kitchen and climbed up on his fathers knee oh it will be so beautiful he saidand we shall all be so happydo come father do come too master lepage looked at him very kindly out of his shrewd grey eyes and gently pinched his cheek illustration no no my son he answered go with your mother and your brothers these shows are admirable for pious women and for the young but you see i am no longer very young and they no longer greatly interest me those who think deeply upon politics and philosophy outgrow the satisfaction that others derive from such devout illusions every age has its appropriate pastimes go my children as for me i will remain at home read the newspaper and pursue my studies in ancient history cannot you think of something better than the doings of those unhappy old heathens for one day in the week mon ami asked his wife little peter looked up at her quickly she had laid aside her knitting and coming across the room placed her hand lightly on her husbands shoulder master lepage made a grimace moved a little in his chair and smiled goodhumouredly at her ah my dear you are the best of women he said then why will you not oblige me lepage pressed his lips together and put up his eyebrows there are points he said on which compliance would be a mere manifestation of weakness we will not discuss the situation about those small matters upon which we do not unfortunately quite agree it is wise to maintain silence there are your three sonsan escort worthy of a roman matron be contented then i remain at home susan lepage turned away and calling to eliza bade her clear the table indeed is it worth while it will be breakfast time directly replied eliza who was still in a bad temper at antony having been late for supper susan lepage looked up at the cuckoo clock in the corner it is late she said come come peter we will go upstairs it is long past your bedtime but the boy did not want to go to bed he felt a little disturbed and unhappy and wanted lepage more than ever to go with the rest of the family on sunday to church at nullepart so he rubbed his black head against his fathers shoulder coaxingly mother wants you to go and we all want it do please go with us to the church on sunday master lepage took the child and stood him down on the floor in front of him go to bed when you are told to he said obedience was a virtue greatly prized by those grand old romans illustration go to bed when you are told page out of the mouth of babes murmured susan lepage gently for some reason this observation appeared to incense her husband ten thousand plagues he burst out vehemently twenty thousand cutthroat prussians this is a conspiracy can i not stay at home when i please can i not sit peaceably in my own kitchen without cabals and flagrant acts of insubordination the rights of a husband and father are supreme and without limit i tell youread the domestic history of the ancient romans susan lepage waited till her husband had finished speaking and then taking poor frightened little peter by the hand she said calmly do not trouble your father any more my child he has his reasons for remaining at home and doubtless they are good ones perhaps it was a dreamfor peter was very tired and sleepy and it came to him when he was snugly tucked up in his little bed just before his mother put out the candle and left him alone with a faint glimmer of starlight coming in at the uncurtained window at the end of the room perhaps it was a dream but certainly he seemed to hear master lepages voice saying softly forgive me my wife i was over hasty your path appears to lie in one direction and mine in another at present but let us both be tolerant who knows but that they may yet meet in the end then someone stooped down over the little boys bed and kissed him yes it must have been his father for on his forehead he felt the rough scrape of a thick moustache chapter iii which improves our acquaintance with the grasshopper man i am going to nullepart on sunday cried little peter pfui what a traveller answered the charcoalburner and how do you go in a coach and four on the back of a fiery dragon in the giants sevenleague boots or flying through the air with the wild ducks there crying quack quack quack we are all going south because the snow is coming i shall walk of course like a big boy said little peter but the snow isnt coming just yet is it they all say it will be here in a day or two john paqualin shook his head and looked up at the sky he was sitting on the rough wooden bench set against the southern wall of his hut with his back bent and his elbows resting on his thin knees little peter climbed up on to the bench beside him it was rather difficult you see because the bench was a very high one to suit the length of the charcoalburners long legs who are they asked the boy as soon as he had settled himself comfortably he tried to lean forward with his elbows on his knees like his companion but his short legs were dangling and his feet were far off the ground and he did not find it altogether easy to keep his balance who are they he asked oh the earth spirits who live underground and the air spirits who wander up and down the sky look at the great arc of white light they are setting up in the northeast as a signal and the wild ducks flying overhead and the moaning in the pinetrees and madelon the old sow there see how she runs about with her mouth full of grass wanting to make herself a lair because she sees the stormwind coming they are all telling what will happen they are wiser than men they know beforehand men only know afterwards paqualin paused a moment and sat staring at madelon the old black sow with her floppety ears as she ran to and fro and grouted about in the heaps of charcoal refuse and in the tumbledown garden fencehalf smothered in tall withered grass and weedsgrunting and barking the while like one distracted everything in the world talks to me he continued speaking slowly all day long all night long the air is full of voices peter wriggled himself a little further back on the bench for in the excitement of conversation he had slipped very near the edge of it and was in great danger of falling head first on to the ground i dont hear them he said presently paqualin laughed his laugh was cracked and shrill like his voice and peter was always a trifle startled by it somehow never hear them little peter he cried never hear them a few men will call you a poet but most men will only call you mad if you do what is mad asked peter he felt very much interested is it a good or a bad thing the charcoalburner looked round at the boy sharply with his mouth a little open his strange eyes were glowing dull red he waited a minute before replying eh he said what an innocent why it is a good thing of course an excellent splendid glorious thing look at me little peter ill tell you a secret can you keep it herequite closeill whisperi am madyes thats the secret a grand one see all the blessings it brings me i live alone in the wood and burn charcoal yes said peter i should like that i have no wife or child to bother me on feastdays when i was a lad the pretty girls never plagued me to dance with them or asked me to steal kisses the charcoalburner laughed againi am saved from all sins of pride and vanity think what a gainfor as i go down the street the very children tell me my faults crying look at the grasshopper legs look at the crookback and the women shut their eyes and turn their heads away saying heaven avert the bad omen what a frightful fellow such observations little peter are sharp discipline and teach humility more thoroughly than any penance the priest can lay on you oh yes no doubt it is a capital thing to be mad it saves you a deal of troublenobody cares for you nurses you when youre sick feeds you when youre hungry mourns for you when you die paqualin laughed again and getting up stretched his long ungainly limbs and shook himself till his hair hung like a red cloud about his stooping shoulders ah ha its splendid he cried all alone with the spirits and voices with the beasts and the trees and the rain and the starlight no one to love you but the fire when you feed it with branches or the swine when you drive them back to their stye in the twilight now to tell the truth poor little peter was becoming rather confused and nervous with all this wild incomprehensible talk of the charcoalburners he had never seen his friend in this strange humour before and he felt as much alarmed and embarrassed as he would have done if that wellconducted animal cincinnatus had suddenly turned upon him with bristling hair and a great tail spitting and swearing in the middle of their innocent games of play he sat very still staring anxiously at his companion but when paqualin threw himself down on the bench again and putting his lean brown face very close to little peters said to him with a sort of cry think of it think of it child nobody day nor night all through the long years of life nobody ever to love youthe boys embarrassment changed into absolute fear and he scrambled down off the bench in a great hurry hardly able to keep from sobbing if you please john paqualin i should like to go home to my mother he said and then he trotted away as fast as he could along the black cinderpath across the little garden mother mother echoed the charcoalburner sweet fair wife and sweet mother have pity dear lord on those who may have neither then he got up and walked after the child in his awkward way calling gently to him here little mouse come here dont run away so fast there is nothing to hurt you peter had nearly reached the garden gate but there in the opening stood madelon the sow grunting and snorting her great jaws working and her wicked little eyes twinkling come come called paqualin again coaxingly there are no more disquieting secrets to tell you never fear see now i have a box of nuts indoors under my bedbeautiesbeauties will you try them crrrack go the shells out pop the nice kernelscrunch crunch crunch between sharp white little teeth eating them all up eh nuts are appetising are they you will not run away just yet then will you dear little mouse now peter would have felt a great deal safer at home it is true but in the first place there stood the hideous madelon blocking the way and he was very much afraid of her and then in the second place he did not wish to be uncivil to his old friend the charcoalburner so finally he went back and climbed up the high bench again i will not have any of those nuts though please he said decidedly for he wished paqualin to understand that it was not greediness but friendship that made him return no nuts cried the charcoalburner smiling kindly at him eh what a proud little soul and then john paqualin really became delightful and as he and the little boy sat together in the shelter of the high pinetrees and of the brown wooden wall of the tumbledown dwellinghouse behind them he told many most interesting stories for you see the charcoalburner perhaps from living so much alone perhaps from being what some persons call mad knew a number of things which you could not find in the pages of the very largest encyclopaedia of universal informationthough they really are every bit as true as half the information you would find there he knew all about the elves who live in the foxglove bells and the waternixies who haunt the stream side and about the gnomes who work with tiny spades and pickaxes searching for the precious metals underground and he could tell where the willofthewisp gets the light for his lantern with which he dances over bogs and marshy places trying to lead weakminded and unscientific travellers astray and he knew all about the pot of fairy gold that stands just where the base of the rainbow touches the earth and which moves away and away as you run to find it shifting its ground forever so that those who will seek it in the end come home hot and breathless and angry and empty handed for all their pains and he could also tell of the old black dwarf who lives in a cave in the heart of the forest which no one can ever find though they may search for it for a year and a day and who being a mischievous and illconditioned dwarf bewitches the cows so that they go dry and the hens so that they steal their nests and lay their eggs in all manner of holes and corners instead of in the henroosts like rightminded wellconducted fowls and who rides the horses all night long in the stable so that when the carter goes in in the dewy morning to give them their fodder he finds them trembling and starting and bathed in sweat and who turns the cream sour in summer or sits on the handle of the churnthough you cant see himso that though the good housewife turns and turns till her arms and back ache and the heat stands in drops on her forehead the butter will not come and the days work is wellnigh wasted and paqualin could tell the story moreover of the dirty little boy eli who insisted on eating raw turnips and cabbages and distressing his friends and relatives by picking bits out of the pig pail instead of sitting up to table like a little gentleman and who utterly refused to have his hair combed or his face washed and at last one night said the charcoalburner as a punishment for all his nasty ways the fairies came and turned him into a great black crow which flew out of the bedroom window in the chilly dawn you may often hear him now little peter croaking in the treetops or see him skulking about the farmyard and gardens looking out for scraps and refuse how long ago was he turned into a crow asked peter eh many and many a year ago answered the charcoalburner i saw him only yesterday and he has grown quite old and grey but the time of his probation will not be over yet awhile for bad habits are slow to die though quick enough to breed in us little peter i throw him a crust of bread now and again the poor old villain ive a sort of fellow feeling for him you see for i am an ugly old vagabond too bless the child there he is at last ah my poor heart how it beats with all this running the speaker was eliza she stood on the other side of the tumbledown garden fence with her hand pressed to her side and a shawl over her head she was breathing very hard eliza was one of those persons who like to make the most of an injury come home peter come at once she went on dont you know its half an hour past dinnertime here have i been trapesing half over the country to find youa pretty occupation for a respectable young servant woman like me too all the men were out and nothing would do but that i must go racing about like a wild creature wasting good shoe leather in looking for you ah my poor heart eliza leant up against the fence and panted a little as peter got down off the bench paqualin bent forward and patted the boys curly head run away little mouse he said but come again some day and see me am i to wait here all night cried eliza for you peter have you not had enough yet of the society of his highness the charcoalburner no no dont speak to me she added addressing paqualin i have no desire to hold any communication with you why merely seeing you as you pass makes me squint for an hour afterwards come along child illustration and seizing peters fat pudgy hand in her large red one eliza marched him off at a sharp pace down the forest path hey ho hey ho life is a bit long for some of us said the charcoalburner chapter iv which leaves some at home and takes some to church little peter woke up very early on sunday morning feeling excited and glad he sat up on end in bed but he had to rub his eyes very hard and get the sleep out of them before he could remember exactly what there was to be so very glad about when he did remember he was so much delighted that he was compelled to express his feelings in some rather violent manner he went on all fours and burrowed very quick like a rabbit head first down under the clothes to the bottom of the bed and then rushed up again with very red cheeks puffing and pushing his curly hair out of his eyes but it really was not light yetonly the rushlight his mother burnt at night glimmered feebly in the corner peter could hear master lepage snoring peacefully in his bed on the other side of the wooden partition which divided the big room into two unequal halvesthe small half for little peter and his little bed and the large half for his father and mother and their large bed it would be a long while yet before his mother got up and called him to her to help dress and wash him for gustavus the cowherd had only just gone downstairs from his attic clumpetyclump with his big heavy boots over the stairs and he always got up long before anybody else peter wondered what he could do to amuse himself till it was time to dress and then it struck him as just possible that when gustavus went down into the kitchen he might have left the door open and that in that case cincinnatus the cat might have stepped upstairs and be waiting outside on the landingit had happened so once before on a very delightful and never to be forgotten occasion peter waited a moment and held his breath listening for it seemed to him extremely adventurous to be on the move so very early in the morning he was not quite sure whether the little hairy housebogies and hobgoblins who undoubtedly so eliza said at least wander about the empty rooms and chase each other up and down the silent passages and stairways every night with impish frolic and laughter when we are all safe in bed might not still be holding their revels and he knew at least eliza said so that it was extremely unlucky for any person to see them for they dont like to be looked at by mortal eyes and will come and sit on your pillow and tickle your nose with a feather out of the bedding and squat on your chest till you feel as though you lay under the weight of a mountain and treat you in a number of other odious and disturbing ways it made the cold shivers run down peters back as he sat up there in his little white nightshirt even to think of coming face to face with the hairy goblins and bogies but then on the other hand the society of cincinnatus would be so very delightful peter slipped one sturdy bare leg down over the side of the bed ah how cold the smooth boards of the floor felt however the other leg very soon followed then he crept across the room very quietly avoiding the oak chest and the chairs and the corner of the high cupboard with his mothers initials and the date of her weddingday carved on the doors of it and when he reached the door paused listening at the keyhole oh dear me there really was something outside on the landing moving about stealthily on small soft feet little peters heart stood still was it dear old cincinnatus or a dreadful roundabout hairy hobgoblin at last he plucked up courage to put his lips close to the keyhole and whisper in a rather trembling voice pussy puss cincinnatus oh please is that you miau answered cincinnatus quite composedly and comfortably in a great hurry little peter opened a crack of the door oh come in quick please cincinnatus he said illustration oh come in quick please cincinnatus but cats of quality never permit themselves to be hurried cincinnatus came just halfway through the door then he stopped and rubbed himselfvery tallup against the sidepost and purred and then stretching out his fore legs as far as ever he could sharpened his claws crick crack crick crack on the boards of the bedroom flooring oh do be quick cincinnatus said the little boy under his breath again and to hasten matters he gave the cat a poke in the ribs with his cold bare toes miau cried cincinnatus quite sharply jumping on one side for he was taken rather by surprise subsequently he added in the cat languagemanners my good child manners let us before all things cultivate a polite address and a calm unagitated exterior meanwhile peter had succeeded in shutting the door quietly and that to his great relief without catching a single glimpse of one of the blobbetybodied spindlelegged housebogies he pattered across the room as fast as ever he could and jumped into his warm bed again he is young and inexperienced murmured cincinnatus reflectively i am magnanimous i scorn to bear malice and he too jumped into the warm bed now this was really charming little peter pushed up the bedclothes in front making them into a snug little dark cavern inside which there was just room enough for himself and cincinnatus see he said we will play at robbers i will be the captain and you shall be my first lieutenant but unfortunately cincinnatus did not seem to care very much about that particular game he had arrived at an age and temper of mind at which material comfort is far more valuable than pleasures derived from a lively exercise of the imagination perhaps you do not quite understand what that means well so much the better for my part i hope you never may understand it there are a number of things in this world that it is very much the best to be ignorant about if you can possibly manage it cincinnatus anyway understood it well enough so he tucked his fore legs under his chest until nothing was visible of them but just the furry elbows and laid his tail neatly along his soft side and settled himself down on the warm sheet with his eyes more than half shut purring all the while as loud as if he had got a small steamengine inside him thats not the way to play at robbers said little peter but cincinnatus only purred a trifle louder it was rather provoking still peter was too glad of the cats comfortable company and was moreover really too sweettempered a boy to get cross and angry so he just lay down on his stomach resting his chin in one hand while with the other he gently rubbed cincinnatus about the ears and amused himself by thinking of the nice new clothes that lay folded up on the chair at the bottom of his bed and of the representation of the stable and the manger in which the infant saviour was cradled that he hoped to see in the great church in the town before the day was done and meanwhile the pale dawn broadened over the dark stretches of the great pine forest and the cows lowed as gustavus drove them out to pasture and eliza bustled down stairs to begin dusting and sweeping and making ready the savoury sunday breakfast and at last his mother with her sweet pale face got up and washed and dressed him listening as tenderly as only mothers know how to his happy prattle and his simple morning prayer ask the dear lord to send a special blessing to us all today she said may i ask him to send a blessing to my friend john paqualin too asked peter he told me yesterday he should never have anybody to love him and that it saved him a great deal of trouble but he doesnt look as if it made him happy does he mother alas no poor soul said susan lepage yes pray for him also little one pray that the long disgrace and lonely sorrow of his life here may be counted unto him for righteousness hereafter and i will say amen it must have been quite halfpast eight oclock before they were all ready to start for nullepart eliza was going too you see and she was furiously busy up to the very last moment consequently she was rather late and rushed out of the house after the rest of the party pinning her blue shawl and giving sundry pats to the crown of her stiff white muslin cap to make sure it sat quite straight over her plaits of hair behind eh but you are smart eliza said gustavus opening his eyes very wide as he rested the two pails of water he was carrying on the ground for a moment and rubbed his elbows which ached a little with the weight imbecile do not detain me cried eliza haughtilythough in truth she was prodigiously gratified by the cowherds observation dont you see how breathless and flurried i am with all the work bless me wheres my prayerbook oh thank you yes gustavus tied up in my pockethandkerchief of coursei knew where it wasat least i should have found out for myself directly goodbye gustavus take care of yourself and remember the evenings milk is to be set on the lefthand shelf two from the bottom eliza pursed up her mouth and nodded as she walked away with a very impressive swinging of petticoats poor young man his head is completely turned she said to herself but then what wonder my appearance in my fete day clothes has always been a subject of remark and respectful admiration farewell my wife enjoy to the full the emotions called forth by the pious exhibition you are about to witness they are becoming to your sex boys take good care of your mother and conduct yourselves in all things as worthy sons of our glorious republic master lepage raised his soft felt hat from his head as he spoke with an elegant flourish but whether in compliment to his wife or in honour of the democratic form of government i really cannot say at that moment the charcoalburner came hurriedly from the narrow forest path that led from his hut on to the open space outside the farmhouse madelon the sow ran beside him shaking her lean sides as she ran and grunting now and then apparently with pleasure at being taken out walking sometimes she bundled up against her masters long thin legs nearly knocking him over sometimes she stopped and forced her ugly snout into a tuft of grass or weeds by the wayside the charcoalburners red hair streamed out behind him as he came rapidly along his strange eyes were dull and vacant as those of a sleepwalker i have a message he cried hoarselya message to you from the beasts and the birds from the pinetrees and the stormclouds and the voices all night long they have told it me over and over again paqualin a wild ragged unkempt figure came up close to master lepage who stood there erect and superior as a general officer on parade surrounded with his family and servantsgustavus had left his pails of water and joined the little companyin their sunday best and all animated with pleasant expectation of a holiday in which amusement promised to be agreeably mingled with spiritual edification well well out with it quickly then my good fellow this wonderful message of yours lepage said in a bantering patronising tone you see my wife and my sons here are just ready to start on a long walk i cannot have them delayed they must not go or you must go with them cried the charcoalburner he stretched out his hands like a man in the dark groping for something he cannot find my head is troubled he went on i cannot tell you plainly but i have an aching in all my bones which foretells misfortune and i say they must not go pooh said lepage your head is troubled just so but when peoples heads are troubled they had best keep at home and not trouble their neighbours into the bargain with all their crazy fancies calm yourself paqualin and as for you added lepage nodding encouragingly to his wife and the boys forward march do not let this untoward little incident affect the pleasures of the day but susan lepage looked kindly and compassionately at the charcoalburner and then turning to her husband said have a moments patience with him mon ami let us at least hear what he has to say yes give me time cried paqualin imploringly there are so many of you staring at meah i begin to remember you must go with them if they go for the snow is coming master lepage the storm hung out its streaming white flag in the northeast yesterday and the wild ducks flew south there were signs in the earth and in the heavens and in my ears the sound of many voices do not let your wife and children go the snow will be here before evening and the way will be difficult to find and the house door will stand open long into the night before the feet of those you love cross the threshold the charcoalburner spoke as though he was so certain of the truth of that which he said and his voice sounded so sad that poor little peter felt quite dismayed even eliza had no opprobrious observation to make and as for gustavus he stood with his big mouth wide open staring as if he saw a ghost master lepage however remained quite unmoved and his composure was very reassuring well well my good fellow he said i for one need no further proof that your head is very much troubled so much so indeed that if i had my way you should find a lodging for a time in the maison dieu at nullepartan excellent institution which is calculated to cure troubled heads or at all events to restrain the possessors of them from being inconvenient to other people but the worst of it is lepage added rather angrily that this superstitious nonsense is infectious you for instance my wife begin to look quite disconcerted lepage folded his arms and nodded his head argumentatively quite as though he had been addressing an audience in the wine shop now i put it to you he said the day is mild and even sunshiny at present and which pray is likely to be the best weather prophet i francis louis lepage householder citizen veteran and i may add philosophicpolitician and student of ancient history or that poor halfwitunsound as anyone can see both in mind and body of course the grasshoppers afraid of the snow chimed in antony switching at madelon the sow with the little stick he held in his hand it puts his fiddle out of tune then antony laughed rather loud as people do sometimes when they have made a joke they are not sure is a very good one for shame antony said his mother quickly and john paqualin turned on the lad his eyes glowing like live coals ah it is noble and generous in a handsome fellow like you to taunt me and scoff at me heaven pay you back in your own coin eliza gave a scream and seized gustavus by the arm as though she required protection from some most fearful danger for the love of the saints maam let us go on and get out of the way of this wild animal she said in a very loud whisper he looks wicked enough to commit a crime keep off gustavus what are you thinking about catching hold like that of a respectable young servant woman why it was you who caught hold of me eliza answered the cowherd mildly paqualin meanwhile looked round the little group with a sort of despair in his poor ugly face it is all useless he said you will not listen to or believe me i only get jeered at you all despise me illustration you all despise me page he turned away with a bitter cry and shambled off into the forest goodbye dear john paqualin goodbyeno i wont hush eliza i love him he is a very kind friend to megoodbye dear john paqualin little peter called after him he felt very very sorry for the poor charcoalburner whoof went madelon the sow making a run at cincinnatuswho sat washing his face on the clean flags just outside the door of the farmhouseand taking him so by surprise that he leapt up with a prodigious tail on to the window ledge without even waiting to scratch then she cantered off grunting and shaking her great bristly floppety ears after her master next time i see the charcoalburner it will undoubtedly be my duty to spit at him said cincinnatus to himself in the catlanguage after that which has just occurred i feel it is quite unnecessary to take any second opinion upon the subject forward march cried master lepage gaily enjoy yourselves let no thought of that unfortunate beings prognostications disturb you the day will be charming and so after all they started for nullepart chapter v which is both social and religious now undoubtedly it is extremely easy to most persons not to believe a thing if they do not wish to believe it and very soon our friends wending their way along the soft moist forest path in the languid december sunshine began to forget about john paqualin and his alarming warning it was all spite said eliza tossing her head white muslin cap and all with a great show of dignity he hates me because i wont receive his advances and always keep him at a proper distance it was just a trick to deprive a poor hardworking young woman of a wellearned holiday i think he was wrong about the weather remarked paul quietly its generally colder before snow he ought to be shut up in the madhouse as my father suggested said antony who was still smarting from the reproof his mother had given him id have all those sort of fellows kept under lock and key there ought to be a law about it theyve no right to be about loose you are young my son said susan lepage and the young too often are thoughtless and cruel perhaps life will teach you among other lessons to be merciful if you would obtain mercy antonys handsome face grew very sulky youre always scolding me for something or other he said crossly illustration meanwhile our little peter was very happy he had been sorry for the charcoalburner it is true but he would have been very much more sorry not to go to nullepart a light breeze ruffled the dark branches of the pinetrees here and there a scarlet or yellow leaf still hung on the brambles that grew on the skirts of the wood the little birds looked at him merrily with their round bright eyes as they flew chirping to and fro among the trees and bushes as to the snow peter did not give it a thought as he ran just like a little dog first a long way on in front of the rest of the party and then dawdled ever so far behind themlooking at the quaint little huts and houses and castles that the pine needles make where they fall and gather on the small twigs and branches at the base of the younger trees and then seeing that his mother and brothers had got on a long way ahead of him scuttled up to them again in a great fuss and hurry with very red cheeks and a curious bumping at his heart what with excitement and exercise and just a trifle of fright too lest the old dwarf whom john paqualin had told him about should suddenly nod and grin at him from under the pine boughs saying hey my fine fellow so weve met at last but i suppose the black dwarf was plotting mischief at home within the recesses of his mysterious cavern on that particular sunday morning for though he kept a very sharp lookout little peter saw no trace of his naughty mocking face even where the path was narrowest and the pinetrees thickest now the town of nullepart is an exceedingly ancient place as you will gather from its name if you are anything of a scholar it lies down in a remote valley along the banks of a river with hills on either hand clothed below with oak and beech chestnut and walnut and at their summits crowned with pinetrees that make a dark ragged sawlike edge against the sky some of the houses in the main street are built of stone and roofed with fine red fluted tiles but the major part of them are of wood like the farmhouse in the forest with deep eaves and quaint gables and stairways and galleries and i am sorry to say that the good people of nullepart are somewhat oldfashioned in their habits and do not pay quite as strict a regard to cleanliness as might be desired and permit their ducks and chickens and pigs to walk about the crooked streets along with the footpassengers in rather too friendly and confidential a manner illustration going to church page but little peter never having seen any other town thought nullepart a very fine place indeed and quite believed that nowhere else in the world were there such grand houses or such inviting shops or so many people or half so much chatter and bustle you see the justice of our opinions is very much dependent upon the extent of our experiencea fact which few persons always manage to bear in mind at least where their own opinions are concernedwith the opinions of their neighbours it is of course different little peter clung rather tight to his mothers hand on one side and to his brother pauls on the other for he was somewhat afraid of being lost in the crowd and never found again antony did not offer to hold the little boys hand he walked on the other side of his mother with his cap set jauntily over one ear and his handsome face all smiles again he nodded and said goodday to all his acquaintances and stared hard at all the pretty girls when he passed them as a young man should who has a good opinion of himself and who intends some day to be a soldier but if little peter thought nullepart street dangerously full of people what did he think when passing under the carved porch and pushing aside the heavy leathern curtain that hung across the doorway he entered the church itself still clinging tightly to his mothers hand he could see nothing but trousers and petticoats the broad backs of men and the comfortable backs of womenit would be uncivil to call them broad too you know you should select your adjectives carefully in speaking of ladiesand the straight backs of lads and the slim neat backs of young girls all around him while the close heavy air of the church was full of the hum of many voices and the shuffling of many feet over the stone pavement ouf how hot said eliza in a loud whisper unpinning her blue shawl heaven forgive me but its like being in a saucepan with the lid on why theres my cousin ursula jacqueline lambert ah my dear cousin how have you been this long while yes it is seldom we meet and time passes and leaves its mark behind it not that i change muchno the saints be praised i keep my looks but i see you have altered well it cannot be helped your husband is a good faithful soul and i daresay he doesnt observe it theres the advantage of having married an old man his eyes grow dim just in timenow with me but peter did not hear any more of elizas conversation for his mother moved forward into the middle of the nave of the church from whence it was possible to see the high altar with its lights and flowers and the great picture behind it of which the people of nullepart are very proud for it was painted by a famous artist and is worth a great deal of money and is moreover so dark with age and perhaps with a proportion of dirt as well that it affords an immense amount of interesting conversation as nobody has ever yet discovered what subject it represents priests in rich vestments stood before the altar their backs looking like those of great gold and silver beetles and there were boys with tall candles and boys chanting and the plaintive sound of the organ and many persons kneeling on low chairs or on the rough pavement saying their prayers susan lepage knelt down too and little peter stood bareheaded close beside her the church somehow seemed very different to what he had expected it was very large and high and the painted windows up in the roof let in but scanty light it seemed to peter a very mysterious place and he felt a wee bit frightened at last susan rose again from her knees now for thy pleasure little one she said looking lovingly at the child where is the stable antony it is there he answered pointing to the southern aisle of the church ive just been to see but the crowd is so thick about it we must wait awhilewe cant get through yet susan lepage sat down on one of the low rushbottomed chairs and took peter on her lap all in good time she said antony will let us know when to be moving meanwhile we will rest your poor little legs must be tired presently a stout geniallooking old gentleman in a black cassock and funny little black cape came up to them he wore a black skullcap too for the church was draughty and his head was bald save just at the back where his short bristly white hair stood out like a neat trimming round the edge of his cap well well susan lepage it isnt often that we see you here now he said dont move dont move my good woman ah yes i know the walk is long and fatiguing you would come oftener if you could the spirit is willing as it is written but the flesh is weak yet you do well to come today and bring these fine lads your sons with you the good god remembers those who remember him but where is the husband illustration peter looked at his mother as the priest asked this question and it seemed to him that for some reason she seemed troubled and sad ah my father he has remained at home to keep house we live as you know in a lonely place the priest smiled and shook his head exactly he said i understand politics have a word to say in the matter though havent they but susan lepage did not smile in return alas my father she said peter stared at both speakers wonderingly he did not understand what they meant but then it must be admitted there are a good many things we do not quite understand at five years old do not vex yourself answered the priest kindly it is written that the faithful wife may save her husband all times are in the hands of god that which he has ordained cannot fail to be accomplished then he laid his hand gently on little peters round black head saying and this is your youngest the autumn child who brings the blessing to the house yes she said he has come for the first time to burn a candle before the infant jesus but the worshippers are so many that as yet we have been unable to get a sight of the stable just then eliza bustled up ah she exclaimed one thing is certain my poor cousins temper is sadly soured with age i made myself agreeable to her in the assurance that she would at least ask me in to dinnerforgive me your reverence i did not observe that you were conversing with my mistresseliza curtsied to the priestbut not a bit of it she has treated me with marked coldness and not so much as hinted at an invitation it seems to me my daughter said the priest lower your voice we do not discuss these things so shrilly in this sacred place turn your thoughts to religion think here of your own sins not of the shortcomings of others eliza got very red in the face believe me i was not thinking of myself your reverence she answered quickly but of my mistress i wished to save her the expense of my dinner at the inn by dining with my relationswe ought to be going to the red horse soon maam she added or there will be no room for us oh but i havent seen the stable yet cried little peter quite out loud forgetting that he was in church i dont want any dinner but i cant go home till i have seen the stable please the little boy had jumped down off his mothers lap and stood there with the big tears in his eyes and with the corners of his mouth quivering it seemed to him a terrible thing to have come this long way full of expectation and hope and then to be disappointed after all but the priest took his hand kindly and led him towards the southern aisle of the church where the crowd was while susan lepage and paul and antony followed behind them room my friends have the amiability to make room said the priest for a little lad who comes from a considerable distance to see this pious and instructive representation for the first time then little peter felt quite proud and distinguished for the people at the request of the priest moved aside to the right hand and the left making a narrow lane for him to pass along to the gilded railings in front of the chapel where the stable was dressed once there he stood quite still staring with very round eyes for the sight seemed to him very beautiful and strange and his heart was filled with wonder and awe in a rough rocky cave on the straw in a wooden manger lay the image of the infant jesus wrapped in swaddling clothes with a golden circle above his baby head on one side knelt the virgin mother in a white robe and blue mantle with her hands clasped meekly on her heart and as she bent towards her babe she seemed to little peter to look at him with mild and loving eyes on the other side stood st joseph in a brown habit leaning upon his staff and in the dusky background the boy could just make out the form of an ass and some cows while above the entrance of the cave shone a bright star ah how beautiful said susan lepage softly it should have been finer had we had more money answered the priest with a sigh not that i complain the parish has been generous and the good sisters have done their best still i myself greatly desired to have the three kings offering treasures it would have been an effective incidentbut our means are limited they would have been too expensive for us and little peter was puzzled and could not quite comprehend what the priest meant for he had often heard his father say that kings were oldfashioned rubbish worth nothing at all and that a republic was worth ten thousand of them any day in the week kneel down my son said the priest to peter presentlyand pray to be kept pure and innocent and devout so that when your earthly warfare is accomplishedbe it late or soonyou may behold the face of the saviour in heaven as you now behold this poor unworthy image of him on earth then he turned and left them each of the boys bought a candle from the old woman who sat on the chapel steps and stuck them in the round iron frame standing just by the gilded rails and lighted them with the long taper she gave them and eliza bought one too though she was a little disposed to haggle with the old woman and accuse her of overcharging but susan lepage bought three candles and set them in the frame and lighted them for she said we must remember those who are absentwhether by choice or by misfortunewhen we are in the house of god illustration chapter vi which attempts to show why the skies fall do you know what the snow is and where it comes from the dictionary says it is a frozen moisture which falls from the atmosphere in white flakes but that description doesnt seem to make us know very much more about it somehow some people say the snow is caused by the angels shaking the feather beds up in heaven but that both scientifically and spiritually too appears to me an improbable solution other people again say it is all the time spirit plucking his geese and who are the time spirits geesewell if you really want to know they are all the little poets and little painters and little musicians and little players and all the little inventors of little theories and little writers of little books who spend their time in diligently trying to persuade themselves and others that they are great writers of great books and discoverers of a universal panacea for the healing of the nations and that in short they are not any of them geese at all but as fine swans as you can see on any river or pond in the three kingdoms and they come cackling and hissing and sidling and waddling up to the time spirit every yearspecially in the spring and about christmastidein great flocks and all cry out together is it possible to deny o time spirit that we are every one of us swans and then i am sorry to sayfor though it is perfectly right and just it isnt the least bit agreeable as some of us know to our costthe time spirit turns up his sleeves and sets to work with a will and catches them though they mostly make a terrible noise and fluster and plucks them one by onebig feathers first and then smalland sends them away looking sadly bare and foolish and thereby leaving the world in no doubt whatsoever that they are only geese after all and some wise persons who have a perfect right to speak on the matter think that why we have had so much more snow than usual the last few winters is becausewhat with higher education and womens colleges and one thing and anotherthe flocks of geese grow larger and larger so that the poor time spirit is getting worn to fiddle strings with everlasting plucking and it seems not unlikely we may soon have snowstorms nine months in the year but what if a real swan does come among the geese once in a wayah that is quite another matter for the time spirit discovers it in a very few minutes and jumps up and pulls down his sleeves and slips off his hathe has to wear one you know to keep the goose down from lodging in his hairand draws his heels together with a snap and makes a bow from the waist like an accomplished courtier and says all hail to you my master or my mistressas the case may befor you the stars shine by night and the sun rises at morning all the world is yours or shall soon be if you have patience and faith and daring and are true to the voice of the daemon within but there is yet another explanation of the snowfall besides this and it is perhaps after all the most reasonable one to believe in for when the nights are long and the days are short and the sunlight is feeble as a sick mans smile the north wind wakes from his summer sleep and calls to his brother the east wind and they go forth over the earth driving the heavyladen snowclouds before them and the pale snowfairies who do their will down from the ice floes and the dim silent polar wastes over land and sea with a shout like the roar of a battle and a laugh like the crackle of thunder while the hills grow white with fear under his tread and the forests bow themselves and shriek in his fierce breath as the planks and rigging of a ship shriek in a storm at sea the north wind comes he was born hundreds of thousands of years ago in the ice age when the glaciers crawled out from the heart of the mountains milelong greygreen monsters over what are now fertile meadows and sunny plainsbefore man or beast so vigorous was the keentoothed frost roamed over the surface of the earth his eyes are blue and clear and they dance as you may see the sky dance on a sharp winters night and his white beard hangs low on his chest which is broad and firm as a hillside and he is in the full vigour of a lusty manhood still and it promises to be a very long while yet before his eye grows dim or his limbs grow weak with age some think indeed that as he saw man first born into the world he may live to see him die off it againto see this great ball which so long has been our human dwellingplace and home rolling silent out into immeasurable space a dead planet locked in the arms of everlasting frost but be that as it may on the fair sunday morning when our friend little peter his mother and brothers and eliza were going through the pine forest to the church at nullepart the north wind was up and walking southward southward over europe with the great grey snowclouds hurrying on before for he had hard work to do and as the day wore on he gathered the clouds from east and west and packed them together in a vast dusky mass over the town and the forest and the limestone crags and gorges and the wide flat meadows where the cows pasture in summer and over little peters home and then he bade the snowfairies bestir themselves and prick the clouds as full of holes as the top of a flourdredge and wrap all the country in a robe of spotless white now it happened that among the snowfairies there was one who was very young and tenderhearted indeed she was not really a snowfairy at all but a child of the soft south wind who when all her sisters flew awayas the swallows fly in autumnto the tropics overslept herself and got left behind by mistake and she had joined the snowfairies because she was dull and lonely and could find no other playfellows and nothing to do but for all that she did not care to help them in their work for she had not been brought up to it you see and it seemed to her a sad chilly business so instead of laughing and playing and flitting about and easing the great lumbering clouds of their burden she sat down by herself in a hollow of one of them and cried and cried for she could not help thinking of all the sheep on lonely hillsides and of the small birds seeking food and finding none in the snowburied fields and lanes and hedges and of little neglected children of whom alas there are always so many in bare cottage or dreary city cellar with no warm clothes or food or firing and of wayfarers on barren heaths and bleak moors and of the beggars and vagabonds and outcasts the sorry throng of refuse humanity that tramps the high roads of every country of the civilised world with neither home nor hope nor money and as she thought of their frostnipped hands and bleeding feet and scanty rags she cried as if her little heart would break but the snowfairies were vexed with her and scolded and flouted her for it is as you all know a great nuisance to have somebody crying and sobbing and making a fuss when you yourselves feel quite happy and comfortable and at last in their irritation against her they made such a noise and clamour and so pushed and plagued and hustled the poor little creature that the squabbling and commotion reached the ears of the north wind himself and he asked what in the name of commonsense was the matter then the snowfairies all pointed at her and all began chattering at once as you may hear a flock of starlings chattering in the tops of the beeches at sunset on a mild march day but the north wind told them to go about their business and he took up the little fairy and stood her in the hollow of his great hand and asked her quite gentlyfor the stronger a man is the gentler he can be as you will very likely find out some fine daywhy she was so sad then though she was horribly frightened and blushed up to the tips of her pretty ears as a modest young maiden should she looked the great north wind bravely in the face and told him her little storyhow she had been left behind how she loved the sunshine and the summer and how she grieved for the misery and famine that winter brings too often on man and bird and beast and i dont see why it should all happen she said or why there cannot be summer all the year still though she spoke up so courageously the poor little fairy trembled for she thought that the north wind would be angry as the snowfairies had been and that he might crush her tiny life into nothingness in the grasp of his great hand but the north wind did nothing of the kind he looked at her till his clear dancing eyes grew dim and misty and when at last he spoke his voice was low and sweet and sad as church bells that the sailor hears far out at sea as he sails at evening in sight of some fair foreign coast ah my child he said all those who have once been happy young and old wise and foolish mortal and immortal mighty princes prophets psalmists all living creatures nay the very earth herself all that my eyes have looked on through unnumbered centuries have asked and still ask that question in some form or other but the answer is not granted yet and so knowing that till the end it may not be told us we grow humble and grow wise and learn that it is best to do the work that is appointed us without doubt or hesitation careless whether it be known or unknown pleasant or unpleasant hard or soft kind or cruel even so that we get it well and honestly done as for you you have lost your way and have wandered from the business set for you to do and therefore you are filled with sadness and fears and questionings but have patience for a while and have faith too that the mysterious purposes of the almighty your master and mine will certainly be made plain at lastmeanwhile go and help your cousins the snowfairies and then because though you are honest and brave you still are frail and tender when the night of my winter reign is over i will give you back into the keeping of my kinsman the south wind who will find less sharp and cutting work for you to do and all this though you may not at first see exactly how has a great deal to do with the story of our friend little peter and therefore even at the risk of your thinking it somewhat dry and puzzling it has seemed to me well to set it down for you to read here chapter vii which describes a pleasant dinnerparty and an unpleasant walk for when little peter and his mother and brothers came out of the church at nullepart the sun had been hidden some time behind thick clouds fierce gusts of wind rushed down the street blowing off hats and blowing about petticoats and making windowshutters rattle and doors slam make haste children make haste cried susan lepage we must get our dinner at the red horse and start homewards as quickly as we can oh i have been hearing something so terrible said eliza to her mistress as she came down the church steps not that i am surprised at itno no no i have always suspected it i am sure his appearance this morning was enough to confirm ones worst suspicions eliza pursed up her lips and shook her head with an air of extreme wisdom they do say that paqualin is a wizard she went on take care peter if you look one way and walk another you will unquestionably tumble down and you neednt stare at me so i wasnt talking to youjoseph berri the watchmakers brother has just been telling me all about it there is no doubt he overlooked one of miller georgeons draught oxen three years ago so that it would not eat and grew daily thinner and thinner and had at last to be killedgo on peter your ears will grow as long as a donkeys if you are always listening like thatand they do say he can call up evil spirits and storms and thunder and lightning and whirlwinds when he wants them for his own vicious purposes nonsense eliza nonsense said susan lepage you are far too willing to listen to idle illnatured tales eliza sighed profoundly and turned up her eyes ah she murmured some day maam you will see who was in the right and give credit where it is due for my part if it does snow today i shall know what to think make haste children said susan lepage again the time draws on and we have no time to waste but it was not so easy to make haste the large diningroom of the red horse with its tall whitecurtained windows was crowded from up the valley and down the valley in their long narrow country cartsfor all the world like teatrays set on four wheelswith cracking whips and jangling bells or on foot from lonely hamlets in the forest or solitary herdsmens huts on the steep grass slopes beneath the grey limestone cliffs and crags all the inhabitants of the district had gathered to attend the church and see the show and spend a merry sunday and among all these good people were many friends of susan lepage who detained her with greetings and questions then too the places at the tables were already taken and it was some time before the boys and their mother could get seats even so little peter had to squeeze himself into a very small space between madame georgeonthe stout comely wife of monsieur georgeon the miller at oudoncand his mother but little peter thought it all delightful though he was rather pinched as to elbowroom he liked the rattle of the knives and forks and the many voices and the talk and laughter and watched with great curiosity the active servingmaids balancing in their handsand indeed all up their arms too so it seemedan incredible number of plates and dishes even the floor sprinkled with sawdust and the not altogether spotless tablecloth were interesting for it was all new you see to little peter and even things not very nice in themselves are charming when they are new then too peter was very hungry and though madame georgeons full skirts overflowed his small legs and her handsome shawl thrown gracefully back from her shouldersthe room was warm what with the great china stove in the corner and all the companyand though her shawl i say enveloped him entirely now and then in a cloud of many coloured cashmere the millers wife was very kind and coaxed and petted him and piled up his plate with all manner of dainty things eh par exemple she said smiling and nodding at him as she sipped her glass of red wineit is not every day we go into society is it to meet old friends and make new ones you susan lepage from a child were of a serious turn of mind that is an excellent thing too no doubt it secures the future but the present should not be despised either the members of my familythe saints be praisedhave ever possessed a little grain of gaiety in their composition for my part i think it is only economical to make the most of this world while you are permitted to be in it and i regard it as an actual impiety to neglect any opportunity of innocent entertainment eat my child eat thena spoonful or so more of this admirable pastry see on my plate here i was provident when the dish came round and secured a double portion then turning she smiled at susan lepage again do not alarm yourself it will not injure him he will walk it off exercise is a fine thing to prevent food lying heavy on the stomach perhaps moderation is a finer one still answered the other gently but are you not ready my sons we must not linger though you in your kindness would tempt us to do so good madame georgeon we do not drive home by the high road as you do but go on foot through the forest and the days are shortantony we should surely be moving but antony was in no haste to be going for he too was making the most of this opportunity of innocent enjoyment he sat beside marie georgeon the millers pretty daughter who certainly took after her mothers family in respect of gaiety and clean glasses being somewhat scarce at the red horse from the unusual number of guests it happened that she and antony shared one and her brown eyes were as full of mischief as a may morning is full of sunshine as she glanced up at him over the rim of it and laughed and talked and fingered the gold and garnet necklace that fitted so neatly about her throat and what with her pretty looks and merry words the young fellows head was completely turnedand if you do not quite understand what that means you need only wait a little for you are bound to find out clearly enough some day and as the inevitable consequence of his head being turned he hardly heard his mother when she spoke to him and made no haste in the world to finish his dinner and loitered and dawdled about upon one excuse and another as long as possible and i am sorry to say spoke quite snappishly to his brother paul when the latter pointed out to him that the clock had struck three already and that it was high time to be going you see it is just as well not to understandby experience anyhowwhat it is to have your head turned since it leads to these deplorable errors both of manners and conduct so it fell out that when at last our friends left the jovial company at the red horse and came out from the steaming diningroom into the street the snowfairies had already been some halfhour at work and the roadway and houseroofs were all lightly powdered with snow to little peter warm with his dinner this seemed the crowning piece of fun of a glorious day he could hardly get along for turning to look at the marks his nailed boots made in the snow but susan lepage thought very differently she glanced up at the dull clouded sky and remembered the sad words of john paqualin the charcoalburner that everyone had treated so lightly some few hours ago will it last do you think she asked of antony antony however was still thinking of pretty marie georgeon with whom he had shared the kernel of a double almond at parting both wishing as they eat it he was wishing his wish still and it was such an agreeable one that he felt quite superior to all inconvenient incidents in the way of snowstorms and such likehe cocked his cap more on one side than ever and assumed quite a patronising air even towards his mother which to say the least was very silly of him it may last or it may not he answered but really it doesnt very much matter i wish that your father was with us added susan why cried antony he couldnt stop it snowing any more than i can and pray remember mother that this isnt by any means the first time i have walked home from nullepart in bad weather i believe i could find my way back blindfold or at midnight for that matter i am not at all troubled about you my son replied his mother quietly but about our poor little peter here with his little short legs oh peter will do well enough said the lad impatiently some find it difficult to make room in their hearts for more than one person at a time you know and antonys heart was still pretty well occupied by marie georgeon he walked along briskly humming the tune of partant pour la syrie which is a song about a young soldier who was pious as well as brave and a lucky fellow into the bargain for when he came back from the war he married his master the counts daughter and lived happily ever after never mind mother said paul if the snow is deep or peter is tired i can carry him pickaback hes not very heavy you know i shant be tired i like the snow cried little peter and he clapped his hands and pranced about till elizawho was still rather cross because her cousin had neglected to invite her to dinnercaught hold of him and made him walk soberly if you laugh so now there will be tears before night she said laugh at breakfast cry at dinner laugh at dinner cry at suppertime ah dear me this cold wind i wish i had thought to put some wool in my earsi shall be martyred with the toothache so they passed down the main street it was almost deserted now for the storm had driven people to take shelter in the wine shops or which was far wiser in their own houses even the pigs had gone to their styes and the fowls to their roosts and the goats with their little tinkling bells were safe housed too in their sheds munching the dry brown hay that in the summertime had waved as green grass full of a rainbow of flowers they passed by the smaller houses and outbuildings and the great sawmills where the pine logs from the mountains are cut up that stand along the bank of the swift river and crossed the bridge with the dark water rushing underneath and began climbing the road that zigzags up the long hill between the great bare walnuttrees and stubble fields and wild rocky pastures to the edge of the pine forestfour tall straight figures and one short roundabout one showing black against the everdeepening snow illustration for alas the snow was falling thicker and thickerhere in the open it was already up to the second lacehole of little peters bootsscurrying and racing in wild confusion before the icy breath of the north wind twisting and twirling and dancing clinging to grass blade and bush and branch and tree stem hiding the road so that you could no longer see the margin of it covering the wheel tracks and marks of the horse hoofs filling up hollows under the grey rocks and boulders and blurring the jagged outline of the pinetrees where they rise against the sky hundreds of thousands of white hurrying flakes soft silent multitudes filling the air as far as eye could see there was no fun now in turning round to look at the marks of his nailed boots for peter found the snow hid them again almost as soon as they were made and it was hard work too struggling up the steep hill and battling with the wind still the little fellow trudged along without making any complaint for you see he had often heard his father praise the virtues of the ancient romans their courage and endurance and so peter had got the notion into his head that it is rather a grand thing not to mind what is uncomfortable and disagreeable and that it is rather a shameful and unworthy thing to grumble and make a fuss and cry when your chilblains itch or you happen to bump your head against the table or when your legs ache as his legs began to ache now with the length and steepness of the hill more than once his mother stopped and called him to her and told him he was a good brave little man and pulled the collar of his overcoat up about his red little ears and peter though he would not have said so for three dozen baking apples or half a washingbasket full of sugar pigs did find it very comfortable to stand still in the shelter of her petticoats for a minute or two and get his breath the town below was hidden in the driving snow and the dark wall of the pinetrees loomed nearer and nearer at last the forest path was reached and here it was better walking the snow was lighter and there was shelter from the force of the wind but they had taken so much time in climbing the hill that the dusk was coming on and there was still a long way to go antony no longer whistled he walked on steadily ahead of the others turning round now and then with a fine air of superiority and command antony indeed was as yet not at all displeased with the adventure he believed that this was an occasion on which he showed to great advantage his mother followed him in silence little peter came next he had taken his brother pauls hand now and trotted along as fast as his sturdy little legs would carry him for to tell the honest truth he was getting a trifle frightened the birds had all hidden themselves away in the thick brushwood and no longer welcomed him with their merry round eyes the wellknown path looked mysterious almost awful in the halflight with the tall ranks of the pinetrees on either side of it swaying in the blast sometimes the snow would slip in great masses from the high branches and fall close to little peters feet as if the black dwarf was throwing snowballs at him poor peter began to feel very shivery and creepy and did not the least care to look round lest something he did not exactly know whatand that made it all the worse perhapsshould be coming tripping tripping tripping over the white ground behind him but the only person who really came behind little peter was eliza and though i do not want to be rude to eliza who was a very worthy young woman in her way i cannot pretend to say that she was doing anything so graceful as tripping over the snow not a bit of it eliza was extremely disgruntled by the events of the day and was as full of complaints and lamentations as a hedgehogs back is full of spines the wet snow had made her fine white cap limp and drabbled so that instead of standing up like the vizor of an ancient helmet the big lace frill of it tumbled in the most melancholy manner about her face she had turned the skirt of her dress up over her head and what with holding it and her books tied up in her handkerchief and what with the tightness of her boots which were a pair of brand new ones and half a size too small for her into the bargain eliza came very much nearer floundering than tripping over the snow the forest opens out in places into wide spaces of waste moorland across these by daylight or in fine weather it is easy enough to find the right road but on such an evening as i am telling you about it is by no means easy on the edge of the moorland susan lepage called to antony to stop go slowly she said and pray be careful if we once mistake the path we may find ourselves in a sad plight i wish your father was with us go on in front she added turning to paul and i will follow you now his mothers words rather nettled antony illustration lost page you havent any real confidence in me he said sulkily or you wouldnt be repeating all the while that you wish my father was here you see antony had been a good deal flattered and excited by his pretty companion at the red horse at nullepart and it often happens unfortunately that pleasure when it is past makes us quarrelsome he kicked the snow about with his foot and his handsome young face looked quite rebellious and naughty no no my son susan lepage answered gently i have every confidence in your good intentions but the way must needs be difficult to find i merely caution you to be careful of course i shall be careful said the lad angrily as he stepped from the shelter of the pine trees into the dim white waste beyond for a time all went well but all of a sudden the ground began to grow rough and uneven under foot peter stumbled and fell and scrambled up again half smothered in snow his poor little mouth and eyes full of it and his hands scratched with the harsh heath roots and stones beneath antony antony we are wandering cried his mother as she wiped the snow out of peters eyes and off his clothes and kissed him the little boy clung to her for he felt very desolate and cheerless he did not think it in the least amusing now to be out in the storm he longed for the warm cosy kitchen and for the society of cincinnatus but he choked down his tears as his mother kissed him and tried to be very brave and not to mind his tumble antony turned back he was a few steps ahead we can only have missed the path by a yard or two he said hurriedly you just stand still and ill find it and he did find it but alas he could not keep to it for the light faded and darkness came on quicker and quicker and still the snow fell in hundreds of thousands of soft white flakes eliza groaned and lamented and our poor little peters snowclogged boots began to chill his feet through and his hands grew as cold as frogs paws and he got more and more hungry and tired but he did not grumble about it for he knew his mother and brothers were cold and weary too so he struggled on manfully through the ankledeep snow and at last he got too tired even to feel hungry and began to cry quite gently to himself illustration please mother he said i cant go any further susan lepage took him up in her arms and held him close against her bosom she did not speak but if it had been light enough to see i think peter would have found that she was crying too for the ground was all rough and uneven under foot again and though antony went first to the right hand and then to the left he could not make out the road at all ive come all wrong mother he said and his voice trembled i dont know where we are or which way we are walking we are lost there was a silence before his mother answered him you have done your best she said the event is in the hands of god chapter viii which proves that even philosophic politicians may have to admit themselves in the wrong but now it is quite time for us to go back to the old wooden farmhouse on the edge of the forest and see what master lepage and gustavus and that intelligent and experienced person cincinnatus are doing while the rest of the household are wandering alas not without growing alarm and even suffering in the darkness and cold and snow in point of fact then though master lepage had been so very determined to please himself by sitting at home he had found the day uncommonly long and dull for he was one of those sociable persons who are never quite happy without an audience to hold forth to and instruct and convince of their own remarkable wisdom and the hearers equally remarkable folly and then too for all that he appeared somewhat dictatorial and highhanded lepage was at bottom an affectionate and warmhearted man who loved his wife and children tenderly and so as the afternoon drew on and the wind rose and the clouds gathered he began to get into a fine fume and fret he walked up and down the warm cosy kitchen as restless as a bear in a pit and knocked double postmans knocks on the weather glass and declared out loud that the mercury was going up when he saw perfectly well that it was going down and did a number of other useless things to try to persuade himself that he was not one bit anxious or uneasy how inferior is the education of men to that of cats thought cincinnatus before i was old enough to lap milk out of a saucer my mother had taught me the vulgarity of giving way to purposeless agitation calm she would say is even a greater sign of goodbreeding than a curl of hair inside the ears in my poor master there calm and earcurls alike are wanting what a situation thank heaven i at least was born a cat but you see master lepage had really some cause for his restlessness for all this while he was struggling with an unseen enemy deep down in that innermost chamber of the heartthe door of which we most of us keep so tight shut because we know truth sits within weighing and judging all our thoughts and actions and letting us know from time to time just what she thinks about them in the very plainest languagein that innermost heartchamber i say lepage was aware that there was a busy active feeling of shame and remorse and while truth pushed hard at the door inside to let the feeling out he pushed equally hard on the outside to keep the feeling in but when finally the snow began to fall and the daylight lessen and the storm grow fierce and fiercer truth pushed and bumped and banged upon the poor door so unmercifully that master lepage sturdy veteran though he was grew quite weary of opposing her and so the busy feeling popped out first its head and then its two arms and then squeezed itself out all together and began racing up and down the whole length and breadth of the old soldiers heart in the most audacious manner you were obstinate and conceited this morning said the feeling you wouldnt listen to john paqualin the charcoalburner look at the snow the glass was rising answered lepage i am perfectly certain it was and john paqualin is a madman madman yourself said the feelingfor feelings are very freespoken you know and dont mince mattersmadman yourself for letting your wife who is a delicate woman and that poor child little peter run such a risk of cold and fatigue and perhaps worse antony knows the way answered lepage again and hes an able fellow he is a boy and like most boys is thoughtless and selfopinionated he takes after you in that last by the same token said the feeling i am a philosophic politician cried lepage somewhat hotly i worship the goddess of reason do you said the feeling and these newspapers you were so anxious to sit at home and read today fullas you perfectly well knowof garbled news and onesided statements and of cheap party criesthey are the voice of reason are they hang you answered lepagewhich was not at all a pretty way of answering but then you see poor master lepage was getting very angry because he was very uncomfortable and when persons are both uncomfortable and angry they are liable to make use of expressions which very properly are not printed in the french and english conversation books that you study in the schoolroomi wont listen to you so away with you i have no doubt no doubt havent you said the feeling well i am glad to hear that no doubt at allten thousand plagues on youno doubt at all i say that my wife and children will be home in ten minutes at the latest meanwhile i will read a little i will improve my mind with the history of those grand old romans so lepage got down the history book and it fell open at one of his favourite passagesthe account of the consul marcus attilius regulus who rather than break his word left his home and kindred and gave himself up to his pitiless enemies and bore in silence all the cruel tortures to which they subjected him there was a man cried lepage as he wiped his spectacles with his red pockethandkerchief yes indeed a very different man to you francis louis lepage said the feeling why why what do you mean twenty thousand cutthroat prussiansat least i am no coward no one has ever accused me of that before what was i ever afraid of illustration waiting page of a little trouble answered the feeling of a walk for instance when you felt inclined to sit at home smokingof what one or two silly featherheaded fellows who fancy themselves mighty sharp and clever might perhaps say about you if you were seen kneeling down beside your wife and sons in the church there with your head uncovered praying god to forgive you your sinspooh dont talk about your courage to me said the feeling master lepage sat very still for some time after that in the windowseat with the roman history wide open before him but he did not care to go on reading about the consul regulus he remembered how little peter had climbed on his knee on friday evening and coaxed him to go to nullepart to see the infant jesus and the stable and had saidpoor little lad what a nice little face he hadlepage rubbed the end of his hooked nose and sniffedthat if only his father came with them they would all be so happy well i hope they have been happy he said to himself it is more than i have been in any case he turned and looked out of window ah how it snowed and how dark it was growing and with this wind on the moorland the snow will drift if they have the intelligence of a blue owl between them they will have started early he cried quite fiercely ten thousand plaguespoor dear souls he added for master lepage was getting a little confused somehow illustration he hurried across the kitchen to the housedoor and flung it wide open and standing on the threshold gazed long and earnestly down the dim forest path drawing his shaggy eyebrows together till they stood out like chevaux de frise above his keen grey eyes hola hola hey he shouted but there was no answer save the roaring of the wind among the pines and the soft hush hush of the falling snow now for some time past cincinnatus had been sitting very composedly staring with his great yellow eyes into the glowing log fire and meditating pleasantly on the inferiority of men to cats but when master lepage a prey to that remorseful feeling which truth had let loose to tramp where it would up and down his heart threw the housedoor wide open the icy breath of the north wind rushed wildly into the kitchen and made our friend cincinnatus feel uncommonly cool about the back neither calm nor earcurls dear me he murmured to himself as he rose slowly stretching one fore leg and then the other and then each hind leg in turnshaking the last leg rapidly for a moment too because it was slightly crampedand yawning the while so wide that his pink tongue was curled up quite tight like a rollingpin at the back of his mouth then he moved away with dignity intending to take up his station upon the cushion of the big armchair that stood in the corner nicely out of the draught but all of a sudden cincinnatus heard something that made him jump all on one side with an arched back and a bristling tail and say pffzsh twice over as loud as ever he had said it in his life it was an unfamiliar sound that so startled cincinnatus for master lepage was pulling strongly at the rope of the big bell that hung under the centre gable of the old house and the urgent clang of its iron voice rang through the thick snowladen air far over the forest the bell had been placed there long years before to summon neighboursthe house standing in a solitary placein case of fire or accident and now lepage rang it with a double purpose trusting that even if its friendly tones failed to reach the ears of the poor wanderers it might at least bring gustavus the cowherd from his fathers cottage on the edge of the pastures where he was spending the sunday and that he might help him search for the wife and children whom he loved so well by my greatgrandmothers whiskers exclaimed cincinnatus as he settled himself down on the chair cushion what with draughts and bellringing and one thing and another this house will soon be impossible for a cat of any pretensions to gentility compare it with the sacristans establishment now where you cant tell one day from another except by the smell of the different soups for dinnerdelightfulwith an occasional vocal evening too in the back garden when the moon is full lots are strangely unequal in this worldpffzsh and to add to everything else if there actually is not that intolerable charcoalburner john paqualin stood on the threshold a flaming torch of pine boughs in his hand his long unkempt hair was white with snow and so was the tattered cloth cloak that hung in so many folds from his stooping shoulders his eyes were bright and glowing ah the wind he said the glorious wind the roar and the shout of it the cry of the trees that strain and the passionate snap of the brancheslike heartstrings that snap under the blast of incurable sorrow and the snow soft and pure and light as the coverlet a young mother lays on her firstborns cradlegetting a little too thick just now though that coverleteh whats this have you smothered the infantlaid it over the face as well be careful then with yourbut the bell he added suddenly interrupting himself and catching hold of master lepage with his hard thin fingersit called to me while i was listening to the roll of the drums and the blare of the trumpets and the scream of the fifes in the forest there and made me come hither whether i would or no what do you want spoiling all my splendid windmusic with your infernal bellclatter want cried lepage hoarsely i want help paqualin laughed aloud heyho he said times are changed are they i never heard you sing that song before lepage let go the bellrope and raised his clenched fist but he did not strike the blow something stopped him perhaps it was that same remorseful feeling which truth had let loose in his heart come inside paqualin he said quite quietly after a moment or two now try to remembermy wife and sons and our maidservant went to church at nullepart this morning you did your best to prevent them going you said the snow was coming and it has come they should have been back a good two hours ago and they are not here yet not here yet repeated the charcoalburner slowly no not yet lepage drew his hand across his eyes would to god he said i had gone along with thembut see now i will light the lamp and leave the housedoor open and then will go out to search for them you can find your way like a hound they say by night or day through the forest will you come with me and help me paqualin stood in front of the fire the snow on his hair and cloak melted and ran down forming a little pool of water about his illshod feet i am not over and above fond of you francis lepage he said presently as you most likely know already love and hatred alike can tell their own story without much need of spoken words i think you a vain man and a hard one but your wife is as pitiful as the saints in heaven you want me to help you to find her you have not got a dog to do the work for you and so youll take me ah well ive known the dogs place pretty well all my life longthe kicks and the cuffs and the grudging crust from the masters table and then the here my good fellow good cur here nose down tail up the scents cold but still youre sharp enough to find it and sweat and faint to catch the hare that will make your owner a savoury supper while you slink home to the dirty straw and the mouldy crust again yes yesto be sure ill go with you and find them and bring them home your fair wife and your children and leave you happy and go back to my hut and the voicesnot for your sake though mind you but for hersthe only woman whose eyes have ever looked kindly upon me come on your own terms said lepage just then gustavus in his heavy boots came clumping into the kitchen the bell masterhas the red cow calved of a sudden he asked for once in his life gustavus appeared to be quite excited he forgot to take off his hat or put down his big cotton umbrella from off which the wet snow slipped in little avalanches sthlop on to the floor calf thyself with thy great stupid cheese face cried the charcoalburner then while lepage gave the cowherd his orders and got some things together to take with them paqualin stood murmuring to himself with his head bent low and his lean grimy hands stretched out towards the comfortable blaze of the fire illustration you the man welcome and brave and beloved i the dog to show the man the way gustavus there the ass to trot behind loaded up with the blankets and the food and the brandy and in the end what a bone for the dog a thistle for the ass and for the man kisses which has the best of it hardly fair is it eh umph said gustavus as he got the big bundle on to his back perhaps shell be a bit softhearted when she sees me maybe the snow will have taken some of the starch out of our eliza chapter ix which is very short because in some ways it is rather sad have you ever looked for something you cared for very much and failed to find it a dolly for instance forgotten at play in the garden swept up with the dead leaves and never seen after or still worse a dear little kitten of an adventurous turn of mind that went out in the woods for a walk by himself and never came home again though you ran down the churchlane and up to the top of the pasture crying puss puss puss till you were quite hoarse and cross and tired and nurse said you must come in because it was past bedtime and the dew was rising and a number of other things which were perfectly true but which didnt throw any light on the whereabouts of the kitten how did you feel why just the most miserable little boy or girl in all the world to be sure or supposing on the other hand that you found dolly at last after all but with all the red washed off her lips and cheeks and the mould mixed up with her yellow hair and her smart frock wet and torn and one of her waxen legs squashed flat where the wheel of the gardeners barrow had gone over it or that the keeper brought back poor kitty some three or four days later stiff and cold and saidbin poaching bin caught in a gin thought little missy ud like to know the end of er well did that make matters much better i dont think so myself and at one time of my life i had a good deal of experience in these things so i have the right to speak for it is a poor pleasure at best to play that dolly is sick of a fever when you see that she does not get a bit better even though you dose her ten times a day with an elaborate preparation of slatepencil scrapings and as to begging a candlebox of the housemaid for a coffin and having a grand funeral in the shrubbery for the kitten that is terrible work indeed and makes your eyes so red with crying that you are quite ashamed to go down to dessert in the evening now if you and i have felt so very unhappy over our dolls and kittens when we lost themand found them again maybe but always a good deal the worse for the losinghow do you think master lepage felt as he went out that dark stormy snowy night with the charcoalburner and gustavus into the forest he was very silent as he tramped through the snow while the wind roared in the pines above him and blew about the flame of his torch making it twist and twirl and flicker and glimmer sometimes casting a red glare far over the white ground and the great grey treestems and john paqualins crooked uncouth form flitting on just ahead of him and sometimes dying down till all the scene was wrapped in darkness he was very silent i say and not a bit like vivacious loquacious master lepage who used to sit and hold forth in the wineshop and thump the table and make the glasses ring but more like sergeant lepage who with his teeth set and his face fierce and white had marched up under fire of the enemies guns in battle long ago in italy or africa lepage marched under fire now and the battlefield was his own heart and oh dear me how many of his most cherished ideas and beliefs the shot from those guns knocked overhis pride his selfimportance his trust in his own intellect and insight and acuteness his politics his philosophy nothing in short nothing was left standing except a sense of remorse for his past folly and his love for his wife and his children if they have been merely delayed by the storm we shall meet them on the road here if they are lost they will have begun wandering on the first stretch of moorland said john paqualin see the snow is ceasing the stars begin to show in heaven eh the frost how it bites and so it did as the snow stopped the night grew colder and colder for all the icefairies came tripping out far and wide over hill and valley and built transparent piers and bridges across the streams and pools and hung icicles from the rocks and from the overhanging eaves of the houses and froze the breath on lepages long moustache and made the earth like iron beneath his feet yet he and his two companions still marched on through the forest they could go but slowly for in the open spaces the snow had drifted deep and where the forest paths crossed each other it required all the charcoalburners knowledge and skill to tell which was the right one now and again they would halt for a minute or two and call aloud and then listen hoping for an answer but it was close upon midnight and they had walked more than half the way to nullepart before they came upon any trace of those they so earnestly searched for here as i have already told you the path crosses a wide stretch of rolling moorland covered with heather and stunted bushes thorns and brambles and whortleberry and juniper while in places crop out large limestone blocks and boulders some standing together and looking like the ruins of a giants castle others but just peeping above the rough soil and encrusted with stonecrop and ferns and many kinds of mossesa lovely playplace on a summer day when the butterflies sport over the heath and the dragonflies over the pools in the marshes but bleak and desolate enough on a december night with the harsh north wind and the snowstorm on the edge of this moorland before leaving the shelter of the pines paqualin stopped shout he said turning to the others shout your loudest the frost has caught me by the throat and squeezed my crooked windpipe till i am as hoarse as a raven but you are strong men shout lepage for love of your wife and you good ass there for love of eliza your sweetheart shell pay you in thistles prickles and all if you find her so they shouted and this time there was an answera boys voice half choked with crying and with a pale haggard face and in his eyes a look of terror from among the snowladen pinetrees came antony you alone cried lepage i trusted her to you where are your mother and brothers she sent us on to try to get help paul is here just behind me we lost ourselves and wandered she could get no further and little peter is dead asleep under the big rocks there to the right out on the moor eliza does nothing but cry and wont move the boy was utterly faint and disheartened he threw himself down on the snow and covered his face with his hands i did my best father he said indeed indeed i did but i couldnt find the way it was dark and there was nothing to guide us and i got bewildered with the cold we were too late in starting i knowthat was my fault but i did my best afterwards oh father i did try to take care of them i couldnt help it say you forgive me paqualin did not wait to hear more the big rocks out to the right he repeated illustration found page his limbs were stiff with the sharp cold which had penetrated his threadbare clothes and his feet were numb with the snow that had worked its way in through the worn cracked leather of his wretched boots oh yes i am afraid he was a very funny figure indeed and that all the little boys in nullepart would have hooted louder than ever if they could have seen him as with his long grasshopper legs wild red hair and tattered cloak streaming out behind him he shambled along slipping and staggering in the half darkness over that long halfmile of heath and stone and prickly bushes and sly deceitful snowdrifts that stretched between the edge of the forest and the rocks here is help he shrieked in his shrill voice it is ii john paqualin here is help as he passed round in front into the shelter of the tall grey rocks susan lepage rose up from the foot of them with a great cry she flung her arms about him and rested her fair head on his shoulder ah god has sent you she sobbed i called upon him in the bitterness of my anguish and he has heard me save us john paqualin in mercy save me and my children the charcoalburners torch slipped from his grasp and fell hissing upon the ground the dog gets something more than his bone for once he said between his teeth for a minute or so in that mysterious ghostly radiance of dancing starlight and white snow he stood holding the weeping woman in his arms god sent me though did he he murmured at last then i must do his good pleasure not my own paqualin spoke low and quite softly notwithstanding that queer crack in his voice look up and take courage there is better comfort than mine at hand your two boys are safely cared for already and your husband is coming the trouble is over for you at least the morning begins to break then as he heard the crunch of hurried footsteps coming over the snow behind him he turned and cried here take your wife lepage paqualin moved aside for the man he said half aloudwellwhat hes a right to get back to your kennel you hound now eliza was sitting with her back against one of the rocks in the burrow where the snow was lightest and little peter closely wrapped in his mothers shawl lay stupefied with sleep with his head in her lap as paqualin turned round she moaned out no no dont come near me i am dreadfully illprobably i shall never recover i think i shall die but i wont give way i wont listen to you to the last i am true to gustavus ah my poor heart how it beats yes i should like to have bidden a last farewell to gustavus dont fret answered the charcoalburner thy mooncalf is on the road hell be here in plenty of time to say a good deal besides goodbye to you unless i am very much mistaken eliza gave a prodigious sigh he will be too late i know it i know it ah how will he live without me poor faithful brokenhearted gustavus whether it was his mothers cry that roused him or the sudden lights and the voices i do not know but little peter half awoke from the heavy torpor of sleep into which the cold and fatigue had plunged him i will not hush eliza i love john paqualin yes i love him he murmured chapter x which ends the story something has gone very wrong said cincinnatus to himself in the cat language i dont pretend to understand it this is one of those many matters that i should be glad to take my cousin the sacristans cats opinion upon dear me what a misfortune it is to live here in the country away from the centre of social intercourse and civilisation then cincinnatus fell to washing his face with his paws for he had lately had his five oclock saucer of milk you see and it is etiquette in catland always to wash after meals not before them as we do the yellow earthenware stove was lighted in the bedroom and cincinnatus sat opposite to the open door of it and blinked at the heart of crimson wood embers set in a fringe of flaky grey ashes it was very warm there but cincinnatus blinked and washed his face slowly as to the heat it soothed him and inclined him to make a number of reflections at the risk of repeating myself i must observe that men are poor improvident thoughtless creatures he went on presently subject to illness and accidents of all kinds however a thoughtful cat will not be hard upon them noblesse oblige those who have the advantage can afford to be generous fancy coming into this world now where the weather is so extremely uncertain all pink and bare as they do poor things without any comfortable fur to cover them and having to make up for it by enclosing themselves in all sorts of shapeless foreign substances prepared from sheeps wool or vegetables and no tail either imagine being deprived of that most dignified and expressive member yet you must give them their due necessity has certainly made them very ingenious cincinnatus stretched himself lazily in the hot glow of the stove fire but with all their ingenuity only one life he said yawning and that one as i observed just now subject to all manner of illness and accident we have nine lives who would be one of them if he could help it poor things no wonder if they envy us then cincinnatus went across the boarded floor with his noiseless tread and jumped up on to little peters bed and began purring in the most amiable and engaging manner sticking out all his claws and then drawing them in again and making a nice tight little fist as he trampled on the bedclothes first with one forefoot and then with the other he even went so far as to rub his head along against the little boys shoulder which considering his opinion of the relative position of cats and mankind in the universal scale of being was really very condescending of him to my thinking but little peter did not speak or pay any attention to cincinnatus he only sighed in his sleep and turned his round black head on the pillow poor little peter had lain just like that quite still and quiet in bed ever since his father and the charcoalburner had placed him there when they had got home from that terrible walk in the snow about four oclock in the morning the icefairies who really are very elegant people and not at all disagreeable when you know them had come at sunrise and spread the most beautiful patternscrowns and crosses and stars and diamonds and ice flowers of a hundred exquisite shapesall over the window panes but little peter had been too tired and sleepy to get up and look at them and when in the afternoon not without struggle and difficulty for the road was dangerous with snowdrifts the kind old doctor with his red nose and his snuffbox had ridden over from nullepart and sat by the little boys bed and felt his pulse and examined him carefully with a face as wise as an owls from behind his large spectacles peter had been too fired and sleepy to look at him either the old doctor had taken an extra pinch of snuff and shaken his head quite seriously i am sorry to say at leaving now it was past five oclock and peter still lay in his little bed dozing and sleepingdreaming too but not of the snow and the pain of the winter he dreamed of sunshine and of pleasant places of the singing of birds and the sound of the cowbells in the flowery fields in the springtime the elder boys and their father had gone to see the doctor safe part of his way home again and susan lepage had sunk down in the big chair in the kitchen and had fallen asleep worn out with fatigue and anxiety and eliza hearing gustavus come into the back kitchen with the milkpans had slipped downstairs from watching beside the child just to have a word with him poor fellow she said he really is so overjoyed at my being restored to him that there is no saying if he wont mix this evenings milk with this mornings or ruin the cream by shaking it or commit some other folly he is not clever and my family will certainly reproach me with having married beneath me but he has a good heart and i think he really appreciates me as he ought to does gustavus so it happened that little peter was left quite alone but for the society of the cat up in the bedroom john paqualin came along the flagged path to the front of the house and pressing his face close against the glass for it was difficult to see through them the panes being frosty looked in at the kitchen window then he went to the house door lifted the latch carefully entered and stood still listening there was no sound save the singing of the kettle and elizas chatter in the distant dairy with the clump of the cowherds boots on the flags and the clink of the milkpans from the rows of copper kettles and saucepans and the china high on the dresser to the red tiled floor under the charcoalburners feet the large kitchen actually shone with exquisite cleanliness the light of the lamp on the table fell upon susan lepages high white cap showing it and her pure grave profile as she leaned her head back in the armchair clear cut against the ruddy dusk of the chimney corner behind her illustration paqualin as he stood there silent and watchful with his sunken eyes ungainly figure and dilapidated garments seemed strangely out of place he shaded his eyes with his hand for the light dazzled him as he looked for a minute or two at the sleeping mother then he went quietly across the kitchen and up the wide wooden staircase the house is asleep he murmured in his high cracked tonesor would be but for the voice of eliza pah the womans tongue cuts like a whip but her sweetheart the ass has a good thick hide of his own he finds the lash only pleasantly tickling paqualin went into the warm dimlylighted bedroom above the house is asleep he repeated heyho sleeps a kindly fellow with his turban of nodding poppies he cures the heartache but hes forgetful sadly forgetful he hasnt been near me these five nights and god knows i have had the heartache as badly as any of the others he knelt down by little peters bed and looked closely at the child illustration the charcoalburner visits little peter page eh sleep is hardly a kind friend to you im afraid though he said under his breath a little too much of the smell of the drowsy poppies here to be quite healthful as he spoke cincinnatus who had been curled up comfortably in a nice warm depression in the bedclothes jumped down on to the floor with glaring eyes and a great tail i wont spit though he said it really isnt worth the trouble no an air of absolute indifference will be even more impressive and chilling so he walked away very stiffly and sat down opposite the open stove door again the charcoalburner placed one of his lean hands on the little boys soft pudgy one that lay palm upward on the pillow and with the other patted him tenderly on the cheek little peter he said wake up come back to us dear little mouse you said you loved menobody ever said that to me before dont go away from me do not desert me he paused a minute and then went on pleadingly think of all the stories i have told you remember the nuts and the appleseh wake up little lad and come back to poor ugly john paqualin to whom his fellow men have shown such scant mercy but the child lay quite still his long black eyelashes resting on his pale cheeks and his pretty round mouth a wee bit open as he sighed softly in that strange stupor of sleep tears dimmed the charcoalburners eyes he bent his wild shock head and rested it down on the white coverlet ah great god he murmured thou who art all powerful listen to me see here cant we make an exchangetake my poor battered weary old soul instead of his fresh innocent white one let me give him my life for his mothers sake the sweetest and most compassionate of women she will grieve if she loses him her darling her baby and kind as she is she wont miss me very much why should shean outcast of nature a shameful misshapen mistake one sorry sight the less in the world when im gone thats alldeaths dreadful they sayyes i know i am afraid of it but after all it cant be so very much worse than lifeat least for some of us he threw back his head and clasped his hard hands together here take me he cried i will come a trifle of suffering more or less what does it matter spare the little lamb o lord and take me john paqualin as ransom now the charcoalburner was not quite right in his head you see and that accounts for his eccentric prayer and very original behaviour you had better bear this in mind i wont tell you why you will probably find out for yourselves when you have seen more of the world and grown rather older paqualin knelt on there for some time looking up as though he expected a direct and visible answer to his singular petition but nothing happened save that eliza came upstairs on the tips of her toesa way of stepping which she intended to be particularly quiet but which was in fact particularly noisyand peeped into the room seeing the charcoalburner kneeling by the bedside she gave a fearful gasp and sank down into the nearest chair the saints help and preserve us she exclaimed in a loud whisper holding her side what next ah how it startled me the helpless sick child in the arms of that ogre go away john paqualin go away how on earth did you get here ive only been downstairs three minutes giving some necessary instructions to gustavushe really is beside himself with joy poor fellowgo away i say if peter woke up suddenly he would have a fit at seeing you look at yourself in the lookingglass and youll understand why fast enough a rush of blood to the head from fright and the child would be dead and if half the stories one hears of you are true there is enough down on the wrong side of your account already without adding wilful murder go along with youah i am so weakmy poor heart how it beats eliza advanced creaking across the boarded floor towards the charcoalburner he had risen to his feet there is no answer he said in a low voice you fool learn your lesson god doesnt want your wretched worthless soul john paqualin who are you indeed that you should try to strike a bargain with the almighty and offer such miserable refuse and offscourings as your life in place of that of the pure and sinless child there he looked back towards the bed goodbye he said dear little peter when you are gone there will be nothing left on earth to love me and in heaven its clear they can do very well without me yet awhile then as eliza came close to him whispering pointing towards the door and signing to him he turned upon her with a terrible face woman leave me alone he said have not i enough to bear already without the maddening gnatbites of your spiteful ignorance and cruel folly and the grasshopper man went out of the room and down the stairs and into the dark frosty night illustration eliza leant up against the bottom of the bed with her eyes half shut are you gone yet she murmured you savage wild animalif the child had woke up and screamed there would have been a fine fuss and all the blame would have been laid on me of course it isnt fair that crazy men like that should be allowed to persecute respectable young servantwomen ill get gustavus to lay an information against him at the police station at nullepart for using threatening language to me of course it is all jealousy but i cant help my good looks eliza opened her eyes again arranged the mauve silk handkerchief about her neck and smiled complacently it is a comfort to know that you have no cause to be ashamed of your faceor of your disposition for that matter either she added now this all happened on monday evening as no doubt you have made out already very early before it was light on wednesday morning little peter who all that long time had lain sleeping unconscious of what went on around him suddenly seemed to find himself very wide awake indeed there was a strange light in the room bright and yet soft like an early summer dawn and as the little boy opened his eyes he saw that at his bedside there stood a young man with a calm beautiful face and shining hair he was clothed down to the feet in a long white linen garment as peter looked up wonderingly the young man bent over him there was something very still and gentle in his glance and the little boy smiled for it seemed to him that the young mans face was that of an old friend though he could not remember ever to have seen him before then the young man spoke to him and said little peter you have been sick and tired will you come away with me to a faroff country where there is no more sickness and trouble and where the children play all the year round among blooming flowers in green sunny pastures by the riverside peter did not feel a bit afraid but he thought of his parents and his brothers and asked but please will my mother and father and paul and antony and my cat cincinnatus come too paul is very kind and he makes such nice millwheels to turn in the brook and weathercocks to stick up in the peartree and show which way the wind blows and cincinnatus would be dull and lonely if i left him behind he likes to come to bed with me in the morning and the old grey wolf might come out of the wood and catch him and make him into soup for little wolves when i was gone the young man smiled as he answerednever fear your mother and father and paul and antony will certainly join you some day if they are good time seems very short while we wait in that happy country and as to cincinnatus who knows but that he may come also in any case he will be quite safe for our heavenly father loves all his living creaturesnot only angels and men but fish and birds and beasts as well will you come little peter ah but theres john paqualin said the boy you know whom i meanthe charcoalburner i cant leave him very well you see because he is often very unhappy and he says nobody will ever care for him because he is rather odd and uglylooking and i do care for him very much indeed then the young man bent lower and looked into little peters eyes why why you are john paqualin cried the child yes said the other and his face was radiant with the peace that passes understanding i am john paqualin god be praised but how you have changed little peter said for he was a good deal surprised you know and no wonder with the lord one day is as a thousand years answered the young man will you come with me now little peter then peter stretched out his hands and laughed out loud with joy he was so very glad about quite a number of thingsthe thought of his playfellows in that fair and happy country and of the coming of his parents and brothers and of cincinnatus the cat and most of all at the delightful change for the better that had taken place in the personal appearance of his friend the charcoalburner yes he said ill come so then the young man took him up very tenderly in his strong arms and laid the little tired head upon his breast and carried little peter away now it happened strangely enough that though both susan lepage and her husband sat watching by their childs bedside they neither of them saw the young man with the calm face and shining hair or heard a word he said they only saw that the little boy opened his eyes suddenly and seemed to gaze at something with a kind of glad wonder and that he smiled and that his dear little lips moved and then that he stretched out his hands and laughed joyfully after that he lay very still susan lepage waited a moment or two then she rose and took a candle that stood on the oak chest near the beds head shading it with her hand she stooped down and looked closely at the child ah my little one she cried she put the candle back again and coming round the foot of the bed stood by master lepage with her hand resting on his shoulder my husband she said our child will suffer no more the dear lord loved him and has called for him a child has died on earth a child is born in paradise there was a long silence master lepage sat bolt upright with his arms hanging down at his sidesmore as though he was standing before the general officer on parade than sitting in the rushbottomed chair in his own bedroom the big tears ran down over his cheeks and fell from his moustache on to his blue blouse as thick as a summer shower my wife he said slowly our paths have joined at lastjoined beside an open grave but better there than nowhere there shall be no more silence between us the god whom you have served so faithfully in time will surely heal the smart of your sorrow and perhaps he will condescend to listen to the prayers of a foolish vainglorious wrongheaded old soldier whom grief and repentance have humbled pardon me my wife i have been wrong and you right all along lepage stood up took her two hands in his and kissed her ah my dear let us talk only of love and hope not of pardon susan lepage answered gently she turned and looked at little peter still and smiling with his round black head resting so cosily on the white pillow the autumn child has brought a blessing to the house she murmured ten thousand plagues broke out master lepage hoarsely twenty thousand cutthroat prussiansbut i loved the little one and is that the end of the story well yes as far as a story can be said to have an endmost stories go on for ever only we get tired or stupid and leave off reading themif the story has an end i say i suppose this is it still there are just one or two little things i can mention which you might like to know for instance when next day gustavus happened to pass the charcoalburners hut he heard such a horrible barking and yelling that though he was not of a very active or curious order of mind he really had to go and see what was the matter and on getting to the back of the hut he found madelon the sow standing up on her hind legs in her sty with her forefeet resting on the rough wooden door of it her long black snout high in the air her floppety ears shaking her great mouth wide open as she squealed aloud and not a single scrap of food in her trough this seemed to gustavus such a singular thing that though he had no great fancy for the society of the charcoalburner he thought he would just look inside the hut door which stood half open the snow had drifted in at it and lay thick on the mud floor within there was no fire on the hearth and the place was deathly chill yet paqualin sat there sure enough on a wooden bench with his elbows on the table in front of him and his head resting on his hands his back was towards gustavus the cowherd did not quite like to go inside the hut somehow he stood in the snow on the doorsill and called at last he plucked up his courage and going forward pulled at paqualins ragged sleeve illustration umph said gustavus as he stumbled out again in a desperate hurry he took off his hat and wiped his face round for notwithstanding the frosty day he felt quite uncomfortably warm here ill give you something granny he called out to the sow if you wait till your master brings it youll wait a long time for your breakfast today bless me but i shall have something to tell our eliza this evening at supper thatll make her open her eyes antony has gone to serve his time in the army and when his time is up and he comes back again to the old wooden farmhouse in the forest i think it is very likely that the wish he wished in the diningroom of the red horse at nullepart when he shared the double filbert kernel with pretty marie georgeon may really come true paul is apprenticed to an engineer in paris and lives among whirling machines in the great crowded workshops and his employers are much impressed with his ability and talent and prophesy that he will make a name for himself some day cincinnatus is quite an old cat now and his whiskers are almost white but he still sits opposite the glowing wood fire in the kitchen and blinks his big yellow eyes and reflects on the superiority of cats to men and master lepage still reads the history of the famous roman republic in the winter evenings and takes off his spectacles and wipes them with his red pockethandkerchief but he rarely talks politics now and never sits in the wineshop though on fine sundays he often walks with his gentle sweetfaced wife through the forest and kneels humbly beside her in the church and prays god to guide and teach him and forgive him all his sins illustration and is this a true story yes as true as i can make it and i have taken a good deal of pains but did it all really happen ah that is quite another question for you will find as you grow older that some of the very truest stories are those which as most people in this world count happening have never happened at all and if you cant understand how that can be i advise you the first fine day to ask your way to nullepart and take the opinion of the sacristans cat upon the matter he is a scholar you know so he is sure to be able to explain it the end printed by spottiswoode and co newstreet square london transcribers note variations in hyphenation have been
