hands of justice xxxv the love that lives preface in its original form the mystery of a hansom cab has reached the sale of copies in this country and some few editions in the united states of america notwithstanding this the present publishers have the best of reasons for believing that there are thousands of persons whom the book has never reached the causes of this have doubtless been many but chief among them was the form of the publication itself it is for this section of the public chiefly that the present edition is issued in placing it before my new readers i have been asked by the publishers thoroughly to revise the work and at the same time to set at rest the many conflicting reports concerning it and myself which have been current since its initial issue the first of these requests i have complied with and the many typographic and other errors which disfigured the first edition have i think i can safely say now disappeared the second request i am about to fulfil but in order to do so i must ask my readers to go back with me to the beginning of all things so far as this special book is concerned the writing of the book was due more to accident than to design i was bent on becoming a dramatist but being quite unknown i found it impossible to induce the managers of the melbourne theatres to accept or even to read a play at length it occurred to me i might further my purpose by writing a novel i should at all events secure a certain amount of local attention up to that time i had written only one or two short stories and the cab was not only the first book i ever published but the first book i ever wrote so to youth and lack of experience must be ascribed whatever was wanting in the book i repeat that the story was written only to attract local attention and no one was more astonished than i when it passed beyond the narrow circle for which it had originally been intended my mind made up on this point i enquired of a leading melbourne bookseller what style of book he sold most of he replied that the detective stories of gaboriau had a large sale and as at this time i had never even heard of this author i bought all his works eleven or thereabouts and read them carefully the style of these stories attracted me and i determined to write a book of the same class containing a mystery a murder and a description of low life in melbourne this was the origin of the cab the central idea ie the murder in a cab came to me while driving at a late hour to st kilda a suburb of melbourne but it took some time and much thought to work it out to a logical conclusion i was two months sketching out the skeleton of the novel but even so when i had written it the result proved unsatisfactory for i found i had not sufficiently well concealed the mystery upon which the whole interest of the book depended in the first draft i made frettlby the criminal but on reading over the ms i found that his guilt was so obvious that i wrote out the story for a second time introducing the character of moreland as a scape goat mother guttersnipe i unearthed in the slums off little bourke street and i gave what i am afraid was perhaps too vivid a picture of her language and personality these i have toned down in the present edition calton and the two lodging house keepers were actual personages whom i knew very well and i do not think i have exaggerated their idiosyncracies although many have i believe doubted the existence of such oddities all the scenes in the book especially the slums are described from personal observation and i passed a great many nights in little bourke street gathering material having completed the book i tried to get it published but every one to whom i offered it refused even to look at the manuscript on the ground that no colonial could write anything worth reading they gave no reason for this extraordinary opinion but it was sufficient for them and they laughed to scorn the idea that any good could come out of nazareth ie the colonies the story thus being boycotted on all hands i determined to publish it myself and accordingly an edition of i think some five thousand copies was brought out at my own cost contrary to the expectations of the publishers and i must add to my own the whole edition went off in three weeks and the public demanded a second this also sold rapidly and after some months proposals were made to me that the book should be brought out in london later on i parted with the book to several speculators who formed themselves into what they called the hansom cab publishing company taking the book to london they published it there with great success and it had a phenomenal sale which brought in a large sum of money the success was in the first instance due in no small degree to a very kind and generous criticism written by mr clement scott i may here state that i had nothing to do with the company nor did i receive any money for the english sale of the book beyond what i sold it for and as a matter of fact i did not arrive in england until a year after the novel was published i have heard it declared that the plot is founded on a real criminal case but such a statement is utterly without foundation as the story is pure fiction from beginning to end several people before and since my arrival in england have assumed the authorship of the book to themselves and one gentleman went so far as to declare that he would shoot me if i claimed to have written it i am glad to say that up to the present he has not carried out his intention another individual had his cards printed fergus hume author of 'the mystery of a hansom cab' and also added the price for which he was prepared to write a similar book many of the papers put this last piece of eccentricity down to my account i may state in conclusion that i belong to new zealand and not to australia that i am a barrister and not a retired policeman that i am yet two decades off fifty years of age that fergus hume is my real name and not a nom de plume and finally that far from making a fortune out of the book all i received for the english and american rights previous to the issue of this revised edition by my present publishers was the sum of fifty pounds with this i take my leave and i trust that the present edition may prove as successful as did the first chapter i what the argus said the following report appeared in the argus newspaper of saturday the th july truth is said to be stranger than fiction and certainly the extraordinary murder which took place in melbourne on thursday night or rather friday morning goes a long way towards verifying this saying a crime has been committed by an unknown assassin within a short distance of the principal streets of this great city and is surrounded by an inpenetrable mystery indeed from the nature of the crime itself the place where it was committed and the fact that the assassin has escaped without leaving a trace behind him it would seem as though the case itself had been taken bodily from one of gaboreau's novels and that his famous detective lecoq alone would be able to unravel it the facts of the case are simply these on the twenty seventh day of july at the hour of twenty minutes to two o'clock in the morning a hansom cab drove up to the police station in grey street st kilda and the driver made the startling statement that his cab contained the body of a man who he had reason to believe had been murdered being taken into the presence of the inspector the cabman who gave his name as malcolm royston related the following strange story at the hour of one o'clock in the morning he was driving down collins street east when as he was passing the burke and wills' monument he was hailed by a gentleman standing at the corner by the scotch church he immediately drove up and saw that the gentleman who hailed him was supporting the deceased who appeared to be intoxicated both were in evening dress but the deceased had on no overcoat while the other wore a short covert coat of a light fawn colour which was open as royston drove up the gentleman in the light coat said 'look here cabby here's some fellow awfully tight you'd better take him home' royston then asked him if the drunken man was his friend but this the other denied saying that he had just picked him up from the footpath and did not know him from adam at this moment the deceased turned his face up to the light of the lamp under which both were standing and the other seemed to recognise him for he recoiled a pace letting the drunken man fall in a heap on the pavement and gasping out 'you' he turned on his heel and walked rapidly away down russell street in the direction of bourke street royston was staring after him and wondering at his strange conduct when he was recalled to himself by the voice of the deceased who had struggled to his feet and was holding on to the lamp post swaying to and fro 'i wan' g'ome' he said in a thick voice 'st kilda' he then tried to get into the cab but was too drunk to do so and finally sat down again on the pavement seeing this royston got down and lifting him up helped him into the cab with some considerable difficulty the deceased fell back into the cab and seemed to drop off to sleep so after closing the door royston turned to remount his driving seat when he found the gentleman in the light coat whom he had seen holding up the deceased close to his elbow royston said 'oh you've come back' and the other answered 'yes i've changed my mind and will see him home' as he said this he opened the door of the cab stepped in beside the deceased and told royston to drive down to st kilda royston who was glad that the friend of the deceased had come to look after him drove as he had been directed but near the church of england grammar school on the st kilda road the gentleman in the light coat called out to him to stop he did so and the gentleman got out of the cab closing the door after him 'he won't let me take him home' he said 'so i'll just walk back to the city and you can drive him to st kilda' 'what street sir' asked royston 'grey street i fancy' said the other 'but my friend will direct you when you get to the junction' 'ain't he too much on sir' said royston dubiously 'oh no i think he'll be able to tell you where he lives it's grey street or ackland street i fancy i don't know which' he then opened the door of the cab and looked in 'good night old man' he said the other apparently did not answer for the gentleman in the light coat shrugging his shoulders and muttering 'sulky brute' closed the door again he then gave royston half a sovereign lit a cigarette and after making a few remarks about the beauty of the night walked off quickly in the direction of melbourne royston drove down to the junction and having stopped there according to his instructions he asked his 'fare' several times where he was to drive him to receiving no response and thinking that the deceased was too drunk to answer he got down from his seat opened the door of the cab and found the deceased lying back in the corner with a handkerchief across his mouth he put out his hand with the intention of rousing him thinking that he had gone to sleep but on touching him the deceased fell forward and on examination to his horror he found that he was quite dead alarmed at what had taken place and suspecting the gentleman in the light coat he drove to the police station at st kilda and there made the above report the body of the deceased was taken out of the cab and brought into the station a doctor being sent for at once on his arrival however he found that life was quite extinct and also discovered that the handkerchief which was tied lightly over the mouth was saturated with chloroform he had no hesitation in stating that from the way in which the handkerchief was placed and the presence of chloroform that a murder had been committed and from all appearances the deceased died easily and without a struggle the deceased is a slender man of medium height with a dark complexion and is dressed in evening dress which will render identification difficult as it is a costume which has no distinctive mark to render it noticeable there were no papers or cards found on the deceased from which his name could be discovered and the clothing was not marked in any way the handkerchief however which was tied across his mouth was of white silk and marked in one of the corners with the letters 'ow' in red silk the assassin of course may have used his own handkerchief to commit the crime so that if the initials are those of his name they may ultimately lead to his detection there will be an inquest held on the body of the deceased this morning when no doubt some evidence may be elicited which may solve the mystery in monday morning's issue of the argus the following article appeared with reference to the matter the following additional evidence which has been obtained may throw some light on the mysterious murder in a hansom cab of which we gave a full description in saturday's issue 'another hansom cabman called at the police office and gave a clue which will no doubt prove of value to the detectives in their search for the murderer he states that he was driving up the st kilda road on friday morning about half past one o'clock when he was hailed by a gentleman in a light coat who stepped into the cab and told him to drive to powlett street in east melbourne he did so and after paying him the gentleman got out at the corner of wellington parade and powlett street and walked slowly up powlett street while the cab drove back to town here all clue ends but there can be no doubt in the minds of our readers as to the identity of the man in the light coat who got out of royston's cab on the st kilda road with the one who entered the other cab and alighted therefrom at powlett street there could have been no struggle as had any taken place the cabman royston surely would have heard the noise the supposition is therefore that the deceased was too drunk to make any resistance and that the other watching his opportunity placed the handkerchief saturated with chloroform over the mouth of his victim then after perhaps a few ineffectual struggles the latter would succumb to the effects of his inhalation the man in the light coat judging from his conduct before getting into the cab appears to have known the deceased though the circumstance of his walking away on recognition and returning again shows that his attitude towards the deceased was not altogether a friendly one the difficulty is where to start from in the search after the author of what appears to be a deliberate murder as the deceased seems to be unknown and his presumed murderer has escaped but it is impossible that the body can remain long without being identified by someone as though melbourne is a large city yet it is neither paris nor london where a man can disappear in a crowd and never be heard of again the first thing to be done is to establish the identity of the deceased and then no doubt a clue will be obtained leading to the detection of the man in the light coat who appears to have been the perpetrator of the crime it is of the utmost importance that the mystery in which the crime is shrouded should be cleared up not only in the interests of justice but also in those of the public taking place as it did in a public conveyance and in the public street to think that the author of such a crime is at present at large walking in our midst and perhaps preparing for the committal of another is enough to shake the strongest nerves in one of du boisgobey's stories entitled 'an omnibus mystery' a murder closely resembling this tragedy takes place in an omnibus but we question if even that author would have been daring enough to write about a crime being committed in such an unlikely place as a hansom cab here is a great chance for some of our detectives to render themselves famous and we feel sure that they will do their utmost to trace the author of this cowardly and dastardly murder chapter ii the evidence at the inquest at the inquest held on the body found in the hansom cab the following articles taken from the deceased were placed on the table two pounds ten shillings in gold and silver the white silk handkerchief which was saturated with chloroform and was found tied across the mouth of the deceased marked with the letters ow in red silk a cigarette case of russian leather half filled with old judge cigarettes a left hand white glove of kid rather soiled with black seams down the back samuel gorby of the detective office was present in order to see if anything might be said by the witnesses likely to point to the cause or to the author of the crime the first witness called was malcolm royston in whose cab the crime had been committed he told the same story as had already appeared in the argus and the following facts were elicited by the coroner q can you give a description of the gentleman in the light coat who was holding the deceased when you drove up a i did not observe him very closely as my attention was taken up by the deceased and besides the gentleman in the light coat was in the shadow q describe him from what you saw of him a he was fair i think because i could see his moustache rather tall and in evening dress with a light coat over it i could not see his face very plainly as he wore a soft felt hat which was pulled down over his eyes q what kind of hat was it he wore a wide awake a yes the brim was turned down and i could see only his mouth and moustache q what did he say when you asked him if he knew the deceased a he said he didn't that he had just picked him up q and afterwards he seemed to recognise him a yes when the deceased looked up he said you and let him fall on to the ground then he walked away towards bourke street q did he look back a not that i saw q how long were you looking after him a about a minute q and when did you see him again a after i put deceased into the cab i turned round and found him at my elbow q and what did he say a i said oh you've come back and he said yes i've changed my mind and will see him home and then he got into the cab and told me to drive to st kilda q he spoke then as if he knew the deceased a yes i thought that he recognised him only when he looked up and perhaps having had a row with him walked away but thought he'd come back q did you see him coming back a no the first i saw of him was at my elbow when i turned q and when did he get out a just as i was turning down by the grammar school on the st kilda road q did you hear any sounds of fighting or struggling in the cab during the drive a no the road was rather rough and the noise of the wheels going over the stones would have prevented my hearing anything q when the gentleman in the light coat got out did he appear disturbed a no he was perfectly calm q how could you tell that a because the moon had risen and i could see plainly q did you see his face then a no his hat was pulled down over it i only saw as much as i did when he entered the cab in collins street q were his clothes torn or disarranged in any way a no the only difference i remarked in him was that his coat was buttoned q and was it open when he got in a no but it was when he was holding up the deceased q then he buttoned it before he came back and got into the cab a yes i suppose so q what did he say when he got out of the cab on the st kilda road a he said that the deceased would not let him take him home and that he would walk back to melbourne q and you asked him where you were to drive the deceased to a yes and he said that the deceased lived either in grey street or ackland street st kilda but that the deceased would direct me at the junction q did you not think that the deceased was too drunk to direct you a yes i did but his friend said that the sleep and the shaking of the cab would sober him a bit by the time i got to the junction q the gentleman in the light coat apparently did not know where the deceased lived a no he said it was either in ackland street or grey street q did you not think that curious a no i thought he might be a club friend of the deceased q for how long did the man in the light coat talk to you a about five minutes q and during that time you heard no noise in the cab a no i thought the deceased had gone to sleep q and after the man in the light coat said good night to the deceased what happened a he lit a cigarette gave me a half sovereign and walked off towards melbourne q did you observe if the gentleman in the light coat had his handkerchief with him a oh yes because he dusted his boots with it the road was very dusty q did you notice any striking peculiarity about him a well no except that he wore a diamond ring q what was there peculiar about that a he wore it on the forefinger of the right hand and i never saw it that way before q when did you notice this a when he was lighting his cigarette q how often did you call to the deceased when you got to the junction a three or four times i then got down and found he was quite dead q how was he lying a he was doubled up in the far corner of the cab very much in the same position as i left him when i put him in his head was hanging on one side and there was a handkerchief across his mouth when i touched him he fell into the other corner of the cab and then i found out he was dead i immediately drove to the st kilda police station and told the police at the conclusion of royston's evidence during which gorby had been continually taking notes robert chinston was called he deposed i am a duly qualified medical practitioner residing in collins street east i made a post mortem examination of the body of the deceased on friday q that was within a few hours of his death a yes judging from the position of the handkerchief and the presence of chloroform that the deceased had died from the effects of anaesthesia and knowing how rapidly the poison evaporates i made the examination at once coroner go on sir dr chinston externally the body was healthy looking and well nourished there were no marks of violence the staining apparent at the back of the legs and trunk was due to post mortem congestion internally the brain was hyperaemic and there was a considerable amount of congestion especially apparent in the superficial vessels there was no brain disease the lungs were healthy but slightly congested on opening the thorax there was a faint spirituous odour discernible the stomach contained about a pint of completely digested food the heart was flaccid the right heart contained a considerable quantity of dark fluid blood there was a tendency to fatty degeneration of that organ i am of opinion that the deceased died from the inhalation of some such vapour as chloroform or methylene q you say there was a tendency to fatty degeneration of the heart would that have anything to do with the death of deceased a not of itself but chloroform administered while the heart was in such a state would have a decided tendency to accelerate the fatal result at the same time i may mention that the post mortem signs of poisoning by chloroform are mostly negative dr chinston was then permitted to retire and clement rankin another hansom cabman was called he deposed i am a cabman living in collingwood and usually drive a hansom cab i remember thursday last i had driven a party down to st kilda and was returning about half past one o'clock a short distance past the grammar school i was hailed by a gentleman in a light coat he was smoking a cigarette and told me to drive him to powlett street east melbourne i did so and he got out at the corner of wellington parade and powlett street he paid me half a sovereign for my fare and then walked up powlett street while i drove back to town q what time was it when you stopped at powlett street a two o'clock exactly q how do you know a because it was a still night and i heard the post office clock strike two o'clock q did you notice anything peculiar about the man in the light coat a no he looked just the same as anyone else i thought he was some swell of the town out for a lark his hat was pulled down over his eyes and i could not see his face q did you notice if he wore a ring a yes i did when he was handing me the half sovereign i saw he had a diamond ring on the forefinger of his right hand q he did not say why he was on the st kilda road at such an hour a no he did not clement rankin was then ordered to stand down and the coroner then summed up in an address of half an hour's duration there was he pointed out no doubt that the death of the deceased had resulted not from natural causes but from the effects of poisoning only slight evidence had been obtained up to the present time regarding the circumstances of the case but the only person who could be accused of committing the crime was the unknown man who entered the cab with the deceased on friday morning at the corner of the scotch church near the burke and wills' monument it had been proved that the deceased when he entered the cab was to all appearances in good health though in a state of intoxication and the fact that he was found by the cabman royston after the man in the light coat had left the cab with a handkerchief saturated with chloroform tied over his mouth would seem to show that he had died through the inhalation of chloroform which had been deliberately administered all the obtainable evidence in the case was circumstantial but nevertheless showed conclusively that a crime had been committed therefore as the circumstances of the case pointed to one conclusion the jury could not do otherwise than frame a verdict in accordance with that conclusion the jury retired at four o'clock and after an absence of a quarter of an hour returned with the following verdict that the deceased whose name there is no evidence to determine died on the th day of july from the effects of poison namely chloroform feloniously administered by some person unknown and the jury on their oaths say that the said unknown person feloniously wilfully and maliciously did murder the said deceased chapter iii one hundred pounds reward vr murder pounds reward whereas on friday the th day of july the body of a man name unknown was found in a hansom cab and whereas at an inquest held at st kilda on the th day of july a verdict of wilful murder against some person unknown was brought in by the jury the deceased is of medium height with a dark complexion dark hair clean shaved has a mole on the left temple and was dressed in evening dress notice is hereby given that a reward of pounds will be paid by the government for such information as will lead to the conviction of the murderer who is presumed to be a man who entered the hansom cab with the deceased at the corner of collins and russell streets on the morning of the th day of july chapter iv mr gorby makes a start well said mr gorby addressing his reflection in the looking glass i've been finding out things these last twenty years but this is a puzzler and no mistake mr gorby was shaving and as was his usual custom conversed with his reflection being a detective and of an extremely reticent disposition he never talked outside about his business or made a confidant of anyone when he did want to unbosom himself he retired to his bedroom and talked to his reflection in the mirror this method of procedure he found to work capitally for it relieved his sometimes overburdened mind with absolute security to himself did not the barber of midas when he found out what was under the royal crown of his master fret and chafe over his secret until one morning he stole to the reeds by the river and whispered midas has ass's ears in the like manner mr gorby felt a longing at times to give speech to his innermost secrets and having no fancy for chattering to the air he made his mirror his confidant so far it had never betrayed him while for the rest it joyed him to see his own jolly red face nodding gravely at him from out the shining surface like a mandarin this morning the detective was unusually animated in his confidences to his mirror at times too a puzzled expression would pass over his face the hansom cab murder had been placed in his hands for solution and he was trying to think how he should make a beginning hang it he said thoughtfully stropping his razor a thing with an end must have a start and if i don't get the start how am i to get the end as the mirror did not answer this question mr gorby lathered his face and started shaving in a somewhat mechanical fashion for his thoughts were with the case and ran on in this manner here's a man well say a gentleman who gets drunk and therefore don't know what he's up to another gent who is on the square comes up and sings out for a cab for him first he says he don't know him and then he shows plainly he does he walks away in a temper changes his mind comes back and gets into the cab after telling the cabby to drive down to st kilda then he polishes the drunk one off with chloroform gets out of the cab jumps into another and after getting out at powlett street vanishes that's the riddle i've got to find out and i don't think the sphinx ever had a harder one there are three things to be discovered first who is the dead man second what was he killed for and third who did it once i get hold of the first the other two won't be very hard to find out for one can tell pretty well from a man's life whether it's to anyone's interest that he should be got off the books the man that murdered that chap must have had some strong motive and i must find out what that motive was love no it wasn't that men in love don't go to such lengths in real life they do in novels and plays but i've never seen it occurring in my experience robbery no there was plenty of money in his pocket revenge now really it might be that it's a kind of thing that carries most people further than they want to go there was no violence used for his clothes weren't torn so he must have been taken sudden and before he knew what the other chap was up to by the way i don't think i examined his clothes sufficiently there might be something about them to give a clue at any rate it's worth looking after so i'll start with his clothes so mr gorby having dressed and breakfasted walked quickly to the police station where he asked for the clothes of the deceased to be shown to him when he received them he retired into a corner and commenced an exhaustive examination of them there was nothing remarkable about the coat it was merely a well cut and well made dress coat so with a grunt of dissatisfaction mr gorby threw it aside and picked up the waistcoat here he found something to interest him in the shape of a pocket made on the left hand side and on the inside of the garment now what the deuce is this for said mr gorby scratching his head it ain't usual for a dress waistcoat to have a pocket on its inside as i'm aware of and continued the detective greatly excited this ain't tailor's work he did it himself and jolly badly he did it too now he must have taken the trouble to make this pocket himself so that no one else would know anything about it and it was made to carry something valuable so valuable that he had to carry it with him even when he wore evening clothes ah here's a tear on the side nearest the outside of the waistcoat something has been pulled out roughly i begin to see now the dead man possessed something which the other man wanted and which he knew the dead one carried about with him he sees him drunk gets into the cab with him and tries to get what he wants the dead man resists upon which the other kills him by means of the chloroform which he had with him and being afraid that the cab will stop and he will be found out snatches what he wants out of the pocket so quickly that he tears the waistcoat and then makes off that's clear enough but the question is what was it he wanted a case with jewels no it could not have been anything so bulky or the dead man would never have carried it about inside his waistcoat it was something flat which could easily lie in the pocket a paper some valuable paper which the assassin wanted and for which he killed the other this is all very well said mr gorby throwing down the waistcoat and rising i have found number two before number one the first question is who is the murdered man he's a stranger in melbourne that's pretty clear or else some one would have been sure to recognise him before now by the description given in the reward now i wonder if he has any relations here no he can't or else they would have made enquiries before this well there's one thing certain he must have had a landlady or landlord unless he slept in the open air he can't have lived in an hotel as the landlord of any hotel in melbourne would have recognised him from the description especially when the whole place is ringing with the murder private lodgings more like and a landlady who doesn't read the papers and doesn't gossip or she'd have known all about it by this time now if he did live as i think in private lodgings and suddenly disappeared his landlady wouldn't keep quiet it's a whole week since the murder and as the lodger has not been seen or heard of the landlady will naturally make enquiries if however as i surmise the lodger is a stranger she will not know where to enquire therefore under these circumstances the most natural thing for her to do would be to advertise for him so i'll have a look at the newspapers mr gorby got a file of the different newspapers and looked carefully through those columns in which missing friends and people who will hear something to their advantage are generally advertised for he was murdered said mr gorby to himself on a friday morning between one and two o'clock so he might stay away till monday without exciting any suspicion on monday however the landlady would begin to feel uneasy and on tuesday she would advertise for him therefore said mr gorby running his fat finger down the column wednesday it is it did not appear in wednesday's paper neither did it in thursday's but in friday's issue exactly one week after the murder mr gorby suddenly came upon the following advertisement if mr oliver whyte does not return to possum villa grey street st kilda before the end of the week his rooms will be let again rubina hableton oliver whyte repeated mr gorby slowly and the initials on the pocket handkerchief which was proved to have belonged to the deceased were 'ow' so his name is oliver whyte is it now i wonder if rubina hableton knows anything about this matter at any rate said mr gorby putting on his hat as i'm fond of sea breezes i think i'll go down and call at possum villa grey street st kilda chapter v mrs hamilton unbosoms herself mrs hableton was a lady with a grievance as anybody who happened to become acquainted with her soon found out it is beaconsfield who says in one of his novels that no one is so interesting as when he is talking about himself and judging mrs hableton by this statement she was an extremely fascinating individual as she never by any chance talked upon any other subject what was the threat of a russian invasion to her so long as she had her special grievance once let that be removed and she would have time to attend to such minor details as affected the colony mrs hableton's particular grievance was want of money not by any means an uncommon one you might remind her but she snappishly would tell you that she knowd that but some people weren't like other people in time one came to learn what she meant by this she had come to the colonies in the early days days when the making of money in appreciable quantity was an easier matter than it is now owing to a bad husband she had failed to save any the late mr hableton for he had long since departed this life had been addicted to alcohol and at those times when he should have been earning he was usually to be found in a drinking shanty spending his wife's earnings in shouting for himself and his friends the constant drinking and the hot victorian climate soon carried him off and when mrs hableton had seen him safely under the ground in the melbourne cemetery she returned home to survey her position and see how it could be bettered she gathered together a little money from the wreck of her fortune and land being cheap purchased a small section at st kilda and built a house on it she supported herself by going out charing taking in sewing and acting as a sick nurse so among this multiplicity of occupations she managed to exist fairly well and in truth it was somewhat hard upon mrs hableton for at the time when she should have been resting and reaping the fruit of her early industry she was obliged to toil more assiduously than ever it was little consolation to her that she was but a type of many women who hardworking and thrifty themselves are married to men who are nothing but an incubus to their wives and to their families small wonder then that mrs hableton should condense all her knowledge of the male sex into the one bitter aphorism men is brutes possum villa was an unpretentious looking place with one bow window and a narrow verandah in front it was surrounded by a small garden in which were a few sparse flowers the especial delight of mrs hableton it was her way to tie an old handkerchief round her head and to go out into the garden and dig and water her beloved flowers until from sheer desperation at the overwhelming odds they gave up all attempt to grow she was engaged in this favourite occupation about a week after her lodger had gone she wondered where he was lyin' drunk in a public 'ouse i'll be bound she said viciously pulling up a weed a spendin' 'is rent and a spilin' 'is inside with beer ah men is brutes drat 'em just as she said this a shadow fell across the garden and on looking up she saw a man leaning over the fence staring at her git out she said sharply rising from her knees and shaking her trowel at the intruder i don't want no apples to day an' i don't care how cheap you sells 'em mrs hableton evidently laboured under the delusion that the man was a hawker but seeing no hand cart with him she changed her mind you're takin' a plan of the 'ouse to rob it are you she said well you needn't 'cause there ain't nothin' to rob the silver spoons as belonged to my father's mother 'avin' gone down my 'usband's throat long ago an' i ain't 'ad money to buy more i'm a lone pusson as is put on by brutes like you an' i'll thank you to leave the fence i bought with my own 'ard earned money alone and git out mrs hableton stopped short for want of breath and stood shaking her trowel and gasping like a fish out of water my dear lady said the man at the fence mildly are you no i ain't retorted mrs hableton fiercely i ain't neither a member of the 'ouse nor a school teacher to answer your questions i'm a woman as pays my rates an' taxes and don't gossip nor read yer rubbishin' newspapers nor care for the russings no how so git out don't read the papers repeated the man in a satisfied tone ah that accounts for it mrs hableton stared suspiciously at the intruder he was a burly looking man with a jovial red face clean shaven and his sharp shrewd looking grey eyes twinkled like two stars he was well dressed in a suit of light clothes and wore a stiffly starched white waistcoat with a massive gold chain stretched across it altogether he gave mrs hableton finally the impression of being a well to do tradesman and she mentally wondered what he wanted what d'y want she asked abruptly does mr oliver whyte live here asked the stranger he do an' he don't answered mrs hableton epigrammatically i ain't seen 'im for over a week so i s'pose 'e's gone on the drink like the rest of 'em but i've put sumthin' in the paper as 'ill pull him up pretty sharp and let 'im know i ain't a carpet to be trod on an' if you're a friend of 'im you can tell 'im from me 'e's a brute an' it's no more but what i expected of 'im 'e bein' a male the stranger waited placidly during the outburst and mrs hableton having stopped for want of breath he interposed quietly can i speak to you for a few moments an' who's a stoppin' of you said mrs hableton defiantly go on with you not as i expects the truth from a male but go on well really said the other looking up at the cloudless blue sky and wiping his face with a gaudy red silk pocket handkerchief it is rather hot you know and mrs hableton did not give him time to finish but walking to the gate opened it with a jerk use your legs and walk in she said and the stranger having done so she led the way into the house and into a small neat sitting room which seemed to overflow with antimacassars wool mats and wax flowers there were also a row of emu eggs on the mantelpiece a cutlass on the wall and a grimy line of hard looking little books set in a stiff row on a shelf presumably for ornament for their appearance in no way tempted one to read them the furniture was of horsehair and everything was hard and shiny so when the stranger sat down in the slippery looking arm chair that mrs hableton pushed towards him he could not help thinking it had been stuffed with stones it felt so cold and hard the lady herself sat opposite to him in another hard chair and having taken the handkerchief off her head folded it carefully laid it on her lap and then looked straight at her unexpected visitor now then she said letting her mouth fly open so rapidly that it gave one the impression that it was moved by strings like a marionette who are you what are you and what do you want the stranger put his red silk handkerchief into his hat placed it on the table and answered deliberately my name is gorby i am a detective i want mr oliver whyte he ain't here said mrs hableton thinking that whyte had got into trouble and was in danger of arrest i know that answered mr gorby then where is 'e mr gorby answered abruptly and watched the effect of his words he is dead mrs hableton grew pale and pushed back her chair no she cried he never killed 'im did 'e who never killed him queried mr gorby sharply mrs hableton evidently knew more than she intended to say for recovering herself with a violent effort she answered evasively he never killed himself mr gorby looked at her keenly and she returned his gaze with a defiant stare clever muttered the detective to himself knows something more than she chooses to tell but i'll get it out of her he paused a moment and then went on smoothly oh no he did not commit suicide what makes you think so mrs hableton did not answer but rising from her seat went over to a hard and shiny looking sideboard from whence she took a bottle of brandy and a small wine glass half filling the glass she drank it off and returned to her seat i don't take much of that stuff she said seeing the detective's eyes fixed curiously on her but you 'ave given me such a turn that i must take something to steady my nerves what do you want me to do tell me all you know said mr gorby keeping his eyes fixed on her face where was mr whyte killed she asked he was murdered in a hansom cab on the st kilda road in the open street she asked in a startled tone yes in the open street ah she drew a long breath and closed her lips firmly mr gorby said nothing he saw that she was deliberating whether or not to speak and a word from him might seal her lips so like a wise man he kept silent he obtained his reward sooner than he expected mr gorby she said at length i 'ave 'ad a 'ard struggle all my life which it came along of a bad husband who was a brute and a drunkard so god knows i ain't got much inducement to think well of the lot of you but murder she shivered slightly though the room was quite warm i didn't think of that in connection with whom mr whyte of course she answered hurriedly and who else i don't know then there is nobody else well i don't know i'm not sure the detective was puzzled what do you mean he asked i will tell you all i know said mrs hableton an' if 'e's innocent god will 'elp 'im if who is innocent i'll tell you everythin' from the start said mrs hableton an' you can judge for yourself mr gorby assented and she began it's only two months ago since i decided to take in lodgers but charin's 'ard work and sewin's tryin' for the eyes so bein' a lone woman 'avin' bin badly treated by a brute who is now dead which i was allays a good wife to 'im i thought lodgers 'ud 'elp me a little so i put a notice in the paper an' mr oliver whyte took the rooms two months ago what was he like not very tall dark face no whiskers nor moustache an' quite the gentleman anything peculiar about him mrs hableton thought for a moment well she said at length he 'ad a mole on his left temple but it was covered with 'is 'air an' few people 'ud 'ave seen it the very man said gorby to himself i'm on the right path mr whyte said 'e 'ad just come from england went on the woman which thought mr gorby accounts for the corpse not being recognised by friends he took the rooms an' said 'e'd stay with me for six months an' paid a week's rent in advance an' 'e allays paid up reg'ler like a respectable man tho' i don't believe in 'em myself he said 'e'd lots of friends an' used to go out every night who were his friends that i can't tell you for 'e were very close an' when 'e went out of doors i never knowd where 'e went which is jest like 'em for they ses they're goin' to work an' you finds 'em in the beershop mr whyte told me 'e was a goin' to marry a heiress 'e was ah interjected mr gorby sapiently he 'ad only one friend as i ever saw a mr moreland who comed 'ere with 'm an' was allays with 'im brother like what is this mr moreland like good lookin' enough said mrs hableton sourly but 'is 'abits weren't as good as 'is face 'andsom is as 'andsom does is what i ses i wonder if he knows anything about this affair thought gorby to himself where is mr moreland to be found he asked not knowin' can't tell retorted the landlady 'e used to be 'ere reg'lar but i ain't seen 'im for over a week strange very said gorby shaking his head i should like to see this mr moreland i suppose it's probable he'll call again 'abit bein' second nature i s'pose he will answered the woman 'e might call at any time mostly 'avin' called at night ah then i'll come down this evening on chance of seeing him replied the detective coincidences happen in real life as well as in novels and the gentleman in question may turn up in the nick of time now what else about mr whyte about two weeks ago or three i'm not cert'in which a gentleman called to see mr whyte 'e was very tall and wore a light coat ah a morning coat no 'e was in evenin' dress and wore a light coat over it an' a soft 'at the very man said the detective below his breath go on he went into mr whyte's room an' shut the door i don't know how long they were talkin' together but i was sittin' in this very room and heard their voices git angry and they were a swearin' at one another which is the way with men the brutes i got up and went into the passage in order to ask 'em not to make such a noise when mr whyte's door opens an' the gentleman in the light coat comes out and bangs along to the door mr whyte 'e comes to the door of 'is room an' 'e 'ollers out 'she is mine you can't do anything an' the other turns with 'is 'and on the door an' says 'i can kill you an' if you marry 'er i'll do it even in the open street' ah said mr gorby drawing a long breath and then then he bangs the door to which it's never shut easy since an' i ain't got no money to get it put right an' mr whyte walks back to his room laughing did he make any remark to you no except he'd been worried by a loonatic and what was the stranger's name that i can't tell you as mr whyte never told me he was very tall with a fair moustache an' dressed as i told you mr gorby was satisfied that is the man he said to himself who got into the hansom cab and murdered whyte there's no doubt of it whyte and he were rivals for the heiress what d'y think of it said mrs hableton curiously i think said mr gorby slowly with his eyes fixed on her i think that there is a woman at the bottom of this crime chapter vi mr gorby makes further discoveries when mr gorby left possum villa no doubt remained in his mind as to who had committed the murder the gentleman in the light coat had threatened to murder whyte even in the open street these last words being especially significant and there was no doubt that he had carried out his threat the committal of the crime was merely the fulfilment of the words uttered in anger what the detective had now to do was to find who the gentleman in the light coat was where he lived and that done to ascertain his doings on the night of the murder mrs hableton had described him but was ignorant of his name and her very vague description might apply to dozens of young men in melbourne there was only one person who in mr gorby's opinion could tell the name of the gentleman in the light coat and that was moreland the intimate friend of the dead man they appeared from the landlady's description to have been so friendly that it was more than likely whyte would have told moreland all about his angry visitor besides moreland's knowledge of his dead friend's life and habits might be able to supply information on two points namely who was most likely to gain by whyte's death and who the heiress was that the deceased boasted he would marry but the fact that moreland should be ignorant of his friend's tragic death notwithstanding that the papers were full of it and that the reward gave an excellent description of his personal appearance greatly puzzled gorby the only way in which to account for moreland's extraordinary silence was that he was out of town and had neither seen the papers nor heard anyone talking about the murder if this were the case he might either stay away for an indefinite time or return after a few days at all events it was worth while going down to st kilda in the evening on the chance that moreland might have returned to town and would call to see his friend so after his tea mr gorby put on his hat and went down to possum villa on what he could not help acknowledging to himself was a very slender possibility mrs hableton opened the door for him and in silence led the way not into her own sitting room but into a much more luxuriously furnished apartment which gorby guessed at once was that of whyte's he looked keenly round the room and his estimate of the dead man's character was formed at once fast he said to himself and a spendthrift a man who would have his friends and possibly his enemies among a very shady lot of people what led mr gorby to this belief was the evidence which surrounded him of whyte's mode of life the room was well furnished the furniture being covered with dark red velvet while the curtains on the windows and the carpet were all of the same somewhat sombre hue i did the thing properly observed mrs hableton with a satisfactory smile on her hard face when you wants young men to stop with you the rooms must be well furnished an' mr whyte paid well tho' 'e was rather pertickler about 'is food which i'm only a plain cook an' can't make them french things which spile the stomach the globes of the gas lamps were of a pale pink colour and mrs hableton having lit the gas in expectation of mr gorby's arrival there was a soft roseate hue through the room mr gorby put his hands in his capacious pockets and strolled leisurely through the room examining everything with a curious eye the walls were covered with pictures of celebrated horses and famous jockeys alternating with these were photographs of ladies of the stage mostly london actresses nellie farren kate vaughan and other burlesque stars evidently being the objects of the late mr whyte's adoration over the mantelpiece hung a rack of pipes above which were two crossed foils and under these a number of plush frames of all colours with pretty faces smiling out of them a remarkable fact being that all the photographs were of ladies and not a single male face was to be seen either on the walls or in the plush frames fond of the ladies i see said mr gorby nodding his head towards the mantelpiece a set of hussies said mrs hableton grimly closing her lips tightly i feel that ashamed when i dusts 'em as never was i don't believe in gals gettin' their picters taken with 'ardly any clothes on as if they just got out of bed but mr whyte seems to like 'em most young men do answered mr gorby dryly going over to the bookcase brutes said the lady of the house i'd drown 'em in the yarrer i would a settin' 'emselves and a callin' 'emselves lords of creation as if women were made for nothin' but to earn money 'an see 'em drink it as my 'usband did which 'is inside never seemed to 'ave enough beer an' me a poor lone woman with no family thank god or they'd 'ave taken arter their father in 'is drinkin' 'abits mr gorby took no notice of this tirade against men but stood looking at mr whyte's library which seemed to consist mostly of french novels and sporting newspapers zola said mr gorby thoughtfully taking down a flimsy yellow book rather tattered i've heard of him if his novels are as bad as his reputation i shouldn't care to read them here a knock came at the front door loud and decisive on hearing it mrs hableton sprang hastily to her feet that may be mr moreland she said as the detective quickly replaced zola in the bookcase i never 'ave visitors in the evenin' bein' a lone widder and if it is 'im i'll bring 'im in 'ere she went out and presently gorby who was listening intently heard a man's voice ask if mr whyte was at home no sir he ain't answered the landlady but there's a gentleman in his room askin' after 'im won't you come in sir for a rest yes returned the visitor and immediately afterwards mrs hableton appeared ushering in the late oliver whyte's most intimate friend he was a tall slender man with a pink and white complexion curly fair hair and a drooping straw coloured moustache altogether a strikingly aristocratic individual he was well dressed in a suit of check and had a cool nonchalant air about him and where is mr whyte to night he asked sinking into a chair and taking no more notice of the detective than if he had been an article of furniture haven't you seen him lately asked the detective quickly mr moreland stared in an insolent manner at his questioner for a few moments as if he were debating the advisability of answering or not at last he apparently decided that he would for slowly pulling off one glove he leaned back in his chair no i have not he said with a yawn i have been up the country for a few days and arrived back only this evening so i have not seen him for over a week why do you ask the detective did not answer but stood looking at the young man before him in a thoughtful manner i hope said mr moreland nonchalantly i hope you will know me again my friend but i didn't know whyte had started a lunatic asylum during my absence who are you mr gorby came forward and stood under the gas light my name is gorby sir and i am a detective he said quietly ah indeed said moreland coolly looking him up and down what has whyte been doing running away with someone's wife eh i know he has little weaknesses of that sort gorby shook his head do you know where mr whyte is to be found he asked cautiously moreland laughed not i my friend said he lightly i presume he is somewhere about here as these are his head quarters what has he been doing nothing that can surprise me i assure you he was always an erratic individual and he paid reg'ler interrupted mrs hableton pursing up her lips a most enviable reputation to possess answered the other with a sneer and one i'm afraid i'll never enjoy but why all this questioning about whyte what's the matter with him he's dead said gorby abruptly all moreland's nonchalance vanished on hearing this and he started up from his chair dead he repeated mechanically what do you mean i mean that mr oliver whyte was murdered in a hansom cab moreland stared at the detective in a puzzled sort of way and passed his hand across his forehead excuse me my head is in a whirl he said as he sat down again whyte murdered he was all right when i left him nearly two weeks ago haven't you seen the papers asked gorby not for the last two weeks replied moreland i have been up country and it was only on arriving back in town to night that i heard about the murder at all as my landlady gave me a garbled account of it but i never for a moment connected it with whyte and i came down here to see him as i had agreed to do when i left poor fellow poor fellow poor fellow and much overcome he buried his face in his hands mr gorby was touched by his evident distress and even mrs hableton permitted a small tear to roll down one hard cheek as a tribute of sorrow and sympathy presently moreland raised his head and spoke to gorby in a husky tone tell me all about it he said leaning his cheek on his hand everything you know he placed his elbows on the table and buried his face in his hands again while the detective sat down and related all that he knew about whyte's murder when it was done he lifted up his head and looked sadly at the detective if i had been in town he said this would not have happened for i was always beside whyte you knew him very well sir said the detective in a sympathetic tone we were like brothers replied moreland mournfully i came out from england in the same steamer with him and used to visit him constantly here mrs hableton nodded her head to imply that such was the case in fact said mr moreland after a moment's thought i believe i was with him on the night he was murdered mrs hableton gave a slight scream and threw her apron over her face but the detective sat unmoved though moreland's last remark had startled him considerably what's the matter said moreland turning to mrs hableton don't be afraid i didn't kill him no but i met him last thursday week and i left for the country on friday morning at half past six and what time did you meet whyte on thursday night asked gorby let me see said moreland crossing his legs and looking thoughtfully up to the ceiling it was about half past nine o'clock i was in the orient hotel in bourke street we had a drink together and then went up the street to an hotel in russell street where we had another in fact said moreland coolly we had several other drinks brutes muttered mrs hableton below her breath yes said gorby placidly go on well of it's hardly the thing to confess it said moreland looking from one to the other with a pleasant smile but in a case like this i feel it my duty to throw all social scruples aside we both became very drunk ah whyte was as we know drunk when he got into the cab and you i was not quite so bad as whyte answered the other i had my senses about me i fancy he left the hotel some minutes before one o'clock on friday morning and what did you do i remained in the hotel he left his overcoat behind him and i picked it up and followed him shortly afterwards to return it i was too drunk to see in which direction he had gone and stood leaning against the hotel door in bourke street with the coat in my hand then some one came up and snatching the coat from me made off with it and the last thing i remember was shouting out 'stop thief' then i must have fallen down for next morning i was in bed with all my clothes on and they were very muddy i got up and left town for the country by the six thirty train so i knew nothing about the matter until i came back to melbourne to night that's all i know and you had no impression that whyte was watched that night no i had not answered moreland frankly he was in pretty good spirits though he was put out at first what was the cause of his being put out moreland arose and going to a side table brought whyte's album which he laid on the table and opened in silence the contents were very much the same as the photographs in the room burlesque actresses and ladies of the ballet predominating but mr moreland turned over the pages till nearly the end when he stopped at a large cabinet photograph and pushed the album towards mr gorby that was the cause he said it was the portrait of a charmingly pretty girl dressed in white with a sailor hat on her fair hair and holding a lawn tennis racquet she was bending half forward with a winning smile and in the background bloomed a mass of tropical plants mrs hableton uttered a cry of surprise at seeing this why it's miss frettlby she said how did he know her knew her father letter of introduction and all that sort of thing said mr moreland glibly ah indeed said mr gorby slowly so mr whyte knew mark frettlby the millionaire but how did he obtain a photograph of the daughter she gave it to him said moreland the fact is whyte was very much in love with miss frettlby and she was in love with someone else finished moreland exactly yes she loved a mr brian fitzgerald to whom she is now engaged he was mad on her and whyte and he used to quarrel desperately over the young lady indeed said mr gorby and do you know this mr fitzgerald oh dear no answered the other coolly whyte's friends were not mine he was a rich young man who had good introductions i am only a poor devil on the outskirts of society trying to push my way in the world you are acquainted with his personal appearance of course observed mr gorby oh yes i can describe that said moreland in fact he's not at all unlike me which i take to be rather a compliment as he is said to be good looking he is tall rather fair talks in a bored sort of manner and is altogether what one would call a heavy swell but you must have seen him he went on turning to mrs hableton he was here three or four weeks ago whyte told me oh that was mr fitzgerald was it said mrs hableton in surprise yes he is rather like you the lady they quarrelled over must have been miss frettlby very likely said moreland rising well i'm off here's my address putting a card in gorby's hand i'm glad to be of any use to you in this matter as whyte was my dearest friend and i'll do all in my power to help you to find out the murderer i don't think that is a very difficult matter said mr gorby slowly oh you have your suspicions asked moreland looking at him i have then who do you think murdered whyte mr gorby paused a moment and then said deliberately i have an idea but i am not certain when i am certain i'll speak you think fitzgerald killed my friend said moreland i see it in your face mr gorby smiled perhaps he said ambiguously wait till i'm certain chapter vii the wool king the old greek legend of midas turning everything he touched into gold is truer than most people imagine mediaeval superstition changed the human being who possessed such a power into the philosopher's stone the stone which so many alchemists sought in the dark ages but we of the nineteenth century have given back into human hands this power of transformation but we do not ascribe it either to greek deity or to superstition we call it luck and he who possesses luck should be happy notwithstanding the proverb which hints the contrary luck means more than riches it means happiness in most of those things which the fortunate possessor of it may choose to touch should he speculate he is successful if he marry his wife will surely prove everything to be desired should he aspire to a position social or political he not only attains it but does so with comparative ease worldly wealth domestic happiness high position and complete success all these things belong to the man who has luck mark frettlby was one of these fortunate individuals and his luck was proverbial throughout australia if there was any speculation for which mark frettlby went in other men would surely follow and in every case the result turned out as well and in many cases even better than they expected he had come out in the early days of the colony with comparatively little money but his great perseverance and never failing luck had soon changed his hundreds into thousands and now at the age of fifty five he did not himself know the extent of his income he had large stations scattered all over the colony of victoria which brought him in a splendid income a charming country house where at certain seasons of the year he dispensed hospitality to his friends and a magnificent town house down in st kilda which would have been not unworthy of park lane nor were his domestic relations less happy he had a charming wife who was one of the best known and most popular ladies of melbourne and an equally charming daughter who being both pretty and an heiress naturally attracted crowds of suitors but madge frettlby was capricious and refused innumerable offers being an extremely independent young person with a mind of her own she decided to remain single as she had not yet seen anyone she could love and with her mother continued to dispense the hospitality of the mansion at st kilda but the fairy prince comes at length to every woman and in this instance he came at his appointed time in the person of one brian fitzgerald a tall handsome fair haired young man hailing from ireland he had left behind him in the old country a ruined castle and a few acres of barren land inhabited by discontented tenants who refused to pay the rent and talked darkly about the land league and other agreeable things under these circumstances with no rent coming in and no prospect of doing anything in the future brian had left the castle of his forefathers to the rats and the family banshee and had come out to australia to make his fortune he brought letters of introduction to mark frettlby and that gentleman taking a fancy to him assisted him by every means in his power under frettlby's advice brian bought a station and to his astonishment in a few years he found himself growing rich the fitzgeralds had always been more famous for spending than for saving and it was an agreeable surprise to their latest representative to find the money rolling in instead of out he began to indulge in castles in the air concerning that other castle in ireland with the barren acres and discontented tenants in his mind's eye he saw the old place rise up in all its pristine splendour from out its ruins he saw the barren acres well cultivated and the tenants happy and content he was rather doubtful on this latter point but with the rash confidence of eight and twenty determined to do his best to perform even the impossible having built and furnished his castle in the air brian naturally thought of giving it a mistress and this time actual appearance took the place of vision he fell in love with madge frettlby and having decided in his own mind that she and none other was fitted to grace the visionary halls of his renovated castle he watched his opportunity and declared himself she woman like coquetted with him for some time but at last unable to withstand the impetuosity of her irish lover confessed in a low voice with a pretty smile on her face that she could not live without him whereupon well lovers being of a conservative turn of mind and accustomed to observe the traditional forms of wooing the result can easily be guessed brian hunted all over the jewellers' shops in melbourne with lover like assiduity and having obtained a ring wherein were set turquoise stones as blue as his own eyes he placed it on her slender finger and at last felt that his engagement was an accomplished fact he next proceeded to interview the father and had just screwed up his courage to the awful ordeal when something occurred which postponed the interview indefinitely mrs frettlby was out driving and the horses took fright and bolted the coachman and groom both escaped unhurt but mrs frettlby was thrown out and killed instantly this was the first really great trouble which had fallen on mark frettlby and he seemed stunned by it shutting himself up in his room he refused to see anyone even his daughter and appeared at the funeral with a white and haggard face which shocked everyone when everything was over and the body of the late mrs frettlby was consigned to the earth with all the pomp and ceremony which money could give the bereaved husband rode home and resumed his old life but he was never the same again his face which had always been so genial and so bright became stern and sad he seldom smiled and when he did it was a faint wintry smile which seemed mechanical his whole interest in life was centred in his daughter she became the sole mistress of the st kilda mansion and her father idolised her she was apparently the one thing left to him which gave him a pleasure in existence in truth had it not been for her bright presence mark frettlby would fain have been lying beside his dead wife in the quiet graveyard after a time brian again resolved to ask mr frettlby for the hand of his daughter but for the second time fate interposed a rival suitor made his appearance and brian's hot irish temper rose in anger at him mr oliver whyte had come out from england a few months previously bringing with him a letter of introduction to mr frettlby who received him hospitably as was his custom taking advantage of this whyte lost no time in making himself perfectly at home in the st kilda mansion from the outset brian took a dislike to the new comer he was a student of lavater and prided himself on his perspicuity in reading character his opinion of whyte was anything but flattering to that gentleman while madge shared his repulsion towards the new comer on his part mr whyte was nothing if not diplomatic he affected not to notice the coldness of madge's reception of him on the contrary he began to pay her the most marked attentions much to brian's disgust at length he asked her to be his wife and notwithstanding her prompt refusal spoke to her father on the subject much to the astonishment of his daughter mr frettlby not only consented to whyte paying his addresses to madge but gave that young lady to understand that he wished her to consider his proposals favourably in spite of all madge could say he refused to alter his decision and whyte feeling himself safe began to treat brian with an insolence which was highly galling to fitzgerald's proud nature he had called on whyte at his lodgings and after a violent quarrel he had left the house vowing to kill him should he marry madge frettlby the same night fitzgerald had an interview with mr frettlby he confessed that he loved madge and that his love was returned so when madge added her entreaties to brian's mr frettlby found himself unable to withstand the combined forces and gave his consent to their engagement whyte was absent in the country for the next few days after his stormy interview with brian and it was only on his return that he learnt that madge was engaged to his rival he saw mr frettlby and having learnt from his own lips that such was the case he left the house at once and swore that he would never enter it again he little knew how prophetic were his words for on that same night he met his death in the hansom cab he had passed out of the life of both the lovers and they glad that he troubled them no more never suspected for a moment that the body of the unknown man found in royston's cab was that of oliver whyte about two weeks after whyte's disappearance mr frettlby gave a dinner party in honour of his daughter's birthday it was a delightful evening and the wide french windows which led on to the verandah were open letting in a gentle breeze from the ocean outside there was a kind of screen of tropical plants and through the tangle of the boughs the guests seated at the table could just see the waters of the bay glittering in the pale moonlight brian was seated opposite to madge and every now and then he caught a glimpse of her bright face from behind the fruit and flowers which stood in the centre of the table mark frettlby was at the head of the table and appeared in very good spirits his stern features were somewhat relaxed and he drank more wine than usual the soup had just been removed when some one who was late entered with apologies and took his seat some one in this case was mr felix rolleston one of the best known young men in melbourne he had an income of his own scribbled a little for the papers was to be seen at every house of any pretensions in melbourne and was always bright happy and full of news for details of any scandal you were safe in applying to felix rolleston he knew all that was going on both at home and abroad and his knowledge if not very accurate was at least extensive while his conversation was piquant and at times witty calton one of the leading lawyers of the city remarked that rolleston put him in mind of what beaconsfield said of one of the personages in lothair 'he wasn't an intellectual croesus but his pockets were always full of sixpences' be it said in his favour that felix was free with his sixpences the conversation which had shown signs of languishing before his arrival now brightened up so awfully sorry don't you know said felix as he slipped into a seat by madge but a fellow like me has got to be careful of his time so many calls on it so many calls in it you mean retorted madge with a disbelieving smile confess now you have been paying a round of visits well yes assented mr rolleston that's the disadvantage of having a large circle of acquaintances they give you weak tea and thin bread and butter whereas you would rather have something else finished brian there was a laugh at this but mr rolleston disdained to notice the interruption the only advantage of five o'clock tea he went on is that it brings people together and one hears what's going on ah yes rolleston said mr frettlby who was looking at him with an amused smile what news have you good news bad news and such news as you have never heard of quoted rolleston gravely yes i have a bit of news haven't you heard it rolleston felt he held sensation in his hands there was nothing he liked better well do you know he said gravely fixing in his eye glass they have found out the name of the fellow who was murdered in the hansom cab never cried every one eagerly yes went on rolleston and what's more you all know him it's never whyte said brian in a horrified tone hang it how did you know said rolleston rather annoyed at being forestalled why i just heard it at the st kilda station oh easily enough said brian rather confused i used to meet whyte constantly and as i have not seen him for the last two weeks i thought he might be the victim how did they find out asked mr frettlby idly toying with his wine glass oh one of those detective fellows you know answered felix they know everything i'm sorry to hear it said frettlby referring to the fact that whyte was murdered he had a letter of introduction to me and seemed a clever pushing young fellow a confounded cad muttered felix under his breath and brian who overheard him seemed inclined to assent for the rest of the meal nothing was talked about but the murder and the mystery in which it was shrouded when the ladies retired they chatted about it in the drawingroom but finally dropped it for more agreeable subjects the men however when the cloth was removed filled their glasses and continued the discussion with unabated vigour brian alone did not take part in the conversation he sat moodily staring at his untasted wine wrapped in a brown study what i can't make out observed rolleston who was amusing himself with cracking nuts is why they did not find out who he was before that is not hard to answer said frettlby filling his glass he was comparatively little known here as he had been out from england such a short time and i fancy that this was the only house at which he visited and look here rolleston said calton who was sitting near him if you were to find a man dead in a hansom cab dressed in evening clothes which nine men out of ten are in the habit of wearing in the evening no cards in his pockets and no name on his linen i rather think you would find it hard to discover who he was i consider it reflects great credit on the police for finding out so quickly puts one in mind of 'the leavenworth case' and all that sort of thing said felix whose reading was of the lightest description awfully exciting like putting a chinese puzzle together gad i wouldn't mind being a detective myself i'm afraid if that were the case said mr frettlby with an amused smile criminals would be pretty safe oh i don't know so much about that answered felix shrewdly some fellows are like trifle at a party froth on top but something better underneath what a greedy simile said calton sipping his wine but i'm afraid the police will have a more difficult task in discovering the man who committed the crime in my opinion he's a deuced clever fellow then you don't think he will be discovered asked brian rousing himself out of his brown study well i don't go as far as that rejoined calton but he has certainly left no trace behind him and even the red indian in whom instinct for tracking is so highly developed needs some sort of a trail to enable him to find out his enemies depend upon it went on calton warming to his subject the man who murdered whyte is no ordinary criminal the place he chose for the committal of the crime was such a safe one do you think so said rolleston why i should think that a hansom cab in a public street would be very unsafe it is that very fact that makes it safer replied mr calton epigrammatically you read de quincey's account of the marr murders in london and you will see that the more public the place the less risk there is of detection there was nothing about the gentleman in the light coat who murdered whyte to excite royston's suspicions he entered the cab with whyte no noise or anything likely to attract attention was heard and then he alighted naturally enough royston drove to st kilda and never suspected whyte was dead till he looked inside and touched him as to the man in the light coat he doesn't live in powlett street no nor in east melbourne either why not asked frettlby because he wouldn't have been such a fool as to leave a trail to his own door he did what the fox often does he doubled my opinion is that he went either right through east melbourne to fitzroy or he walked back through the fitzroy gardens into town there was no one about at that time of the morning and he could return to his lodgings hotel or wherever he is staying with impunity of course this is a theory that may be wrong but from what insight into human nature my profession has given me i think that my idea is a correct one all present agreed with mr calton's idea as it really did seem the most natural thing that would be done by a man desirous of escaping detection tell you what said felix to brian as they were on their way to the drawing room if the fellow that committed the crime is found out by gad he ought to get calton to defend him chapter viii brian takes a walk and a drive when the gentlemen entered the drawing room a young lady was engaged in playing one of those detestable pieces of the morceau de salon order in which an unoffending air is taken and variations embroidered on it till it becomes a perfect agony to distinguish the tune amid the perpetual rattle of quavers and demi semi quavers the melody in this case was over the garden wall with variations by signor thumpanini and the young lady who played it was a pupil of that celebrated italian musician when the male portion of the guests entered the air was being played in the bass with a great deal of power that is the loud pedal was down and with a perpetual rattle of treble notes trying with all their shrill might to drown the tune gad it's getting over the garden wall in a hailstorm said felix as he strolled over to the piano for he saw that the musician was dora featherweight an heiress to whom he was then paying attention in the hope that she might be induced to take the name of rolleston so when the fair dora had paralysed her audience with one final bang and rattle as if the gentleman going over the garden wall had tumbled into the cucumber frame felix was loud in his expressions of delight such power you know miss featherweight he said sinking into a chair and mentally wondering if any of the piano strings had given way at that last crash you put your heart into it and all your muscle too by gad he added mentally it's nothing but practice answered miss featherweight with a modest blush i am at the piano four hours every day good heavens thought felix what a time the family must have of it but he kept this remark to himself and screwing his eye glass into his left organ of vision merely ejaculated lucky piano miss featherweight not being able to think of any answer to this looked down and blushed while the ingenuous felix looked up and sighed madge and brian were in a corner of the room talking over whyte's death i never liked him she said but it is horrible to think of him dying like that i don't know answered brian gloomily from all i can hear dying by chloroform is a very easy death death can never be easy replied madge especially to a young man so full of health and spirits as mr whyte was i believe you are sorry he's dead said brian jealously aren't you she asked in some surprise de mortuis nil nisi bonum quoted fitzgerald but as i detested him when alive you can't expect me to regret his end madge did not answer him but glanced quickly at his face and for the first time it struck her that he looked ill what is the matter with you dear she asked placing her hand on his arm you are not looking well nothing nothing he answered hurriedly i've been a little worried about business lately but come he said rising let us go outside for i see your father has got that girl with the steam whistle voice to sing the girl with the steam whistle voice was julia featherweight the sister of rolleston's inamorata and madge stifled a laugh as she went on to the verandah with fitzgerald what a shame of you she said bursting into a laugh when they were safely outside she's been taught by the best masters how i pity them retorted brian grimly as julia wailed out meet me once again with an ear piercing shrillness i'd much rather listen to our ancestral banshee and as to meeting her again one interview would be more than enough madge did not answer but leaning lightly over the high rail of the verandah looked out into the beautiful moonlit night there were a number of people passing along the esplanade some of whom stopped and listened to julia's shrill notes one man in particular seemed to have a taste for music for he persistently stared over the fence at the house brian and madge talked of divers subjects but every time madge looked up she saw the man watching the house what does that man want brian she asked what man asked brian starting oh he went on indifferently as the watcher moved away from the gate and crossed the road on to the footpath he's taken up with the music i suppose that's all madge said nothing but she could not help thinking there was more in it than the music presently julia ceased and she proposed to go in why asked brian who was lying back in a comfortable seat smoking a cigarette it's nice enough here i must attend to my guests she answered rising you stop here and finish your cigarette and with a gay laugh she flitted into the house brian sat and smoked staring out into the moonlight the while yes the man was certainly watching the house for he sat on one of the seats and kept his eyes fixed on the brilliantly lighted windows brian threw away his cigarette and shivered slightly could anyone have seen me he muttered rising uneasily pshaw of course not and the cabman would never recognise me again curse whyte i wish i'd never set eyes upon him he gave one glance at the dark figure on the seat and then with a shiver passed into the warm well lighted room he did not feel easy in his mind and he would have felt still less so had he known that the man on the seat was one of the cleverest of the melbourne detectives mr gorby had been watching the frettlby mansion the whole evening and was getting rather annoyed moreland did not know where fitzgerald lived and as that was one of the primary facts the detective wished to ascertain he determined to watch brian's movements and to trace him home if he's the lover of that pretty girl i'll wait till he leaves the house argued mr gorby to himself as he took his seat on the esplanade he won't long remain away from her and once he leaves the house it will be no difficult matter to find out where he lives when brian made his appearance early in the evening on his way to mark frettlby's mansion he wore evening dress a light overcoat and a soft hat well i'm dashed ejaculated mr gorby when he saw fitzgerald disappear if he isn't a fool i don't know who is to go about in the very clothes he wore when he polished whyte off and think he won't be recognised melbourne ain't paris or london that he can afford to be so careless and when i put the darbies on him he will be astonished ah well he went on lighting his pipe and taking a seat on the esplanade i suppose i'll have to wait here till he comes out mr gorby's patience was pretty severely tried for hour after hour passed and no one appeared he smoked several pipes and watched the people strolling along in the soft silver moonlight a bevy of girls passed by with their arms round one another's waists then a young man and woman evidently lovers came walking along they sat down by mr gorby and looked hard at him to hint that he need not stay but the detective took no heed of them and kept his eyes steadily upon the great house opposite finally the lovers took themselves off with a very bad grace then mr gorby saw madge and brian come out on to the verandah and heard in the stillness of the night a sound weird and unearthly it was miss featherweight singing he saw madge go in shortly followed by brian the latter turned and stared at him for a moment ah said gorby to himself as he re lit his pipe your conscience is a smiting you is it wait a bit my boy till i have you in gaol then the guests came out of the house and their black figures disappeared one by one from the moonlight as they shook hands and said good night shortly after brian came down the path with frettlby at his side and madge hanging on her father's arm frettlby opened the gate and held out his hand good night fitzgerald he said in a hearty voice come soon again good night brian dearest said madge kissing him and don't forget to morrow then father and daughter closed the gate leaving brian outside and walked back to the house ah said mr gorby to himself if you only knew what i know you wouldn't be so precious kind to him brian strolled along the esplanade and crossing over passed by gorby and walked on till he was opposite the esplanade hotel then he leaned his arms on the fence and taking off his hat enjoyed the calm beauty of the hour what a good looking fellow murmured mr gorby in a regretful tone i can hardly believe it of him but the proofs are too clear the night was perfectly still not a breath of wind stirred for what breeze there had been had long since died away but brian could see the white wavelets breaking lightly on the sands the long narrow pier ran out like a black thread into the sheet of gleaming silver and away in the distance the line of the williamstown lights sparkled like some fairy illumination over all this placid scene of land and water was a sky such as dore loved a great heavy mass of rain clouds heaped one on top of the other as the rocks the titans piled to reach olympus then a break in the woof and a bit of dark blue sky could be seen glittering with stars in the midst of which sailed the serene moon shedding down her light on the cloudland beneath giving to it all one silver lining somewhat to the annoyance of mr gorby who had no eye for the picturesque brian gazed at the sky for several minutes admiring the wonderful beauty of its broken masses of light and shade at length he lit a cigarette and walked down the steps on to the pier oh suicide is it muttered mr gorby not if i can help it and he lit his pipe and followed him he found brian leaning over the parapet at the end of the pier looking at the glittering waters beneath which kept rising and falling in a dreamy rhythm that soothed and charmed the ear poor girl poor girl the detective heard him mutter as he came up if she only knew all if she at this moment he heard the approaching step and turned round sharply the detective saw that his face was ghastly pale in the moonlight and his brows wrinkled in anger what the devil do you want he burst out as gorby paused what do you mean by following me all over the place saw me watching the house said gorby to himself i'm not following you sir he said aloud i suppose the pier ain't private property i only came down here for a breath of fresh air fitzgerald did not answer but turned sharply on his heel and walked quickly up the pier leaving gorby staring after him he's getting frightened soliloquised the detective to himself as he strolled easily along keeping the black figure in front well in view i'll have to keep a sharp eye on him or he'll be clearing out of victoria brian walked rapidly up to the st kilda station for on looking at his watch he found that he would just have time to catch the last train he arrived a few minutes before it started so getting into the smoking carriage at the near end of the platform he lit a cigarette and leaning back in his seat watched the late comers hurrying into the station just as the last bell rang he saw a man rush along to catch the train it was the same man who had been watching him the whole evening and brian felt confident that he was being followed he comforted himself however with the thought that this pertinacious follower might lose the train and being in the last carriage himself he kept a look out along the platform expecting to see his friend of the esplanade standing disappointed on it there was no appearance of him so brian sinking back into his seat lamented his ill luck in not shaking off this man who kept him under such strict surveillance confound him he muttered softly i expect he will follow me to east melbourne and find out where i live but he shan't if i can help it there was no one but himself in the carriage and he felt relieved at this because he was in no humour to hear chatter murdered in a cab he said lighting a fresh cigarette and blowing a cloud of smoke a romance in real life which beats miss braddon hollow there is one thing certain he won't come between madge and me again poor madge with an impatient sigh if she only knew all there would not be much chance of our marriage but she can never find out and i don't suppose anyone else will here a thought suddenly struck him and rising out of his seat he walked to the other end of the carriage and threw himself on the cushions as if desirous to escape from himself what grounds can that man have for suspecting me he said aloud no one knows i was with whyte on that night and the police can't possibly bring forward any evidence to show that i was pshaw he went on impatiently buttoning up his coat i am like a child afraid of my shadow the fellow on the pier is only some one out for a breath of fresh air as he said himself i am quite safe at the same time he felt by no means easy in his mind and as he stepped out on to the platform at the melbourne station he looked round apprehensively as if he half expected to feel the detective's hand upon his shoulder but he saw no one at all like the man he had met on the st kilda pier and with a sigh of relief he left the station mr gorby however was not far away he was following at a safe distance brian walked slowly along flinders street apparently deep in thought he turned up russell street and did not stop until he found himself close to the burke and wills' monument the exact spot where the cab had stopped on the night of whyte's murder ah said the detective to himself as he stood in the shadow on the opposite side of the street you're going to have a look at it are you i wouldn't if i were you it's dangerous fitzgerald stood for a few minutes at the corner and then walked up collins street when he got to the cab stand opposite the melbourne club still suspecting he was followed he hailed a hansom and drove away in the direction of spring street gorby was rather perplexed at this sudden move but without delay he hailed another cab and told the driver to follow the first till it stopped two can play at that game he said settling himself back in the cab and i'll get the better of you clever as you are and you are clever he went on in a tone of admiration as he looked round the luxurious hansom to choose such a convenient place for a murder no disturbance and plenty of time for escape after you had finished it's a pleasure going after a chap like you instead of after men who tumble down like ripe fruit and ain't got any brains to keep their crime quiet while the detective thus soliloquised his cab following on the trail of the other had turned down spring street and was being driven rapidly along the wellington parade in the direction of east melbourne it then turned up powlett street at which mr gorby was glad ain't so clever as i thought he said to himself shows his nest right off without any attempt to hide it the detective however had reckoned without his host for the cab in front kept driving on through an interminable maze of streets until it seemed as though brian were determined to drive the whole night look 'ere sir cried gorby's cabman looking through his trap door in the roof of the hansom 'ow long's this 'ere game agoin' to larst my 'oss is knocked up 'e is and 'is blessed old legs is agivin' way under 'im go on go on answered the detective impatiently i'll pay you well the cabman's spirits were raised by this and by dint of coaxing and a liberal use of the whip he managed to get his jaded horse up to a pretty good pace they were in fitzroy by this time and both cabs turned out of gertrude street into nicholson street thence passed on to evelyn street and along spring street until brian's cab stopped at the corner of collins street and gorby saw him alight and dismiss his cab man he then walked down the street and disappeared into the treasury gardens confound it said the detective as he got out and paid his fare which was by no means a light one but over which he had no time to argue we've come in a circle and i do believe he lives in powlett street after all he went into the gardens and saw brian some distance ahead of him walking rapidly it was bright moonlight and he could easily distinguish fitzgerald by his light coat as he went along that noble avenue with its elms in their winter dress the moon shining through their branches wrought a fantastic tracery on the smooth asphalte and on either side gorby could see the dim white forms of the old greek gods and goddesses venus victrix with the apple in her hand which mr gorby in his happy ignorance of heathen mythology took for eve offering adam the forbidden fruit diana with the hound at her feet and bacchus and ariadne which the detective imagined were the babes in the wood he knew that each of the statues had queer names but thought they were merely allegorical passing over the bridge with the water rippling quietly underneath brian went up the smooth yellow path to where the statue of hebe holding the cup seems instinct with life and turning down the path to the right he left the gardens by the end gate near which stands the statue of the dancing faun with the great bush of scarlet geranium burning like an altar before it then he went along the wellington parade and turned up powlett street where he stopped at a house near cairns' memorial church much to mr gorby's relief who being like hamlet fat and scant of breath found himself rather exhausted he kept well in the shadow however and saw fitzgerald give one final look round before he disappeared into the house then mr gorby like the robber captain in ali baba took careful stock of the house and fixed its locality and appearance well in his mind as he intended to call at it on the morrow what i'm going to do he said as he walked slowly back to melbourne is to see his landlady when he's out and find out what time he came in on the night of the murder if it fits into the time he got out of rankin's cab i'll get out a warrant and arrest him straight off chapter ix mr gorby is satisfied at last in spite of his long walk and still longer drive brian did not sleep well that night he kept tossing and turning or lying on his back wide awake looking into the darkness and thinking of whyte towards dawn when the first faint glimmer of morning came through the venetian blinds he fell into a sort of uneasy doze haunted by horrible dreams he thought he was driving in a hansom when suddenly he found whyte by his side clad in white cerements grinning and gibbering at him with ghastly merriment then the cab went over a precipice and he fell from a great height down down with the mocking laughter still sounding in his ears until he woke with a loud cry and found it was broad daylight and that drops of perspiration were standing on his brow it was no use trying to sleep any longer so with a weary sigh he arose and went to his tub feeling jaded and worn out by worry and want of sleep his bath did him some good the cold water brightened him up and pulled him together still he could not help giving a start of surprise when he saw his face reflected in the mirror old and haggard looking with dark circles round the eyes a pleasant life i'll have of it if this sort of thing goes on he said bitterly i wish i had never seen or heard of whyte he dressed himself carefully he was not a man to neglect his toilet however worried and out of sorts he might happen to feel yet notwithstanding all his efforts the change in his appearance did not escape the eye of his landlady she was a small dried up little woman with a wrinkled yellowish face she seemed parched up and brittle whenever she moved she crackled and one went in constant dread of seeing a wizen looking limb break off short like the branch of some dead tree when she spoke it was in a voice hard and shrill not unlike the chirp of a cricket when as was frequently the case she clothed her attenuated form in a faded brown silk gown her resemblance to that lively insect was remarkable and as on this morning she crackled into brian's sitting room with the argus and his coffee a look of dismay at his altered appearance came over her stony little countenance dear me sir she chirped out in her shrill voice as she placed her burden on the table are you took bad brian shook his head want of sleep that's all mrs sampson he answered unfolding the argus ah that's because ye ain't got enough blood in yer 'ead said mrs sampson wisely for she had her own ideas on the subject of health if you ain't got blood you ain't got sleep brian looked at her as she said this for there seemed such an obvious want of blood in her veins that he wondered if she had ever slept in all her life there was my father's brother which of course makes 'im my uncle went on the landlady pouring out a cup of coffee for brian an' the blood 'e 'ad was somethin' astoundin' which it made 'im sleep that long as they 'ad to draw pints from 'im afore 'e'd wake in the mornin' brian had the argus before his face and under its friendly cover he laughed quietly to himself his blood poured out like a river went on the landlady still drawing from the rich stores of her imagination and the doctor was struck dumb with astonishment at seein' the nigagerer which burst from 'im but i'm not so full blooded myself fitzgerald again stifled a laugh and wondered that mrs sampson was not afraid of being treated as were ananias and sapphira however he said nothing but merely intimated that if she would leave the room he would take his breakfast an' if you wants anythin' else mr fitzgerald she said going to the door you knows your way to the bell as easily as i do to the kitching and with a final chirrup she crackled out of the room as soon as the door was closed brian put down his paper and roared in spite of his worries he had that extraordinary vivacious irish temperament which enables a man to put all trouble behind his back and thoroughly enjoy the present his landlady with her arabian nightlike romances was a source of great amusement to him and he felt considerably cheered by the odd turn her humour had taken this morning after a time however his laughter ceased and his troubles came crowding on him again he drank his coffee but pushed away the food which was before him and looked through the argus for the latest report about the murder case what he read made his cheek turn a shade paler than before he could feel his heart thumping wildly they've found a clue have they he muttered rising and pacing restlessly up and down i wonder what it can be i threw that man off the scent last night but if he suspects me there will be no difficulty in his finding out where i live bah what nonsense i am talking i am the victim of my own morbid imagination there is nothing to connect me with the crime so i need not be afraid of my shadow i've a good mind to leave town for a time but if i am suspected that would excite suspicion oh madge my darling he cried passionately if you only knew what i suffer i know that you would pity me but you must never know the truth never never and sinking into a chair by the window he covered his face with his hands after remaining in this position for some minutes occupied with his own gloomy thoughts he arose and rang the bell a faint crackle in the distance announced that mrs sampson had heard it and she soon came into the room looking more like a cricket than ever brian had gone into his bedroom and called out to her from there i am going down to st kilda mrs sampson he said and probably i shall not be back all day which i 'opes it 'ull do you good she answered for you've eaten nothin' an' the sea breezes is miraculous for makin' you take to your victuals my mother's brother bein' a sailor an' wonderful for 'is stomach which when 'e 'ad done a meal the table looked as if a low cuss had gone over it a what asked fitzgerald buttoning his gloves a low cuss replied the landlady in surprise at his ignorance as i've read in 'oly writ as 'ow john the baptist was partial to 'em not that i think they'd be very fillin' tho' to be sure 'e 'ad a sweet tooth and ate 'oney with 'em oh you mean locusts said brian now enlightened an' what else asked mrs sampson indignantly which tho' not bein' a scholar'd i speaks english i 'opes my mother's second cousin 'avin' 'ad first prize at a spellin' bee tho' 'e died early through brain fever 'avin' crowded 'is 'ead over much with the dictionary dear me answered brian mechanically how unfortunate he was not listening to mrs sampson's remarks he suddenly remembered an arrangement which madge had made and which up till now had slipped his memory mrs sampson he said turning round at the door i am going to bring mr frettlby and his daughter to have a cup of afternoon tea here so you might have some ready you 'ave only to ask and to 'ave answered mrs sampson hospitably with a gratified crackle of all her joints i'll make the tea sir an' also some of my own perticler cakes bein' a special kind i 'ave which my mother showed me 'ow to make 'avin' been taught by a lady as she nussed thro' the scarlet fever tho' bein' of a weak constitootion she died soon arter bein' in the 'abit of contractin' any disease she might chance on brian hurried off lest in her poe like appreciation of them mrs sampson should give vent to more charnel house horrors at one period of her life the little woman had been a nurse and it was told of her that she had frightened one of her patients into convulsions during the night by narrating to her the history of all the corpses she had laid out this ghoul like tendency in the end proved fatal to her professional advancement as soon as fitzgerald had gone she went over to the window and watched him as he walked slowly down the street a tall handsome man of whom any woman would be proud what an awful thing it are to think 'e'll be a corpse some day she chirped cheerily to herself tho' of course bein' a great swell in 'is own place 'e'll 'ave a nice airy vault which 'ud be far more comfortable than a close stuffy grave even tho' it 'as a tombstone an' vi'lets over it ah now who are you impertinence she broke off as a stout man in a light suit of clothes crossed the road and rang the bell a pullin' at the bell as if it were a pump 'andle as the gentleman at the door who was none other than mr gorby did not hear her he of course did not reply so she hurried down the stairs crackling with anger at the rough usage her bell had received mr gorby had seen brian go out and deeming it a good opportunity for enquiry had lost no time in making a start you nearly tored the bell down said mrs sampson as she presented her thin body and wrinkled face to the view of the detective i'm very sorry answered gorby meekly i'll knock next time oh no you won't said the landlady tossing her head me not 'avin' a knocker an' your 'and a scratchin' the paint off the door which it ain't been done over six months by my sister in law's cousin which 'e is a painter with a shop in fitzroy an' a wonderful heye to colour does mr fitzgerald live here asked mr gorby quietly he do replied mrs sampson but 'e's gone out an' won't be back till the arternoon which any messige 'ull be delivered to 'im punctual on 'is arrival i'm glad he's not in said mr gorby would you allow me to have a few moments' conversation what is it asked the landlady her curiosity being roused i'll tell you when we get inside answered mr gorby she looked at him with her sharp little eyes and seeing nothing disreputable about him led the way upstairs crackling loudly the whole time this so astonished mr gorby that he cast about in his own mind for an explanation of the phenomenon wants oiling about the jints was his conclusion but i never heard anything like it and she looks as if she'd snap in two she's that brittle mrs sampson took gorby into brian's sitting room and having closed the door sat down and prepared to hear what he had to say for himself i 'ope it ain't bills she said mr fitzgerald 'avin' money in the bank and everythin' respectable like a gentleman as 'e is tho' to be sure your bill might come down on him unbeknown 'e not 'avin' kept it in mind which it ain't everybody as 'ave sich a good memory as my aunt on my mother's side she 'avin' been famous for 'er dates like a 'istory not to speak of 'er multiplication tables and the numbers of people's 'ouses it's not bills answered mr gorby who having vainly attempted to stem the shrill torrent of words had given in and waited mildly until she had finished i only want to know a few things about mr fitzgerald's habits and what for asked mrs sampson indignantly are you a noospaper a putin' in articles about people who don't want to see 'emselves in print which i knows your 'abits my late 'usband 'avin' bin a printer on a paper which bust up not 'avin' the money to pay wages thro' which there was doo to him the sum of one pound seven and sixpence halfpenny which i bein' 'is widder ought to 'ave not that i expects to see it on this side of the grave oh dear no and she gave a shrill elfish laugh mr gorby seeing that unless he took the bull by the horns he would never be able to get what he wanted grew desperate and plunged in medias res i am an insurance agent he said rapidly so as to prevent any interruption and mr fitzgerald desires to insure his life in our company i therefore want to find out if he is a good life to insure does he live temperately keep early hours and in fact all about him i shall be 'appy to answer any enquiries which may be of use to you sir replied mrs sampson knowin' as i do 'ow good a insurance is to a family should the 'ead of it be taken off unexpected leavin' a widder which as i know mr fitzgerald is a goin' to be married soon an' i 'opes 'e'll be 'appy tho' thro' it i loses a lodger as 'as allays paid regler an' be'aved like a gentleman so he is a temperate man said mr gorby feeling his way cautiously not bein' a blue ribbing all the same answered mrs sampson and i never saw him the wuss for drink 'e being allays able to use his latch key and take 'is boots off afore going to bed which is no more than a woman ought to expect from a lodger she 'avin' to do 'er own washin' and he keeps good hours allays in afore the clock strikes twelve answered the landlady tho' to be sure i uses it as a figger of speech none of the clocks in the 'ouse strikin' but one which is bein' mended 'avin' broke through overwindin' is he always in before twelve asked mr gorby keenly disappointed at this answer mrs sampson eyed him waggishly and a smile crept over her wrinkled little face young men not bein' old men she replied cautiously and sinners not bein' saints it's not nattral as latch keys should be made for ornament instead of use and mr fitzgerald bein' one of the 'andsomest men in melbourne it ain't to be expected as 'e should let 'is latch key git rusty tho' 'avin' a good moral character 'e uses it with moderation but i suppose you are seldom awake when he comes in really late said the detective not as a rule assented mrs sampson bein' a 'eavy sleeper and much disposed for bed but i 'ave 'eard 'im come in arter twelve the last time bein' thursday week ah mr gorby drew a long breath for thursday week was the night upon which the murder was committed bein' troubled with my 'ead said mrs sampson thro' 'avin' been out in the sun all day a washin' i did not feel so partial to my bed that night as in general so went down to the kitching with the intent of getting a linseed poultice to put at the back of my 'ead it being calculated to remove pain as was told to me when a nuss by a doctor in the horspital 'e now bein' in business for hisself at geelong with a large family 'avin' married early just as i was leavin' the kitching i 'eard mr fitzgerald a comin' in and turnin' round looked at the clock that 'avin' been my custom when my late 'usband came in in the early mornin' i bein' a preparin' 'is meal and the time was asked mr gorby breathlessly five minutes to two o'clock replied mrs sampson mr gorby thought for a moment cab was hailed at one o'clock started for st kilda at about ten minutes past reached grammar school say at twenty five minutes past fitzgerald talks five minutes to cabman making it half past say he waited ten minutes for other cab to turn up makes it twenty minutes to two it would take another twenty minutes to get to east melbourne and five minutes to walk up here that makes it five minutes past two instead of before confound it 'was your clock in the kitchen right' he asked aloud well i think so answered mrs sampson it does get a little slow sometimes not 'avin' been cleaned for some time which my nevy bein' a watchmaker i allays 'ands it over to 'im of course it was slow on that night said gorby triumphantly he must have come in at five minutes past two which makes it right makes what right asked the landlady sharply and 'ow do you know my clock was ten minutes wrong oh it was was it asked gorby eagerly i'm not denyin' of it replied mrs sampson clocks ain't allays to be relied on more than men an' women but it won't be anythin' agin 'is insurance will it as in general 'e's in afore twelve oh all that will be quite safe answered the detective delighted with the information he had obtained is this mr fitzgerald's room yes it is replied the landlady but 'e furnished it 'imself bein' of a luxurus turn of mind not but what 'is taste is good tho' far be it from me to deny i 'elped 'im to select but 'avin' another room of the same to let any friends as you might 'ave in search of a 'ome 'ud be well looked arter my references bein' very 'igh an' my cookin' tasty an' if here a ring at the front door bell called mrs sampson away so with a hurried word to gorby she crackled downstairs left to himself mr gorby arose and looked round the room it was excellently furnished and the pictures were good at one end of the room by the window there was a writing table covered with papers it's no good looking for the papers he took out of whyte's pocket i suppose said the detective to himself as he turned over some letters as i don't know what they are and i couldn't tell them if i saw them but i'd like to find that missing glove and the bottle that held the chloroform unless he's done away with them there doesn't seem any sign of them here so i'll have a look in his bedroom there was no time to lose as mrs sampson might return at any moment so mr gorby walked quickly into the bedroom which opened off the sitting room the first thing that caught the detective's eye was a large photograph in a plush frame of madge frettlby it stood on the dressing table and was similar to that one which he had already seen in whyte's album he took it up with a laugh you're a pretty girl he said apostrophising the picture but you give your photograph to two young men both in love with you and both hot tempered the result is that one is dead and the other won't survive him long that's what you've done he put it down again and looking round the room caught sight of a light covert coat hanging behind the door and also a soft hat ah said the detective going up to the door here is the very coat you wore when you killed that poor fellow wonder what you have in the pockets and he plunged his hand into them in turn there were an old theatre programme and a pair of brown gloves in one but in the second pocket mr gorby made a discovery none other than that of the missing glove there it was a soiled white glove for the right hand with black bands down the back and the detective smiled in a gratified manner as he put it carefully in his pocket my morning has not been wasted he said to himself i've found out that he came in at a time which corresponds to all his movements after one o'clock on thursday night and this is the missing glove which clearly belonged to whyte if i could only get hold of the chloroform bottle i'd be satisfied but the chloroform bottle was not to be found though he searched most carefully for it at last hearing mrs sampson coming upstairs again he gave up the search and came back to the sitting room threw it away i suspect he said as he sat down in his old place but it doesn't matter i think i can form a chain of evidence from what i have discovered which will be sufficient to convict him besides i expect when he is arrested he will confess everything he seems to feel remorse for what he has done the door opened and mrs sampson entered the room in a state of indignation one of them chinese 'awkers she explained 'e's bin a tryin' to git the better of me over carrots as if i didn't know what carrots was and 'im a talkin' about a shillin' in his gibberish as if 'e 'adn't been brought up in a place where they don't know what a shillin' is but i never could abide furreigners ever since a frenchman as taught me 'is language made orf with my mother's silver tea pot unbeknown to 'er it bein' set out on the sideboard for company mr gorby interrupted these domestic reminiscences of mrs sampson's by stating that now she had given him all necessary information he would take his departure an' i 'opes said mrs sampson as she opened the door for him as i'll 'ave the pleasure of seein' you again should any business on be'alf of mr fitzgerald require it oh i'll see you again said mr gorby with heavy jocularity and in a way you won't like as you'll be called as a witness he added mentally did i understand you to say mrs sampson he went on that mr fitzgerald would be at home this afternoon oh yes sir 'e will answered mrs sampson a drinkin' tea with his young lady who is miss frettlby and 'as got no end of money not but what i mightn't 'ave 'ad the same 'ad i been born in a 'igher spear you need not tell mr fitzgerald i have been here said gorby closing the gate i'll probably call and see him myself this afternoon what a stout person 'e are said mrs sampson to herself as the detective walked away just like my late father who was allays fleshy bein' a great eater and fond of 'is glass but i took arter my mother's family they bein' thin like and proud of keeping 'emselves so as the vinegar they drank could testify not that i indulge in it myself she shut the door and went upstairs to take away the breakfast things while gorby was being driven along at a good pace to the police office to obtain a warrant for brian's arrest on a charge of wilful murder chapter x in the queen's name it was a broiling hot day one of those cloudless days with the blazing sun beating down on the arid streets and casting deep black shadows a real australian december day dropped by mistake of the clerk of the weather into the middle of august the previous week having been really chilly it was all the more welcome it was saturday morning and fashionable melbourne was doing the block collins street is to the southern city what bond street and the row are to london and the boulevards to paris it is on the block that people show off their new dresses bow to their friends cut their enemies and chatter small talk the same thing no doubt occurred in the appian way the fashionable street of imperial rome when catullus talked gay nonsense to lesbia and horace received the congratulations of his friends over his new volume of society verses history repeats itself and every city is bound by all the laws of civilisation to have one special street wherein the votaries of fashion can congregate collins street is not of course such a grand thoroughfare as those above mentioned but the people who stroll up and down the broad pavement are quite as charmingly dressed and as pleasant as any of the peripatetics of those famous cities as the sun brings out bright flowers so the seductive influence of the hot weather had brought out all the ladies in gay dresses of innumerable colours which made the long street look like a restless rainbow carriages were bowling smoothly along their occupants smiling and bowing as they recognised their friends on the side walk lawyers their legal quibbles finished for the week were strolling leisurely with their black bags in their hands portly merchants forgetting flinder's lane and incoming ships walked beside their pretty daughters and the representatives of swelldom were stalking along in their customary apparel of curly brimmed hats high collars and immaculate suits altogether it was a pleasant and animated scene which would have delighted the heart of anyone who was not dyspeptic or in love dyspeptic people and lovers disappointed ones of course being wont to survey the world in a cynical vein madge frettlby was engaged in that occupation so dear to every female heart shopping she was in moubray rowan and hicks' turning over ribbons and laces while the faithful brian waited for her outside and amused himself by looking at the human stream which flowed along the pavement he disliked shopping quite as much as the majority of his sex and though as a lover he felt a certain amount of self abnegation to be becoming in him it was difficult to drive away the thoughts of his pleasant club where he could be reading and smoking with perchance something cooling in a glass beside him however after she had purchased a dozen or more articles she did not want madge remembered that brian was waiting for her and hurried to the door i haven't been many minutes have i dear she said touching him lightly on the arm oh dear no answered brian looking at his watch only thirty a mere nothing considering a new dress was being discussed i thought i had been longer said madge her brow clearing but still i am sure you feel a martyr not at all replied fitzgerald handing her into the carriage i enjoyed myself very much nonsense she laughed opening her sunshade while brian took his seat beside her that's one of those social stories which every one considers themselves bound to tell from a sense of duty i'm afraid i did keep you waiting though after all she went on with a true feminine idea as to the flight of time i was only a few minutes and the rest said brian quizzically looking at her pretty face so charmingly flushed under her great white hat madge disdained to notice this interruption james she cried to the coachman drive to the melbourne club papa will be there you know she said to brian and we'll take him off to have tea with us but it's only one o'clock said brian as the town hall clock came in sight mrs sampson won't be ready oh anything will do replied madge a cup of tea and some thin bread and butter isn't hard to prepare i don't feel like lunch and papa eats so little in the middle of the day and you eat a great deal at all times finished brian with a laugh madge went on chattering in her usual lively manner and brian listened to her with delight her pleasant talk drove away the evil spirit which had been with him for the last three weeks suddenly madge made an observation as they were passing the burke and wills' monument which startled him isn't that the place where mr whyte got into the cab she asked looking at the corner near the scotch church where a vagrant of musical tendencies was playing just before the battle mother on a battered old concertina so the papers say answered brian listlessly without turning his head i wonder who the gentleman in the light coat could have been said madge as she settled herself again no one seems to know he replied evasively ah but they have a clue she said do you know brian she went on that he was dressed just like you in a light overcoat and soft hat how remarkable said fitzgerald speaking in a slightly sarcastic tone and as calmly as he was able he was dressed in the same manner as nine out of every ten young fellows in melbourne madge looked at him in surprise at the tone in which he spoke so different from his usual nonchalant way of speaking she was about to answer when the carriage stopped at the door of the melbourne club brian anxious to escape any more remarks about the murder sprang quickly out and ran up the steps into the building he found mr frettlby smoking complacently and reading the age as fitzgerald entered he looked up and putting down the paper held out his hand which the other took ah fitzgerald he said have you left the attractions of collins street for the still greater ones of clubland not i answered brian i've come to carry you off to afternoon tea with madge and myself i don't mind answered mr frettlby rising but isn't afternoon tea at half past one rather an anomaly what's in a name said fitzgerald absently as they left the room what have you been doing all morning i've been in here for the last half hour reading answered the other carelessly wool market i suppose no the hansom cab murder oh d that thing said brian hastily then seeing his companion looking at him in surprise he apologised but indeed he went on i'm nearly worried to death by people asking about whyte as if i knew all about him whereas i know nothing just as well you don't answered mr frettlby as they descended the steps together he was not a very desirable companion it was on the tip of brian's tongue to say and yet you wanted him to marry your daughter but he wisely refrained and they reached the carriage in silence now then papa said madge when they were all settled in the carriage and it was rolling along smoothly in the direction of east melbourne what have you been doing enjoying myself answered her father until you and brian came and dragged me out into this blazing sunshine well brian has been so good of late said madge that i had to reward him so i knew that nothing would please him better than to play host certainly said brian rousing himself out of a fit of abstraction especially when one has such charming visitors madge laughed at this and made a little grimace if your tea is only equal to your compliments she said lightly i'm sure papa will forgive us for dragging him away from his club papa will forgive anything murmured mr frettlby tilting his hat over his eyes so long as he gets somewhere out of the sun i can't say i care about playing the parts of shadrach meshach and abednego in the fiery furnace of a melbourne hot day there now papa is quite a host in himself said madge mischievously as the carriage drew up at mrs sampson's door no you are wrong said brian as he alighted and helped her out i am the host in myself this time if there is one thing i hate above another observed miss frettlby calmly it's a pun and especially a bad one mrs sampson was very much astonished at the early arrival of her lodger's guests and did not hesitate to express her astonishment bein' taken by surprise she said with an apologetic cackle it ain't to be suppose as miraculs can be performed with regard to cookin' the fire havin' gone out not bein' kept alight on account of the 'eat of the day which was that 'ot as never was tho' to be sure bein' a child in the early days i remember it were that 'ot as my sister's aunt was in the 'abit of roastin' her jints in the sun after telling this last romance and leaving her visitors in doubt whether the joints referred to belonged to an animal or to her sister's aunt or to herself mrs sampson crackled away downstairs to get things ready what a curious thing that landlady of yours is brian said madge from the depths of a huge arm chair i believe she's a grasshopper from the fitzroy gardens oh no she's a woman said mr frettlby cynically you can tell that by the length of her tongue a popular error papa retorted madge sharply i know plenty of men who talk far more than any woman i hope i'll never meet them then said mr frettlby for if i did i should be inclined to agree with de quincey on murder as a fine art brian winced at this and looked apprehensively at madge and saw with relief that she was not paying attention to her father but was listening intently there she is as a faint rustle at the door announced the arrival of mrs sampson and the tea tray i wonder brian you don't think the house is on fire with that queer noise always going on she wants oil yes st jacob's oil laughed brian as mrs sampson entered and placed her burden on the table not 'avin' any cake said that lady thro' not being forewarned as to the time of arrival tho' it's not ofting i'm taken by surprise except as to a 'eadache which of course is accidental to every pusson i ain't got nothin' but bread and butter the baker and grocer both bein' all that could be desired except in the way of worryin' for their money which they thinks as 'ow i keeps the bank in the 'ouse like allading's cave as i've 'eard tell in the arabian nights me 'avin' gained it as a prize for english in my early girl'ood bein' then considered a scholard an' industrus mrs sampson's shrill apologies for the absence of cake having been received she hopped out of the room and madge made the tea the service was a quaint chinese one which brian had picked up in his wanderings he used it only on special occasions as he watched madge he could not help thinking how pretty she looked with her hands moving deftly among the cups and saucers so bizarre looking with their sprawling dragons of yellow and green he half smiled to himself as he thought if they knew all i wonder if they would sit with me so unconcernedly mr frettlby too as he looked at his daughter thought of his dead wife and sighed well said madge as she handed them their tea and helped herself to some thin bread and butter you two gentlemen are most delightful company papa is sighing like a furnace and brian is staring at me with his eyes like blue china saucers you ought both to be turned forth to funerals like melancholy why like melancholy queried brian lazily i'm afraid mr fitzgerald said the young lady with a smile in her pretty black eyes that you are not a student of 'a midsummer night's dream' very likely not answered brian midsummer out here is so hot that one gets no sleep and consequently no dreams depend upon it if the four lovers whom puck treated so badly had lived in australia they wouldn't have been able to sleep for the mosquitoes what nonsense you two young people do talk said mr frettlby with an amused smile as he stirred his tea dulce est desipere in loco observed brian gravely a man who can't carry out that observation is sure not to be up to much i don't like latin said miss frettlby shaking her pretty head i agree with heine's remark that if the romans had been forced to learn it they would not have found time to conquer the world which was a much more agreeable task said brian and more profitable finished mr frettlby they chattered in this desultory fashion for a considerable time till at last madge rose and said they must go brian proposed to dine with them at st kilda and then they would all go to brock's fireworks madge consented to this and she was just pulling on her gloves when suddenly they heard a ring at the front door and presently mrs sampson talking in an excited manner at the pitch of her voice you shan't come in i tell you they heard her say shrilly so it's no good trying which i've allays 'eard as an englishman's 'ouse is 'is castle an' you're a breakin' the law as well as a spilin' the carpets which 'as bin newly put down some one made a reply then the door of brian's room was thrown open and gorby walked in followed by another man fitzgerald turned as white as a sheet for he felt instinctively that they had come for him however pulling himself together he demanded in a haughty tone the reason of the intrusion mr gorby walked straight over to where brian was standing and placed his hand on the young man's shoulder brian fitzgerald he said in a clear voice i arrest you in the queen's name for what asked brian steadily the murder of oliver whyte at this madge gave a cry it is not true she said wildly my god it's not true brian did not answer but ghastly pale held out his hands gorby slipped the handcuffs on to his wrists with a feeling of compunction despite his joy in running his man down this done fitzgerald turned round to where madge was standing pale and still as though turned into stone madge he said in a clear low voice i am going to prison perhaps to death but i swear to you by all that i hold most sacred that i am innocent of this murder my darling she made a step forward but her father stepped before her keep back he said in a hard voice there is nothing between you and that man now she turned round with an ashen face but with a proud look in her clear eyes you are wrong she answered with a touch of scorn in her voice i love him more now than ever then before her father could stop her she placed her arms round her lover's neck and kissed him wildly my darling she said with the tears streaming down her white cheeks whatever the world may say you are always dearest of all to me brian kissed her passionately and moved away madge fell down at her father's feet in a dead faint chapter xi counsel for the prisoner brian fitzgerald was arrested at a few minutes past three o'clock and by five all melbourne was ringing with the news that the perpetrator of the now famous hansom cab murder had been caught the evening papers were full of the affair and the herald went through several editions the demand being far in the excess of the supply such a crime had not been committed in melbourne since the greer shooting case in the opera house and the mystery by which it was surrounded made it even more sensational the committal of the crime in such an extraordinary place as a hansom cab had been startling enough but the discovery that the assassin was one of the most fashionable young men in melbourne was still more so brian fitzgerald being well known in society as a wealthy squatter and the future husband of one of the richest and prettiest girls in victoria it was no wonder that his arrest caused some sensation the herald which was fortunate enough to obtain the earliest information about the arrest made the best use of it and published a flaming article in its most sensational type somewhat after this fashion hansom cab tragedy arrest of the supposed murderer startling revelations in high life it is needless to say that some of the reporters had painted the lily pretty freely but the public were ready to believe everything that came out in the papers mr frettlby the day after brian's arrest had a long conversation with his daughter and wanted her to go up to yabba yallook station until the public excitement had somewhat subsided but this madge flatly refused to do i'm not going to desert him when he most needs me she said resolutely everybody has turned against him even before they have heard the facts of the case he says he is not guilty and i believe him then let him prove his innocence said her father who was pacing slowly up and down the room if he did not get into the cab with whyte he must have been somewhere else so he ought to set up the defence of an alibi he can easily do that said madge with a ray of hope lighting up her sad face he was here till eleven o'clock on thursday night very probably returned her father dryly but where was he at one o'clock on friday morning besides mr whyte left the house long before brian did she went on rapidly you must remember it was when you quarrelled with mr whyte my dear madge said frettlby stopping in front of her with a displeased look you are incorrect whyte and myself did not quarrel he asked me if it were true that fitzgerald was engaged to you and i answered 'yes' that was all and then he left the house yes and brian didn't go until two hours after said madge triumphantly he never saw mr whyte the whole night so he says replied mr frettlby significantly i believe brian before any one else in the world said his daughter hotly with flushed cheeks and flashing eyes ah but will a jury queried her father you have turned against him too answered madge her eyes filling with tears you believe him guilty i am not prepared either to deny or confirm his guilt said mr frettlby coldly i have done what i could to help him i have engaged calton to defend him and if eloquence and skill can save him you may set your mind at rest my dear father said madge throwing her arms round his neck i knew you would not desert him altogether for my sake my darling replied her father in a faltering voice as he kissed her there is nothing in the world i would not do for your sake meanwhile brian was sitting in his cell in the melbourne jail thinking sadly enough about his position he saw no hope of escape except one and that he did not intend to take advantage of it would kill her it would kill her he said feverishly as he paced to and fro over the echoing stones better that the last of the fitzgeralds should perish like a common thief than that she should know the bitter truth if i engage a lawyer to defend me he went on the first question he will ask me will be where was i on that night and if i tell him all will be discovered and then no no i cannot do it it would kill her my darling and throwing himself down on the bed he covered his face with his hands he was roused by the opening of the door of his cell and on looking up saw that it was calton who entered he was a great friend of fitzgerald's and brian was deeply touched by his kindness in coming to see him duncan calton had a kindly heart and was anxious to help brian but there was also a touch of self interest in the matter he had received a note from mr frettlby asking him to defend fitzgerald which he agreed to do with avidity as he foresaw in this case an opportunity for his name becoming known throughout the australian colonies it is true that he was already a celebrated lawyer but his reputation was purely a local one and as he foresaw that fitzgerald's trial for murder would cause a great sensation throughout australia and new zealand he determined to take advantage of it as another step in the ladder which led to fame wealth and position so this tall keen eyed man with the clean shaven face and expressive mouth advanced into the cell and took brian by the hand it is very kind of you to come and see me said fitzgerald it is at a time like this that one appreciates friendship yes of course answered the lawyer fixing his keen eyes on the other's haggard face as if he would read his innermost thoughts i came partly on my own account and partly because frettlby asked me to see you as to your defence mr frettlby said brian in a mechanical way he is very kind i thought he believed me guilty no man is considered guilty until he has been proved so answered calton evasively brian noticed how guarded the answer was for he heaved an impatient sigh and miss frettlby he asked in a hesitating manner this time he got a decided answer she declines to believe you guilty and will not hear a word said against you god bless her said brian fervently she is a true woman i suppose i am pretty well canvassed he added bitterly nothing else talked about answered calton calmly your arrest has for the present suspended all interest in theatres cricket matches and balls and you are at the present moment being discussed threadbare in clubs and drawing rooms fitzgerald writhed he was a singularly proud man and there was something inexpressibly galling in this unpleasant publicity but this is all idle chatter said calton taking a seat we must get to business of course you will accept me as your counsel it's no good my doing so replied brian gloomily the rope is already round my neck nonsense replied the lawyer cheerfully the rope is round no man's neck until he is on the scaffold now you need not say a word he went on holding up his hand as brian was about to speak i intend to defend you whether you like it or not i do not know all the facts except what the papers have stated and they exaggerate so much that one can place no reliance on them at all events i believe from my heart that you are innocent and you must walk out of the prisoner's dock a free man if only for the sake of that noble girl who loves you brian did not answer but put out his hand which the other grasped warmly i will not deny went on calton that there is a little bit of professional curiosity about me this case is such an extraordinary one that i feel as if i were unable to let slip an opportunity of doing something with it i don't care for your humdrum murders with the poker and all that sort of thing but this is something clever and therefore interesting when you are safe we will look together for the real criminal and the pleasure of the search will be proportionate to the excitement when we find him out i agree with everything you say said fitzgerald calmly but i have no defence to make no defence you are not going to confess you killed him no with an angry flush but there are certain circumstances which prevent me from defending myself what nonsense retorted calton sharply as if any circumstances should prevent a man from saving his own life but never mind i like these objections they make the nut harder to crack but the kernel must be worth getting at now i want you to answer certain questions i won't promise well we shall see said the lawyer cheerfully taking out his note book and resting it on his knee first where were you on the thursday night preceding the murder i can't tell you oh yes you can my friend you left st kilda and came up to town by the eleven o'clock train eleven twenty corrected brian calton smiled in a gratified manner as he noted this down a little diplomacy is all that's required he said mentally and where did you go then he added aloud i met rolleston in the train and we took a cab from the flinders street station up to the club what club the melbourne club yes interrogatively rolleston went home and i went into the club and played cards for a time when did you leave the club a few minutes to one o'clock in the morning and then i suppose you went home no i did not then where did you go down the street rather vague i presume you mean collins street yes you were going to meet some one i suppose i never said so probably not but young men don't wander about the streets at night without some object i was restless and wanted a walk indeed how curious you should prefer going into the heart of the dusty town for a walk to strolling through the fitzroy gardens which were on your way home it won't do you had an appointment to meet some one well er yes i thought as much man or woman i cannot tell you then i must find out for myself you can't indeed why not you don't know where to look for her her cried calton delighted at the success of his craftily put question i knew it was a woman brian did not answer but sat biting his lips with vexation now who is this woman no answer come now fitzgerald i know that young men will be young men and of course you don't like these things talked about but in this case your character must be sacrificed to save your neck what is her name i can't tell you oh you know it then well yes and you won't tell me no calton however had found out two things that pleased him first that fitzgerald had an appointment and second that it had been with a woman he pursued another line when did you last see whyte brian answered with great reluctance i saw him drunk by the scotch church what you were the man who hailed the hansom yes assented the other hesitating slightly i was the thought flashed through calton's brain as to whether the young man before him was guilty or not and he was obliged to confess that things looked very black against him then what the newspapers said was correct partly ah calton drew a long breath here was a ray of hope you did not know it was whyte when you found him lying drunk near the scotch church no i did not had i known it was he i would not have picked him up of course you recognised him afterwards yes i did and as the paper stated i dropped him and walked away why did you leave him so abruptly brian looked at his questioner in some surprise because i detested him he said shortly why did you detest him no answer was it because he admired miss frettlby and from all appearances was going to marry her well yes sullenly and now said calton impressively this is the whole point upon which the case turns why did you get into the cab with him i did not get into the cab the cabman declares that you did he is wrong i never came back after i recognised whyte then who was the man who got into the cab with whyte i don't know you have no idea not the least you are certain yes perfectly certain he seems to have been dressed exactly like you very probably i could name at least a dozen of my acquaintances who wear light coats over their evening dress and soft hats do you know if whyte had any enemies no i don't i know nothing about him beyond that he came from england a short time ago with a letter of introduction to mr frettlby and had the impertinence to ask madge to marry him where did whyte live down in st kilda at the end of grey street how do you know it was in the papers and and hesitatingly i called on him why to see if he would cease his attentions to madge and to tell him that she was engaged to me and what did he say laughed at me curse him you had high words evidently brian laughed bitterly yes we had did anyone hear you the landlady did i think i saw her in the passage as i left the house the prosecution will bring her forward as a witness very likely indifferently did you say anything likely to incriminate yourself fitzgerald turned away his head yes he answered in a low voice i spoke very wildly indeed i did not know at the time what i said did you threaten him yes i did i told him i would kill him if he persisted in his plan of marrying madge ah if the landlady can swear that she heard you say so it will form a strong piece of evidence against you so far as i can see there is only one defence and that is an easy one you must prove an alibi no answer you say you did not come back and get into the cab said calton watching the face of the other closely no it was some one else dressed like me and you have no idea who it was no i have not then after you left whyte and walked along russell street where did you go i can't tell you were you intoxicated no indignantly then you remember yes and where were you i can't tell you you refuse yes i do take time to consider you may have to pay a heavy price for your refusal if necessary i will pay it and you won't tell me where you were no i won't calton was beginning to feel annoyed you're very foolish he said sacrificing your life to some feeling of false modesty you must prove an alibi no answer at what hour did you get home about two o'clock in the morning did you walk home yes through the fitzroy gardens did you see anyone on your way home i don't know i wasn't paying attention did anyone see you not that i know of then you refuse to tell me where you were between one and two o'clock on friday morning absolutely calton thought for a moment to consider his next move did you know that whyte carried valuable papers about with him fitzgerald hesitated and turned pale no i did not know he said reluctantly the lawyer made a master stroke then why did you take them from him what had he it with him calton saw his advantage and seized it at once yes he had it with him why did you take it i did not take it i didn't even know he had it with him indeed will you kindly tell me what 'it' is brian saw the trap into which he had fallen no i will not he answered steadily was it a jewel no was it an important paper i don't know ah it was a paper i can see it in your face and was that paper of importance to you why do you ask calton fixed his keen grey eyes steadily on brian's face because he answered slowly the man to whom that paper was of such value murdered whyte brian started up ghastly pale my god he almost shrieked stretching out his hands it is true after all and he fell down on the stone pavement in a dead faint calton alarmed summoned the gaoler and between them they placed him on the bed and dashed some cold water over his face he recovered and moaned feebly while calton seeing that he was unfit to be spoken to left the prison when he got outside he stopped for a moment and looked back on the grim grey walls brian fitzgerald he said to himself you did not commit the murder yourself but you know who did chapter xii she was a true woman melbourne society was greatly agitated over the hansom cab murder before the assassin had been discovered it had been looked upon merely as a common murder and one of which society need take no cognisance beyond the bare fact of its committal but now that one of the most fashionable young men in melbourne had been arrested as the assassin it bade fair to assume gigantic proportions mrs grundy was shocked and openly talked about having nourished in her bosom a viper which had unexpectedly turned and stung her morn noon and night in toorak drawing rooms and melbourne clubs the case formed the principal subject of conversation and mrs grundy was horrified here was a young man well born the fitzgeralds my dear an irish family with royal blood in their veins well bred most charming manners i assure you and so very good looking and engaged to one of the richest girls in melbourne pretty enough madam no doubt but he wanted her money sly dog and this young man who had been petted by the ladies voted a good fellow by the men and was universally popular both in drawing room and club had committed a vulgar murder it was truly shocking what was the world coming to and what were gaols and lunatic asylums built for if men of young fitzgerald's calibre were not put in them and kept from killing people and then of course everybody asked everybody else who whyte was and why he had never been heard of before all people who had met mr whyte were worried to death with questions about him and underwent a species of social martyrdom as to who he was what he was like why he was killed and all the rest of the insane questions which some people will ask it was talked about everywhere in fashionable drawing rooms at five o'clock tea over thin bread and butter and souchong at clubs over brandies and sodas and cigarettes by working men over their mid day pint and by their wives in the congenial atmosphere of the back yard over the wash tub the papers were full of paragraphs about the famous murder and the society papers gave an interview with the prisoner by their special reporters which had been composed by those gentlemen out of the floating rumours which they heard around and their own fertile imaginations as to the prisoner's guilt everyone was certain of it the cabman royston had sworn that fitzgerald had got into the cab with whyte and when he got out whyte was dead there could be no stronger proof than that and the general opinion was that the prisoner would put in no defence but would throw himself on the mercy of the court even the church caught the contagion and ministers anglican roman catholic and presbyterian together with the lesser lights of minor denominations took the hansom cab murder as a text whereon to preach sermons on the profligacy of the age and to point out that the only ark which could save men from the rising flood of infidelity and immorality was their own particular church gad as calton remarked after hearing five or six ministers each claim their own church as the one special vessel of safety there seems to be a whole fleet of arks for mr felix rolleston acquainted as he was with all concerned the time was one of great and exceeding joy he was ever to the fore in retailing to his friends plus certain garnishments of his own any fresh evidence that chanced to come to light his endeavour was to render it the more piquant if not dramatic if you asked him for his definite opinion as to the innocence or guilt of the accused mr felix shook his head sagaciously and gave you to understand that neither he nor his dear friend calton he knew calton to nod to had yet been able to make up their minds about the matter fact is don't you know observed mr rolleston wisely there's more in this than meets the eye and all that sort of thing think 'tective fellers wrong myself don't think fitz killed whyte jolly well sure he didn't this would be followed invariably by a query in chorus of who killed him then aha felix would retort putting his head on one side like a meditative sparrow 'tective fellers can't find out that's the difficulty good mind to go on the prowl myself by jove but do you know anything of the detective business some one would ask oh dear yes with an airy wave of his hand i've read gaboreau you know awfully jolly life 'tectives despite this evasion rolleston in his heart of hearts believed fitzgerald guilty but he was one of those persons who having either tender hearts or obstinate natures the latter is perhaps the more general deem it incumbent upon them to come forward in championship of those in trouble there are doubtless those who think that nero was a pleasant young man whose cruelties were but the resultant of an overflow of high spirits and who regard henry viii in the light of a henpecked husband unfortunate in the possession of six wives these people delight in expressing their sympathy with great scoundrels of the ned kelly order they view them as the embodiment of heroism unsympathetically and disgracefully treated by the narrow understanding of the law if one half the world does kick a man when he is down the other half invariably consoles the prostrate individual with halfpence and therefore even while the weight of public opinion was dead against fitzgerald he had his share of avowed sympathy there was a comfort in this for madge not that if the whole countryside had unanimously condemned her lover she would have believed him guilty the element of logic does not enter into the championship of woman her love for a man is sufficient to exalt him to the rank of a demi god she absolutely refuses to see the clay feet of her idol when all others forsake she clings to him when all others frown she smiles on him and when he dies she reveres his memory as that of a saint and a martyr young men of the present day are prone to disparage their womenkind but a poor thing is the man who in time of trouble has no woman to stand by him with cheering words and loving comfort and so madge frettlby true woman that she was had nailed her colours to the mast she refused surrender to anyone or before any argument he was innocent and his innocence would be proved for she had an intuitive feeling that he would be saved at the eleventh hour how she knew not but she was certain that it would be so she would have gone to see brian in prison but that her father absolutely forbade her doing so therefore she was dependent upon calton for all the news respecting him and any message which she wished conveyed brian's persistent refusal to set up the defence of an alibi annoyed calton the more so as he could conceive no reason sufficiently worthy of the risk to which it subjected his client if it's for the sake of a woman he said to brian i don't care who she is it's absurdly quixotic self preservation is the first law of nature and if my neck was in danger i'd spare neither man woman nor child to save it i dare say answered brian but if you had my reasons you might think differently yet in his own mind the lawyer had a suspicion which he thought might perhaps account for brian's obstinate concealment of his movements on the fatal night he had admitted an appointment with a woman he was a handsome young fellow and probably his morals were no better than those of his fellows there was perhaps some intrigue with a married woman he had perchance been with her on that night and it was to shield her that he refused to speak even so argued calton let him lose his character rather than his life indeed the woman herself should speak it would be hard upon her i admit yet when a man's life is in danger surely nothing should stop her full of these perplexing thoughts calton went down to st kilda to have a talk with madge he intended to ask her to assist him towards obtaining the information he needed he had a great respect for madge and thought her a really clever woman it was just possible he argued that brian's great love might cause him to confess everything to her at her urgent request he found madge awaiting his arrival with anxiety where have you been all this time she said as they sat down i have been counting every moment since i saw you last how is he just the same answered calton taking off his gloves still obstinately refusing to save his own life where's your father he asked suddenly out of town she answered impatiently he will not be back for a week but what do you mean that he won't save his own life calton leaned forward and took her hand do you want to save his life he asked save his life she reiterated starting up out of her chair with a cry god knows i would die to save him pish murmured calton to himself as he looked at her glowing face and outstretched hands these women are always in extremes the fact is he said aloud fitzgerald is able to prove an alibi and he refuses to do so but why calton shrugged his shoulders that is best known to himself some quixotic idea of honour i fancy now he refuses to tell me where he was on that night perhaps he won't refuse to tell you so you must come up and see him with me and perhaps he will recover his senses and confess but my father she faltered did you not say he was out of town asked calton yes hesitated madge but he told me not to go in that case said calton rising and taking up his hat and gloves i won't ask you she laid her hand on his arm stop will it do any good calton hesitated a moment for he thought that if the reason of brian's silence was as he surmised an intrigue with a married woman he might not tell the girl he was engaged to about it but on the other hand there might be some other reason and calton trusted to madge to find it out with these thoughts in his mind he turned round yes he answered boldly it may save his life then i shall go she answered recklessly he is more to me than my father and if i can save him i will wait and she ran out of the room an uncommonly plucky girl murmured the lawyer as he looked out of the window if fitzgerald is not a fool he will certainly tell her all that is of course if he is able to queer things these women are i quite agree with balzac's saying that no wonder man couldn't understand woman seeing that god who created her failed to do so madge came back dressed to go out with a heavy veil over her face shall i order the carriage she asked pulling on her gloves with trembling fingers hardly answered calton dryly unless you want to see a paragraph in the society papers to the effect that miss madge frettlby visited mr fitzgerald in gaol no no we'll get a cab come my dear and taking her arm he led her away they reached the station and caught a train just as it started yet notwithstanding this madge was in a fever of impatience how slowly it goes she said fretfully hush my dear said calton laying his hand on her arm you will betray yourself we'll arrive soon and save him oh god grant we may she said with a low cry clasping her hands tightly together while calton could see the tears falling from under her thick veil this is not the way to do so he said almost roughly you'll be in hysterics soon control yourself for his sake for his sake she muttered and with a powerful effort of will calmed herself they soon arrived in melbourne and getting a hansom drove up quickly to the gaol after going through the usual formula they entered the cell where brian was and when the warder who accompanied them opened the door they found the young man seated on his bed he looked up and on seeing madge rose and held out his hands with a cry of delight she ran forward and threw herself on his breast with a stifled sob for a short time no one spoke calton being at the other end of the cell busy with some notes which he had taken from his pocket and the warder having retired my poor darling said madge stroking back the soft fair hair from his flushed forehead how ill you look yes answered fitzgerald with a hard laugh prison does not improve a man does it don't speak in that tone brian she said it is not like you let us sit down and talk calmly over the matter i don't see what good that will do he answered wearily as they sat down hand in hand i have talked about it to calton till my head aches and it is no good of course not retorted the lawyer sharply as he also sat down nor will it be any good until you come to your senses and tell us where you were on that night i tell you i cannot brian dear said madge softly taking his hand you must tell all for my sake fitzgerald sighed this was the hardest temptation he had yet been subjected to he felt half inclined to yield and chance the result but one look at madge's pure face steeled him against doing so what could his confession bring but sorrow and regret to one whom he loved better than his life madge he answered gravely taking her hand again you do not know what you ask yes i do she replied quickly i ask you to save yourself to prove that you are not guilty of this terrible crime and not to sacrifice your life for the sake of of here she stopped and looked helplessly at calton for she had no idea of the reason of fitzgerald's refusal to speak for the sake of a woman finished calton bluntly a woman she faltered still holding her lover's hand is is is that the reason brian averted his face yes he said in a low rough voice a sharp expression of anguish crossed her pale face and sinking her head on her hands she wept bitterly brian looked at her in a dogged kind of way and calton stared grimly at them both look here he said at length to brian in an angry voice if you want my opinion of your conduct i think it's infamous begging your pardon miss frettlby for the expression here is this noble girl who loves you with her whole heart and is ready to sacrifice everything for your sake comes to implore you to save your life and you coolly turn round and acknowledge another woman brian lifted his head haughtily and his face flushed you are wrong he said turning round sharply there is the woman for whose sake i keep silence and rising up from the bed he pointed to madge as she sobbed bitterly on it she lifted up her haggard face with an air of surprise for my sake she cried in a startled voice oh he's mad said calton shrugging his shoulders i shall put in a defence of insanity no i am not mad cried fitzgerald wildly as he caught madge in his arms my darling my darling it is for your sake that i keep silence and i shall do so though my life pays the penalty i could tell you where i was on that night and save myself but if i did you would learn a secret which would curse your life and i dare not speak i dare not madge looked up into his face with a pitiful smile as her tears fell fast dearest she said softly do not think of me but only of yourself better that i should endure misery than that you should die i do not know what the secret can be but if the telling of it will save your life do not hesitate see she cried falling on her knees i am at your feet i implore you by all the love you ever had for me to save yourself whatever the consequences may be to me madge said fitzgerald as he raised her in his arms at one time i might have done so but now it is too late there is another and stronger reason for my silence which i have only found out since my arrest i know that i am closing up the one way of escape from this charge of murder of which i am innocent but as there is a god in heaven i swear that i will not speak there was a silence in the cell broken only by madge's convulsive sobs and even calton cynical man of the world as he was felt his eyes grow wet brian led madge over to him and placed her in his arms take her away he said in a broken voice or i shall forget that i am a man and turning away he threw himself on his bed and covered his face with his hands calton did not answer him but summoned the warder and tried to lead madge away but just as they reached the door she broke away from him and running back flung herself on her lover's breast my darling my darling she sobbed kissing him you shall not die i shall save you in spite of yourself and as if afraid to trust herself longer she ran out of the cell followed by the barrister chapter xiii madge makes a discovery madge stepped into the cab and calton paused a moment to tell the cabman to drive to the railway station suddenly she stopped him tell him to drive to brian's lodgings in powlett street she said laying her hand on calton's arm what for asked the lawyer in astonishment and also to go past the melbourne club as i want to stop there what the deuce does she mean muttered calton as he gave the necessary orders and stepped into the cab and now he asked looking at his companion who had let down her veil while the cab rattled quickly down the street what do you intend to do she threw back her veil and he was astonished to see the sudden change which had come over her there were no tears now and her eyes were hard and glittering while her mouth was firmly closed she looked like a woman who had determined to do a certain thing and would carry out her intention at whatever cost i intend to save brian in spite of himself she said very distinctly but how ah you think that being a woman i can do nothing she said bitterly well you shall see i beg your pardon retorted calton with a grim smile my opinion of your sex has always been an excellent one every lawyer's is stands to reason that it should be so seeing that a woman is at the bottom of nine cases out of ten the old cry nevertheless a true one answered calton ever since the time of father adam it has been acknowledged that women influence the world either for good or evil more than men but this is not to the point he went on rather impatiently what do you propose to do simply this she answered in the first place i may tell you that i do not understand brian's statement that he keeps silence for my sake as there are no secrets in my life that can justify his saying so the facts of the case are simply these brian on the night in question left our house at st kilda at eleven o'clock he told me that he would call at the club to see if there were any letters for him and then go straight home but he might have said that merely as a blind madge shook her head no i don't think so i did not ask him where he was going he told me quite spontaneously i know brian's character and he would not tell a deliberate lie especially when there was no necessity for it i am quite certain that he intended to do as he said and go straight home when he got to the club he found a letter there which caused him to alter his mind from whom was the letter can't you guess she said impatiently from the person man or woman who wanted to see him and reveal this secret about me whatever it is he got the letter at his club and went down collins street to meet the writer at the corner of the scotch church he found mr whyte and on recognising him left in disgust and walked down russell street to keep his appointment then you don't think he came back i am certain he did not for as brian told you there are plenty of young men who wear the same kind of coat and hat as he does who the second man who got into the cab was i do not know but i will swear that it was not brian and you are going to look for that letter yes in brian's lodgings he might have burnt it he might have done a thousand things but he did not she answered brian is the most careless man in the world he would put the letter into his pocket or throw it into the waste paper basket and never think of it again in this case he did however yes he thought of the conversation he had with the writer but not of the letter itself depend upon it we shall find it in his desk or in one of the pockets of the clothes he wore that night then there's another thing said calton thoughtfully the letter might have been delivered to him between the elizabeth street railway station and the club we can soon find out about that answered madge for mr rolleston was with him at the time so he was answered calton and here is rolleston coming down the street we'll ask him now the cab was just passing the burke and wills' monument and calton's quick eye had caught a glimpse of rolleston walking down the left hand side what first attracted calton's attention was the glittering appearance of felix his well brushed top hat glittered his varnished boots glittered and his rings and scarf pin glittered in fact so resplendent was his appearance that he looked like an animated diamond coming along in the blazing sunshine the cab drove up to the kerb and rolleston stopped short as calton sprang out directly in front of him madge lay back in the cab and pulled down her veil not wishing to be recognised by felix as she knew that if he did it would soon be all over the town hallo old chap said rolleston in considerable astonishment where did you spring from from the cab of course answered calton with a laugh a kind of deus ex machina replied rolleston attempting a bad pun exactly said calton look here rolleston do you remember the night of whyte's murder you met fitzgerald at the railway station in the train corrected felix well well no matter you came up with him to the club yes and left him there did you notice if he received any message while he was with you any message repeated felix no he did not we were talking together the whole time and he spoke to no one but me was he in good spirits excellent made me laugh awfully but why all this thusness oh nothing answered calton getting back into the cab i wanted a little information from you i'll explain next time i see you good bye but i say began felix but the cab had already rattled away so mr rolleston turned angrily away i never saw anything like these lawyers he said to himself calton's a perfect whirlwind by jove meanwhile calton was talking to madge you were right he said there must have been a message for him at the club for he got none from the time he left your place and what shall we do now asked madge who having heard all the conversation did not trouble to question the lawyer about it find out at the club if any letter was waiting for him on that night said calton as the cab stopped at the door of the melbourne club here we are and with a hasty word to madge he ran up the steps he went to the office of the club to find out if any letters had been waiting for fitzgerald and found there a waiter with whom he was pretty well acquainted look here brown said the lawyer do you remember on that thursday night when the hansom cab murder took place if any letters were waiting here for mr fitzgerald well really sir hesitated brown it's so long ago that i almost forget calton gave him a sovereign oh it's not that mr calton said the waiter pocketing the coin nevertheless but i really do forget try and remember said calton shortly brown made a tremendous effort of memory and at last gave a satisfactory answer no sir there were none are you sure said calton feeling a thrill of disappointment quite sure sir replied the other confidently i went to the letter rack several times that night and i am sure there were none for mr fitzgerald ah i thought as much said calton heaving a sigh stop said brown as though struck with a sudden idea though there was no letter came by post sir there was one brought to him on that night ah said calton turning sharply at what time just before twelve o'clock sir who brought it a young woman sir said brown in a tone of disgust a bold thing beggin' your pardon sir and no better than she should be she bounced in at the door as bold as brass and sings out 'is he in' 'get out' i says 'or i'll call the perlice' 'oh no you won't' says she 'you'll give him that' and she shoves a letter into my hands 'who's him' i asks 'i dunno' she answers 'it's written there and i can't read give it him at once' and then she clears out before i could stop her and the letter was for mr fitzgerald yes sir and a precious dirty letter it was too you gave it to him of course i did sir he was playing cards and he put it in his pocket after having looked at the outside of it and went on with his game didn't he open it not then sir but he did later on about a quarter to one o'clock i was in the room and he opens it and reads it then he says to himself 'what d d impertinence' and puts it into his pocket was he disturbed well sir he looked angry like and put his coat and hat on and walked out about five minutes to one ah and he met whyte at one muttered calton there's no doubt about it the letter was an appointment and he was going to keep it what kind of a letter was it he asked very dirty sir in a square envelope but the paper was good and so was the writing that will do said calton i am much obliged to you and he hurried down to where madge awaited him in the cab you were right he said to her when the cab was once more in motion he got a letter on that night and went to keep his appointment at the time he met whyte i knew it cried madge with delight you see we will find it in his lodgings i hope so answered calton but we must not be too sanguine he may have destroyed it no he has not she replied i am convinced it is there well answered calton looking at her i don't contradict you for your feminine instincts have done more to discover the truth than my reasonings but that is often the case with women they jump in the dark where a man would hesitate and in nine cases out of ten land safely alas for the tenth said miss frettlby she has to be the one exception to prove the rule she had in a great measure recovered her spirits and seemed confident that she would save her lover but mr calton saw that her nerves were strung up to the highest pitch and that it was only her strong will that kept her from breaking down altogether by jove he muttered in an admiring tone as he watched her she's a plucky girl and fitzgerald is a lucky man to have the love of such a woman they soon arrived at brian's lodgings and the door was opened by mrs sampson who looked very disconsolate indeed the poor cricket had been blaming herself severely for the information she had given to the false insurance agent and the floods of tears which she had wept had apparently had an effect on her physical condition for she crackled less loudly than usual though her voice was as shrill as ever that sich a thing should 'ave 'appened to 'im she wailed in her thin high voice an' me that proud of 'im not 'avin' any family of my own except one as died and went up to 'eaving arter 'is father which i 'opes as they both are now angels an' friendly as 'is nature 'ad not developed in this valley of the shadder to determine 'is feelin's towards is father when 'e died bein' carried off by a chill caused by the change from 'ot to cold the weather bein' that contrary they had arrived in brian's sitting room by this time and madge sank into a chair while calton anxious to begin the search hinted to mrs sampson that she could go i'm departin' sir piped the cricket with a sad shake of her head as she opened the door knowin' as i do as 'e's as innocent as an unborn babe an' to think of me 'avin' told that 'orrid pusson who 'ad no regard for the truth all about 'im as is now in a cold cell not as what the weather ain't warm an' 'e won't want a fire as long as they allows 'im blankets what did you tell him asked calton sharply ah you may well say that lamented mrs sampson rolling her dingy handkerchief into a ball and dabbing at her red rimmed eyes which presented quite a bacchanalian appearance due be it said in justice to grief not to liquor 'avin' bin beguiled by that serping in light clothes as wanted to know if 'e allays come 'ome afore twelve which i said 'e was in the 'abit of doin' tho' to be sure 'e did sometimes use 'is latch key the night of the murder for instance oh don't say that sir said mrs sampson with a terrified crackle me bein' weak an' ailin' tho' comin' of a strong family as allays lived to a good age thro' bein' in the 'abit of wearin' flannels which my mother's father thought better nor a spilin' the inside with chemistry clever man that detective murmured calton to himself he got out of her by strategy what he never would have done by force it's a strong piece of evidence against fitzgerald but it does not matter much if he can prove an alibi you'll likely be called as a witness for the prosecution he said aloud me sir squeaked mrs sampson trembling violently and thereby producing a subdued rustle as of wind in the trees as i've never bin in the court 'cept the time as father tooked me for a treat to 'ear a murder which there's no denyin' is as good as a play 'e bein' 'ung 'avin' 'it 'is wife over the 'ead with the poker when she weren't lookin' and a berryin' 'er corpse in a back garding without even a stone to mark the place let alone a line from the psalms and a remuneration of 'er virtues well well said calton rather impatiently as he opened the door for her leave us for a short time there's a good soul miss frettlby and i want to rest and we will ring for you when we are going thank you sir said the lachrymose landlady an' i 'opes they won't 'ang 'im which is sich a choky way of dyin' but in life we are in death she went on rather incoherently as is well known to them as 'as diseases an' may be corpsed at any minute and as here calton unable to restrain his impatience any longer shut the door and they heard mrs sampson's shrill voice and subdued cracklings die away in the distance now then he said now that we have got rid of that woman and her tongue where are we to begin the desk replied madge going over to it it's the most likely place don't think so said calton shaking his head if as you say fitzgerald is a careless man he would not have troubled to put it there however perhaps we'd better look the desk was very untidy just like brian as madge remarked full of paid and unpaid bills old letters play bills ball programmes and withered flowers reminiscences of former flirtations said calton with a laugh pointing to these i should not wonder retorted miss frettlby coolly brian always was in love with some one or other but you know what lytton says 'there are many counterfeits but only one eros' so i can afford to forget these things the letter however was not to be found in the desk nor was it in the sitting room they tried the bedroom but with no better result madge was about to give up the search in despair when suddenly calton's eye fell on the waste paper basket which by some unaccountable reason they had over looked the basket was half full in fact more than half and on looking at it a sudden thought struck the lawyer he rang the bell and presently mrs sampson made her appearance how long has that waste paper basket been standing like that he asked pointing to it it bein' the only fault i 'ad to find with 'im said mrs sampson 'e bein' that untidy that 'e a never let me clean it out until 'e told me pussonly 'e said as 'ow 'e throwed things into it as 'e might 'ave to look up again an' i 'aven't touched it for more nor six weeks 'opin' you won't think me a bad 'ousekeeper it bein' 'is own wish bein' fond of litter an' sich like six weeks repeated calton with a look at madge ah and he got the letter four weeks ago depend upon it we shall find it there madge gave a cry and falling on her knees emptied the basket out on the floor and both she and calton were soon as busy among the fragments of paper as though they were rag pickers 'opin they ain't orf their 'eads murmured mrs sampson as she went to the door but it looks like it they bein' suddenly a cry broke from madge as she drew out of the mass of paper a half burnt letter written on thick and creamy looking paper at last she cried rising off her knees and smoothing it out i knew he had not destroyed it pretty nearly however said calton as his eye glanced rapidly over it it's almost useless as it is there's no name to it illustration fac simile of the letter he took it over to the window and spread it out upon the table it was dirty and half burnt but still it was a clue the above is a fac simile of the letter there is not much to be gained from that i'm afraid said madge sadly it shows that he had an appointment but where calton did not answer but leaning his head on his hands stared hard at the paper at last he jumped up with a cry i have it he said in an excited tone look at that paper see how creamy and white it is and above all look at the printing in the corner 'ot villa toorak' then he went down to toorak in an hour and back again hardly then it was not written from toorak no it was written in one of the melbourne back slums how do you know look at the girl who brought it said calton quickly a disreputable woman one far more likely to come from the back slums than from toorak as to the paper three months ago there was a robbery at toorak and this is some of the paper that was stolen by the thieves madge said nothing but her sparkling eyes and the nervous trembling of her hands showed her excitement i will see a detective this evening said calton exultingly find out where this letter came from and who wrote it we'll save him yet he said placing the precious letter carefully in his pocket book you think that you will be able to find the woman who wrote that hum said the lawyer looking thoughtful she may be dead as the letter says she is in a dying condition however if i can find the woman who delivered the letter at the club and who waited for fitzgerald at the corner of bourke and russell streets that will be sufficient all i want to prove is that he was not in the hansom cab with whyte and do you think you can do that depends upon this letter said calton tapping his pocket book with his finger i'll tell you to morrow shortly afterwards they left the house and when calton put madge safely into the st kilda train her heart felt lighter than it had done since fitzgerald's arrest chapter xiv another richmond in the field there is an old adage that says like draws to like the antithesis of this is probably that unlike repels unlike but there are times when individualism does not enter into the matter and fate alone by throwing two persons together sets up a state congenial or uncongenial as the case may be fate chose to throw together mr gorby and mr kilsip and each was something more than uncongenial to the other each was equally clever in their common profession each was a universal favourite yet each hated the other they were as fire and water to one another and when they came together invariably there was trouble kilsip was tall and slender gorby was short and stout kilsip looked clever gorby wore a smile of self satisfaction which alone was sufficient to prevent his doing so yet singularly enough it was this very smile that proved most useful to gorby in the pursuit of his calling it enabled him to come at information where his sharp looking colleague might try in vain the hearts of all went forth to gorby's sweet smile and insinuating manner but when kilsip appeared people were wont to shut up and to retire promptly like alarmed snails within their shells gorby gave the lie direct to those who hold that the face is ever the index to the mind kilsip on the other hand with his hawk like countenance his brilliant black eyes hooked nose and small thin lipped mouth endorsed the theory his complexion was quite colourless and his hair was jet black altogether he could not be called fair to look upon his craft and cunning were of the snake like order so long as he conducted his enquiries in secret he was generally successful but once let him appear personally on the scene and failure was assured to him thus while kilsip passed as the cleverer gorby was invariably the more successful at all events ostensibly when therefore this hansom cab murder case was put into gorby's hands the soul of kilsip was smitten with envy and when fitzgerald was arrested and all the evidence collected by gorby seemed to point so conclusively to his guilt kilsip writhed in secret over the triumph of his enemy though he would only have been too glad to say that gorby had got hold of the wrong man yet the evidence was so conclusive that such a thought never entered his head until he received a note from mr calton asking him to call at his office that evening at eight o'clock with reference to the murder kilsip knew that calton was counsel for the prisoner he guessed that he was wanted to follow up a clue and he determined to devote himself to whatever calton might require of him if only to prove gorby to be wrong so pleased was he at the mere possibility of triumphing over his rival that on casually meeting him he stopped and invited him to drink the primary effect of his sudden and unusual hospitality was to arouse all gorby's suspicions but on second thoughts deeming himself quite a match for kilsip both mentally and physically gorby accepted the invitation ah said kilsip in his soft low voice rubbing his lean white hands together as they sat over their drinks you're a lucky man to have laid your hands on that hansom cab murderer so quickly yes i flatter myself i did manage it pretty well said gorby lighting his pipe i had no idea that it would be so simple though mind you it required a lot of thought before i got a proper start i suppose you're pretty sure he's the man you want pursued kilsip softly with a brilliant flash of his black eyes pretty sure indeed retorted mr gorby scornfully there ain't no pretty sure about it i'd take my bible oath he's the man he and whyte hated one another he says to whyte 'i'll kill you if i've got to do it in the open street' he meets whyte drunk a fact which he acknowledges himself he clears out and the cabman swears he comes back then he gets into the cab with a living man and when he comes out leaves a dead one he drives to east melbourne and gets into the house at a time which his landlady can prove just the time that a cab would take to drive from the grammar school on the st kilda road if you ain't a fool kilsip you'll see as there's no doubt about it it looks all square enough said kilsip who wondered what evidence calton could have found to contradict such a plain statement of fact and what's his defence mr calton's the only man as knows that answered gorby finishing his drink but clever and all as he is he can't put anything in that can go against my evidence don't you be too sure of that sneered kilsip whose soul was devoured with envy oh but i am retorted gorby getting as red as a turkey cock at the sneer you're jealous you are because you haven't got a finger in the pie ah but i may have yet going a hunting yourself are you said gorby with an indignant snort a hunting for what for a man as is already caught i don't believe you've got the right man remarked kilsip deliberately mr gorby looked upon him with a smile of pity no of course you don't just because i've caught him perhaps when you see him hanged you'll believe it then you're a smart man you are retorted kilsip but you ain't the pope to be infallible and what grounds have you for saying he's not the right man demanded gorby kilsip smiled and stole softly across the room like a cat you don't think i'm such a fool as to tell you but you ain't so safe nor clever as you think and with another irritating smile he went out he's a regular snake said gorby to himself as the door closed on his brother detective but he's bragging now there isn't a link missing in the chain of evidence against fitzgerald so i defy him he can do his worst at eight o'clock on that night the soft footed and soft voiced detective presented himself at calton's office he found the lawyer impatiently waiting for him kilsip closed the door softly and then taking a seat opposite to calton waited for him to speak the lawyer however first handed him a cigar and then producing a bottle of whisky and two glasses from some mysterious recess he filled one and pushed it towards the detective kilsip accepted these little attentions with the utmost gravity yet they were not without their effect on him as the keen eyed lawyer saw calton was a great believer in diplomacy and never lost an opportunity of inculcating it into young men starting in life diplomacy said calton to one young aspirant for legal honours is the oil we cast on the troubled waters of social professional and political life and if you can by a little tact manage mankind you are pretty certain to get on in this world calton was a man who practised what he preached he believed kilsip to have that feline nature which likes to be stroked to be made much of and he paid him these little attentions knowing full well they would bear their fruit he also knew that kilsip entertained no friendly feeling for gorby that in fact he bore him hatred and he determined that this feeling which existed between the two men should serve him to the end he had in view i suppose he said leaning back in his chair and watching the wreaths of blue smoke curling from his cigar i suppose you know all the ins and the outs of the hansom cab murder i should rather think so said kilsip with a curious light in his queer eyes why gorby does nothing but brag about it and his smartness in catching the supposed murderer aha said calton leaning forward and putting his arms on the table supposed murderer eh does that mean that he hasn't been convicted by a jury or that you think that fitzgerald is innocent kilsip stared hard at the lawyer in a vague kind of way slowly rubbing his hands together well he said at length in a deliberate manner before i got your note i was convinced gorby had got hold of the right man but when i heard that you wanted to see me and knowing you are defending the prisoner i guessed that you must have found something in his favour which you wanted me to look after right said calton laconically as mr fitzgerald said he met whyte at the corner and hailed the cab went on the detective how do you know that interrupted calton sharply gorby told me how the devil did he find out cried the lawyer with genuine surprise because he is always poking and prying about said kilsip forgetting in his indignation that such poking and prying formed part of detective business but at any rate he went on quickly if mr fitzgerald did leave mr whyte the only chance he's got of proving his innocence is that he did not come back as the cabman alleged then i suppose you think that fitzgerald will prove an alibi said calton well sir answered kilsip modestly of course you know more about the case than i do but that is the only defence i can see he can make well he's not going to put in such a defence then he must be guilty said kilsip promptly not necessarily returned the barrister drily but if he wants to save his neck he'll have to prove an alibi persisted the other that's just where the point is answered calton he doesn't want to save his neck kilsip looking rather bewildered took a sip of whisky and waited to hear what mr calton had to say the fact is said calton lighting a fresh cigar he has some extraordinary idea in his head he refuses absolutely to say where he was on that night i understand said kilsip nodding his head woman no nothing of the kind retorted calton hastily i thought so at first but i was wrong he went to see a dying woman who wished to tell him something what about that's just what i can't tell you answered calton quickly it must have been something important for she sent for him in great haste and he was by her bedside between the hours of one and two on friday morning then he did not return to the cab no he did not he went to keep his appointment but for some reason or other he won't tell where this appointment was i went to his rooms to day and found this half burnt letter asking him to come calton handed the letter to kilsip who placed it on the table and examined it carefully this was written on thursday said the detective of course you can see that from the date and whyte was murdered on friday the th it was written at something villa toorak pursued kilsip still examining the paper oh i understand he went down there hardly retorted calton in a sarcastic tone he couldn't very well go down there have an interview and be back in east melbourne in one hour the cabman royston can prove that he was at russell street at one o'clock and his landlady that he entered his lodging in east melbourne at two no he wasn't at toorak when was this letter delivered shortly before twelve o'clock at the melbourne club by a girl who from what the waiter saw of her appears to be a disreputable individual you will see it says bearer will wait him at bourke street and as another street is mentioned and as fitzgerald after leaving whyte went down russell street to keep his appointment the most logical conclusion is that the bearer of the letter waited for him at the corner of bourke and russell streets now went on the lawyer i want to find out who the girl that brought the letter is but how god bless my soul kilsip how stupid you are cried calton his irritation getting the better of him can't you understand that paper came from one of the back slums therefore it must have been stolen a sudden light flashed into kilsip's eyes talbot villa toorak he cried quickly snatching up the letter again and examining it with great attention where that burglary took place exactly said calton smiling complacently now do you understand what i want you must take me to the crib in the back slums where the articles stolen from the house in toorak were hidden this paper pointing to the letter is part of the swag left behind and must have been used by someone there brian fitzgerald obeyed the directions given in the letter and he was there at the time of the murder i understand said kilsip with a gratified purr there were four men engaged in that burglary and they hid the swag at mother guttersnipe's crib in a lane off little bourke street but hang it a swell like mr fitzgerald in evening dress couldn't very well have gone down there unless he had some one with him well known in the locality finished calton rapidly exactly that woman who delivered the letter at the club guided him judging from the waiter's description of her appearance i should think she was pretty well known about the slums well said kilsip rising and looking at his watch it is now nine o'clock so if you like we will go to the old hag's place at once dying woman he said as if struck by a sudden thought there was a woman who died there about four weeks ago who was she asked calton who was putting on his overcoat some relation of mother guttersnipe's i fancy answered kilsip as they left the office i don't know exactly what she was she was called the 'queen' and a precious handsome woman she must have been came from sydney about three months ago and from what i can make out was not long from england died of consumption on the thursday night before the murder chapter xv a woman of the people bourke street is a more crowded thoroughfare than collins street especially at night the theatres that it contains are in themselves sufficient for the gathering of a considerable crowd it is a grimy crowd for the most part round the doors of the hotels a number of ragged and shabby looking individuals collect waiting till some kind friend shall invite them to step inside further on a knot of horsey looking men are to be seen standing under the opera house verandah giving and taking odds about the melbourne cup or some other meeting here and there are ragged street arabs selling matches and newspapers and against the verandah post in the full blaze of the electric light leans a weary draggled looking woman one arm clasping a baby to her breast and the other holding a pile of newspapers while she drones out in a hoarse voice 'erald third 'dition one penny until the ear wearies of the constant repetition cabs rattle incessantly along the street here a fast looking hansom with a rakish horse bearing some gilded youth to his club there a dingy looking vehicle drawn by a lank quadruped which staggers blindly down the street alternating with these carriages dash along with their well groomed horses and within the vision of bright eyes white dresses and the sparkle of diamonds then further up just on the verge of the pavement three violins and a harp are playing a german waltz to an admiring crowd of attentive spectators if there is one thing which the melbourne folk love more than another it is music their fondness for it is only equalled by their admiration for horse racing any street band which plays at all decently may be sure of a good audience and a substantial remuneration for their performance some writer has described melbourne as glasgow with the sky of alexandria and certainly the beautiful climate of australia so italian in its brightness must have a great effect on the nature of such an adaptable race as the anglo saxon in spite of the dismal prognostications of marcus clarke regarding the future australian whom he describes as being a tall coarse strong jawed greedy pushing talented man excelling in swimming and horsemanship it is more likely that he will be a cultured indolent individual with an intense appreciation of the arts and sciences and a dislike to hard work and utilitarian principles climatic influence should be taken into account with regard to the future australian and our posterity will no more resemble us than the luxurious venetians resembled their hardy forefathers who first started to build on those lonely sandy islands of the adriatic this was the conclusion at which mr calton arrived as he followed his guide through the crowded streets and saw with what deep interest the crowd listened to the rhythmic strains of strauss and the sparkling melodies of offenbach the brilliantly lit street with the never ceasing stream of people pouring along the shrill cries of the street arabs the rattle of vehicles and the fitful strains of music all made up a scene which fascinated him and he could have gone on wandering all night watching the myriad phases of human character constantly passing before his eyes but his guide with whom familiarity with the proletarians had in a great measure bred indifference hurried him away to little bourke street where the narrowness of the thoroughfare with the high buildings on each side the dim light of the sparsely scattered gas lamps and the few ragged looking figures slouching along formed a strong contrast to the brilliant and crowded scene they had just left turning off little bourke street the detective led the way down a dark lane it was as hot as a furnace from the accumulated heat of the day to look up at the clear starlit sky was to experience a sensation of delicious coolness keep close to me whispered kilsip touching the barrister on the arm we may meet some nasty customers about here it was not quite dark for the atmosphere had that luminous kind of haze so observable in australian twilights and this weird light was just sufficient to make the darkness visible kilsip and the barrister kept for safety in the middle of the alley so that no one could spring upon them unaware and they could see sometimes on the one side a man cowering back into the black shadow or on the other a woman with disordered hair and bare bosom leaning out of a window trying to get a breath of fresh air there were also some children playing in the dried up gutter and their shrill young voices came echoing strangely through the gloom mingling with a bacchanalian sort of song sung by a man as he slouched along unsteadily over the rough stones now and then a mild looking string of chinamen stole along clad in their dull hued blue blouses either chattering shrilly like a lot of parrots or moving silently down the alley with a stolid oriental apathy on their yellow faces here and there came a stream of warm light through an open door and within the mongolians were gathered round the gambling tables playing fan tan or leaving the seductions of their favourite pastime to glide soft footed to the many cook shops where enticing looking fowls and turkeys already cooked were awaiting purchasers kilsip turning to the left led the barrister down another and still narrower lane the darkness and gloom of which made the lawyer shudder as he wondered how human beings could live in such murky places at last to calton's relief for he felt somewhat bewildered by the darkness and narrowness of the lanes through which he had been taken the detective stopped before a door which he opened and stepping inside beckoned to the barrister to follow calton did so and found himself in a low dark ill smelling passage at the end a faint light glimmered kilsip caught his companion by the arm and guided him carefully along the passage there was much need of this caution for calton could feel that the rotten boards were full of holes into which one or the other of his feet kept slipping from time to time while he could hear the rats squeaking and scampering away on all sides just as they got to the end of this tunnel for it could be called nothing else the light suddenly went out and they were left in complete darkness light that cried the detective in a peremptory tone of voice what do you mean by dowsing the glim thieves' argot was evidently well understood here for there was a shuffle in the dark a muttered voice and someone lit a candle calton saw that the light was held by an elfish looking child tangled masses of black hair hung over her scowling white face as she crouched down on the floor against the damp wall she looked up defiantly yet fearfully at the detective where's mother guttersnipe asked kilsip touching her with his foot she seemed to resent the indignity and rose quickly to her feet upstairs she replied jerking her head in the direction of the right wall following her direction calton his eyes now somewhat accustomed to the gloom could discern a gaping black chasm which he presumed was the stair alluded to yer won't get much out of 'er to night she's a going to start 'er booze she is never mind what she's doing or about to do said kilsip sharply take me to her at once the girl looked him sullenly up and down then she led the way into the black chasm and up the stairs they were so shaky as to make calton fear they might give way as they toiled slowly up the broken steps he held tightly to his companion's arm at last they stopped at a door through the cracks of which a faint glimmer of light was to be seen here the girl gave a shrill whistle and the door opened still preceded by their elfish guide calton and the detective stepped through the doorway a curious scene was before them a small square room with a low roof from which the paper mildewed and torn hung in shreds on the left hand at the far end was a kind of low stretcher upon which a woman almost naked lay amid a heap of greasy clothes she appeared to be ill for she kept tossing her head from side to side restlessly and every now and then sang snatches of song in a cracked voice in the centre of the room was a rough deal table upon which stood a guttering tallow candle which but faintly illuminated the scene and a half empty rectangular bottle of schnapps with a broken cup beside it in front of these signs of festivity sat an old woman with a pack of cards spread out before her and from which she had evidently been telling the fortune of a villainous looking young man who had opened the door and who stood looking at the detective with no very friendly expression of countenance he wore a greasy brown velvet coat much patched and a black wide awake hat pulled down over his eyes from his expression so scowling and vindictive was it the barrister judged his ultimate destiny to lie between pentridge and the gallows as they entered the fortune teller raised her head and shading her eyes with one skinny hand looked curiously at the new comers calton thought he had never seen such a repulsive looking old crone and in truth her ugliness was in its very grotesqueness well worthy the pencil of a dore her face was seamed and lined with innumerable wrinkles clearly defined by the dirt which was in them bushy grey eyebrows drawn frowningly over two piercing black eyes whose light was undimmed by age a hook nose like the beak of a bird of prey and a thin lipped mouth devoid of teeth her hair was very luxurious and almost white and was tied up in a great bunch by a greasy bit of black ribbon as to her chin calton when he saw it wagging to and fro involuntarily quoted macbeth's lines ye should be women and yet your beards forbid me to interpret that ye are so she was no bad representative of the weird sisters as they entered she eyed them viciously demanding what the blazes they wanted want your booze cried the child with an elfish laugh as she shook back her tangled hair get out you whelp croaked the old hag shaking one skinny fist at her or i'll tear yer 'eart out yes she can go said kilsip nodding to the girl and you can clear too he added sharply turning to the young man who stood still holding the door open at first he seemed inclined to dispute the detective's order but ultimately obeyed him muttering as he went out something about the blooming cheek of showin' swells cove's cribs the child followed him out her exit being accelerated by mother guttersnipe who with a rapidity only attained by long practice seized the shoe from one of her feet and flung it at the head of the rapidly retreating girl wait till i ketches yer lizer she shrieked with a volley of oaths i'll break yer 'ead for ye lizer responded with a shrill laugh of disdain and vanished through the shaky door which she closed after her when she had disappeared mother guttersnipe took a drink from the broken cup and gathering all her greasy cards together in a business like way looked insinuatingly at calton with a suggestive leer it's the future ye want unveiled dearie she croaked rapidly shuffling the cards an' old mother 'ull tell no she won't interrupted the detective sharply i've come on business the old woman started at this and looked keenly at him from under her bushy eyebrows what 'av the boys been up to now she asked harshly there ain't no swag 'ere this time just then the sick woman who had been restlessly tossing on the bed commenced singing a snatch of the quaint old ballad of barbara allen oh mither mither mak' my bed an' mak' it saft an' narrow since my true love died for me to day i'll die for him to morrow shut up cuss you yelled mother guttersnipe viciously or i'll knock yer bloomin' 'ead orf and she seized the square bottle as if to carry out her threat but altering her mind she poured some of its contents into the cup and drank it off with avidity the woman seems ill said calton casting a shuddering glance at the stretcher so she are growled mother guttersnipe angrily she ought to be in yarrer bend she ought instead of stoppin' 'ere an' singin' them beastly things which makes my blood run cold just 'ear 'er she said viciously as the sick woman broke out once more oh little did my mither think when first she cradled me i'd die sa far away fra home upon the gallows tree yah said the old woman hastily drinking some more gin out of the cup she's allays a talkin' of dyin' an' gallers as if they were nice things to jawr about who was that woman who died here three or four weeks ago asked kilsip sharply 'ow should i know retorted mother guttersnipe sullenly i didn't kill 'er did i it were the brandy she drank she was allays drinkin' cuss her do you remember the night she died no i don't answered the beldame frankly i were drunk blind bloomin' blazin' drunk s'elp me you're always drunk said kilsip what if i am snarled the woman seizing her bottle you don't pay fur it yes i'm drunk i'm allays drunk i was drunk last night an' the night before an' i'm a goin' to git drunk to night with an impressive look at the bottle an' to morrow night an' i'll keep it up till i'm rottin' in the grave calton shuddered so full of hatred and suppressed malignity was her voice but the detective merely shrugged his shoulders more fool you he said briefly come now on the night the 'queen' as you call her died there was a gentleman came to see her so she said retorted mother guttersnipe but lor i dunno anythin' i were drunk who said the 'queen' no my gran'darter sal the 'queen' sent 'er to fetch the toff to see 'er cut 'er lucky wanted 'im to look at 'is work i s'pose cuss 'im and sal prigged some paper from my box she shrieked indignantly prigged it w'en i were too drunk to stop 'er the detective glanced at calton who nodded to him with a gratified expression on his face they were right as to the paper having been stolen from the villa at toorak you did not see the gentleman who came said kilsip turning again to the old hag not i cuss you she retorted politely 'e came about 'arf past one in the morning an' you don't expects we can stop up all night do ye half past one o'clock repeated calton quickly the very time is this true wish i may die if it ain't said mother guttersnipe graciously my gran'darter sal kin tell ye where is she asked kilsip sharply at this the old woman threw back her head and howled dismay she's 'ooked it she wailed drumming on the ground with her feet gon' an' left 'er pore old gran' an' joined the army cuss 'em a comin' round an' a spilin' business here the woman on the bed broke out again since the flowers o' the forest are a' wed awa 'old yer jawr yelled mother guttersnipe rising and making a dart at the bed i'll choke the life out ye s'elp me d'y want me to murder ye singin' 'em funeral things meanwhile the detective was talking rapidly to mr calton the only person who can prove mr fitzgerald was here between one and two o'clock he said quickly is sal rawlins as everyone else seems to have been drunk or asleep as she has joined the salvation army i'll go to the barracks the first thing in the morning and look for her i hope you'll find her answered calton drawing a long breath a man's life hangs on her evidence they turned to go calton having first given mother guttersnipe some loose silver which she seized on with an avaricious clutch you'll drink it i suppose said the barrister shrinking back from her werry likely retorted the hag with a repulsive grin tying the money up in a piece of her dress which she tore off for the purpose i'm a forting to the public 'ouse i am an' it's the on'y pleasure i 'ave in my life cuss it the sight of money had a genial effect on her nature for she held the candle at the head of the stairs as they went down so that they should not break their heads as they arrived safely they saw the light vanish and heard the sick woman singing the last rose of summer the street door was open and after groping their way along the dark passage with its pitfalls they found themselves in the open street thank heaven said calton taking off his hat and drawing a long breath thank heaven we are safely out of that den at all events our journey has not been wasted said the detective as they walked along we've found out where mr fitzgerald was on the night of the murder so he will be safe that depends upon sal rawlins answered calton gravely but come let us have a glass of brandy for i feel quite ill after my experience of low life chapter xvi missing the next day kilsip called at calton's office late in the afternoon and found the lawyer eagerly expecting him the detective's face however looked rather dismal and calton was not reassured well he said impatiently when kilsip had closed the door and taken his seat where is she that's just what i want to know answered the detective coolly i went to the salvation army head quarters and made enquiries about her it appears that she had been in the army as a hallelujah lass but got tired of it in a week and went off with a friend of hers to sydney she carried on her old life of dissipation but ultimately her friend got sick of her and the last thing they heard about her was that she had taken up with a chinaman in one of the sydney slums i telegraphed at once to sydney and got a reply that there was no person of the name of sal rawlins known to the sydney police but they said they would make enquiries and let me know the result ah she has no doubt changed her name said calton thoughtfully stroking his chin i wonder why wanted to get rid of the army i expect answered kilsip drily the straying lamb did not care about being hunted back to the fold and when did she join the army the very day after the murder rather sudden conversion yes but she said the death of the woman on thursday night had so startled her that she went straight off to the army to get her religion properly fixed up the effects of fright no doubt said calton dryly i've met a good many examples of these sudden conversions but they never last long as a rule it's a case of 'the devil was sick the devil a monk would be' more than anything else good looking so so i believe replied kilsip shrugging his shoulders very ignorant could neither read nor write that accounts for her not asking for fitzgerald when she called at the club she probably did not know whom she had been sent for it will resolve itself into a question of identification i expect however if the police can't find her we will put an advertisement in the papers offering a reward and send out handbills to the same effect she must be found brian fitzgerald's life hangs on a thread and that thread is sal rawlins yes assented kilsip rubbing his hands together even if mr fitzgerald acknowledges that he was at mother guttersnipe's on the night in question she will have to prove that he was there as no one else saw him are you sure of that as sure as anyone can be in such a case it was a late hour when he came and everyone seems to have been asleep except the dying woman and sal and as one is dead the other is the only person that can prove that he was there at the time when the murder was being committed in the hansom and mother guttersnipe was drunk as she acknowledged last night she thought that if a gentleman did call it must have been the other one the other one repeated calton in a puzzled voice what other one oliver whyte calton arose from his seat with a blank air of astonishment oliver whyte he said as soon as he could find his voice was he in the habit of going there kilsip curled himself up in his seat like a sleek cat and pushing forward his head till his nose looked like the beak of a bird of prey looked keenly at calton look here sir he said in his low purring voice there's a good deal in this case which don't seem plain in fact the further we go into it the more mixed up it seems to get i went to see mother guttersnipe this morning and she told me that whyte had visited the 'queen' several times while she lay ill and that he seemed to be pretty well acquainted with her but who the deuce is this woman they call the 'queen' said calton irritably she seems to be at the bottom of the whole affair every path we take leads to her i know hardly anything about her replied kilsip except that she was a good looking woman of about forty nine she come out from england to sydney a few months ago then on here how she got to mother guttersnipe's i can't find out though i've tried to pump that old woman but she's as close as wax and it's my belief she knows more about this dead woman than she chooses to tell but what could she have told fitzgerald to make him act in this silly manner a stranger who comes from england and dies in a melbourne slum can't possibly know anything about miss frettlby not unless miss frettlby was secretly married to whyte suggested kilsip and the 'queen' knew it nonsense retorted calton sharply why she hated him and loves fitzgerald besides why on earth should she marry secretly and make a confidant of a woman in one of the lowest parts of melbourne at one time her father wanted her to marry whyte but she made such strong opposition that he eventually gave his consent to her engagement with fitzgerald and whyte oh he had a row with mr frettlby and left the house in a rage he was murdered the same night for the sake of some papers he carried oh that's gorby's idea said kilsip scornfully with a vicious snarl and it's mine too answered calton firmly whyte had some valuable papers which he always carried about with him the woman who died evidently told fitzgerald that he did so i gathered as much from an accidental admission he made kilsip looked puzzled i must confess that it is a riddle he said at length but if mr fitzgerald would only speak it would clear everything up speak about what the man who murdered whyte well if he did not go quite so far as that he might at least supply the motive for the crime perhaps so answered calton as the detective rose to go but it's no use fitzgerald for some reason or another has evidently made up his mind not to speak so our only hope in saving him lies in finding this girl if she's anywhere in australia you may be sure she'll be found answered kilsip confidently as he took his departure australia isn't so over crowded as all that but if sal rawlins was in australia at all she certainly must have been in some very remote part all efforts to find her proved futile it was an open question if she was alive or dead she seemed to have vanished completely she was last seen in a sydney den with a chinaman whom afterwards she appears to have left since then nothing whatever was known of her notices offering large rewards for her discovery were inserted in all the newspapers australian and new zealand but nothing came of them as she herself was unable to read there seemed little chance of her knowing of them and if as calton surmised she had changed her name no one would be likely to tell her of them there was only the bare chance that she might hear of them casually or that she might turn up of her own accord if she returned to melbourne she would certainly go to her grandmother's she had no motive for not doing so so kilsip kept a sharp watch on the house much to mrs rawlins' disgust for with true english pride she objected to this system of espionage cuss 'im she croaked over her evening drink to an old crone as withered and evil looking as herself why can't 'e stop in 'is own bloomin' 'ouse an' leave mine alone a comin' round 'ere a pokin' and pryin' and a perwenting people from earnin' their livin' an' a gittin' drunk when they ain't well what do 'e want asked her friend rubbing her weak old knees wants 'e wants 'is throat cut said mother guttersnipe viciously an' s'elp me i'll do for 'im some night w'en 'e's a watchin' round 'ere as if it were pentridge 'e can git what he can out of that whelp as ran away but i knows suthin' 'e don't know cuss 'im she ended with a senile laugh and her companion having taken advantage of the long speech to drink some gin out of the broken cup mother guttersnipe seized the unfortunate old creature by the hair and in spite of her feeble cries banged her head against the wall i'll have the perlice in at yer whimpered the assaulted one as she tottered as quickly away as her rheumatics would allow her see if i don't get out retorted mother guttersnipe indifferently as she filled herself a fresh cup you come a falutin' round 'ere agin priggin' my drinks cuss you an' i'll cut yer throat an' wring yer wicked old 'ead orf the other gave a howl of dismay at hearing this pleasant proposal and tottered out as quickly as possible leaving mother guttersnipe in undisputed possession of the field meanwhile calton had seen brian several times and used every argument in his power to get him to tell everything but he either maintained an obstinate silence or merely answered it would only break her heart he admitted to calton after a good deal of questioning that he had been at mother guttersnipe's on the night of the murder after he had left whyte by the corner of the scotch church as the cabman royston had stated he had gone along russell street and met sal rawlins near the unicorn hotel she had taken him to mother guttersnipe's where he had seen the dying woman who had told him something he could not reveal well said mr calton after hearing the admission you might have saved us all this trouble by admitting this before and yet kept your secret whatever it may be had you done so we might have got hold of sal rawlins before she left melbourne but now it's a mere chance whether she turns up or not brian did not answer to this in fact he seemed hardly to be thinking of what the lawyer was saying but just as calton was leaving he asked how is madge how can you expect her to be said calton turning angrily on him she is very ill owing to the worry she has had over this affair my darling my darling cried brian in agony clasping his hands above his head i did it only to save you calton approached him and laid his hand lightly on his shoulder my dear fellow he said gravely the confidences between lawyer and client are as sacred as those between priest and penitent you must tell me this secret which concerns miss frettlby so deeply no said brian firmly i will never repeat what that wretched woman told me when i would not tell you before in order to save my life it is not likely i am going to do so now when i have nothing to gain and everything to lose by telling it i will never ask you again said calton rather annoyed as he walked to the door and as to this accusation of murder if i can find this girl you are safe when the lawyer left the gaol he went to the detective office to see kilsip and ascertain if there was any news of sal rawlins but as usual there was none it is fighting against fate he said sadly as he went away his life hangs on a mere chance the trial was fixed to come off in september and of course there was great excitement in melbourne as the time drew near great therefore was the disappointment when it was discovered that the prisoner's counsel had applied for an adjournment of the trial till october on the ground that an important witness for the defence could not be found chapter xvii the trial in spite of the utmost vigilance on the part of the police and the offer of a large reward both by calton on behalf of the accused and by mr frettlby the much desired sal rawlins still remained hidden the millionaire had maintained a most friendly attitude towards brian throughout the whole affair he refused to believe him guilty and when calton told him of the defence of proving an alibi by means of sal rawlins he immediately offered a large reward which was in itself enough to set every person with any time on their hands hunting for the missing witness all australia and new zealand rang with the extremely plebeian name of sal rawlins the papers being full of notices offering rewards and handbills of staring red letters were posted up in all railway stations in conjunction with liquid sunshine rum and dwd whisky she had become famous without knowing it unless indeed she had kept herself concealed purposely but this was hardly probable as there was no apparent motive for her doing so if she was above ground she must certainly have seen the handbills if not the papers and though not able to read she could hardly help hearing something about the one topic of conversation throughout australia notwithstanding all this sal rawlins was still undiscovered and calton in despair began to think that she must be dead but madge though at times her courage gave way was still hopeful god will not permit such a judicial crime as the murder of an innocent man to be committed she declared mr calton to whom she said this shook his head doubtfully god has permitted it to take place before he answered softly and we can only judge the future by the past at last the day of the long expected trial came and as calton sat in his office looking over his brief a clerk entered and told him mr frettlby and his daughter wished to see him when they came in the barrister saw that the millionaire looked haggard and ill and there was a worried expression on his face there is my daughter calton he said after hurried greetings had been exchanged she wants to be present in court during fitzgerald's trial and nothing i can say will dissuade her calton turned and looked at the girl in some surprise yes she answered meeting his look steadily though her face was very pale i must be there i shall go mad with anxiety unless i know how the trial goes on but think of the disagreeable amount of attention you will attract urged the lawyer no one will recognise me she said calmly i am very plainly dressed and i will wear this veil and drawing one from her pocket she went to a small looking glass which was hanging on the wall and tied it over her face calton looked in perplexity at mr frettlby i'm afraid you must consent he said very well replied the other almost sternly while a look of annoyance passed over his face i shall leave her in your charge and you i'm not coming answered frettlby quickly putting on his hat i don't care about seeing a man whom i have had at my dinner table in the prisoner's dock much as i sympathise with him good day and with a curt nod he took his leave when the door closed on her father madge placed her hand on calton's arm any hope she whispered looking at him through the black veil the merest chance answered calton putting his brief into his bag we have done everything in our power to discover this girl but without result if she does not come at the eleventh hour i'm afraid brian fitzgerald is a doomed man madge fell on her knees with a stifled cry oh god of mercy she cried raising her hands as if in prayer save him save my darling and let him not die for the crime of another god she dropped her face in her hands and wept convulsively as the lawyer touched her lightly on the shoulder come he said kindly be the brave girl you were and we may save him yet the hour is darkest before the dawn you know madge dried her tears and followed the lawyer to the cab which was waiting for them at the door they drove quickly up to the court and calton put her in a quiet place where she could see the dock and yet be unobserved by the people in the body of the court just as he was leaving her she touched his arm tell him she whispered in a trembling voice tell him i am here calton nodded and hurried away to put on his wig and gown while madge looked hurriedly round the court from her point of vantage it was crowded with fashionable melbourne of both sexes and they were all talking together in subdued whispers the popular character of the prisoner his good looks and engagement to madge frettlby together with the extraordinary circumstances of the case had raised public curiosity to the highest pitch and consequently everybody who could possibly manage to gain admission was there felix rolleston had secured an excellent seat beside the pretty miss featherweight whom he admired so much and he was chattering to her with the utmost volubility puts me in mind of the coliseum and all that sort of thing you know he said putting up his eye glass and staring round butchered to make a roman holiday by jove don't say such horrid things you frivolous creature simpered miss featherweight using her smelling bottle we are all here out of sympathy for that poor dear mr fitzgerald the mercurial felix who had more cleverness in him than people gave him credit for smiled outright at this eminently feminine way of covering an overpowering curiosity ah yes he said lightly exactly i daresay eve only ate the apple because she didn't like to see such a lot of good fruit go to waste miss featherweight eyed him doubtfully she was not quite certain whether he was in jest or earnest just as she was about to reply to the effect that she thought it wicked to make the bible a subject for joking the judge entered and the court rose when the prisoner was brought in there was a great flutter among the ladies and some of them even had the bad taste to produce opera glasses brian noticed this and he flushed up to the roots of his fair hair for he felt his degradation acutely he was an intensely proud man and to be placed in the criminal dock with a lot of frivolous people who had called themselves his friends looking at him as though he were a new actor or a wild animal was galling in the extreme he was dressed in black and looked pale and worn but all the ladies declared that he was as good looking as ever and they were sure he was innocent the jury were sworn in and the crown prosecutor rose to deliver his opening address most of those present knew the facts only through the medium of the newspapers and such floating rumours as they had been able to gather they were therefore unaware of the true history of events which had led to fitzgerald's arrest and they prepared to listen to the speech with profound attention the ladies ceased to talk the men to stare round and nothing could be seen but row after row of eager and attentive faces hanging on the words that issued from the lips of the crown prosecutor he was not a great orator but he spoke clearly and distinctly and every word could be heard in the dead silence he gave a rapid sketch of the crime merely a repetition of what had been published in the newspapers and then proceeded to enumerate the witnesses for the prosecution he would call the landlady of the deceased to show that ill feeling existed between the prisoner and the murdered man and that the accused had called on the deceased a week prior to the committal of the crime and threatened his life there was great excitement at this and several ladies decided on the spur of the moment that the horrid man was guilty but the majority of them still refused to believe in the guilt of such a good looking young fellow he would call a witness who could prove that whyte was drunk on the night of the murder and went along russell street in the direction of collins street the cabman royston could swear to the fact that the prisoner had hailed the cab and after going away for a short time returned and entered the cab with the deceased he would also prove that the prisoner left the cab at the grammar school in the st kilda road and on the arrival of the cab at the junction he discovered the deceased had been murdered the cabman rankin would prove that he drove the prisoner from the st kilda road to powlett street in east melbourne where he got out and he would call the prisoner's landlady to prove that the prisoner resided in powlett street and that on the night of the murder he had not reached home till shortly after two o'clock he would also call the detective who had charge of the case to prove the finding of a glove belonging to the deceased in the pocket of the coat which the prisoner wore on the night of the murder and the doctor who had examined the body of the deceased would give evidence that the death was caused by inhalation of chloroform as he had now fully shown the chain of evidence which he proposed to prove he would call the first witness malcolm royston royston on being sworn gave the same evidence as he had given at the inquest from the time that the cab was hailed up to his arrival at the st kilda police station with the dead body of whyte in the cross examination calton asked him if he was prepared to swear that the man who hailed the cab and the man who got in with the deceased were one and the same person witness i am calton you are quite certain witness yes quite certain calton do you then recognise the prisoner as the man who hailed the cab witness hesitatingly i cannot swear to that the gentleman who hailed the cab had his hat pulled down over his eyes so that i could not see his face but the height and general appearance of the prisoner are the same calton then it is only because the man who got into the cab was dressed like the prisoner on that night that you thought they were both the same witness it never struck me for a minute that they were not the same besides he spoke as if he had been there before i said oh you've come back and he said yes i'm going to take him home and got into my cab calton did you notice any difference in his voice witness no except that the first time i saw him he spoke in a loud voice and the second time he came back very low calton you were sober i suppose witness indignantly yes quite sober calton ah you did not have a drink say at the oriental hotel which i believe is near the rank where your cab stands witness hesitating well i might have had a glass calton so you might you might have had several witness sulkily well there's no law against a cove feeling thirsty calton certainly not and i suppose you took advantage of the absence of such a law witness defiantly yes i did calton and you were elevated witness yes on my cab laughter calton severely you are here to give evidence sir not to make jokes however clever they may be were you or were you not slightly the worse for drink witness i might have been calton so you were in such a condition that you did not observe very closely the man who hailed you witness no i didn't there was no reason why i should i didn't know a murder was going to be committed calton and it never struck you it might be a different man witness no i thought it was the same man the whole time this closed royston's evidence and calton sat down very dissatisfied at not being able to elicit anything more definite from him one thing appeared clear that someone must have dressed himself to resemble brian and have spoken in a low voice for fear of betraying himself clement rankin the next witness deposed to having picked up the prisoner on the st kilda road between one and two on friday morning and driven him to powlett street east melbourne in the cross examination calton elicited one point in the prisoner's favour calton is the prisoner the same gentleman you drove to powlett street witness confidently oh yes calton how do you know did you see his face witness no his hat was pulled down over his eyes and i could only see the ends of his moustache and his chin but he carried himself the same as the prisoner and his moustache is the same light colour calton when you drove up to him on the st kilda road where was he and what was he doing witness he was near the grammar school walking quickly in the direction of melbourne and was smoking a cigarette calton did he wear gloves witness yes one on the left hand the other was bare calton did he wear any rings on the right hand witness yes a large diamond one on the forefinger calton are you sure witness yes because i thought it a curious place for a gentleman to wear a ring and when he was paying me my fare i saw the diamond glitter on his finger in the moonlight calton that will do the counsel for the defence was pleased with this bit of evidence as fitzgerald detested rings and never wore any so he made a note of the matter on his brief mrs hableton the landlady of the deceased was then called and deposed that oliver whyte had lodged with her for nearly two months he seemed a quiet enough young man but often came home drunk the only friend she knew he had was a mr moreland who was often with him on the th july the prisoner called to see mr whyte and they had a quarrel she heard whyte say she is mine you can't do anything with her and the prisoner answered i can kill you and if you marry her i shall do so in the open street she had no idea at the time of the name of the lady they were talking about there was a great sensation in the court at these words and half the people present looked upon such evidence as being sufficient in itself to prove the guilt of the prisoner in cross examination calton was unable to shake the evidence of the witness as she merely reiterated the same statements over and over again the next witness was mrs sampson who crackled into the witness box dissolved in tears and gave her answers in a piercingly shrill tone of anguish she stated that the prisoner was in the habit of coming home early but on the night of the murder had come in shortly before two o'clock crown prosecutor referring to his brief you mean after two witness 'avin made a mistake once by saying five minutes after two to the policeman as called hisself a insurance agent which 'e put the words into my mouth i ain't a goin' to do so again it bein' five minutes afore two as i can swear to crown prosecutor you are sure your clock was right witness it 'adn't bin but my nevy bein' a watchmaker called unbeknown to me an' made it right on thursday night which it was friday mornin' when mr fitzgerald came 'ome mrs sampson bravely stuck to this statement and ultimately left the witness box in triumph the rest of her evidence being comparatively unimportant as compared with this point of time the witness rankin who drove the prisoner to powlett street as sworn to by him was recalled and gave evidence that it was two o'clock when the prisoner got down from his cab in powlett street crown prosecutor how do you know that witness because i heard the post office clock strike crown prosecutor could you hear it at east melbourne witness it was a very still night and i heard the chimes and then the hour strike quite plainly this conflicting evidence as to time was a strong point in brian's favour if as the landlady stated on the authority of the kitchen clock which had been put right on the day previous to the murder fitzgerald had come into the house at five minutes to two he could not possibly be the man who had alighted from rankin's cab at two o'clock at powlett street the next witness was dr chinston who swore to the death of the deceased by means of chloroform administered in a large quantity and he was followed by mr gorby who deposed as to the finding of the glove belonging to the deceased in the pocket of the prisoner's coat roger moreland an intimate friend of the deceased was next called he stated that he had known the deceased in london and had met him in melbourne he was with him a great deal on the night of the murder he was in the orient hotel in bourke street whyte came in and was greatly excited he was in evening dress and wore a light coat they had several drinks together and then went up to an hotel in russell street and had some more drinks there both witness and deceased were intoxicated whyte took off his light coat saying he felt warm and went out shortly afterwards leaving witness asleep in the bar he was awakened by the barman who wanted him to leave the hotel he saw that whyte had left his coat behind him and took it up with the intention of giving it to him as he stood in the street some one snatched the coat from him and made off with it he tried to follow the thief but he could not do so being too intoxicated he then went home and to bed as he had to leave early for the country in the morning in cross examination calton when you went into the street after leaving the hotel did you see the deceased witness no i did not but i was very drunk and unless deceased had spoken to me i would not have noticed him calton what was deceased excited about when you met him witness i don't know he did not say calton what were you talking about witness all sorts of things london principally calton did the deceased mention anything about papers witness surprised no he did not calton are you sure witness quite sure calton what time did you get home witness i don't know i was too drunk to remember this closed the case for the crown and as it was now late the case was adjourned till the next day the court was soon emptied of the busy chattering crowd and calton on looking over his notes found that the result of the first day's trial was two points in favour of fitzgerald first the discrepancy of time in the evidence of rankin and the landlady mrs sampson second the evidence of the cabman royston as to the wearing of a ring on the forefinger of the right hand by the man who murdered whyte whereas the prisoner never wore rings these were slender proofs of innocence to put against the overwhelming mass of evidence in favour of the prisoner's guilt the opinions of all were pretty well divided some being in favour and others against when suddenly an event happened which surprised everyone all over melbourne extras were posted and the news passed from lip to lip like wildfire return of the missing witness sal rawlins chapter xviii sal rawlins tells all she knows and indeed such was the case sal rawlins had made her appearance at the eleventh hour to the heartfelt thankfulness of calton who saw in her an angel from heaven sent to save the life of an innocent man it was at the conclusion of the trial and together with madge he had gone down to his office when his clerk entered with a telegram the lawyer opened it hastily and with a silent look of pleasure on his face handed the telegram to madge she womanlike being more impulsive gave a cry when she read it and falling on her knees thanked god for having heard her prayers and saved her lover's life take me to her at once she implored the lawyer she was anxious to hear from sal rawlins' own lips the joyful words which would save brian from a felon's death no my dear answered calton firmly but kindly i can hardly take a lady to the place where sal rawlins lives you will know all to morrow but meanwhile you must go home and get some sleep and you will tell him she whispered clasping her hands on calton's arm at once he answered promptly and i will see sal rawlins to night and hear what she has to say rest content my dear he added as he placed her in the carriage he is perfectly safe now brian heard the good news with a deep feeling of gratitude knowing that his life was safe and that he could still keep his secret it was the natural revulsion of feeling after the unnatural life he had been leading since his arrest when one is young and healthy and has all the world before one it is a terrible thing to contemplate a sudden death and yet in spite of his joy at being delivered from the hangman's rope there mingled with his delight the horror of that secret which the dying woman had told him with such malignant joy i had rather she had died in silence than she should have bequeathed me this legacy of sorrow and the gaoler seeing his haggard face the next morning muttered to himself he war blest if the swell warn't sorry he war safe so while brian was pacing up and down his cell during the weary watches of the night madge in her own room was kneeling beside her bed and thanking god for his great mercy and calton the good fairy of the two lovers was hurrying towards the humble abode of mrs rawlins familiarly known as mother guttersnipe kilsip was beside him and they were talking eagerly about the providential appearance of the invaluable witness what i like observed kilsip in his soft purring tone is the sell it will be for that gorby he was so certain that mr fitzgerald was the man and when he gets off to morrow gorby will be in a rage where was sal the whole time asked calton absently not thinking of what the detective was saying ill answered kilsip after she left the chinaman she went into the country caught cold by falling into some river and ended up by getting brain fever some people found her took her in and nursed her when she got well she came back to her grandmother's but why didn't the people who nursed her tell her she was wanted they must have seen the papers not they retorted the detective they knew nothing vegetables muttered calton contemptuously how can people be so ignorant why all australia has been ringing with the case at any rate it's money out of their pocket well there's nothing more to tell said kilsip except that she turned up to night at five o'clock looking more like a corpse than anything else when they entered the squalid dingy passage that led to mother guttersnipe's abode they saw a faint light streaming down the stair as they climbed up they could hear the rancorous voice of the old hag pouring forth alternate blessings and curses on her prodigal offspring and the low tones of a girl's voice in reply on entering the room calton saw that the sick woman who had been lying in the corner on the occasion of his last visit was gone mother guttersnipe was seated in front of the deal table with a broken cup and her favourite bottle of spirits before her she evidently intended to have a night of it in order to celebrate sal's return and had commenced early so as to lose no time sal herself was seated on a broken chair and leaned wearily against the wall she stood up as calton and the detective entered and they saw that she was a tall slender woman of about twenty five not bad looking but with a pallid and haggard appearance from recent illness she was clothed in a kind of tawdry blue dress much soiled and torn and had over her shoulders an old tartan shawl which she drew tightly across her breast as the strangers entered her grandmother who looked more weird and grotesquely horrible than ever saluted calton and the detective on their entrance with a shrill yell and a volley of choice language oh ye've come again 'ave ye she screeched raising her skinny arms to take my gal away from 'er pore old gran'mother as nussed 'er cuss her when 'er own mother had gone a gallivantin' with swells i'll 'ave the lawr of ye both s'elp me i will kilsip paid no attention to this outbreak of the old fury but turned to the girl this is the gentleman who wants to speak to you he said gently making the girl sit on the chair again for indeed she looked too ill to stand just tell him what you told me 'bout the 'queen' sir said sal in a low hoarse voice fixing her wild eyes on calton if i'd only known as you was a wantin' me i'd 'ave come afore where were you asked calton in a pitying tone noo south wales answered the girl with a shiver the cove as i went with t' sydney left me yes left me to die like a dog in the gutter cuss 'im croaked the old woman in a sympathetic manner as she took a drink from the broken cup i tooked up with a chinerman went on her granddaughter wearily an' lived with 'im for a bit it's orful ain't it she said with a dreary laugh as she saw the disgust on the lawyer's face but chinermen ain't bad they treat a pore girl a dashed sight better nor a white cove does they don't beat the life out of 'em with their fists nor drag 'em about the floor by the 'air cuss 'em croaked mother guttersnipe drowsily i'll tear their 'earts out i think i must have gone mad i must said sal pushing her tangled hair off her forehead for arter i left the chiner cove i went on walkin' and walkin' right into the bush a tryin' to cool my 'ead for it felt on fire like i went into a river an' got wet an' then i took my 'at an' boots orf an' lay down on the grass an' then the rain comed on an' i walked to a 'ouse as was near where they tooked me in oh sich kind people she sobbed stretching out her hands that didn't badger me 'bout my soul but gave me good food to eat i gave 'em a wrong name i was so 'fraid of that army a findin' me then i got ill an' knowd nothin' for weeks they said i was orf my chump an' then i came back 'ere to see gran' cuss ye said the old woman but in such a tender tone that it sounded like a blessing and did the people who took you in never tell you anything about the murder asked calton sal shook her head no it were a long way in the country and they never knowd anythin' they didn't ah that explains it muttered calton to himself come now he said cheerfully tell me all that happened on the night you brought mr fitzgerald to see the 'queen' who's 'e asked sal puzzled mr fitzgerald the gentleman you brought the letter for to the melbourne club oh 'im said sal a sudden light breaking over her wan face i never knowd his name afore calton nodded complacently i knew you didn't he said that's why you didn't ask for him at the club she never told me 'is name said sal jerking her head in the direction of the bed then whom did she ask you to bring to her asked calton eagerly no one replied the girl this was the way of it on that night she was orfil ill an' i sat beside 'er while gran' was asleep i was drunk broke in gran' fiercely none of yer lies i was blazin' drunk an' ses she to me she ses went on the girl indifferent to her grandmother's interruption 'get me some paper an' a pencil an' i'll write a note to 'im i will' so i goes an' gits 'er what she arsks fur out of gran's box stole it cuss ye shrieked the old hag shaking her fist hold your tongue said kilsip in a peremptory tone mother guttersnipe burst into a volley of oaths and having run rapidly through all she knew subsided into a sulky silence she wrote on it went on sal an' then arsked me to take it to the melbourne club an' give it to 'im ses i 'who's 'im' ses she 'it's on the letter don't you arsk no questions an' you won't 'ear no lies but give it to 'im at the club an' wait for 'im at the corner of bourke street and russell street' so out i goes and gives it to a cove at the club an' then 'e comes along an' ses 'e 'take me to 'er' and i tooked 'im and what like was the gentleman oh werry good lookin' said sal werry tall with yeller 'air an' moustache he

then ses she 'do you know what i'm a goin' to tell you' an' 'e says 'no' then she ses 'it's about 'er' and ses 'e lookin' very white ''ow dare you 'ave 'er name on your vile lips' an' she gits up an' screeches 'turn that gal out an' i'll tell you' an' 'e takes me by the arm an' ses 'e ''ere git out' an' i gits out an' that's all i knows and how long was he with her asked calton who had been listening attentively 'bout arf a hour answered sal i takes 'im back to russell street 'bout twenty five minutes to two 'cause i looked at the clock on the post office an' 'e gives me a sov an' then he goes a tearin' up the street like anything take him about twenty minutes to walk to east melbourne said calton to himself so he must just have got in at the time mrs sampson said he was in with the 'queen' the whole time i suppose he asked looking keenly at sal i was at that door said sal pointing to it an' 'e couldn't 'ave got out unless i'd seen 'im oh it's all right said calton nodding to kilsip there won't be any difficulty in proving an alibi but i say he added turning to sal what were they talking about i dunno answered sal i was at the door an' they talks that quiet i couldn't 'ear 'em then he sings out 'my g it's too horrible' an' i 'ear 'er a larfin' like to bust an' then 'e comes to me and ses quite wild like 'take me out of this 'ell' an' i tooked 'im and when you came back she was dead dead as a blessed door nail said sal cheerfully an' i never knowd i was in the room with a corpse wailed mother guttersnipe waking up cuss 'er she was allays a doin' contrary things how do you know said calton sharply as he rose to go i knowd 'er longer nor you croaked the old woman fixing one evil eye on the lawyer an' i know what you'd like to know but ye shan't ye shan't calton turned from her with a shrug of his shoulders you will come to the court to morrow with mr kilsip he said to sal and tell what you have just now told me it's all true s'elp me said sal eagerly 'e was 'ere all the time calton stepped towards the door followed by the detective when mother guttersnipe rose where's the money for finin' her she screeched pointing one skinny finger at sal well considering the girl found herself said calton dryly the money is in the bank and will remain there an' i'm to be done out of my 'ard earned tin s'elp me howled the old fury cuss ye i'll 'ave the lawr of ye and get ye put in quod you'll go there yourself if you don't take care said kilsip in his soft purring tones yah shrieked mother guttersnipe snapping her fingers at him what do i care about yer quod ain't i bin in pentrig' an' it ain't 'urt me it ain't i'm as lively as a gal i am and the old fury to prove the truth of her words danced a kind of war dance in front of mr calton snapping her fingers and yelling out curses as an accompaniment to her ballet her luxurious white hair streamed out during her gyrations and with her grotesque appearance and the faint light of the candle she presented a gruesome spectacle calton remembered the tales he had heard of the women of paris at the revolution and the way they danced la carmagnole mother guttersnipe would have been in her element in that sea of blood and turbulence he thought but he merely shrugged his shoulders and walked out of the room as with a final curse delivered in a hoarse voice mother guttersnipe sank exhausted on the floor and yelled for gin chapter xix the verdict of the jury next morning the court was crowded and numbers were unable to gain admission the news that sal rawlins who alone could prove the innocence of the prisoner had been found and would appear in court that morning had spread like wildfire and the acquittal of the prisoner was confidently expected by a large number of sympathising friends who seemed to have sprung up on all sides like mushrooms in a single night there were of course plenty of cautious people left who waited to hear the verdict of the jury before committing themselves and who still believed him to be guilty but the unexpected appearance of sal rawlins had turned the great tide of public feeling in favour of the prisoner and many who had been loudest in their denunciations of fitzgerald were now more than half convinced of his innocence pious clergymen talked in an incoherent way about the finger of god and the innocent not suffering unjustly which was a case of counting unhatched chickens as the verdict had yet to be given felix rolleston awoke and found himself famous in a small way out of good natured sympathy and a spice of contrariness he had declared his belief in brian's innocence and now to his astonishment he found that his view of the matter was likely to prove correct he received so much praise on all sides for his presumed perspicuity that he soon began to think that he had believed in fitzgerald's innocence by a calm course of reasoning and not because of a desire to differ from every one else in their opinion of the case after all felix rolleston is not the only man who has been astonished to find greatness thrust upon him and come to believe himself worthy of it he was a wise man however and while in the full tide of prosperity he seized the flying moment and proposed to miss featherweight who after some hesitation agreed to endow him with herself and her thousands she decided that her future husband was a man of no common intellect seeing that he had long ago arrived at a conclusion which the rest of melbourne were only beginning to discover now so she determined that as soon as she assumed marital authority felix like strephon in iolanthe should go into parliament and with her money and his brains she might some day be the wife of a premier mr rolleston had no idea of the political honours which his future spouse intended for him and was seated in his old place in the court talking about the case knew he was innocent don't you know he said with a complacent smile fitzgerald's too jolly good looking a fellow and all that sort of thing to commit murder whereupon a clergyman happening to overhear the lively felix make this flippant remark disagreed with it entirely and preached a sermon to prove that good looks and crime were closely connected and that both judas iscariot and nero were beauty men ah said calton when he heard the sermon if this unique theory is a true one what a truly pious man that clergyman must be this allusion to the looks of the reverend gentleman was rather unkind for he was by no means bad looking but then calton was one of those witty men who would rather lose a friend than suppress an epigram when the prisoner was brought in a murmur of sympathy ran through the crowded court so ill and worn out he looked but calton was puzzled to account for the expression of his face so different from that of a man whose life had been saved or rather was about to be saved for in truth it was a foregone conclusion you know who stole those papers he thought as he looked at fitzgerald keenly and the man who did so is the murderer of whyte the judge having entered and the court being opened calton rose to make his speech and stated in a few words the line of defence he intended to take he would first call albert dendy a watchmaker to prove that on thursday night at eight o'clock in the evening he had called at the prisoner's lodgings while the landlady was out and while there had put the kitchen clock right and had regulated the same he would also call felix rolleston a friend of the prisoners to prove that the prisoner was not in the habit of wearing rings and frequently expressed his detestation of such a custom sebastian brown a waiter at the melbourne club would be called to prove that on thursday night a letter was delivered to the prisoner at the club by one sarah rawlins and that the prisoner left the club shortly before one o'clock on friday morning he would also call sarah rawlins to prove that she had delivered a note to sebastian brown for the prisoner at the melbourne club at a quarter to twelve on thursday night and that at a few minutes past one o'clock on friday morning she had conducted the prisoner to a slum off little bourke street and that he was there between one and two on friday morning the hour at which the murder was alleged to have taken place this being his defence to the charge brought against the prisoner he would call albert dendy albert dendy duly sworn stated i am a watchmaker and carry on business in fitzroy i remember thursday the th of july last on the evening of that day i called at powlett street east melbourne to see my aunt who is the landlady of the prisoner she was out at the time i called and i waited in the kitchen till her return i looked at the kitchen clock to see if it was too late to wait and then at my watch i found that the clock was ten minutes fast upon which i put it right and regulated it properly calton at what time did you put it right witness about eight o'clock calton between that time and two in the morning was it possible for the clock to gain ten minutes witness no it was not possible calton would it gain at all witness not between eight and two o'clock the time was not long enough calton did you see your aunt that night witness yes i waited till she came in calton and did you tell her you had put the clock right witness no i did not i forgot all about it calton then she was still under the impression that it was ten minutes fast witness yes i suppose so after dendy had been cross examined felix rolleston was called and deposed as follows i am an intimate friend of the prisoner i have known him for five or six years and i never saw him wearing a ring during that time he has frequently told me he did not care for rings and would never wear them in cross examination crown prosecutor you have never seen the prisoner wearing a diamond ring witness no never crown prosecutor have you ever seen any such ring in his possession witness no i have seen him buying rings for ladies but i never saw him with any ring such as a gentleman would wear crown prosecutor not even a seal ring witness no not even a seal ring sarah rawlins was then placed in the witness box and after having been sworn deposed i know the prisoner i delivered a letter addressed to him at the melbourne club at a quarter to twelve o'clock on thursday th july i did not know what his name was he met me shortly after one at the corner of russell and bourke streets where i had been told to wait for him i took him to my grandmother's place in a lane off little bourke street there was a dying woman there who had sent for him he went in and saw her for about twenty minutes and then i took him back to the corner of bourke and russell streets i heard the three quarters strike shortly after i left him crown prosecutor you are quite certain that the prisoner was the man you met on that night witness quite certin' s'elp me g crown prosecutor and he met you a few minutes past one o'clock witness yes 'bout five minutes i 'eard the clock a strikin' one just afore he came down the street and when i leaves 'im agin it were about twenty five to two 'cause it took me ten minits to git 'ome and i 'eard the clock go three quarters jest as i gits to the door crown prosecutor how do you know it was exactly twenty five to two when you left him witness 'cause i sawr the clocks i left 'im at the corner of russell street and comes down bourke street so i could see the post orffice clock as plain as day an' when i gets into swanston street i looks at the town 'all premiscus like and sees the same time there crown prosecutor and you never lost sight of the prisoner the whole time witness no there was only one door by the room an' i was a sittin' outside it an' when he comes out he falls over me crown prosecutor were you asleep witness not a blessed wink calton then directed sebastian brown to be called he deposed i know the prisoner he is a member of the melbourne club at which i am a waiter i remember thursday th july on that night the last witness came with a letter to the prisoner it was about a quarter to twelve she just gave it to me and went away i delivered it to mr fitzgerald he left the club at about ten minutes to one this closed the evidence for the defence and after the crown prosecutor had made his speech in which he pointed out the strong evidence against the prisoner calton arose to address the jury he was a fine speaker and made a splendid defence not a single point escaped him and that brilliant piece of oratory is still remembered and spoken of admiringly in the purlieus of temple court and chancery lane he began by giving a vivid description of the circumstances of the murder of the meeting of the murderer and his victim in collins street east the cab driving down to st kilda the getting out of the cab of the murderer after committing the crime and the way in which he had secured himself against pursuit having thus enchained the attention of the jury by the graphic manner in which he described the crime he pointed out that the evidence brought forward by the prosecution was purely circumstantial and that they had utterly failed to identify the prisoner in the dock with the man who entered the cab the supposition that the prisoner and the man in the light coat were one and the same person rested solely upon the evidence of the cabman royston who although not intoxicated was judging from his own statements not in a fit state to distinguish between the man who hailed the cab and the man who got in the crime was committed by means of chloroform therefore if the prisoner was guilty he must have purchased the chloroform in some shop or obtained it from some friends at all events the prosecution had not brought forward a single piece of evidence to show how and where the chloroform had been obtained with regard to the glove belonging to the murdered man found in the prisoner's pocket he picked it up off the ground at the time when he first met whyte when the deceased was lying drunk near the scotch church certainly there was no evidence to show that the prisoner had picked it up before the deceased entered the cab but on the other hand there was no evidence to show that it had been picked up in the cab it was far more likely that the glove and especially a white glove would be picked up under the light of the lamp near the scotch church where it was easily noticeable than in the darkness of a cab where there was very little room and where it would be quite dark as the blinds were drawn down the cabman royston swore positively that the man who got out of his cab on the st kilda road wore a diamond ring on the forefinger of his right hand and the cabman rankin swore to the same thing about the man who got out at powlett street against this could be placed the evidence of one of the prisoner's most intimate friends one who had seen him almost daily for the last five years and he had sworn positively that the prisoner was not in the habit of wearing rings the cabman rankin had also sworn that the man who entered his cab on the st kilda road alighted at powlett street east melbourne at two o'clock on friday morning as he heard that hour strike from the post office clock whereas the evidence of the prisoner's landlady showed plainly that he entered the house five minutes previously and her evidence was further supported by that of the watchmaker dendy mrs sampson saw the hand of her kitchen clock point to five minutes to two and thinking it was ten minutes slow told the detective that the prisoner did not enter the house till five minutes past two which would just give the man who alighted from the cab presuming him to have been the prisoner sufficient time to walk up to his lodgings the evidence of the watchmaker dendy however showed clearly that he had put the clock right at the hour of eight on thursday night that it was impossible for it to gain ten minutes before two on friday morning and therefore the time five minutes to two seen by the landlady was the correct one and the prisoner was in the house five minutes before the other man alighted from the cab in powlett street these points in themselves were sufficient to show that the prisoner was innocent but the evidence of the woman rawlins must prove conclusively to the jury that the prisoner was not the man who committed the crime the witness brown had proved that the woman rawlins had delivered a letter to him which he gave to the prisoner and that the prisoner left the club to keep the appointment spoken of in the letter which letter or rather the remains of it had been put in evidence the woman rawlins swore that the prisoner met her at the corner of russell and bourke streets and had gone with her to one of the back slums there to see the writer of the letter she also proved that at the time of the committal of the crime the prisoner was still in the back slum by the bed of the dying woman and there being only one door to the room he could not possibly have left without the witness seeing him the woman rawlins further proved that she left the prisoner at the corner of bourke and russell streets at twenty five minutes to two o'clock which was five minutes before royston drove his cab up to the st kilda police station with the dead body inside finally the woman rawlins proved her words by stating that she saw both the post office and town hall clocks and supposing the prisoner started from the corner of bourke and russell streets as she says he did he would reach east melbourne in twenty minutes which made it five minutes to two on friday morning the time at which according to the landlady's statement he entered the house all the evidence given by the different witnesses agreed completely and formed a chain which showed the whole of the prisoner's movements at the time of the committal of the murder therefore it was absolutely impossible that the murder could have been committed by the man in the dock the strongest piece of evidence brought forward by the prosecution was that of the witness hableton who swore that the prisoner used threats against the life of the deceased but the language used was merely the outcome of a passionate irish nature and was not sufficient to prove the crime to have been committed by the prisoner the defence which the prisoner set up was that of an alibi and the evidence of the witnesses for the defence proved conclusively that the prisoner could not and did not commit the murder finally calton wound up his elaborate and exhaustive speech which lasted for over two hours by a brilliant peroration calling upon the jury to base their verdict upon the plain facts of the case and if they did so they could hardly fail in bringing in a verdict of not guilty when calton sat down a subdued murmur of applause was heard which was instantly suppressed and the judge began to sum up strongly in favour of fitzgerald the jury then retired and immediately there was a dead silence in the crowded court an unnatural silence such as must have fallen on the blood loving roman populace when they saw the christian martyrs kneeling on the hot yellow sands of the arena and watched the long lithe forms of lion and panther creeping steadily towards their prey the hour being late the gas had been lighted and there was a sickly glare through the wide hall fitzgerald had been taken out of court on the retiring of the jury but the spectators stared steadily at the empty dock which seemed to enchain them by some indescribable fascination they conversed among themselves only in whispers until even the whispering ceased and nothing could be heard but the steady ticking of the clock and now and then the quick drawn breath of some timid on looker suddenly a woman whose nerves were over strung shrieked and the cry rang weirdly through the crowded hall she was taken out and again there was silence every eye being now fixed on the door through which the jury would re issue with their verdict of life or death the hands of the clock moved slowly round a quarter a half three quarters and then the hour sounded with a silvery ring which startled everyone madge sitting with her hands tightly clasped together began to fear that her highly strung nerves would give way my god she muttered softly to herself will this suspense never end just then the door opened and the jury re entered the prisoner was again placed in the dock and the judge resumed his seat this time with the black cap in his pocket as everyone guessed the usual formalities were gone through and when the foreman of the jury stood up every neck was craned forward and every ear was on the alert to catch the words that fell from his lips the prisoner flushed a little and then grew pale as death giving a quick nervous glance at the quiet figure in black of which he could just catch a glimpse then came the verdict sharp and decisive not guilty on hearing this a cheer went up from everyone in the court so strong was the sympathy with brian in vain the crier of the court yelled order until he was red in the face in vain the judge threatened to commit all present for contempt of court his voice being inaudible it did not matter much the enthusiasm could not be restrained and it was five minutes before order was obtained the judge having recovered his composure delivered his judgment and discharged the prisoner in accordance with the verdict calton had won many cases but it is questionable if he had ever heard a verdict which gave him so much satisfaction as that which proclaimed fitzgerald innocent and brian stepping down from the dock a free man passed through a crowd of congratulating friends to a small room off the court where a woman was waiting for him a woman who clung round his neck and sobbed out my darling my darling i knew that god would save you chapter xx the argus gives its opinion the morning after the trial was concluded the following article in reference to the matter appeared in the argus during the past three months we have frequently in our columns commented on the extraordinary case which is now so widely known as 'the hansom cab tragedy' we can safely say that it is the most remarkable case which has ever come under the notice of our criminal court and the verdict given by the jury yesterday has enveloped the matter in a still deeper mystery by a train of strange coincidences mr brian fitzgerald a young squatter was suspected of having murdered whyte and had it not been for the timely appearance of the woman rawlins who turned up at the eleventh hour we feel sure that a verdict of guilty would have been given and an innocent man would have suffered punishment for the crime of another fortunately for the prisoner and for the interests of justice his counsel mr calton by unwearied diligence was able to discover the last witness and prove an alibi had it not been for this in spite of the remarks made by the learned counsel in his brilliant speech yesterday which resulted in the acquittal of the prisoner we question very much if the rest of the evidence in favour of the accused would have been sufficient to persuade the jury that he was an innocent man the only points in favour of mr fitzgerald were the inability of the cabman royston to swear to him as the man who had got into the cab with whyte the wearing of a diamond ring on the forefinger of the right hand whereas mr fitzgerald wears no rings and the difference in time sworn to by the cabman rankin and the landlady against these points however the prosecution placed a mass of evidence which seemed conclusively to prove the guilt of the prisoner but the appearance of sal rawlins in the witness box put an end to all doubt in language which could not be mistaken for anything else than the truth she positively swore that mr fitzgerald was in one of the slums off bourke street between the hours of one and two on friday morning at which time the murder was committed under these circumstances the jury unanimously agreed and returned a verdict of 'not guilty' and the prisoner was forthwith acquitted we have to congratulate his counsel mr calton for the able speech he made for the defence and also mr fitzgerald for his providential escape from a dishonourable and undeserved punishment he leaves the court without a stain on his character and with the respect and sympathy of all australians for the courage and dignity with which he comported himself throughout while resting under the shadow of such a serious charge but now that it has been conclusively proved that he is innocent the question arises in every one's mind 'who is the murderer of oliver whyte' the man who committed this dastardly crime is still at large and for all we know may be in our midst emboldened by the impunity with which he has escaped the hands of justice he may be walking securely down our streets and talking of the very crime of which he is the perpetrator secure in the thought that all traces of him have been lost for ever from the time he alighted from rankin's cab at powlett street he has ventured probably to remain in melbourne and for all that anyone knows he may have been in the court during the late trial nay this very article may meet his eye and he may rejoice at the futile efforts which have been made to find him but let him beware justice is not blind but blind folded and when he least expects it she will tear the bandage from her keen eyes and drag him forth to the light of day to receive the reward of his deed owing to the strong evidence against fitzgerald that is the only direction in which the detectives have hitherto looked but baffled on one side they will look on the other and this time may be successful that such a man as the murderer of oliver whyte should be at large is a matter of danger not only to individual citizens but to the community at large for it is a well known fact that a tiger who once tastes human blood never overcomes his craving for it and without doubt the man who so daringly and coolly murdered a drunken and therefore defenceless man will not hesitate to commit a second crime the present feeling of all classes in melbourne must be one of terror that such a man should be at large and must in a great measure resemble the fear which filled everyone's heart in london when the marr murders were committed and it was known that the murderer had escaped anyone who has read de quincy's graphic description of the crime perpetrated by williams must tremble to think that such another devil incarnate is in our midst it is an imperative necessity that such a feeling should be done away with but how is this to be managed it is one thing to speak and another to act there seems to be no possible clue discoverable at present which can lead to the discovery of the real murderer the man in the light coat who got out of rankin's cab at powlett street east melbourne designedly as it now appears in order to throw suspicion on fitzgerald has vanished as completely as the witches in macbeth and left no trace behind it was two o'clock in the morning when he left the cab and in a quiet suburb like east melbourne no one would be about so that he could easily escape unseen there seems to be only one chance of ever tracing him and that is to be found in the papers which were stolen from the pocket of the dead man what they were only two persons knew and one knows now the first two were whyte and the woman who was called 'the queen' and both of them are now dead the other who knows now is the man who committed the crime there can be no doubt that these papers were the motive for the crime as no money was taken from the pockets of the deceased the fact also that the papers were carried in a pocket made inside the waistcoat of the deceased shows that they were of value now the reason we think that the dead woman knew of the existence of these papers is simply this it appears that she came out from england with whyte as his mistress and after staying some time in sydney came on to melbourne how she came into such a foul and squalid den as that she died in we are unable to say unless seeing that she was given to drink she was picked up drunk by some samaritan of the slums and carried to mrs rawlins' humble abode whyte visited her there frequently but appears to have made no attempt to remove her to a better place alleging as his reason that the doctor said she would die if taken into the air our reporter learned from one of the detectives that the dead woman was in the habit of talking to whyte about certain papers and on one occasion was overheard to say to him 'they'll make your fortune if you play your cards well' this was told to the detective by the woman rawlins to whose providential appearance mr fitzgerald owes his escape from this it can be gathered that the papers whatever they might be were of value and sufficient to tempt another to commit a murder in order to obtain them whyte therefore being dead and his murderer having escaped the only way of discovering the secret which lies at the root of this tree of crime is to find out the history of the woman who died in the slum traced back for some years circumstances may be discovered which will reveal what these papers contained and once that is found we can confidently say that the murderer will soon be discovered this is the only chance of finding out the cause and the author of this mysterious murder and if it fails we fear the hansom cab tragedy will have to be relegated to the list of undiscovered crimes and the assassin of whyte will have no other punishment than that of the remorse of his own conscience chapter xxi three months afterwards a hot december day with a cloudless blue sky and a sun blazing down on the earth clothed in all the beauty of summer garments such a description of snowy december sounds perchance a trifle strange to english ears it may strike them as being somewhat fantastic as was the play in a midsummer night's dream to demetrius when he remarked this is hot ice and wondrous cold fire but here in australia we are in the realm of contrariety and many things other than dreams go by contrary here black swans are an established fact and the proverb concerning them made when they were considered as mythical a bird as the phoenix has been rendered null and void by the discoveries of captain cook here ironwood sinks and pumice stone floats which must strike the curious spectator as a queer freak on the part of dame nature at home the edinburgh mail bears the hardy traveller to a cold climate with snowy mountains and wintry blasts but here the further north one goes the hotter it gets till one arrives in queensland where the heat is so great that a profane traveller of an epigrammatic turn of mind once fittingly called it an amateur hell but however contrary as mrs gamp would say nature may be in her dealings the english race out in this great continent are much the same as in the old country john bull paddy and sandy all being of a conservative turn of mind and with strong opinions as to the keeping up of old customs therefore on a hot christmas day with the sun one hundred odd in the shade australian revellers sit down to the roast beef and plum pudding of old england which they eat contentedly as the orthodox thing and on new year's eve the festive celt repairs to the doors of his freends with a bottle of whisky and a cheering verse of auld lang syne still it is these peculiar customs that give an individuality to a nation and john bull abroad loses none of his insular obstinacy but keeps his christmas in the old fashion and wears his clothes in the new fashion without regard to heat or cold a nation that never surrenders to the fire of an enemy cannot be expected to give in to the fire of the sun but if some ingenious mortal would only invent some light and airy costume after the fashion of the greek dress and australians would consent to adopt the same life in melbourne and her sister cities would be much cooler than it is at present madge was thinking somewhat after this fashion as she sat on the wide verandah in a state of exhaustion from the heat and stared out at the wide plains lying parched and arid under the blazing sun there was a dim kind of haze rising from the excessive heat hanging midway between heaven and earth and through its tremulous veil the distant hills looked aerial and unreal stretched out before her was the garden with its intensely vivid flowers to look at them merely was to increase one's caloric condition great bushes of oleanders with their bright pink blossoms luxurious rose trees with their yellow red and white blooms and all along the border a rainbow of many coloured flowers with such brilliant tints that the eye ached to see them in the hot sunshine and turned restfully to the cool green of the trees which encircled the lawn in the centre was a round pool surrounded by a ring of white marble and containing a still sheet of water which flashed like a mirror in the blinding light the homestead of yabba yallook station was a long low house with no upper storey and with a wide verandah running nearly round it cool green blinds were hung between the pillars to keep out the sun and all along were scattered lounging chairs of basket work with rugs novels empty soda water bottles and all the other evidences that mr frettlby's guests had been wise and stayed inside during the noonday heat madge was seated in one of these comfortable chairs and she divided her attention between the glowing beauty of the world outside which she could see through a narrow slit in the blinds but she did not seem greatly interested in her book and it was not long before she let it fall unheeded to the ground and took refuge in her own thoughts the trial through which she had so recently passed had been a great one and it had not been without its outward result it had left its impress on her beautiful face and there was a troubled look in her eyes after brian's acquittal of the murder of oliver whyte she had been taken by her father up to the station in the hope that it would restore her to health the mental strain which had been on her during the trial had nearly brought on an attack of brain fever but here far from the excitement of town life in the quiet seclusion of the country she had recovered her health but not her spirits women are more impressionable than men and it is perhaps for this reason that they age quicker a trouble which would pass lightly over a man leaves an indelible mark on a woman both physically and mentally and the terrible episode of whyte's murder had changed madge from a bright and merry girl into a grave and beautiful woman sorrow is a potent enchantress once she touches the heart life can never be quite the same again we never more surrender ourselves entirely to pleasure and often we find so many of the things we have longed for are after all but dead sea fruit sorrow is the veiled isis of the world and once we penetrate her mystery and see her deeply furrowed face and mournful eyes the magic light of romance dies all away and we realise the hard bitter fact of life in all its nakedness madge felt something of all this she saw the world now not as the fantastic fairyland of her girlish dreams but as the sorrowful vale of tears through which we must all walk till we reach the promised land and brian he also had undergone a change for there were a few white hairs now amid his curly chestnut locks and his character from being gay and bright had become moody and irritable after the trial he had left town immediately in order to avoid meeting with his friends and had gone up to his station which was next to that of the frettlbys' there he worked hard all day and smoked hard all night thinking over the secret which the dead woman had told him and which threatened to overshadow his life every now and then he rode over and saw madge but this was generally when he knew her father to be away from melbourne for of late he had disliked the millionaire madge could not but condemn his attitude remembering how her father had stood beside him in his recent trouble yet there was another reason why brian kept aloof from yabba yallook station he did not wish to meet any of the gay society which was there knowing that since his trial he was an object of curiosity and sympathy to everyone a position galling enough to his proud nature at christmas time mr frettlby had asked several people up from melbourne and though madge would rather have been left alone yet she could not refuse her father and had to play hostess with a smiling brow and aching heart felix rolleston who a month since had joined the noble army of benedicts was there with mrs rolleston nee miss featherweight who ruled him with a rod of iron having bought felix with her money she had determined to make good use of him and being ambitious to shine in melbourne society had insisted upon felix studying politics so that when the next general election came round he could enter parliament felix had rebelled at first but ultimately gave way as he found that when he had a good novel concealed among his parliamentary papers time passed quite pleasantly and he got the reputation of a hard worker at little cost they had brought up julia with them and this young person had made up her mind to become the second mrs frettlby she had not received much encouragement but like the english at waterloo did not know when she was beaten and carried on the siege of mr frettlby's heart in an undaunted manner dr chinston had come up for a little relaxation and gave never a thought to his anxious patients or the many sick rooms he was in the habit of visiting a young english fellow called peterson who amused himself by travelling an old colonist full of reminiscences of the old days when by gad sir we hadn't a gas lamp in the whole of melbourne and several other people completed the party they had all gone off to the billiard room and left madge in her comfortable chair half asleep suddenly she started as she heard a step behind her and turning saw sal rawlins in the neatest of black gowns with a coquettish white cap and apron and an open book madge had been so delighted with sal for saving brian's life that she had taken her into her service as maid mr frettlby had offered strong opposition at first that a fallen woman like sal should be near his daughter but madge was determined to rescue the unhappy girl from the life of sin she was leading and so at last he reluctantly consented brian too had objected but ultimately yielded as he saw that madge had set her heart on it mother guttersnipe objected at first characterising the whole affair as cussed 'umbug but she likewise gave in and sal became maid to miss frettlby who immediately set to work to remedy sal's defective education by teaching her to read the book she held in her hand was a spelling book and this she handed to madge i think i knows it now miss she said respectfully as madge looked up with a smile do you indeed said madge gaily you will be able to read in no time sal read this said sal touching tristan a romance by zoe hardly said madge picking it up with a look of contempt i want you to learn english and not a confusion of tongues like this thing but it's too hot for lessons sal she went on leaning back in her seat so get a chair and talk to me sal complied and madge looked out at the brilliant flower beds and at the black shadow of the tall witch elm which grew on one side of the lawn she wanted to ask a certain question of sal and did not know how to do it the moodiness and irritability of brian had troubled her very much of late and with the quick instinct of her sex she ascribed it indirectly to the woman who had died in the back slum anxious to share his troubles and lighten his burden she determined to ask sal about this mysterious woman and find out if possible what secret had been told to brian which affected him so deeply sal she said after a short pause turning her clear grey eyes on the woman i want to ask you something the other shivered and turned pale about about that madge nodded sal hesitated for a moment and then flung herself at the feet of her mistress i will tell you she cried you have been kind to me an' have a right to know i will tell you all i know then asked madge firmly as she clasped her hands tightly together who was this woman whom mr fitzgerald went to see and where did she come from gran' an' me found her one evenin' in little bourke street answered sal just near the theatre she was quite drunk an' we took her home with us how kind of you said madge oh it wasn't that replied the other dryly gran' wanted her clothes she was awful swell dressed and she took the clothes how wicked anyone would have done it down our way answered sal indifferently but gran' changed her mind when she got her home i went out to get some gin for gran' and when i came back she was huggin' and kissin' the woman she recognised her yes i s'pose so replied sal an' next mornin' when the lady got square she made a grab at gran' an' hollered out 'i was comin' to see you' and then gran' chucked me out of the room an' they had a long jaw and then when i come back gran' tells me the lady is a goin' to stay with us 'cause she was ill and sent me for mr whyte and he came oh yes often said sal he kicked up a row when he first turned up but when he found she was ill he sent a doctor but it warn't no good she was two weeks with us and then died the mornin' she saw mr fitzgerald i suppose mr whyte was in the habit of talking to this woman lots returned sal but he always turned gran' an' me out of the room afore he started and hesitating did you ever overhear one of these conversations yes one answered the other with a nod i got riled at the way he cleared us out of our own room and once when he shut the door and gran' went off to get some gin i sat down at the door and listened he wanted her to give up some papers an' she wouldn't she said she'd die first but at last he got 'em and took 'em away with him did you see them asked madge as the assertion of gorby that whyte had been murdered for certain papers flashed across her mind rather said sal i was looking through a hole in the door an' she takes 'em from under her piller an' 'e takes 'em to the table where the candle was an' looks at 'em they were in a large blue envelop with writing on it in red ink then he put 'em in his pocket and she sings out 'you'll lose 'em' an' 'e says 'no i'll always 'ave 'em with me an' if 'e wants 'em 'e'll have to kill me fust afore 'e gits 'em' and you did not know who the man was to whom the papers were of such importance no i didn't they never said no names and when was it whyte got the papers about a week before he was murdered said sal after a moment's thought an' after that he never turned up again she kept watchin' for him night an' day an' 'cause he didn't come got mad at him i hear her sayin' 'you think you've done with me my gentleman an' leaves me here to die but i'll spoil your little game' an' then she wrote that letter to mr fitzgerald an' i brought him to her as you know yes yes said madge rather impatiently i heard all that at the trial but what conversation passed between mr fitzgerald and this woman did you hear it bits of it replied the other i didn't split in court 'cause i thought the lawyer would be down on me for listening the first thing i heard mr fitzgerald sayin' was 'you're mad it ain't true' an' she ses 's'elp me it is whyte's got the proof' an' then he sings out 'my poor girl' and she ses 'will you marry her now' and ses he 'i will i love her more than ever' and then she makes a grab at him and says 'spile his game if you can' and says he 'what's yer name' and she says what asked madge breathlessly rosanna moore there was a sharp exclamation as sal said the name and turning round quickly madge found brian standing beside her pale as death with his eyes fixed on the woman who had risen to her feet go on he said sharply that's all i know she replied in a sullen tone brian gave a sigh of relief you can go he said slowly i wish to speak with miss frettlby alone sal looked at him for a moment and then glanced at her mistress who nodded to her as a sign that she might withdraw she picked up her book and with another sharp enquiring look at brian turned and walked slowly into the house chapter xxii a daughter of eve after sal had gone brian sank into a chair beside madge with a weary sigh he was in riding dress which became his stalwart figure well and he looked remarkably handsome but ill and worried what on earth were you questioning that girl about he said abruptly taking his hat off and tossing it and his gloves on to the floor madge flushed crimson for a moment and then taking brian's two strong hands in her own looked steadily into his frowning face why don't you trust me she asked in a quiet tone it is not necessary that i should he answered moodily the secret that rosanna moore told me on her death bed is nothing that would benefit you to know is it about me she persisted it is and it is not he answered epigrammatically i suppose that means that it is about a third person and concerns me she said calmly releasing his hands well yes impatiently striking his boot with his riding whip but it is nothing that can harm you so long as you do not know it but god help you should anyone tell it to you for it would embitter your life my life being so very sweet now answered madge with a slight sneer you are trying to put out a fire by pouring oil on it and what you say only makes me more determined to learn what it is madge i implore you not to persist in this foolish curiosity he said almost fiercely it will bring you only misery if it concerns me i have a right to know it she answered curtly when i marry you how can we be happy together with the shadow of a secret between us brian rose and leaned against the verandah post with a dark frown on his face do you remember that verse of browning's he said coolly 'where the apple reddens never pry lest we lose our edens eve and i' singularly applicable to our present conversation i think ah she said her pale face flushing with anger you want me to live in a fool's paradise which may end at any moment that depends upon yourself he answered coldly i never roused your curiosity by telling you that there was a secret but betrayed it inadvertently to calton's cross questioning i tell you candidly that i did learn something from rosanna moore and it concerns you though only indirectly through a third person but it would do no good to reveal it and would ruin both our lives she did not answer but looked straight before her into the glowing sunshine brian fell on his knees beside her and stretched out his hands with an entreating gesture oh my darling he cried sadly cannot you trust me the love which has stood such a test as yours cannot fail like this let me bear the misery of knowing it alone without blighting your young life with the knowledge of it i would tell you if i could but god help me i cannot i cannot and he buried his face in his hands madge closed her mouth firmly and touched his comely head with her cool white fingers there was a struggle going on in her breast between her feminine curiosity and her love for the man at her feet the latter conquered and she bowed her head over his brian she whispered softly let it be as you wish i will never again try to learn this secret since you do not desire it he arose to his feet and caught her in his strong arms with a glad smile my dearest he said kissing her passionately and then for a few moments neither of them spoke we will begin a new life he said at length we will put the sad past away from us and think of it only as a dream but this secret will still fret you she murmured it will wear away with time and with change of scene he answered sadly change of scene she repeated in a startled tone are you going away yes i have sold my station and intend leaving australia for ever during the next three months and where are you going asked the girl rather bewildered anywhere he said a little bitterly i am going to follow the example of cain and be a wanderer on the face of the earth alone that is what i have come to see you about said brian looking steadily at her i have come to ask you if you will marry me at once and we will leave australia together she hesitated i know it is asking a great deal he said hurriedly to leave your friends your position and with hesitation your father but think of my life without you think how lonely i shall be wandering round the world by myself but you will not desert me now i have so much need of you you will come with me and be my good angel in the future as you have been in the past she put her hand on his arm and looking at him with her clear grey eyes said yes thank god for that said brian reverently and there was again a silence then they sat down and talked about their plans and built castles in the air after the fashion of lovers i wonder what papa will say observed madge idly twisting her engagement ring round and round brian frowned and a dark look passed over his face i suppose i must speak to him about it he said at length reluctantly yes of course she replied lightly it is merely a formality still one that must be observed and where is mr frettlby asked fitzgerald rising in the billiard room she answered as she followed his example no she continued as she saw her father step on to the verandah here he is brian had not seen mark frettlby for some time and was astonished at the change which had taken place in his appearance formerly he had been as straight as an arrow with a stern fresh coloured face but now he had a slight stoop and his face looked old and withered his thick black hair was streaked here and there with white his eyes alone were unchanged they were as keen and bright as ever brian knew full well how he himself had altered he knew too that madge was not the same and now he could not but wonder whether the great change that was apparent in her father was attributable to the same source to the murder of oliver whyte sad and thoughtful as mr frettlby looked as he came along a smile broke over his face as he caught sight of his daughter my dear fitzgerald he said holding out his hand this is indeed a surprise when did you come over about half an hour ago replied brian reluctantly taking the extended hand of the millionaire i came to see madge and have a talk with you ah that's right said the other putting his arm round his daughter's waist so that's what has brought the roses to your face young lady he went on pinching her cheek playfully you will stay to dinner of course fitzgerald thank you no answered brian hastily my dress nonsense interrupted frettlby hospitably we are not in melbourne and i am sure madge will excuse your dress you must stay yes do said madge in a beseeching tone touching his hand lightly i don't see so much of you that i can let you off with half an hour's conversation brian seemed to be making a violent effort very well he said in a low voice i shall stay and now said frettlby in a brisk tone as he sat down the important question of dinner being settled what is it you want to see me about your station no answered brian leaning against the verandah post while madge slipped her hand through his arm i have sold it sold it echoed frettlby aghast what for i felt restless and wanted a change ah a rolling stone said the millionaire shaking his head gathers no moss you know stones don't roll of their own accord replied brian in a gloomy tone they are impelled by a force over which they have no control oh indeed said the millionaire in a joking tone and may i ask what is your propelling force brian looked at the man's face with such a steady gaze that the latter's eyes dropped after an uneasy attempt to return it well he said impatiently looking at the two tall young people standing before him what do you want to see me about madge has agreed to marry me at once and i want your consent impossible said frettlby curtly there is no such a word as impossible retorted brian coolly thinking of the famous remark in richelieu why should you refuse i am rich now pshaw said frettlby rising impatiently it's not money i'm thinking about i've got enough for both of you but i cannot live without madge then come with us said his daughter kissing him her lover however did not second the invitation but stood moodily twisting his tawny moustache and staring out into the garden in an absent sort of manner what do you say fitzgerald said frettlby who was eyeing him keenly oh delighted of course answered brian confusedly in that case returned the other coolly i will tell you what we will do i have bought a steam yacht and she will be ready for sea about the end of january you will marry my daughter at once and go round new zealand for your honeymoon when you return if i feel inclined and you two turtle doves don't object i will join you and we will make a tour of the world oh how delightful cried madge clasping her hands i am so fond of the ocean with a companion of course she added with a saucy glance at her lover brian's face had brightened considerably for he was a born sailor and a pleasant yachting voyage in the blue waters of the pacific with madge as his companion was to his mind as near paradise as any mortal could get and what is the name of the yacht he asked with deep interest her name repeated mr frettlby hastily oh a very ugly name and one which i intend to change at present she is called the 'rosanna' rosanna brian and his betrothed both started at this and the former stared curiously at the old man wondering at the coincidence between the name of the yacht and that of the woman who died in the melbourne slum mr frettlby flushed a little when he saw brian's eye fixed on him with such an enquiring gaze and rose with an embarrassed laugh you are a pair of moon struck lovers he said gaily taking an arm of each and leading them into the house but you forget dinner will soon be ready chapter xxiii across the walnuts and the wine moore sweetest of bards sings oh there's nothing half so sweet in life as love's young dream but he made this assertion in his callow days before he had learned the value of a good digestion to a young and fervid youth love's young dream is no doubt very charming lovers as a rule having a small appetite but to a man who has seen the world and drunk deeply of the wine of life there is nothing half so sweet in the whole of his existence as a good dinner a hard heart and a good digestion will make any man happy so said talleyrand a cynic if you like but a man who knew the temper of his day and generation ovid wrote about the art of love brillat savarin of the art of dining yet i warrant you the gastronomical treatise of the brilliant frenchman is more widely read than the passionate songs of the roman poet who does not value as the sweetest in the whole twenty four the hour when seated at an artistically laid table with delicately cooked viands good wines and pleasant company all the cares and worries of the day give place to a delightful sense of absolute enjoyment dinner with the english people is generally a very dreary affair and there is a heaviness about the whole thing which communicates itself to the guests who eat and drink with a solemn persistence as though they were occupied in fulfilling some sacred rite but there are men alas few and far between who possess the rare art of giving good dinners good in the sense of sociality as well as in that of cookery mark frettlby was one of these rare individuals he had an innate genius for getting pleasant people together people who so to speak dovetailed into one another he had an excellent cook and his wines were irreproachable so that brian in spite of his worries was glad that he had accepted the invitation the bright gleam of the silver the glitter of glass and the perfume of flowers all collected under the subdued crimson glow of a pink shaded lamp which hung from the ceiling could not but give him a pleasurable sensation on one side of the dining room were the french windows opening on to the verandah and beyond appeared the vivid green of the trees and the dazzling colours of the flowers somewhat tempered by the soft hazy glow of the twilight brian had made himself as respectable as possible under the odd circumstances of dining in his riding dress and sat next to madge contentedly sipping his wine and listening to the pleasant chatter which was going on around him felix rolleston was in great spirits the more so as mrs rolleston was at the further end of the table hidden from his view julia featherweight sat near mr frettlby and chatted to him so persistently that he wished she would become possessed of a dumb devil dr chinston and peterson were seated on the other side of the table and the old colonist whose name was valpy had the post of honour on mr frettlby's right hand the conversation had turned on to the subject ever green and fascinating of politics and mr rolleston thought it a good opportunity to air his views as to the government of the colony and to show his wife that he really meant to obey her wish and become a power in the political world by jove you know he said with a wave of his hand as though he were addressing the house the country is going to the dogs and all that sort of thing what we want is a man like beaconsfield ah but you can't pick up a man like that every day said frettlby who was listening with an amused smile to rolleston's disquisitions rather a good thing too observed dr chinston dryly genius would become too common well when i am elected said felix who had his own views which modesty forbade him to publish on the subject of the coming colonial disraeli i probably shall form a party to advocate what asked peterson curiously oh well you see hesitated felix i haven't drawn up a programme yet so can't say at present yes you can hardly give a performance without a programme said the doctor taking a sip of wine and then everybody laughed and on what are your political opinions founded asked mr frettlby absently without looking at felix oh you see i've read the parliamentary reports and constitutional history and and vivian grey said felix who began to feel himself somewhat at sea the last of which is what the author called it a lusus naturae observed chinston don't erect your political schemes on such bubble foundations as are in that novel for you won't find a marquis carabas out here unfortunately no observed felix mournfully but we may find a vivian grey every one smothered a smile the allusion was so patent well he didn't succeed in the end cried peterson of course he didn't retorted felix disdainfully he made an enemy of a woman and a man who is such a fool as to do that deserves to fall you have an excellent opinion of our sex mr rolleston said madge with a wicked glance at the wife of that gentleman who was listening complacently to her husband's aimless chatter no better than they deserve replied rolleston gallantly but you have never gone in for politics mr frettlby who i no said the host rousing himself out of the brown study into which he had fallen i'm afraid i'm not sufficiently patriotic and my business did not permit me and now now echoed mr frettlby glancing at his daughter i intend to travel the jolliest thing out said peterson eagerly one never gets tired of seeing the queer things that are in the world i've seen queer enough things in melbourne in the early days said the old colonist with a wicked twinkle in his eyes oh cried julia putting her hands up to her ears don't tell me them for i'm sure they're naughty we weren't saints then said old valpy with a senile chuckle ah then we haven't changed much in that respect retorted frettlby drily you talk of your theatres now went on valpy with the garrulousness of old age why you haven't got a dancer like rosanna brian started on hearing this name again and he felt madge's cold hand touch his and who was rosanna asked felix curiously looking up a dancer and burlesque actress replied valpy vivaciously nodding his old head such a beauty we were all mad about her such hair and eyes you remember her frettlby yes answered the host in a curiously dry voice but before mr valpy had the opportunity to wax more eloquent madge rose from the table and the other ladies followed the ever polite felix held the door open for them and received a bright smile from his wife for what she considered his brilliant talk at the dinner table brian sat still and wondered why frettlby changed colour on hearing the name he supposed that the millionaire had been mixed up with the actress and did not care about being reminded of his early indiscretions and after all who does she was as light as a fairy continued valpy with wicked chuckle what became of her asked brian abruptly mark frettlby looked up suddenly as fitzgerald asked this question she went to england in said the aged one i'm not quite sure if it was july or august but it was in you will excuse me valpy but i hardly think that these reminiscences of a ballet dancer are amusing said frettlby curtly pouring himself out a glass of wine let us change the subject notwithstanding the plainly expressed wish of his host brian felt strongly inclined to pursue the conversation politeness however forbade such a thing and he consoled himself with the reflection that after dinner he would ask old valpy about the ballet dancer whose name caused mark frettlby to exhibit such strong emotion but to his annoyance when the gentlemen went into the drawing room frettlby took the old colonist off to his study where he sat with him the whole evening talking over old times fitzgerald found madge seated at the piano in the drawing room playing one of mendelssohn's songs without words what a dismal thing that is you are playing madge he said lightly as he sank into a seat beside her it is more like a funeral march than anything else gad so it is said felix who came up at this moment i don't care myself about 'op ' and all that classical humbug give me something light 'belle helene' with emelie melville and all that sort of thing felix said his wife in a stern tone my dear he answered recklessly rendered bold by the champagne he had taken you observed nothing particular answered mrs rolleston glancing at him with a stony eye except that i consider offenbach low i don't said felix sitting down to the piano from which madge had just risen and to prove he ain't here goes he ran his fingers lightly over the keys and dashed into a brilliant offenbach galop which had the effect of waking up the people in the drawing room who felt sleepy after dinner and sent the blood tingling through their veins when they were thoroughly roused felix now that he had an appreciative audience for he was by no means an individual who believed in wasting his sweetness on the desert air prepared to amuse them you haven't heard the last new song by frosti have you he asked after he had brought his galop to a conclusion is that the composer of 'inasmuch' and 'how so' asked julia clasping her hands i do love his music and the words are so sweetly pretty infernally stupid she means whispered peterson to brian they've no more meaning in them than the titles sing us the new song felix commanded his wife and her obedient husband obeyed her it was entitled somewhere words by vashti music by paola frosti and was one of those extraordinary compositions which may mean anything that is if the meaning can be discovered felix had a pleasant voice though it was not very strong and the music was pretty while the words were mystical the first verse was as follows a flying cloud a breaking wave a faint light in a moonless sky a voice that from the silent grave sounds sad in one long bitter cry i know not sweet where you may stand with shining eyes and golden hair yet i know i will touch your hand and kiss your lips somewhere somewhere somewhere when the summer sun is fair waiting me on land or sea somewhere love somewhere the second verse was very similar to the first and when felix finished a murmur of applause broke from every one of the ladies how sweetly pretty sighed julia such a lot in it but what is its meaning asked brian rather bewildered it hasn't got one replied felix complacently surely you don't want every song to have a moral like a book of aesop's fables brian shrugged his shoulders and turned away with madge i must say i agree with fitzgerald said the doctor quickly i like a song with some meaning in it the poetry of the one you sang is as mystical as browning without any of his genius to redeem it philistine murmured felix under his breath and then vacated his seat at the piano in favour of julia who was about to sing a ballad called going down the hill which had been the rage in melbourne musical circles during the last two months meanwhile madge and brian were walking up and down in the moonlight it was an exquisite night with a cloudless blue sky glittering with the stars and a great yellow moon in the west madge seated herself on the side of the marble ledge which girdled the still pool of water in front of the house and dipped her hand into the cool water brian leaned against the trunk of a great magnolia tree whose glossy green leaves and great creamy blossoms looked fantastic in the moonlight in front of them was the house with the ruddy lamplight streaming through the wide windows and they could see the guests within excited by the music waltzing to rolleston's playing and their dark figures kept passing and re passing the windows while the charming music of the waltz mingled with their merry laughter looks like a haunted house said brian thinking of poe's weird poem but such a thing is impossible out here i don't know so much about that said madge gravely lifting up some water in the palm of her hand and letting it stream back like diamonds in the moonlight i knew a house in st kilda which was haunted by what asked brian sceptically noises she answered solemnly brian burst out laughing and startled a bat which flew round and round in the silver moonlight and whirred away into the shelter of a witch elm rats and mice are more common here than ghosts he said lightly i'm afraid the inhabitants of your haunted house were fanciful so you don't believe in ghosts there's a banshee in our family said brian with a gay smile who is supposed to cheer our death beds with her howlings but as i've never seen the lady myself i'm afraid she's a mrs harris it's aristocratic to have a ghost in a family i believe said madge that is the reason we colonials have none ah but you will have he answered with a careless laugh there are no doubt democratic as well as aristocratic ghosts but pshaw he went on impatiently what nonsense i talk there are no ghosts except of a man's own raising the ghosts of a dead youth the ghosts of past follies the ghosts of what might have been these are the spectres which are more to be feared than those of the churchyard madge looked at him in silence for she understood the meaning of that passionate outburst the secret which the dead woman had told him and which hung like a shadow over his life she arose quietly and took his arm the light touch roused him and a faint wind sent an eerie rustle through the still leaves of the magnolia as they walked back in silence to the house chapter xxiv brian receives a letter notwithstanding the hospitable invitation of mr frettlby brian refused to stay at yabba yallook that night but after saying good bye to madge mounted his horse and rode slowly away in the moonlight he felt very happy and letting the reins lie on his horse's neck he gave himself up unreservedly to his thoughts atra cura certainly did not sit behind the horseman on this night and brian to his surprise found himself singing kitty of coleraine as he rode along in the silver moonlight and was he not right to sing when the future seemed so bright and pleasant oh yes they would live on the ocean and she would find how much pleasanter it was on the restless waters with their solemn sense of mystery than on the crowded land was not the sea made for the free land for courts and slaves alone moore was perfectly right she would learn that when with a fair wind and all sail set they were flying over the blue pacific waters and then they would go home to ireland to the ancestral home of the fitzgeralds where he would lead her in under the arch with cead mille failthe on it and everyone would bless the fair young bride why should he trouble himself about the crime of another no he had made a resolve and intended to keep it he would put this secret with which he had been entrusted behind his back and would wander about the world with madge and her father he felt a sudden chill come over him as he murmured the last words to himself her father i'm a fool he said impatiently as he gathered up the reins and spurred his horse into a canter it can make no difference to me so long as madge remains ignorant but to sit beside him to eat with him to have him always present like a skeleton at a feast god help me he urged his horse into a gallop and as he rushed over the turf with the fresh cool night wind blowing keenly against his face he felt a sense of relief as though he were leaving some dark spectre behind on he galloped with the blood throbbing in his young veins over miles of plain with the dark blue star studded sky above and the pale moon shining down on him past a silent shepherd's hut which stood near a wide creek splashing through the cool water which wound through the dark plain like a thread of silver in the moonlight then again the wide grassy plain dotted here and there with tall clumps of shadowy trees and on either side he could see the sheep skurrying away like fantastic spectres on on ever on until his own homestead appears and he sees the star like light shining brightly in the distance a long avenue of tall trees over whose wavering shadows his horse thundered and then the wide grassy space in front of the house with the clamorous barking of dogs a groom roused by the clatter of hoofs up the avenue comes round the side of the house and brian leaps off his horse and flinging the reins to the man walks into his own room there he finds a lighted lamp brandy and soda on the table and a packet of letters and newspapers he flung his hat on the sofa and opened the window and door so as to let in the cool breeze then mixing for himself a glass of brandy and soda he turned up the lamp and prepared to read his letters the first he took up was from a lady always a she correspondent for me says isaac disraeli provided she does not cross brian's correspondence did not cross but notwithstanding this after reading half a page of small talk and scandal he flung the letter on the table with an impatient ejaculation the other letters were principally business ones but the last one proved to be from calton and fitzgerald opened it with a sensation of pleasure calton was a capital letter writer and his epistles had done much to cheer fitzgerald in the dismal period which succeeded his acquittal of whyte's murder when he was in danger of getting into a morbid state of mind brian therefore sipped his brandy and soda and lying back in his chair prepared to enjoy himself my dear fitzgerald wrote calton his peculiarly clear handwriting which was such an exception to the usual crabbed hieroglyphics of his brethren of the bar while you are enjoying the cool breezes and delightful freshness of the country here am i with numerous other poor devils cooped up in this hot and dusty city how i wish i were with you in the land of goschen by the rolling waters of the murray where everything is bright and green and unsophisticated the two latter terms are almost identical instead of which my view is bounded by bricks and mortar and the muddy waters of the yarra have to do duty for your noble river ah i too have lived in arcadia but i don't now and even if some power gave me the choice to go back again i am not sure that i would accept arcadia after all is a lotus eating paradise of blissful ignorance and i love the world with its pomps vanities and wickedness while you therefore oh corydon don't be afraid i'm not going to quote virgil are studying nature's book i am deep in the musty leaves of themis' volume but i dare say that the great mother teaches you much better things than her artificial daughter does me however you remember that pithy proverb 'when one is in rome one must not speak ill of the pope' so being in the legal profession i must respect its muse i suppose when you saw that this letter came from a law office you wondered what the deuce a lawyer was writing to you for and my handwriting no doubt suggested a writ pshaw i am wrong there you are past the age of writs not that i hint that you are old by no means you are just at that appreciative age when a man enjoys life most when the fire of youth is tempered by the experience of age and one knows how to enjoy to the utmost the good things of this world videlicet love wine and friendship i am afraid i am growing poetical which is a bad thing for a lawyer for the flower of poetry cannot flourish in the arid wastes of the law on reading what i have written i find i have been as discursive as praed's vicar and as this letter is supposed to be a business one i must deny myself the luxury of following out a train of idle ideas and write sense i suppose you still hold the secret which rosanna moore entrusted you with ah you see i know her name and why simply because with the natural curiosity of the human race i have been trying to find out who murdered oliver whyte and as the argus very cleverly pointed out rosanna moore as likely to be at the bottom of the whole affair i have been learning her past history the secret of whyte's murder and the reason for it is known to you but you refuse even in the interests of justice to reveal it why i don't know but we all have our little faults and from an amiable though mistaken sense of shall i say duty you refuse to deliver up the man whose cowardly crime so nearly cost you your life after your departure from melbourne every one said 'the hansom cab tragedy is at an end and the murderer will never be discovered' i ventured to disagree with the wiseacres who made such a remark and asked myself 'who was this woman who died at mother guttersnipe's' receiving no satisfactory answer from myself i determined to find out and took steps accordingly in the first place i learned from roger moreland who if you remember was a witness against you at the trial that whyte and rosanna moore had come out to sydney in the john elder about a year ago as mr and mrs whyte i need hardly say that they did not think it needful to go through the formality of marriage as such a tie might have been found inconvenient on some future occasion moreland knew nothing about rosanna moore and advised me to give up the search as coming from a city like london it would be difficult to find anyone that knew her there notwithstanding this i telegraphed home to a friend of mine who is a bit of an amateur detective 'find out the name and all about the woman who left england in the john elder on the st day of august as wife of oliver whyte' mirabile dictu he found out all about her and knowing as you do what a maelstrom of humanity london is you must admit my friend was clever it appears however that the task i set him was easier than he expected for the so called mrs whyte was rather a notorious individual in her own way she was a burlesque actress at the frivolity theatre in london and being a very handsome woman had been photographed innumerable times consequently when she very foolishly went with whyte to choose a berth on board the boat she was recognised by the clerks in the office as rosanna moore better known as musette of the frivolity why she ran away with whyte i cannot tell you with reference to men understanding women i refer you to balzac's remark anent the same perhaps musette got weary of st john's wood and champagne suppers and longed for the purer air of her native land ah you open your eyes at this latter statement you are surprised no on second thoughts you are not because she told you herself that she was a native of sydney and had gone home in after a triumphant career of acting in melbourne and why did she leave the applauding melbourne public and the flesh pots of egypt you know this also she ran away with a rich young squatter with more money than morals who happened to be in melbourne at the time she seems to have had a weakness for running away but why she chose whyte to go with this time puzzles me he was not rich not particularly good looking had no position and a bad temper how do i know all these traits of mr whyte's character morally and socially easily enough my omniscient friend found them all out mr oliver whyte was the son of a london tailor and his father being well off retired into a private life and ultimately went the way of all flesh his son finding himself with a capital income and a pretty taste for amusement cut the shop of his late lamented parent found out that his family had come over with the conqueror glanville de whyte helped to sew the bayeux tapestry i suppose and graduated at the frivolity theatre as a masher in common with the other gilded youth of the day he worshipped at the gas lit shrine of musette and the goddess pleased with his incense left her other admirers in the lurch and ran off with fortunate mr whyte so far as this goes there is nothing to show why the murder was committed men do not perpetrate crimes for the sake of light o' loves like musette unless indeed some wretched youth embezzles money to buy jewellery for his divinity the career of musette in london was simply that of a clever member of the demi monde and as far as i can learn no one was so much in love with her as to commit a crime for her sake so far so good the motive of the crime must be found in australia whyte had spent nearly all his money in england and consequently musette and her lover arrived in sydney with comparatively very little cash however with an epicurean like philosophy they enjoyed themselves on what little they had and then came to melbourne where they stayed at a second rate hotel musette i may tell you had one special vice a common one drink she loved champagne and drank a good deal of it consequently on arriving at melbourne and finding that a new generation had arisen which knew not joseph i mean musette she drowned her sorrows in the flowing bowl and went out after a quarrel with mr whyte to view melbourne by night a familiar scene to her no doubt what took her to little bourke street i don't know perhaps she got lost perhaps it had been a favourite walk of hers in the old days at all events she was found dead drunk in that unsavoury locality by sal rawlins i know this is so because sal told me so herself sal acted the part of the good samaritan took her to the squalid den she called home and there rosanna moore fell dangerously ill whyte who had missed her found out where she was and that she was too ill to be removed i presume he was rather glad to get rid of such an encumbrance so he went back to his lodgings at st kilda which judging from the landlady's story he must have occupied for some time while rosanna moore was drinking herself to death in a quiet hotel still he does not break off his connection with the dying woman but one night is murdered in a hansom cab and that same night rosanna moore dies so from all appearance everything is ended not so for before dying rosanna sends for brian fitzgerald at his club and reveals to him a secret which he locks up in his own heart the writer of this letter has a theory a fanciful one if you will that the secret told to brian fitzgerald contains the mystery of oliver whyte's death now then have i not found out a good deal without you and do you still decline to reveal the rest i do not say you know who killed whyte but i do say you know sufficient to lead to the detection of the murderer if you tell me so much the better both for your own sense of justice and for your peace of mind if you do not well i shall find out without you i have taken and still take a great interest in this strange case and i have sworn to bring the murderer to justice so i make this last appeal to you to tell me what you know if you refuse i will set to work to find out all about rosanna moore prior to her departure from australia in and i am certain sooner or later to discover the secret which led to whyte's murder if there is any strong reason why it should be kept silent i perhaps will come round to your view and let the matter drop but if i have to find it out myself the murderer of oliver whyte need expect no mercy at my hands so think over what i have said if i do not hear from you within the next week i shall regard your decision as final and pursue the search myself i am sure my dear fitzgerald you will find this letter too long in spite of the interesting story it contains so i will have pity on you and draw to a close remember me to miss frettlby and to her father with kind regards to yourself i remain yours very truly duncan calton when fitzgerald had finished the last of the closely written sheets he let the letter fall from his hands and leaning back in his chair stared blankly into the dawning light outside he arose after a few moments and pouring himself out a glass of brandy drank it quickly then mechanically lighting a cigar he stepped out of the door into the fresh beauty of the dawn there was a soft crimson glow in the east which announced the approach of the sun and he could hear the chirping of the awakening birds in the trees but brian did not see the marvellous breaking of the dawn he stood staring at the red light flaring in the east and thinking of calton's letter i can do no more he said bitterly leaning his head against the wall of the house there is only one way of stopping calton and that is by telling him all my poor madge my poor madge a soft wind arose and rustled among the trees and there appeared great shafts of crimson light in the east then with a sudden blaze the sun peered over the brim of the wide plain the warm yellow rays touched lightly the comely head of the weary man and turning round he held up his arms to the great luminary as though he were a fire worshipper i accept the omen of the dawn he cried for her life and for mine chapter xxv what dr chinston said his resolution taken brian did not let the grass grow under his feet but rode over in the afternoon to tell madge of his intended departure the servant told him she was in the garden so he went there and guided by the sound of merry voices and the laughter of pretty women soon found his way to the lawn tennis ground madge and her guests were there seated under the shade of a great witch elm and watching with great interest a single handed match being played between rolleston and peterson both of whom were capital players mr frettlby was not present he was inside writing letters and talking with old mr valpy and brian gave a sigh of relief as he noted his absence madge caught sight of him as he came down the garden path and flew quickly towards him with outstretched hands as he took his hat off how good of you to come she said in a delighted tone as she took his arm and on such a hot day yes it's something fearful in the shade said pretty mrs rolleston with a laugh putting up her sunshade pardon me if i think the contrary replied fitzgerald bowing with an expressive look at the charming group of ladies under the great tree mrs rolleston blushed and shook her head ah it's easy seen you come from ireland mr fitzgerald she observed as she resumed her seat you are making madge jealous so he is answered madge with a gay laugh i shall certainly inform mr rolleston about you brian if you make these gallant remarks here he comes then said her lover as rolleston and peterson having finished their game walked off the tennis ground and joined the group under the tree though in tennis flannels they both looked remarkably warm and throwing aside his racket mr rolleston sat down with a sigh of relief thank goodness it's over and that i have won he said wiping his heated brow galley slaves couldn't have worked harder than we have done while all you idle folks sat sub tegmine fagi which means asked his wife lazily that onlookers see most of the game answered her husband impudently i suppose that's what you call a free and easy translation said peterson laughing mrs rolleston ought to give you something for your new and original adaptation of virgil let it be iced then retorted rolleston lying full length on the ground and staring up at the blue of the sky as seen through the network of leaves i always like my 'something' iced it's a way you've got said madge with a laugh as she gave him a glass filled with some sparkling golden coloured liquor with a lump of ice clinking musically against the side of it he's not the only one who's got that way said peterson gaily when he had been similarly supplied it's a way we've got in the army it's a way we've got in the navy it's a way we've got in the 'varsity and so say all of us finished rolleston and holding out his glass to be replenished i'll have another please whew it is hot what the drink asked julia with a giggle no the day answered felix making a face at her it's the kind of day one feels inclined to adopt sydney smith's advice by getting out of one's skin and letting the wind whistle through one's bones with such a hot wind blowing said peterson gravely i'm afraid they'd soon be broiled bones go giddy one retorted felix throwing his hat at him or i'll drag you into the blazing sun and make you play another game not i replied peterson coolly not being a salamander i'm hardly used to your climate yet and there is a limit even to lawn tennis and turning his back on rolleston he began to talk to julia featherweight meanwhile madge and her lover leaving all this frivolous chatter behind them were walking slowly towards the house and brian was telling her of his approaching departure though not of his reasons for it i received a letter last night he said turning his face away from her and as it's about some important business i must start at once i don't think it will be long before we follow answered madge thoughtfully papa leaves here at the end of the week why i'm sure i don't know said madge petulantly he is so restless and never seems to settle down to anything he says for the rest of his life he is going to do nothing but wander all over the world there suddenly flashed across fitzgerald's mind a line from genesis which seemed singularly applicable to mr frettlby a fugitive and a vagabond thou shalt be in the earth everyone gets these restless fits sooner or later he said idly in fact with an uneasy laugh i believe i'm in one myself that puts me in mind of what i heard dr chinston say yesterday she said this is the age of unrest as electricity and steam have turned us all into bohemians ah bohemia is a pleasant place said brian absently unconsciously quoting thackeray but we all lose our way to it late in life at that rate we won't lose our way to it for some time she said laughing as they stepped into the drawing room so cool and shady after the heat and glare outside as they entered mr frettlby rose from a chair near the window he appeared to have been reading for he held a book in his hand what fitzgerald he exclaimed in a hearty tone as he held out his hand i am glad to see you i let you know i am living don't i replied brian his face flushing as he reluctantly took the proffered hand but the fact is i have come to say good bye for a few days ah going back to town i suppose said mr frettlby lying back in his chair and playing with his watch chain i don't know that you are wise exchanging the clear air of the country for the dusty atmosphere of melbourne yet madge tells me you are going back said brian idly toying with a vase of flowers on the table depends upon circumstances replied the other carelessly i may and i may not you go on business i presume well the fact is calton here brian stopped suddenly and bit his lip with vexation for he had not intended to mention the lawyer's name yes said mr frettlby interrogatively sitting up quickly and looking keenly at brian wants to see me on business he finished awkwardly connected with the sale of your station i suppose said frettlby still keeping his eyes on the young man's face can't have a better man calton's an excellent man of business a little too excellent replied fitzgerald ruefully he's a man who can't leave well alone a propos of what oh nothing answered fitzgerald hastily and just then his eyes met those of frettlby the two men looked at one another steadily for a moment but in that short space of time a single name flashed through their brains the name of rosanna moore mr frettlby was the first to lower his eyes and break the spell ah well he said lightly as he rose from his chair and held out his hand if you are two weeks in town call at st kilda and it's more than likely you will find us there brian shook hands in silence and watched him pick up his hat and move on to the verandah and then out into the hot sunshine he knows he muttered involuntarily knows what sir said madge who came silently behind him and slipped her arm through his that you are hungry and want something to eat before you leave us i don't feel hungry said brian as they walked towards the door nonsense answered madge merrily who like eve was on hospitable thoughts intent i'm not going to have you appear in melbourne a pale fond lover as though i were treating you badly come sir no she continued putting up her hand as he tried to kiss her business first pleasure afterwards and they went into the dining room laughing mark frettlby wandered down to the lawn tennis ground thinking of the look he had seen in brian's eyes he shivered for a moment in the hot sunshine as though it had grown suddenly chill someone stepping across my grave he murmured to himself with a cynical smile bah how superstitious i am and yet he knows he knows come on sir cried felix who had just caught sight of him a racket awaits you frettlby awoke with a start and found himself near the lawn tennis ground and felix at his elbow smoking a cigarette he roused himself with a great effort and tapped the young man lightly on the shoulder what he said with a forced laugh do you really expect me to play lawn tennis on such a day you are mad i am hot you mean retorted the imperturbable rolleston blowing a wreath of smoke that's a foregone conclusion said dr chinston who came up at that moment such a charming novel cried julia who had just caught the last remark what is asked peterson rather puzzled howell's book 'a foregone conclusion' said julia also looking puzzled weren't you talking about it i'm afraid this talk is getting slightly incoherent said felix with a sigh we all seem madder than usual to day speak for yourself said chinston indignantly i'm as sane as any man in the world exactly retorted the other coolly that's what i say and you being a doctor ought to know that every man and woman in the world is more or less mad where are your facts asked chinston smiling my facts are all visible ones said felix gravely pointing to the company they're all crooked on some point or another there was a chorus of indignant denial at this and then every one burst out laughing at the extraordinary way in which mr rolleston was arguing if you go on like that in the house said frettlby amused you will at all events have an entertaining parliament ah they'll never have an entertaining parliament till they admit ladies observed peterson with a quizzical glance at julia it will be a parliament of love then retorted the doctor dryly and not mediaeval either frettlby took the doctor's arm and walked away with him i want you to come up to my study doctor he said as they strolled towards the house and examine me why don't you feel well said chinston as they entered the house not lately replied frettlby i'm afraid i've got heart disease the doctor looked sharply at him and then shook his head nonsense he said cheerfully it's a common delusion with people that they have heart disease and in nine cases out of ten it's all imagination unless indeed he added waggishly the patient happens to be a young man ah i suppose you think i'm safe as far as that goes said frettlby as they entered the study and what did you think of rolleston's argument about people being mad it was amusing replied chinston taking a seat frettlby doing the same that's all i can say about it though mind you i think there are more mad people at large than the world is aware of indeed yes do you remember that horrible story of dickens' in the 'pickwick papers' about the man who was mad and knew it yet successfully concealed it for years well i believe there are many people like that in the world people whose lives are one long struggle against insanity and yet who eat drink talk and walk with the rest of their fellow men apparently as gay and light hearted as they are how extraordinary half the murders and suicides are done in temporary fits of insanity went on chinston and if a person broods over anything his incipient madness is sure to break out sooner or later but of course there are cases where a perfectly sane person may commit a murder on the impulse of the moment but i regard such persons as mad for the time being but again a murder may be planned and executed in the most cold blooded manner and in the latter case said frettlby without looking at the doctor and playing with a paper knife do you regard the murderer as mad yes i do answered the doctor bluntly he is as mad as a person who kills another because he supposes he has been told by god to do so only there is method in his madness for instance i believe that hansom cab murder in which you were mixed up i wasn't mixed up in it interrupted frettlby pale with anger beg pardon said chinston coolly a slip of the tongue i was thinking of fitzgerald well i believe that crime to have been premeditated and that the man who committed it was mad he is no doubt at large now walking about and conducting himself as sanely as you or i yet the germ of insanity is there and sooner or later he will commit another crime how do you know it was premeditated asked frettlby abruptly any one can see that answered the other whyte was watched on that night and when fitzgerald went away the other was ready to take his place dressed the same that's nothing retorted frettlby looking at his companion sharply there are dozens of men in melbourne who wear evening dress light coats and soft hats in fact i generally wear them myself well that might have been a coincidence said the doctor rather disconcerted but the use of chloroform puts the question beyond a doubt people don't usually carry chloroform about with them i suppose not answered the other and then the matter dropped chinston made an examination of mark frettlby and when he had finished his face was very grave though he laughed at the millionaire's fears you are all right he said gaily action of the heart a little weak that's all only impressively avoid excitement avoid excitement just as frettlby was putting on his coat a knock came to the door and madge entered brian is gone she began oh i beg your pardon doctor but is papa ill she asked with sudden fear no child no said frettlby hastily i'm all right i thought my heart was affected but it isn't not a bit of it answered chinston reassuringly all right only avoid excitement but when frettlby turned to go to the door madge who had her eyes fixed on the doctor's face saw how grave it was there is danger she said touching his arm as they paused for a moment at the door no no he answered hastily yes there is she persisted tell me the worst it is best for me to know the doctor looked at her in some doubt for a few moments and then placed his hand on her shoulder my dear young lady he said gravely i will tell you what i have not dared to tell your father what she asked in a low voice her face growing pale his heart is affected and there is great danger yes great danger in the event of any sudden shock he hesitated yes he would probably drop down dead my god chapter xxvi kilsip has a theory of his own mr calton sat in his office reading a letter he had just received from fitzgerald and judging from the complacent smile upon his face it seemed to give him the greatest satisfaction i know wrote brian that now you have taken up the affair you will not stop until you find out everything so as i want the matter to rest as at present i will anticipate you and reveal all you were right in your conjecture that i knew something likely to lead to the detection of whyte's murderer but when i tell you my reasons for keeping such a thing secret i am sure you will not blame me mind you i do not say that i know who committed the murder but i have suspicions very strong suspicions and i wish to god rosanna moore had died before she told me what she did however i will tell you all and leave you to judge as to whether i was justified in concealing what i was told i will call at your office some time next week and then you will learn everything that rosanna moore told me but once that you are possessed of the knowledge you will pity me most extraordinary mused calton leaning back in his chair as he laid down the letter i wonder if he's about to tell me that he killed whyte after all and that sal rawlins perjured herself to save him no that's nonsense or she'd have turned up in better time and wouldn't have risked his neck up to the last moment though i make it a rule never to be surprised at anything i expect what brian fitzgerald has to tell me will startle me considerably i've never met with such an extraordinary case and from all appearances the end isn't reached yet after all said mr calton thoughtfully truth is stranger than fiction here a knock came to the door and in answer to an invitation to enter it opened and kilsip glided into the room you're not engaged sir he said in his soft low voice oh dear no answered calton carelessly come in come in kilsip closed the door softly and gliding along in his usual velvet footed manner sat down in a chair near calton's and placing his hat on the ground looked keenly at the barrister well kilsip said calton with a yawn playing with his watch chain any good news to tell me well nothing particularly new purred the detective rubbing his hands together nothing new and nothing true and no matter said calton quoting emerson and what have you come to see me about the hansom cab murder replied the other quietly the deuce cried calton startled out of his professional dignity and have you found out who did it no answered kilsip rather dismally but i have an idea so had gorby retorted calton dryly an idea that ended in smoke have you any practical proofs not yet that means you are going to get some if possible much virtue in 'if' quoted calton picking up a pencil and scribbling idly on his blotting paper and to whom does your suspicion point aha said mr kilsip cautiously don't know him answered the other coolly family name humbug i presume bosh whom do you suspect kilsip looked round cautiously as if to make sure they were alone and then said in a stage whisper roger moreland that was the young man that gave evidence as to how whyte got drunk kilsip nodded well and how do you connect him with the murder do you remember in the evidence given by the cabmen royston and rankin they both swore that the man who was with whyte on that night wore a diamond ring on the forefinger of the right hand what of that nearly every second man in melbourne wears a diamond ring but not on the forefinger of the right hand oh and moreland wears a ring in that way yes merely a coincidence is that all your proof all i can obtain at present it's very weak said calton scornfully the weakest proofs may form a chain to hang a man observed kilsip sententiously moreland gave his evidence clearly enough said calton rising and pacing the room he met whyte they got drunk together whyte went out of the hotel and shortly afterwards moreland followed with the coat which was left behind by whyte and then someone snatched it from him ah did they interrupted kilsip quickly so moreland says said calton stopping short i understand you think moreland was not so drunk as he would make out and that after following whyte outside he put on his coat and got into the cab with him that is my theory it's ingenious enough said the barrister but why should moreland murder whyte what motive had he those papers pshaw another idea of gorby's said calton angrily how do you know there were any papers the fact is calton did not intend kilsip to know that whyte really had papers until he heard what fitzgerald had to tell him and another thing said calton resuming his walk if your theory is correct which i don't think it is what became of whyte's coat has moreland got it no he has not answered the detective decisively you seem very positive about it said the lawyer after a moment's pause did you ask moreland about it a reproachful look came into kilsip's white face not quite so green he said forcing a smile i thought you'd a better opinion of me than that mr calton ask him no then how did you find out the fact is moreland is employed as a barman in the kangaroo hotel a barman echoed calton and he came out here as a gentleman of independent fortune why hang it man that in itself is sufficient to prove that he had no motive to murder whyte moreland pretty well lived on whyte so what could have induced him to kill his golden goose and become a barman pshaw the idea is absurd well you may be right about the matter said kilsip rather angrily and if gorby makes mistakes i don't pretend to be infallible but at all events when i saw moreland in the bar he wore a silver ring on the forefinger of his right hand silver isn't a diamond no but it shows that was the finger he was accustomed to wear his ring on when i saw that i determined to search his room i managed to do so while he was out and found a mare's nest kilsip nodded and so your castle of cards falls to the ground said calton jestingly your idea is absurd moreland no more committed the murder than i did why he was too drunk on that night to do anything humph so he says well men don't calumniate themselves for nothing it was a lesser danger to avert a greater one replied kilsip coolly i am sure that moreland was not drunk on that night he only said so to escape awkward questions as to his movements depend upon it he knows more than he lets out well and how do you intend to set about the matter i shall start looking for the coat first ah you think he has hidden it i am sure of it my theory is this when moreland got out of the cab at powlett street but he didn't interrupted calton angrily let us suppose for the sake of argument that he did said kilsip quietly i say when he left the cab he walked up powlett street turned to the left down george street and walked back to town through the fitzroy gardens then knowing that the coat was noticeable he threw it away or rather hid it and walked out of the gardens through the town in evening dress more noticeable than the coat he wasn't in evening dress said kilsip quietly no neither was he observed calton eagerly recalling the evidence at the trial another blow to your theory the murderer was in evening dress the cabman said so yes because he had seen mr fitzgerald in evening dress a few minutes before and thought that he was the same man who got into the cab with whyte well what of that if you remember the second man had his coat buttoned up moreland wore dark trousers at least i suppose so and with the coat buttoned up it was easy for the cabman to make the mistake believing as he did that it was mr fitzgerald that sounds better said calton thoughtfully and what are you going to do look for the coat in the fitzroy gardens pshaw a wild goose chase possibly said kilsip as he arose to go and when shall i see you again said calton oh to night said kilsip pausing at the door i had nearly forgotten mother guttersnipe wants to see you why what's up she's dying and wants to tell you some secret rosanna moore by jove said calton she'll tell me something about her i'll get to the bottom of this yet all right i'll be here at eight o'clock very well sir and the detective glided out i wonder if that old woman knows anything said calton to himself as he resumed his seat she may have overheard some conversation between whyte and his mistress and intends to divulge it well i'm afraid when fitzgerald does confess i shall know all about it beforehand chapter xxvii mother guttersnipe joins the majority punctual to his appointment kilsip called at calton's office at eight o'clock in order to guide him through the squalid labyrinths of the slums he found the barrister waiting impatiently for him the fact is calton had got it into his head that rosanna moore was at the bottom of the whole mystery and every new piece of evidence he discovered went to confirm this belief when rosanna moore was dying she might have confessed something to mother guttersnipe which would hint at the name of the murderer and he had a strong suspicion that the old hag had received hush money in order to keep quiet several times before calton had been on the point of going to her and trying to get the secret out of her that is if she knew it but now fate appeared to be playing into his hands and a voluntary confession was much more likely to be true than one dragged piecemeal from unwilling lips by the time kilsip made his appearance calton was in a high state of excitement i suppose we'd better go at once he said to kilsip as he lit a cigar that old hag may go off at any moment she might assented kilsip doubtfully but i wouldn't be a bit surprised if she pulled through some of these old women have nine lives like a cat not improbable retorted calton as they passed into the brilliantly lighted street her nature seemed to me to be essentially feline but tell me he went on what's the matter with her old age partly drink also i think answered kilsip besides her surroundings are not very healthy and her dissipated habits have pretty well settled her it isn't anything catching i hope cried the barrister with a shudder as they passed into the crowd of bourke street don't know sir not being a doctor answered the detective stolidly oh ejaculated calton in dismay it will be all right sir said kilsip reassuringly i've been there dozens of times and i'm all right i dare say retorted the barrister but i may go there once and catch it whatever it is take my word sir it's nothing worse than old age and drink has she a doctor won't let one come near her prescribes for herself gin i suppose humph much more unpleasant than the usual run of medicines in a short time they found themselves in little bourke street and after traversing a few dark and narrow lanes by this time they were more or less familiar to calton they found themselves before mother guttersnipe's den they climbed the rickety stairs which groaned and creaked beneath their weight and found mother guttersnipe lying on the bed in the corner the elfish black haired child was playing cards with a slatternly looking girl at a deal table by the faint light of a tallow candle they both sprang to their feet as the strangers entered and the elfish child pushed a broken chair in a sullen manner towards mr calton while the other girl shuffled into a far corner of the room and crouched down there like a dog the noise of their entry awoke the hag from an uneasy slumber into which she had fallen sitting up in bed she huddled the clothes round her she presented such a gruesome spectacle that involuntarily calton recoiled her white hair was unbound and hung in tangled masses over her shoulders in snowy profusion her face parched and wrinkled with the hooked nose and beady black eyes like those of a mouse was poked forward and her skinny arms bare to the shoulder were waving wildly about as she grasped at the bedclothes with her claw like hands the square bottle and the broken cup lay beside her and filling herself a dram she lapped it up greedily the irritant brought on a paroxysm of coughing which lasted until the elfish child shook her well and took the cup from her greedy old beast muttered this amiable infant peering into the cup ye'd drink the yarrer dry i b'lieve yah muttered the old woman feebly who's they lizer she said shading her eyes with one trembling hand while she looked at calton and the detective the perlice cove an' the swell said lizer suddenly come to see yer turn up your toes i ain't dead yet ye whelp snarled the hag with sudden energy an' if i gits up i'll turn up yer toes cuss ye lizer gave a shrill laugh of disdain and kilsip stepped forward none of this he said sharply taking lizer by one thin shoulder and pushing her over to where the other girl was crouching stop there till i tell you to move lizer tossed back her tangled black hair and was about to make some impudent reply when the other girl who was older and wiser put out her hand and pulled her down beside her meanwhile calton was addressing himself to the old woman in the corner you wanted to see me he said gently for notwithstanding his repugnance to her she was after all a woman and dying yes cuss ye croaked mother guttersnipe lying down and pulling the greasy bedclothes up to her neck you ain't a parson with sudden suspicion no i am a lawyer i ain't a goin' to have the cussed parsons a prowlin' round 'ere growled the old woman viciously i ain't a goin' to die yet cuss ye i'm goin' to get well an' strong an' 'ave a good time of it i'm afraid you won't recover said calton gently you had better let me send for a doctor no i shan't retorted the hag aiming a blow at him with all her feeble strength i ain't a goin' to have my inside spil'd with salts and senner i don't want neither parsons nor doctors i don't i wouldn't 'ave a lawyer only i'm a thinkin' of makin' my will i am mind i gits the watch yelled lizer from the corner if you gives it to sal i'll tear her eyes out silence said kilsip sharply and with a muttered curse lizer sat back in her corner sharper than a serpent's tooth she are whined the old woman when quiet was once more restored that young devil 'ave fed at my 'ome an' now she turns cuss her well well said calton rather impatiently what is it you wanted to see me about don't be in such a 'urry said the hag with a scowl or i'm blamed if i tell you anything s'elp me she was evidently growing very weak so calton turned to kilsip and told him in a whisper to get a doctor the detective scribbled a note on some paper and giving it to lizer ordered her to take it at this the other girl arose and putting her arm in that of the child's they left together them two young 'usseys gone said mother guttersnipe right you are for i don't want what i've got to tell to git into the noospaper i don't and what is it asked calton bending forward the old woman took another drink of gin and it seemed to put life into her for she sat up in the bed and commenced to talk rapidly as though she were afraid of dying before her secret was told you've been 'ere afore she said pointing one skinny finger at calton and you wanted to find out all about 'er but you didn't she wouldn't let me tell for she was always a proud jade a flouncin' round while 'er pore mother was a starvin' her mother are you rosanna moore's mother cried calton considerably astonished may i die if i ain't croaked the hag 'er pore father died of drink cuss 'im an' i'm a follerin' 'im to the same place in the same way you weren't about town in the old days or you'd a bin after her cuss ye after rosanna the werry girl answered mother guttersnipe she were on the stage she were an' my eye what a swell she were with all the coves a dyin' for 'er an' she dancin' over their black 'earts cuss 'em but she was allays good to me till 'e came who came 'e yelled the old woman raising herself on her arm her eyes sparkling with vindictive fury 'e a comin' round with di'monds and gold and a ruinin' my pore girl an' how 'e's 'eld 'is bloomin' 'ead up all these years as if he were a saint cuss 'im cuss 'im whom does she mean whispered calton to kilsip mean screamed mother guttersnipe whose sharp ears had caught the muttered question why mark frettlby good god calton rose up in his astonishment and even kilsip's inscrutable countenance displayed some surprise aye 'e were a swell in them days pursued mother guttersnipe and 'e comes a philanderin' round my gal cuss 'im an' ruins 'er and leaves 'er an' the child to starve like a black 'earted villain as 'e were the child her name bah retorted the hag with scorn as if you didn't know my gran'daughter sal sal mark frettlby's child yes an' as pretty a girl as the other tho' she 'appened to be born on the wrong side of the 'edge oh i've seen 'er a sweepin' along in 'er silks an' satins as tho' we were dirt an' sal 'er 'alf sister cuss 'er exhausted by the efforts she had made the old woman sank back in her bed while calton sat dazed thinking over the astounding revelation that had just been made that rosanna moore should turn out to be mark frettlby's mistress he hardly wondered at after all the millionaire was but a man and in his young days had been no better and no worse than the rest of his friends rosanna moore was pretty and was evidently one of those women who rakes at heart prefer the untrammelled freedom of being a mistress to the sedate bondage of a wife in questions of morality so many people live in glass houses that there are few nowadays who can afford to throw stones calton did not think any the worse of frettlby for his youthful follies but what did surprise him was that frettlby should be so heartless as to leave his child to the tender mercies of an old hag like mother guttersnipe it was so entirely different from what he knew of the man that he was inclined to think that the old woman was playing him a trick did mr frettlby know sal was his child he asked not 'e snarled mother guttersnipe in an exultant tone 'e thought she was dead 'e did arter rosanner gave him the go by and why did you not tell him 'cause i wanted to break 'is 'eart if 'e 'ad any said the old beldame vindictively sal was a goin' wrong as fast as she could till she was tuk from me if she had gone and got into quod i'd 'ave gone to 'im and said 'look at yer darter 'ow i've ruined her as you did mine' you wicked woman said calton revolted at the malignity of the scheme you sacrificed an innocent girl for this none of yer preachin' retorted the hag sullenly i ain't bin brought up for a saint i ain't an' i wanted to pay 'im out 'e paid me well to 'old my tongue about my darter an' i've got it 'ere laying her hand on the pillow all gold good gold an' mine cuss me calton rose he felt quite sick at this exhibition of human depravity and longed to be away as he was putting on his hat however the two girls entered with the doctor who nodded to kilsip cast a sharp scrutinising glance at calton and then walked over to the bed the two girls went back to their corner and waited in silence for the end mother guttersnipe had fallen back in the bed with one claw like hand clutching the pillow as if to protect her beloved gold and over her face a deadly paleness was spreading which told the practised eye of the doctor that the end was near he knelt down beside the bed for a moment holding the candle to the dying woman's face she opened her eyes and muttered drowsily who's you get out but then she seemed to grasp the situation again and she started up with a shrill yell which made the hearers shudder it was so weird and eerie my money she yelled clasping the pillow in her skinny arms it's all mine ye shan't have it cuss ye the doctor arose from his knees and shrugged his shoulders not worth while doing anything he said coolly she'll be dead soon the old woman mumbling over her pillow caught the word and burst into tears dead dead my poor rosanna with 'er golden 'air always lovin' 'er pore mother till 'e took 'er away an' she came back to die die ooh her voice died away in a long melancholy wail that made the two girls in the corner shiver and put their fingers in their ears my good woman said the doctor bending over the bed would you not like to see a minister she looked at him with her bright beady eyes already somewhat dimmed with the mists of death and said in a harsh low whisper why because you have only a short time to live said the doctor gently you are dying mother guttersnipe sprang up and seized his arm with a scream of terror dyin' dyin' no no she wailed clawing his sleeve i ain't fit to die cuss me save me save me i don't know where i'd go to s'elp me save me the doctor tried to remove her hands but she held on with wonderful tenacity it is impossible he said briefly the hag fell back in her bed i'll give you money to save me she shrieked good money all mine all mine see see 'ere suverains and tearing her pillow open she took out a canvas bag and from it poured a gleaming stream of gold gold gold it rolled all over the bed over the floor away into the dark corners yet no one touched it so enchained were they by the horrible spectacle of the dying woman clinging to life she clutched some of the shining pieces and held them up to the three men as they stood silently beside the bed but her hands trembled so that sovereigns kept falling from them on the floor with metallic clinks all mine all mine she shrieked loudly give me my life gold money cuss ye i sold my soul for it save me give me my life and with trembling hands she tried to force the gold on them they said no word but stood silently looking at her while the two girls in the corner clung together and trembled with fear don't look at me don't cried the hag falling down again amid the shining gold ye want me to die i shan't i shan't give me my gold clawing at the scattered sovereigns i'll take it with me i shan't die g g whimpering i ain't done nothin' let me live give me a bible save me g cuss it g g she fell back on the bed a corpse the faint light of the candle flickered on the shining gold and on the dead face framed in tangled white hair while the three men sick at heart turned away in silence to seek assistance with that wild cry still ringing in their ears g save me g chapter xxviii mark frettlby has a visitor according to the copy books of our youth procrastination is the thief of time now brian found the truth of this he had been in town almost a week but he had not yet been to see calton each morning or something very near it he set out determined to go direct to chancery lane but he never arrived there he had returned to his lodgings in east melbourne and had passed his time either in the house or in the garden when perhaps business connected with the sale of his station compelled his presence in town he drove straight there and back curiously enough he shrank from meeting any of his friends he felt keenly his recent position in the prisoner's dock and even when walking by the yarra as he frequently did he was conscious of an uneasy feeling a feeling that he was an object of curiosity and that people turned to look at him out of a morbid desire to see one who had been so nearly hanged for murder as soon as his station should be sold and he married to madge he determined to leave australia and never set foot on it again but until he could leave the place he would see no one nor would he mix with his former friends so great was his dread of being stared at mrs sampson who had welcomed him back with shrill exclamations of delight was loud in her expressions of disapproval as to the way he was shutting himself up your eyes bein' 'ollow said the sympathising cricket it is nat'ral as it's want of air which my 'usband's uncle being a druggist an' well to do in collingwood ses as 'ow a want of ox eye gent being a french name as 'e called the atmispeare were fearful for pullin' people down an' makin' 'em go off their food which you hardly eats anythin' an' not bein' a butterfly it's expected as your appetite would be larger oh i'm all right said brian absently lighting a cigarette and only half listening to his landlady's garrulous chatter but if anyone calls tell them i'm not in i don't want to be bothered by visitors bein' as wise a thing as solomon ever said answered mrs sampson energetically which no doubt 'e was in good 'ealth when seein' the queen of sheber as is necessary when anyone calls and not feelin' disposed to speak which i'm often that way myself on occasions my sperits bein' low as i've 'eard tell soder water 'ave that effect on 'em which you takes it with a dash of brandy tho' to be sure that might be the cause of your want of life and drat that bell she finished hurrying out of the room as the front door bell sounded which my legs is a givin' way under me thro' bein' overworked meanwhile brian sat and smoked contentedly much relieved by the departure of mrs sampson with her constant chatter but he soon heard her mount the stairs again and she entered the room with a telegram which she handed to her lodger 'opin' it don't contain bad noose she said as she retreated to the door again which i don't like 'em 'avin' had a shock in early life thro' one 'avin' come unexpected as my uncle's grandfather were dead 'avin' perished of consumption our family all being disposed to the disease and now if you'll excuse me sir i'll get to my dinner bein' in the 'abit of takin' my meals reg'lar and i studies my inside carefully bein' easily upset thro' which i never could be a sailor mrs sampson having at last exhausted herself went out of the room and crackled loudly down the stairs leaving brian to read his telegram he tore open the envelope and found the message was from madge to say that they had returned and to ask him to dine with them that evening fitzgerald folded up the telegram then rising from his seat he walked moodily up and down the room with his hands in his pockets so he is there said the young man aloud and i shall have to meet him and shake hands with him knowing all the time what he is if it were not for madge i'd leave this place at once but after the way she stood by me in my trouble i should be a coward if i did so it was as madge had predicted her father was unable to stay long in one place and had come back to melbourne a week after brian had arrived the pleasant party at the station was broken up and like the graves of a household the guests were scattered far and wide peterson had left for new zealand en route for the wonders of the hot lakes and the old colonist was about to start for england in order to refresh his boyish memories mr and mrs rolleston had come back to melbourne where the wretched felix was compelled once more to plunge into politics and dr chinston had resumed his usual routine of fees and patients madge was glad to be back in melbourne again as now that her health was restored she craved for the excitement of town life it was now more than three months since the murder and the nine days' wonder was a thing of the past the possibility of a war with russia was the one absorbing topic of the hour and the colonists were busy preparing for the attack of a possible enemy as the spanish kings had drawn their treasures from mexico and peru so might the white czar lay violent hands on the golden stores of australia but here there were no uncultured savages to face but the sons and grandsons of men who had dimmed the glories of the russian arms at alma and balaclava so in the midst of stormy rumours of wars the tragic fate of oliver whyte was quite forgotten after the trial everyone including the detective office had given up the matter and mentally relegated it to the list of undiscovered crimes in spite of the utmost vigilance nothing new had been discovered and it seemed likely that the assassin of oliver whyte would remain a free man there were only two people in melbourne who still held the contrary opinion and they were calton and kilsip both these men had sworn to discover this unknown murderer who struck his cowardly blow in the dark and though there seemed no possible chance of success yet they worked on kilsip suspected roger moreland the boon companion of the dead man but his suspicions were vague and uncertain and there seemed little hope of verifying them the barrister did not as yet suspect any particular person though the death bed confession of mother guttersnipe had thrown a new light on the subject but he thought that when fitzgerald told him the secret which rosanna moore had confided to his keeping the real murderer would soon be discovered or at least some clue would be found that would lead to his detection so as the matter stood at the time of mark frettlby's return to melbourne mr calton was waiting for fitzgerald's confession before making a move while kilsip worked stealthily in the dark searching for evidence against moreland on receiving madge's telegram brian determined to go down in the evening but not to dinner so he sent a reply to madge to that effect he did not want to meet mark frettlby but did not of course tell this to madge so she had her dinner by herself as her father had gone to his club and the time of his return was uncertain after dinner she wrapped a light cloak round her and repaired to the verandah to wait for her lover the garden looked charming in the moonlight with the black dense cypress trees standing up against the sky and the great fountain splashing cool and silvery there was a heavily foliaged oak by the gate and she strolled down the path and stood under it in the shadow listening to the whisper and rustle of its multitudinous leaves it is curious the unearthly glamour which moonlight seems to throw over everything and though madge knew every flower tree and shrub in the garden yet they all looked weird and fantastical in the cold white light she went up to the fountain and seating herself on the edge amused herself by dipping her hand into the chilly water and letting it fall like silver rain back into the basin then she heard the iron gate open and shut with a clash and springing to her feet saw someone coming up the path in a light coat and soft wide awake hat oh it's you at last brian she cried as she ran down the path to meet him why did you not come before not being brian i can't say answered her father's voice madge burst out laughing what an absurd mistake she cried why i thought you were brian indeed yes in that hat and coat i couldn't tell the difference in the moonlight oh said her father with a laugh pushing his hat back moonlight is necessary to complete the spell i suppose of course answered his daughter if there were no moonlight alas for lovers alas indeed echoed her father they would become as extinct as the moa but where are your eyes puss when you take an old man like me for your gay young lochinvar well really papa answered madge deprecatingly you do look so like him in that coat and hat that i could not tell the difference till you spoke nonsense child said frettlby roughly you are fanciful and turning on his heel he walked rapidly towards the house leaving madge staring after him in astonishment as well she might for her father had never spoken to her so roughly before wondering at the cause of his sudden anger she stood spell bound until there came a step behind her and a soft low whistle she turned with a scream and saw brian smiling at her oh it's you she said with a pout as he caught her in his arms and kissed her only me said brian ungrammatically disappointing isn't it oh fearfully answered the girl with a gay laugh as arm in arm they walked towards the house but do you know i made such a curious mistake just now i thought papa was you how strange said brian absently for indeed he was admiring her charming face which looked so pure and sweet in the moonlight yes wasn't it she replied he had on a light coat and a soft hat just like you wear sometimes and as you are both the same height i took you for one another brian did not answer but there was a cold feeling at his heart as he saw a possibility of his worst suspicions being confirmed for just at that moment there came into his mind the curious coincidence of the man who got into the hansom cab being dressed similarly to himself what if nonsense he said aloud rousing himself out of the train of thought the resemblance had suggested i'm sure it isn't said madge who had been talking about something else for the last five minutes you are a very rude young man i beg your pardon said brian waking up you were saying that the horse is the most noble of all animals exactly i don't understand began brian rather puzzled of course you don't interrupted madge petulantly considering i've been wasting my eloquence on a deaf man for the last ten minutes and very likely lame as well as deaf and to prove the truth of the remark she ran up the path with brian after her he had a long chase of it for madge was nimble and better acquainted with the garden than he was but at last he caught her just as she was running up the steps into the house and then history repeats itself they went into the drawing room and found that mr frettlby had gone up to his study and did not want to be disturbed madge sat down to the piano but before she struck a note brian took both her hands prisoners madge he said gravely as she turned round what did your father say when you made that mistake he was very angry she answered quite cross i'm sure i don't know why brian sighed as he released her hands and was about to reply when the visitor's bell sounded they heard the servant answer it and then someone was taken upstairs to mr frettlby's study when the footman came in to light the gas madge asked who it was that had come to the door i don't know miss he answered he said he wanted to see mr frettlby particularly so i took him up to the study but i thought that papa said he was not to be disturbed yes miss but the gentleman had an appointment with him poor papa sighed madge turning again to the piano he has always got such a lot to do left to themselves madge began playing waldteufel's last new valse a dreamy haunting melody with a touch of sadness in it and brian lying lazily on the sofa listened then she sang a gay little french song about love and a butterfly with a mocking refrain which made brian laugh a memory of offenbach he said rising and coming over to the piano we certainly can't approach the french in writing these airy trifles they're unsatisfactory i think said madge running her fingers over the keys they mean nothing of course not he replied but don't you remember that de quincy says there is no moral either big or little in the iliad well i think there's more music in barbara allan than all those frothy things said madge with fine scorn come and sing it a five act funeral it is groaned brian as he rose to obey let's have garry owen instead nothing else however would suit the capricious young person at the piano so brian who had a pleasant voice sang the quaint old ditty of cruel barbara allan who treated her dying love with such disdain sir john graham was an ass said brian when he had finished or instead of dying in such a silly manner he'd have married her right off without asking her permission i don't think she was worth marrying replied madge opening a book of mendelssohn's duets or she wouldn't have made such a fuss over her health not being drunk depend upon it she was a plain woman remarked brian gravely and was angry because she wasn't toasted among the rest of the country belles i think the young man had a narrow escape she'd always have reminded him about that unfortunate oversight you seem to have analysed her nature pretty well said madge a little dryly however we'll leave the failings of barbara allan alone and sing this this was mendelssohn's charming duet would that my love which was a great favourite of brian's they were in the middle of it when suddenly madge stopped as she heard a loud cry evidently proceeding from her father's study recollecting dr chinston's warning she ran out of the room and upstairs leaving brian rather puzzled by her unceremonious departure for though he had heard the cry yet he did not attach much importance to it madge knocked at the study door and then she tried to open it but it was locked who's there asked her father sharply from inside only me papa she answered i thought you were no no i'm all right replied her father quickly go down stairs i'll join you shortly madge went back to the drawing room only half satisfied with the explanation she found brian waiting at the door with rather an anxious face what's the matter he asked as she paused a moment at the foot of the stairs papa says nothing she replied but i am sure he must have been startled or he would not have cried out like that she told him what dr chinston had said about the state of her father's heart a recital which shocked brian greatly they did not return to the drawing room but went out on the verandah where after wrapping a cloak around madge fitzgerald lit a cigarette they sat down at the far end of the verandah somewhat in the shadow and could see the hall door wide open and a warm flood of mellow light pouring therefrom and beyond the cold white moonshine after about a quarter of an hour madge's alarm about her father having somewhat subsided they were chatting on indifferent subjects when a man came out of the hall door and paused for a moment on the steps of the verandah he was dressed in rather a fashionable suit of clothes but in spite of the heat of the night he had a thick white silk scarf round his throat that's rather a cool individual said brian removing his cigarette from between his lips i wonder what good god he cried rising to his feet as the stranger turned round to look at the house and took off his hat for a moment roger moreland the man started and looked quickly round into the dark shadow of the verandah where they were seated then putting on his hat he ran quickly down the path and they heard the gate clang after him madge felt a sudden fear at the expression on brian's face as revealed by a ray of moonlight streaming full on it who is roger moreland she asked touching his arm ah i remember with sudden horror oliver whyte's friend yes in a hoarse whisper and one of the witnesses at the trial chapter xxix mr calton's curiosity is satisfied there was not much sleep for brian that night he left madge almost immediately and went home but he did not go to bed he felt too anxious and ill at ease to sleep and passed the greater part of the night walking up and down his room occupied with his own sad thoughts he was wondering in his own mind what could be the meaning of roger moreland's visit to mark frettlby all the evidence that he had given at the trial was that he had met whyte and had been drinking with him during the evening whyte then went out and that was the last moreland had seen of him now the question was what did he go to see mark frettlby for he had no acquaintance with him and yet he called by appointment it is true he might have been in poverty and the millionaire being well known as an extremely generous man moreland might have called on him for money but then the cry which frettlby had given after the interview had lasted a short time proved that he had been startled madge had gone upstairs and found the door locked her father refusing her admission now why was he so anxious moreland should not be seen by any one that he had made some startling revelation was certain and fitzgerald felt sure that it was in connection with the hansom cab murder case he wearied himself with conjectures about the matter and towards daybreak threw himself dressed as he was on the bed and slept heavily till twelve o'clock the next day when he arose and looked at himself in the glass he was startled at the haggard and worn appearance of his face the moment he was awake his mind went back to mark frettlby and the visit of roger moreland the net is closing round him he murmured to himself i don't see how he can escape oh madge madge if only i could spare you the bitterness of knowing what you must know sooner or later and that other unhappy girl the sins of the fathers will be visited on the children god help them he took his bath and after dressing himself went into his sitting room where he had a cup of tea which refreshed him considerably mrs sampson came crackling merrily upstairs with a letter and gave vent to an exclamation of surprise on seeing his altered appearance lor sir she exclaimed what 'ave you bin a doin' me knowin' your 'abits know'd as you'd gone to bed not to say as it's very temptin' in this 'ot weather but with excuses sir you looks as if you 'adn't slept a blessed wink no more i have said brian listlessly holding out his hand for the letter i was walking up and down my room all last night i must have walked miles ah 'ow that puts me in mind of my pore 'usband chirped the cricket bein' a printer and accustomed like a howl to the darkness when 'e was 'ome for the night 'e walked up and down till 'e wore out the carpet bein' an expensive one as i 'ad on my marriage an' the only way i could stop 'im was by givin' 'im something soothin' which you sir ought to try whisky 'ot with lemon and sugar but i've 'eard tell as chloroform no d it said brian hastily startled out of his politeness i've had enough of that achin' teeth no doubt said the landlady going to the door which i'm often taken that way myself decayed teeth runnin' in the family tho' to be sure mine are stronger than former a lodger of mine 'avin' bin a dentist an' doin' them beautiful instead of payin' rent not avin' ready cash his boxes bein' filled with bricks on 'is departure from the 'ouse as brian did not appear particularly interested in these domestic reminiscences and seemed as if he wanted to be left alone mrs sampson with a final crackle went down stairs and talked with a neighbour in the kitchen as to the desirability of drawing her money out of the savings bank in case the russians should surprise and capture melbourne brian left alone stared out of the window at the dusty road and the black shadows cast by the tall poplars in front of the house i must leave this place he said to himself every chance remark seems to bear on the murder and i'm not anxious to have it constantly by my side like the skeleton at the feast suddenly he recollected the letter which he held in his hand and which he now looked at for the first time it proved to be from madge and tearing it open hastily he read it i cannot understand what is the matter with papa she wrote ever since that man moreland left last night he has shut himself up in his study and is writing there hour after hour i went up this morning but he would not let me in he did not come down to breakfast and i am getting seriously alarmed come down to morrow and see me for i am anxious about his state of health and i am sure that moreland told him something which has upset him writing said brian as he put the letter in his pocket what about i wonder perhaps he is thinking of committing suicide if so i for one will not stop him it is a horrible thing to do but it would be acting for the best under the circumstances in spite of his determination to see calton and tell all fitzgerald did not go near him that day he felt ill and weary the want of sleep and mental worry telling on him terribly and he looked ten years older than he did before the murder of whyte it is trouble which draws lines on the smooth forehead and furrows round the mouth if a man has any mental worry his life becomes a positive agony to him mental tortures are quite as bad as physical ones if not worse the last thing before dropping off to sleep is the thought of trouble and with the first faint light of dawn it returns and hammers all day at the weary brain but while a man can sleep life is rendered at least endurable and of all the blessings which providence has bestowed there is none so precious as that same sleep which as wise sancho panza says wraps every man like a cloak brian felt the need of rest so sending a telegram to calton to call on him in the morning and another to madge that he would be down to luncheon next day he stayed indoors all day and amused himself with smoking and reading he went to bed early and succeeded in having a sound sleep so when he awoke next morning he felt considerably refreshed and invigorated he was having his breakfast at half past eight when he heard the sound of wheels and immediately afterwards a ring at the bell he went to the window and saw calton's trap was at the door the owner was shortly afterwards shown into the room well you are a nice fellow cried calton after greetings were over here i've been waiting for you with all the patience of job thinking you were still up country will you have some breakfast asked brian laughing at his indignation what have you got said calton looking over the table ham and eggs humph your landlady's culinary ideas are very limited most landladies' ideas are retorted fitzgerald resuming his breakfast unless heaven invents some new animal lodgers will go on getting beef and mutton alternated with hash until the end of the world when one is in rome one musn't speak ill of the pope answered calton with a grimace do you think your landlady could supply me with brandy and soda i think so answered fitzgerald rising and ringing the bell but isn't it rather early for that sort of thing there's a proverb about glass houses said calton severely which applies to you in this particular instance whereupon fitzgerald laughed and calton having been supplied with what he required prepared to talk business i need hardly tell you how anxious i am to hear what you've got to say he said leaning back in his chair but i may as well tell you that i am satisfied that i know half your secret already indeed fitzgerald looked astonished in that case i need not yes you need retorted calton i told you i only know half which half hum rather difficult to answer however i'll tell you what i know and you can supply all deficiencies i am quite ready go on stop he arose and closed the door carefully well resuming his seat mother guttersnipe died the other night is she dead as a door nail answered calton calmly and a horrible death bed it was her screams ring in my ears yet but before she died she sent for me and said what that she was the mother of rosanna moore yes and that sal rawlins was rosanna's child and the father said brian in a low voice was mark frettlby ah and now what have you to tell me nothing nothing echoed calton surprised then this is what rosanna moore told you when she died yes then why have you made such a mystery about it you ask that said fitzgerald looking up in surprise if i had told it don't you see what difference it would have made to madge i'm sure i don't retorted the barrister completely mystified i suppose you mean frettlby's connection with rosanna moore well of course it was not a very creditable thing for her to have been frettlby's mistress but still his mistress said fitzgerald looking up sharply then you don't know all what do you mean was she not his mistress no his wife calton sprang to his feet and gave a cry of surprise his wife fitzgerald nodded why mother guttersnipe did not know this she thought rosanna was his mistress he kept his marriage secret answered brian and as his wife ran away with someone else shortly afterwards he never revealed it i understand now said the barrister slowly for if mark frettlby was lawfully married to rosanna moore madge is illegitimate yes and she now occupies the place which sal rawlins or rather sal frettlby ought to poor girl said calton a little sadly but all this does not explain the mystery of whyte's murder i will tell you that said fitzgerald quickly when rosanna left her husband she ran away to england with some young fellow and when he got tired of her she returned to the stage and became famous as a burlesque actress under the name of musette there she met whyte as your friend found out and they came out here for the purpose of extorting money from frettlby when they arrived in melbourne rosanna let whyte do all the business and kept herself quiet she gave her marriage certificate to whyte and he had it on him the night he was murdered then gorby was right interposed calton eagerly the man to whom those papers were valuable did murder whyte can you doubt it and that man was not mark frettlby burst out calton surely not mark frettlby brian nodded yes mark frettlby there was a silence for a few moments calton being too much startled by the revelation to say anything when did you discover this he asked after a pause at the time you first came to see me in prison said brian i had no suspicion till then but when you said that whyte was murdered for the sake of certain papers i knowing full well what they were and to whom they were of value guessed immediately that mark frettlby had killed whyte in order to obtain them and to keep his secret there can be no doubt of it said the barrister with a sigh so this is the reason frettlby wanted madge to marry whyte her hand was to be the price of his silence when he withdrew his consent whyte threatened him with exposure i remember he left the house in a very excited state on the night he was murdered frettlby must have followed him up to town got into the cab with him and after killing him with chloroform must have taken the marriage certificate from his secret pocket and escaped brian rose to his feet and walked rapidly up and down the room now you can understand what a hell my life has been for the last few months he said knowing that he had committed the crime and yet i had to sit with him eat with him and drink with him with the knowledge that he was a murderer and madge madge his daughter just then a knock came to his door and mrs sampson entered with a telegram which she handed to brian he tore it open as she withdrew and glancing over it gave a cry of horror and let it flutter to his feet calton turned rapidly on hearing his cry and seeing him fall into a chair with a white face snatched up the telegram and read it when he did so his face grew as pale and startled as fitzgerald's and lifting his hand he said solemnly it is the judgment of god chapter xxx nemesis men according to the old greek are the sport of the gods who enthroned on high olympus put evil desires into the hearts of mortals and when evil actions were the outcome of evil thoughts amused themselves by watching the ineffectual efforts made by their victims to escape a relentless deity called nemesis who exacted a penalty for their evil deeds it was no doubt very amusing to the gods but it is questionable if the men found it so they had their revenge however for weary of plaguing puny mortals who whimpered and cried when they saw they could not escape the inevitable nemesis turned her attention from actors to spectators and made a clean sweep of the whole olympian hierarchy she smashed their altars pulled down their statues and after she had completed her malicious work found that she had vulgarly speaking been cutting off her nose to spite her face for she too became an object of derision and of disbelief and was forced to retire to the same obscurity to which she had relegated the other deities but men found out that she had not been altogether useless as a scapegoat upon which to lay the blame of their own shortcomings so they created a new deity called fate and laid any misfortune which happened to them to her charge her worship is still very popular especially among lazy and unlucky people who never bestir themselves on the ground that whether they do so or not their lives are already settled by fate after all the true religion of fate has been preached by george eliot when she says that our lives are the outcome of our actions set up any idol you please upon which to lay the blame of unhappy lives and baffled ambitions but the true cause is to be found in men themselves every action good or bad which we do has its corresponding reward and mark frettlby found it so for the sins of his youth were now being punished in his old age no doubt he had sinned gaily enough in that far off time when life's cup was still brimming with wine and no asp hid among the roses but nemesis had been an unseen spectator of all his thoughtless actions and now she came to demand her just dues he felt somewhat as faust must have felt when mephistopheles suggested a visit to hades in repayment of those years of magic youth and magic power so long ago it seemed since he had married rosanna moore that he almost persuaded himself that it had been only a dream a pleasant dream with a disagreeable awakening when she had left him he had tried to forget her recognising how unworthy she was of a good man's love he heard that she had died in a london hospital and with a passionate sigh for a perished love he had dismissed her from his thoughts for ever his second marriage had turned out a happy one and he regretted the death of his wife deeply afterwards all his love centred in his daughter and he thought he would be able to spend his declining years in peace this however was not to be and he was thunderstruck when whyte arrived from england with the information that his first wife still lived and that the daughter of his second was illegitimate sooner than risk exposure frettlby agreed to anything but whyte's demands became too exorbitant and he refused to comply with them on whyte's death he again breathed freely when suddenly a second possessor of his fatal secret started up in the person of roger moreland as the murder of duncan had to be followed by that of banquo in order to render macbeth safe so he foresaw that while roger moreland lived his life would be one long misery he knew that the friend of the murdered man would be his master and would never leave him during his life while after his death he would probably publish the whole ghastly story and defame the memory of the widely respected mark frettlby what is it that shakespeare says good name in man or woman is the immediate jewel of their souls and after all these years of spotless living and generous use of his wealth was he to be dragged down to the depths of infamy and degradation by a man like moreland already in fancy he heard the jeering cries of his fellow men and saw the finger of scorn point at him he the great mark frettlby famous throughout australia for his honesty integrity and generosity no it could not be and yet this would surely happen unless he took means to prevent it the day after he had seen moreland and knew that his secret was no longer safe since it was in the power of a man who might reveal it at any moment in a drunken fit or out of sheer maliciousness he sat at his desk writing after a time he laid down his pen and taking up a portrait of his dead wife which stood just in front of him he stared at it long and earnestly as he did so his mind went back to the time when he had first met and loved her even as faust had entered into the purity and serenity of gretchen's chamber out of the coarseness and profligacy of auerbach's cellar so he leaving behind him the wild life of his youth had entered into the peace and quiet of a domestic home the old feverish life with rosanna moore seemed to be as unsubstantial and chimerical as no doubt his union with lillith after he met eve seemed to adam in the old rabbinical legend there seemed to be only one way open to him by which he could escape the relentless fate which dogged his steps he would write a confession of everything from the time he had first met rosanna and then death he would cut the gordian knot of all his difficulties and then his secret would be safe safe no it could not be while moreland lived when he was dead moreland would see madge and embitter her life with the story of her father's sins yes he must live to protect her and drag his weary chain of bitter remembrance through life always with that terrible sword of damocles hanging over him but still he would write out his confession and after his death whenever it may happen it might help if not altogether to exculpate at least to secure some pity for a man who had been hardly dealt with by fate his resolution taken he put it into force at once and sat all day at his desk filling page after page with the history of his past life which was so bitter to him he started at first languidly and as in the performance of an unpleasant but necessary duty soon however he became interested in it and took a peculiar pleasure in putting down every minute circumstance which made the case stronger against himself he dealt with it not as a criminal but as a prosecutor and painted his conduct as much blacker than it really had been towards the end of the day however after reading over the earlier sheets he experienced a revulsion of feeling seeing how severe he had been on himself so he wrote a defence of his conduct showing that fate had been too strong for him it was a weak argument to bring forward but still he felt it was the only one that he could make it was quite dark when he had finished and while sitting in the twilight looking dreamily at the sheets scattered all over his desk he heard a knock at the door and his daughter's voice asking if he was coming to dinner all day long he had closed his door against everyone but now his task being ended he collected all the closely written sheets together placed them in a drawer of his escritoire which he locked and then opened the door dear papa cried madge as she entered rapidly and threw her arms around his neck what have you been doing here all day by yourself writing returned her father laconically as he gently removed her arms why i thought you were ill she answered looking at him apprehensively no dear he replied quietly not ill but worried i knew that dreadful man who came last night had told you something to worry you who is he oh a friend of mine answered frettlby with hesitation what roger moreland her father started how do you know it was roger moreland oh brian recognised him as he went out mark frettlby hesitated for a few moments and then busied himself with the papers on his desk as he replied in a low voice you are right it was roger moreland he is very hard up and as he was a friend of poor whyte's he asked me to assist him which i did he hated to hear himself telling such a deliberate falsehood but there was no help for it madge must never know the truth so long as he could conceal it just like you said madge kissing him lightly with filial pride the best and kindest of men he shivered slightly as he felt her caress and thought how she would recoil from him did she know all after all says some cynical writer the illusions of youth are mostly due to the want of experience madge ignorant in a great measure of the world cherished her pleasant illusions though many of them had been destroyed by the trials of the past year and her father longed to keep her in this frame of mind now go down to dinner my dear he said leading her to the door i will follow soon don't be long replied his daughter or i shall come up again and she ran down the stairs her heart feeling strangely light her father looked after her until she vanished then heaving a regretful sigh returned to his study and taking out the scattered papers fastened them together and endorsed them my confession he then placed them in an envelope sealed it and put it back in the desk if all that is in that packet were known he said aloud as he left the room what would the world say that night he was singularly brilliant at the dinner table generally a very reticent and grave man on this night he laughed and talked so gaily that the very servants noticed the change the fact was he felt a sense of relief at having unburdened his mind and felt as though by writing out that confession he had laid the spectre which had haunted him for so long his daughter was delighted at the change in his spirits but the old scotch nurse who had been in the house since madge was a baby shook her head he's fey she said gravely he's no lang for the warld of course she was laughed at people who believe in presentiments generally are but nevertheless she held firmly to her opinion mr frettlby went to bed early that night the excitement of the last few days and the feverish gaiety in which he had lately indulged proving too strong for him no sooner had he laid his head on his pillow than he dropped off to sleep at once and forgot in placid slumber the troubles and worries of his waking hours it was only nine o'clock so madge stayed by herself in the great drawing room and read a new novel which was then creating a sensation called sweet violet eyes it belied its reputation however for it was very soon thrown on the table with a look of disgust and rising from her seat madge walked up and down the room and wished some good fairy would hint to brian that he was wanted if man is a gregarious animal how much more then is a woman this is not a conundrum but a simple truth a female robinson crusoe says a writer who prided himself upon being a keen observer of human nature a female robinson crusoe would have gone mad for want of something to talk to this remark though severe nevertheless contains several grains of truth for women as a rule talk more than men they are more sociable and a miss misanthrope in spite of justin mccarthy's is unknown at least in civilised communities miss frettlby being neither misanthropic nor dumb began to long for some one to talk to and ringing the bell ordered sal to be sent in the two girls had become great friends and madge though by two years the younger assumed the role of mentor and under her guidance sal was rapidly improving it was a strange irony of fate which brought together these two children of the same father each with such different histories the one reared in luxury and affluence never having known want the other dragged up in the gutter all unsexed and besmirched by the life she had led the whirligig of time brings in its revenges and it was the last thing in the world mark frettlby would have thought of seeing rosanna moore's child whom he fancied dead under the same roof as his daughter madge on receiving madge's message sal came to the drawing room and the two were soon chatting amicably together the room was almost in darkness only one lamp being lighted mr frettlby very sensibly detested gas with its glaring light and had nothing but lamps in his drawing room at the end of the apartment where sal and madge were seated there was a small table on it stood a large lamp with an opaque globe which having a shade over it threw a soft and subdued circle of light round the table leaving the rest of the room in a kind of semi darkness near this sat madge and sal talking gaily and away on the left hand side they could see the door open and a warm flood of light pouring in from the hall they had been talking together for some time when sal's quick ear caught a footfall on the soft carpet and turning rapidly she saw a tall figure advancing down the room madge saw it too and started up in surprise on recognising her father he was clothed in his dressing gown and carried some papers in his hand why papa said madge in surprise i hush whispered sal grasping her arms he's asleep and so he was in accordance with the dictates of the excited brain the weary body had risen from the bed and wandered about the house the two girls drawing back into the shadow watched him with bated breath as he came slowly down the room in a few moments he was within the circle of light and moving noiselessly along he laid the papers he carried on the table they were in a large blue envelope much worn with writing in red ink on it sal recognised it at once as the one she had seen in the possession of the dead woman and with an instinctive feeling that there was something wrong she tried to draw madge back as she watched her father's action with an intensity of feeling which held her spell bound frettlby opened the envelope and took therefrom a yellow frayed piece of paper which he spread out on the table madge bent forward to see it but sal with a sudden terror drew her back for god's sake no she cried but it was too late madge had caught sight of the names on the paper marriage rosanna moore mark frettlby and the whole awful truth flashed upon her these were the papers rosanna moore had handed to whyte whyte had been murdered by the man to whom the papers were of value oh my father she staggered blindly forward and then with one piercing shriek fell to the ground in doing so she struck against her father who was still standing beside the table awakened suddenly with that wild cry in his ears he opened his eyes wide put out feeble hands as if to keep something back and with a strangled cry fell dead on the floor beside his daughter sal horror struck did not lose her presence of mind but snatching the papers off the table she thrust them into her pocket and then called aloud for the servants but they already attracted by madge's wild cry came hurrying in to find mark frettlby the millionaire lying dead and his daughter in a faint beside her father's corpse chapter xxxi hush money as soon as brian received the telegram which announced the death of mark frettlby he put on his hat stepped into calton's trap and drove along to the st kilda station in flinders street with that gentleman there calton dismissed his trap sending a note to his clerk with the groom and went down to st kilda with fitzgerald on arrival they found the whole house perfectly quiet and orderly owing to the excellent management of sal rawlins she had taken the command in everything and although the servants knowing her antecedents were disposed to resent her doing so yet such were her administrative powers and strong will that they obeyed her implicitly mark frettlby's body had been taken up to his bedroom madge had been put to bed and dr chinston and brian sent for when they arrived they could not help expressing their admiration at the capital way in which sal rawlins had managed things she's a clever girl that whispered calton to fitzgerald curious thing she should have taken up her proper position in her father's house fate is a deal cleverer than we mortals think her brian was about to reply when dr chinston entered the room his face was very grave and fitzgerald looked at him in alarm madge miss frettlby he faltered is very ill replied the doctor has an attack of brain fever i can't answer for the consequences yet brian sat down on the sofa and stared at the doctor in a dazed sort of way madge dangerously ill perhaps dying what if she were to die and he to lose the true hearted woman who stood so nobly by him in his trouble cheer up said chinston patting him on the shoulder while there's life there's hope and whatever human aid can do to save her will be done brian grasped the doctor's hand in silence his heart being too full to speak how did frettlby die asked calton heart disease said chinston his heart was very much affected as i discovered a week or so ago it appears he was walking in his sleep and entering the drawing room he alarmed miss frettlby who screamed and must have touched him he awoke suddenly and the natural consequences followed he dropped down dead what alarmed miss frettlby asked brian in a low voice covering his face with his hand the sight of her father walking in his sleep i suppose said chinston buttoning his glove and the shock of his death which took place indirectly through her accounts for the brain fever madge frettlby is not the woman to scream and waken a somnambulist said calton decidedly knowing as she did the danger there must be some other reason this young woman will tell you all about it said chinston nodding towards sal who entered the room at this moment she was present and since then has managed things admirably and now i must go he said shaking hands with calton and fitzgerald keep up your heart my boy i'll pull her through yet after the doctor had gone calton turned sharply to sal rawlins who stood waiting to be addressed well he said briskly can you tell us what startled miss frettlby i can sir she answered quietly i was in the drawing room when mr frettlby died but we had better go up to the study why asked calton in surprise as he and fitzgerald followed her up stairs because sir she said when they had entered the study and she had locked the door i don't want any one but yourselves to know what i tell you more mystery muttered calton as he glanced at brian and took his seat at the escritoire mr frettlby went to bed early last night said sal calmly and miss madge and i were talking together in the drawing room when he entered walking in his sleep and carrying some papers both calton and fitzgerald started and the latter grew pale he came down the room and spread out a paper on the table where the lamp was miss madge bent forward to see what it was i tried to stop her but it was too late she gave a scream and fell on the floor in doing so she happened to touch her father he awoke and fell down dead and the papers asked calton uneasily sal did not answer but producing them from her pocket laid them in his hands brian bent forward as calton opened the envelope in silence but both gave vent to an exclamation of horror at seeing the certificate of marriage which they knew rosanna moore had given to whyte their worst suspicions were confirmed and brian turned away his head afraid to meet the barrister's eye the latter folded up the papers thoughtfully and put them in his pocket you know what these are he asked sal eyeing her keenly i could hardly help knowing she answered it proves that rosanna moore was mr frettlby's wife and she hesitated go on said brian in a harsh tone looking up and they were the papers she gave mr whyte well sal was silent for a moment and then looked up with a flush you needn't think i'm going to split she said indignantly recurring to her bourke street slang in the excitement of the moment i know what you know but i'll be as silent as the grave thank you said brian fervently taking her hand i know you love her too well to betray this terrible secret i would be a nice 'un i would said sal with a scorn after her lifting me out of the gutter to round on her a poor girl like me without a friend or a relative now gran's dead calton looked up quickly it was plain sal was quite ignorant that rosanna moore was her mother so much the better they would keep her in ignorance perhaps not altogether but it would be folly to undeceive her at present i'm goin' to miss madge now she said going to the door and i won't see you again she's getting light headed and might let it out but i'll not let any one in but myself and so saying she left the room cast thy bread upon the waters said calton oracularly the kindness of miss frettlby to that poor waif is already bearing fruit gratitude is the rarest of qualities rarer even than modesty fitzgerald made no answer but stared out of the window and thought of his darling lying sick unto death and he able to do nothing to save her well said calton sharply oh i beg your pardon said fitzgerald turning in confusion i suppose the will must be read and all that sort of thing yes answered the barrister i am one of the executors and the others yourself and chinston answered calton so i suppose turning to the desk we can look at his papers and see that all is straight yes i suppose so replied brian mechanically his thoughts far away and then he turned again to the window suddenly calton gave vent to an exclamation of surprise and turning hastily brian saw him holding a thick roll of papers in his hand which he had taken out of the drawer look here fitzgerald he said greatly excited here is frettlby's confession look and he held it up brian sprang forward in astonishment so at last the hansom cab mystery was to be cleared up these sheets no doubt contained the whole narration of the crime and how it was committed we will read it of course he said hesitating half hoping that calton would propose to destroy it at once yes answered calton the three executors must read it and then we will burn it that will be the better way answered brian gloomily frettlby is dead and the law can do nothing in the matter so it would be best to avoid the scandal of publicity but why tell chinston we must said calton decidedly he will be sure to gather the truth from madge's ravings and he may as well know all he is quite safe and will be silent as the grave but i am more sorry to tell kilsip the detective good god calton surely you will not do so i must replied the barrister quietly kilsip is firmly persuaded that moreland committed the crime and i have the same dread of his pertinacity as you had of mine he may find out all what must be must be said fitzgerald clenching his hands but i hope no one else will find out this miserable story there's moreland for instance ah true said calton thoughtfully he called and saw frettlby the other night you say yes i wonder what for there is only one answer said the barrister slowly he must have seen frettlby following whyte when he left the hotel and wanted hush money i wonder if he got it observed fitzgerald oh i'll soon find that out answered calton opening the drawer again and taking out the dead man's cheque book let me see what cheques have been drawn lately most of the blocks were filled up for small amounts and one or two for a hundred or so calton could find no large sum such as moreland would have demanded when at the very end of the book he found a cheque torn off leaving the block slip quite blank there you are he said triumphantly holding out the book to fitzgerald he wasn't such a fool as to write in the amount on the block but tore the cheque out and wrote in the sum required and what's to be done about it let him keep it of course answered calton shrugging his shoulders it's the only way to secure his silence i expect he cashed it yesterday and is off by this time said brian after a moment's pause so much the better for us said calton grimly but i don't think he's off or kilsip would have let me know we must tell him or he'll get everything out of moreland and the consequences will be that all melbourne will know the story whereas by showing him the confession we get him to leave moreland alone and thus secure silence in both cases i suppose we must see chinston yes of course i will telegraph to him and kilsip to come up to my office this afternoon at three o'clock and then we will settle the whole matter and sal rawlins oh i quite forgot about her said calton in a perplexed voice she knows nothing about her parents and of course mark frettlby died in the belief that she was dead we must tell madge said brian gloomily there is no help for it sal is by rights the heiress to the money of her dead father that depends upon the will replied calton dryly if it specifies that the money is left to 'my daughter margaret frettlby' sal rawlins can have no claim and if such is the case it will be no good telling her who she is and what's to be done sal rawlins went on the barrister without noticing the interruption has evidently never given a thought to her father or mother as the old hag no doubt swore they were dead so i think it will be best to keep silent that is if no money is left to her and as her father thought her dead i don't think there will be any in that case it would be best to settle an income on her you can easily find a pretext and let the matter rest but suppose in accordance with the wording of the will she is entitled to all the money in that case said calton gravely there is only one course open she must be told everything and the dividing of the money left to her generosity but i don't think you need be alarmed i'm pretty sure madge is the heiress it's not the money i think about said brian hastily i'd take madge without a penny my boy said the barrister placing his hand kindly on brian's shoulder when you marry madge frettlby you will get what is better than money a heart of gold chapter xxxii de mortuis nil nisi bonum nothing is certain but the unforeseen so says a french proverb and judging from the unexpected things which daily happen to us it is without doubt a very true one if anyone had told madge frettlby one day that she would be stretched on a bed of sickness the next and would be quite oblivious of the world and its doings she would have laughed the prophet to scorn yet it was so and she was tossing and turning on a bed of pain to which the couch of procustes was one of roses sal sat beside her ever watchful of her wants and listened through the bright hours of the day or the still ones of the night to the wild and incoherent words which issued from her lips she incessantly called on her father to save himself and then would talk about brian and sing snatches of song or would sob broken sentences about her dead mother until the heart of the listener ached to hear her no one was allowed into the room except sal and when dr chinston heard the things she was saying although used to such cases he recoiled there is blood on your hands cried madge sitting up in bed with her hair all tangled and falling over her shoulders red blood and you cannot wash it off oh cain god save him brian you are not guilty my father killed him god god and she fell back on her disordered pillows weeping bitterly dr chinston did not say anything but shortly afterwards took his leave after telling sal on no account to let anyone see the patient 'tain't likely said sal in a disgusted tone as she closed the door after him i'm not a viper to sting the bosom as fed me from which it may be gathered she was advancing rapidly in her education meanwhile dr chinston had received calton's telegram and was considerably astonished thereat he was still more so when on arriving at the office at the time appointed he found calton and fitzgerald were not alone but a third man whom he had never seen was with them the latter calton introduced to him as mr kilsip of the detective office a fact which made the worthy doctor uneasy as he could in no wise divine the meaning of it however he made no remark but took the seat handed to him by mr calton and prepared to listen calton locked the door of the office and then went back to his desk having the other three seated before him in a kind of semi circle in the first place said calton to the doctor i have to inform you that you are one of the executors under the will of the late mr frettlby and that is why i asked you to come here to day the other executors are mr fitzgerald and myself oh indeed murmured the doctor politely and now said calton looking at him do you remember the hansom cab murder which caused such a sensation some months ago yes i do replied the doctor rather astonished but what has that to do with the will nothing to do with the will answered calton gravely but the fact is mr frettlby was implicated in the affair dr chinston glanced enquiringly at brian but that gentleman shook his head it has nothing to do with my arrest he said sadly madge's words uttered in her delirium flashed across the doctor's memory what do you mean he gasped pushing back his chair how was he implicated that i cannot tell you answered calton until i read his confession ah said kilsip becoming very attentive yes said calton turning to kilsip your hunt after moreland is a wild goose chase for the murderer of oliver whyte is discovered discovered cried kilsip and the doctor in one breath yes and his name is mark frettlby kilsip shot a glance of disdain out of his bright black eyes and gave a low laugh of disbelief but the doctor pushed back his chair furiously and arose to his feet this is monstrous he cried in a rage i won't sit still and hear this accusation against my dead friend unfortunately it is too true said brian sadly how dare you say so said chinston turning angrily on him and you going to marry his daughter there is only one way to settle the question said calton coldly we must read his confession but why the detective asked the doctor ungraciously as he took his seat because i want him to hear for himself that mr frettlby committed the crime that he may keep silence not till i've arrested him said kilsip determinedly but he's dead said brian i'm speaking of roger moreland retorted kilsip for he and no other murdered oliver whyte that's a much more likely story chinston said i tell you no said calton vehemently god knows i would like to preserve mark frettlby's good name and it is with this object i have brought you all together i will read the confession and when you know the truth i want you all to keep silent about it as mark frettlby is dead and the publication of his crime can do no good to anyone i know resumed calton addressing the detective that you are fully convinced in your own mind that you are right and i am wrong but what if i tell you that mark frettlby died holding those very papers for the sake of which the crime was committed kilsip's face lengthened considerably what were the papers the marriage certificate of mark frettlby and rosanna moore the woman who died in the back slum kilsip was not often astonished but he was so now and dr chinston fell back in his chair staring at the barrister in blank amazement and what's more went on calton triumphantly do you know that moreland went to frettlby two nights ago and obtained a certain sum for hush money what cried kilsip yes moreland in coming out of the hotel evidently saw frettlby and threatened to expose him unless he paid for his silence very strange murmured kilsip to himself with a disappointed look on his face but why did moreland keep still so long i cannot tell you replied calton but no doubt the confession will explain all then for heaven's sake read it broke in dr chinston impatiently i'm quite in the dark and all your talk is greek to me one moment said kilsip dragging a bundle from under his chair and untying it if you are right what about this and he held up a light coat very much soiled and weather worn whose is that asked calton startled not whyte's yes whyte's repeated kilsip with great satisfaction i found it in the fitzroy gardens near the gate that opens to george street east melbourne it was up in a fir tree then mr frettlby must have got out at powlett street and walked down george street and then through the fitzroy gardens into town said calton kilsip took no heed of the remark but took a small bottle out of the pocket of the coat and held it up i also found this he said chloroform cried everyone guessing at once that it was the missing bottle exactly said kilsip replacing it this was the bottle which contained the poison used by by well call him the murderer the name of the chemist being on the label i went to him and found out who bought it now who do you think with a look of triumph frettlby said calton decidedly no moreland burst out chinston greatly excited neither retorted the detective calmly the man who purchased this was oliver whyte himself himself echoed brian now thoroughly surprised as indeed were all the others yes i had no trouble in finding out that thanks to the 'poisons act' as i knew no one would be so foolish as to carry chloroform about in his pocket for any length of time i mentioned the day of the murder as the probable date it was bought the chemist turned up in his book and found that whyte was the purchaser and what did he buy it for asked chinston that's more than i can tell you said kilsip with a shrug of his shoulders it's down in the book as being bought for medicinal uses which may mean anything the law requires a witness observed calton cautiously who was the witness again kilsip smiled triumphantly i think i can guess said fitzgerald moreland kilsip nodded and i suppose remarked calton in a slightly sarcastic tone that is another of your proofs against moreland he knew that whyte had chloroform on him therefore he followed him that night and murdered him well i it's a lot of nonsense said the barrister impatiently there's nothing against moreland to implicate him if he killed whyte what made him go and see frettlby but said kilsip sagely nodding his head if as moreland says he had whyte's coat in his possession before the murder how is it that i should discover it afterwards up a fir tree in the fitzroy gardens with an empty chloroform bottle in the pocket he may have been an accomplice suggested calton what's the good of all this conjecturing said chinston impatiently now thoroughly tired of the discussion read the confession and we will soon know the truth without all this talk calton assented and all having settled themselves to listen he began to read what the dead man had written chapter xxxiii the confession what i am now about to write is set forth by me so that the true circumstances connected with the 'hansom cab tragedy' which took place in melbourne in may be known i owe a confession particularly to brian fitzgerald seeing that he was accused of the crime although i know he was rightfully acquitted of the charge yet i wish him to know all about the case though i am convinced from his altered demeanour towards me that he is better acquainted with it than he chooses to confess in order to account for the murder of oliver whyte i must go back to the beginning of my life in this colony and show how the series of events began which culminated in the committal of the crime should it be necessary to make this confession public in the interests of justice i can say nothing against such a course being taken but i would be grateful if it could be suppressed both on account of my good name and of my dear daughter margaret whose love and affection has so soothed and brightened my life if however she should be informed of the contents of these pages i ask her to deal leniently with the memory of one who was sorely tried and tempted i came to the colony of victoria or rather as it was called then new south wales in the year i had been in a merchant's office in london but not finding much opportunity for advancement i looked about to see if i could better myself i heard of this new land across the ocean and though it was not then the el dorado which it afterwards turned out and truth to tell had rather a shady name owing to the transportation of convicts yet i longed to go there and start a new life unhappily however i had not the means and saw nothing better before me than the dreary life of a london clerk as it was impossible that i could save out of the small salary i got just at this time an old maiden aunt of my mother's died and left a few hundred pounds to me with this i came out to australia determined to become a rich man i stayed some time in sydney and then came over to port phillip now so widely known as marvellous melbourne where i intended to pitch my tent i saw that it was a young and rising colony though of course coming as i did before the days of the gold diggings i never dreamt it would spring up as it has done since into a nation i was careful and saving in those days and indeed i think it was the happiest time of my life i bought land whenever i could scrape the money together and at the time of the gold rush was considered well to do when however the cry that gold had been discovered was raised and the eyes of all the nations were turned to australia with her glittering treasures men poured in from all parts of the world and the 'golden age' commenced i began to grow rich rapidly and was soon pointed out as the wealthiest man in the colonies i bought a station and leaving the riotous feverish melbourne life went to live on it i enjoyed myself there for the wild open air life had great charms for me and there was a sense of freedom to which i had hitherto been a stranger but man is a gregarious animal and i growing weary of solitude and communings with mother nature came down on a visit to melbourne where with companions as gay as myself i spent my money freely and as the phrase goes saw life after confessing that i loved the pure life of the country it sounds strange to say i enjoyed the wild life of the town but i did i was neither a joseph nor a st anthony and i was delighted with bohemia with its good fellowship and charming suppers which took place in the small hours of the morning when wit and humour reigned supreme it was at one of these suppers that i first met rosanna moore the woman who was destined to curse my existence she was a burlesque actress and all the young fellows in those days were madly in love with her she was not exactly what was called beautiful but there was a brilliancy and fascination about her which few could resist on first seeing her i did not admire her much but laughed at my companions as they raved about her on becoming personally acquainted with her however i found that her powers of fascination had not been over rated and i ended by falling desperately in love with her i made enquiries about her private life and found that it was irreproachable as she was guarded by a veritable dragon of a mother who would let no one approach her daughter i need not tell about my courtship as these phases of a man's life are generally the same but it will be sufficient to prove the depth of my passion for her when i say that i determined to make her my wife it was on condition however that the marriage should be kept secret until such time as i should choose to reveal it my reason for such a course was this my father was still alive and he being a rigid presbyterian would never have forgiven me for having married a woman of the stage so as he was old and feeble i did not wish him to learn that i had done so fearing that the shock would be too much for him in his then state of health i told rosanna i would marry her but wanted her to leave her mother who was a perfect fury and not an agreeable person to live with as i was rich young and not bad looking rosanna consented and during an engagement she had in sydney i went over there and married her she never told her mother she had married me why i do not know as i laid no restriction on her doing so the mother made a great noise over the matter but i gave rosanna a large sum of money for her and this the old harridan accepted and left for new zealand rosanna went with me to my station where we lived as man and wife though in melbourne she was supposed to be my mistress at last feeling degraded in my own eyes at the way in which i was supposed to be living i wanted to reveal our secret but this rosanna would not consent to i was astonished at this and could never discover the reason but in many ways rosanna was an enigma to me she then grew weary of the quiet country life and longed to return to the glitter and glare of the footlights this i refused to let her do and from that moment she took a dislike to me a child was born and for a time she was engrossed with it but soon wearied of the new plaything and again pressed me to allow her to return to the stage i again refused and we became estranged from one another i grew gloomy and irritable and was accustomed to take long rides by myself frequently being away for days there was a great friend of mine who owned the next station a fine handsome young fellow called frank kelly with a gay sunny disposition and a wonderful flow of humour when he found i was so much away thinking rosanna was only my mistress he began to console her and succeeded so well that one day on my return from a ride i found she had fled with him and had taken the child with her she left a letter saying that she had never really cared for me but had married me for my money she would keep our marriage secret and was going to return to the stage i followed my false friend and false wife down to melbourne but arrived too late as they had just left for england disgusted with the manner in which i had been treated i plunged into a whirl of dissipation trying to drown the memory of my married life my friends of course thought that my loss amounted to no more than that of a mistress and i soon began myself to doubt that i had ever been married so far away and visionary did my life of the previous year seem i continued my fast life for about six months when suddenly i was arrested upon the brink of destruction by an angel i say this advisedly for if ever there was an angel upon earth it was she who afterwards became my wife she was the daughter of a doctor and it was her influence which drew me back from the dreary path of profligacy and dissipation which i was then leading i paid her great attention and we were in fact looked upon as good as engaged but i knew that i was still linked to that accursed woman and could not ask her to be my wife at this second crisis of my life fate again intervened for i received a letter from england which informed me that rosanna moore had been run over in the streets of london and had died in an hospital the writer was a young doctor who had attended her and i wrote home to him begging him to send out a certificate of her death so that i might be sure she was no more he did so and also enclosed an account of the accident which had appeared in a newspaper then indeed i felt that i was free and closing as i thought for ever the darkest page of my life's history i began to look forward to the future i married again and my domestic life was a singularly happy one as the colony grew greater with every year i became even more wealthy than i had been and was looked up to and respected by my fellow citizens when my dear daughter margaret was born i felt that my cup of happiness was full but suddenly i received a disagreeable reminder of the past rosanna's mother made her appearance one day a disreputable looking creature smelling of gin in whom i could not recognise the respectably dressed woman who used to accompany rosanna to the theatre she had spent long ago all the money i had given her and had sank lower and lower until she now lived in a slum off little bourke street i made enquiries after the child and she told me it was dead rosanna had not taken it to england with her but had left it in her mother's charge and no doubt neglect and want of proper nourishment was the cause of its death there now seemed to be no link to bind me to the past with the exception of the old hag who knew nothing about the marriage i did not attempt to undeceive her but agreed to allow her enough to live on if she promised never to trouble me again and to keep quiet about everything which had reference to my connection with her daughter she promised readily enough and went back to her squalid dwelling in the slums where for all i know she still lives as money has been paid to her regularly every month by my solicitors i heard nothing more about the matter and now felt quite satisfied that i had heard the last of rosanna as years rolled on things prospered with me and so fortunate was i in all speculations that my luck became proverbial then alas when all things seemed to smile upon me my wife died and the world has never seemed the same to me since but i had my dear daughter to console me and in her love and affection i became reconciled to the loss of my wife a young irish gentleman called brian fitzgerald came out to australia and i soon saw that my daughter was in love with him and that he reciprocated that affection whereat i was glad as i have always esteemed him highly i looked forward to their marriage when suddenly a series of events occurred which must be fresh in the memory of those who read these pages mr oliver whyte a gentleman from london called on me and startled me with the news that my first wife rosanna moore was still living and that the story of her death had been an ingenious fabrication in order to deceive me she had met with an accident as stated in the newspaper and had been taken to an hospital where she recovered the young doctor who had sent me the certificate of her death had fallen in love with her and wanted to marry her and had told me that she was dead in order that her past life might be obliterated the doctor however died before the marriage and rosanna did not trouble herself about undeceiving me she was then acting on the burlesque stage under the name of 'musette' and seemed to have gained an unenviable notoriety by her extravagance and infamy whyte met her in london and she became his mistress he seemed to have had a wonderful influence over her for she told him all her past life and about her marriage with me her popularity being on the wane in london as she was now growing old and had to make way for younger actresses whyte proposed that they should proceed to the colonies and extort money from me and he had come to me for that purpose the villain told me all this in the coolest manner and i knowing he held the secret of my life was unable to resent it i refused to see rosanna but told whyte i would agree to his terms which were first a large sum of money was to be paid to rosanna and secondly that he should marry my daughter i at first absolutely declined to sanction the latter proposal but as he threatened to publish the story and that meant the proclamation to the world of my daughter's illegitimacy i at last agreed and he began to pay his addresses to madge she however refused to marry him and told me she was engaged to fitzgerald so after a severe struggle with myself i told whyte that i would not allow him to marry madge but would give him whatever sum he liked to name on the night he was murdered he came to see me and showed me the certificate of marriage between myself and rosanna moore he refused to take a sum of money and said that unless i consented to his marriage with madge he would publish the whole affair i implored him to give me time to think so he said he would give me two days but no more and left the house taking the marriage certificate with him i was in despair and saw that the only way to save myself was to obtain possession of the marriage certificate and deny everything with this idea in my mind i followed him up to town and saw him meet moreland and drink with him they went into the hotel in russell street and when whyte came out at half past twelve he was quite intoxicated i saw him go along to the scotch church near the bourke and wills' monument and cling to the lamp post at the corner i thought i would then be able to get the certificate from him as he was so drunk when i saw a gentleman in a light coat i did not know it was fitzgerald come up to him and hail a cab for him i saw there was nothing more to be done at that time so in despair went home and waited for the next day in fear lest he should carry out his determination nothing however turned up and i was beginning to think that whyte had abandoned his purpose when i heard that he had been murdered in the hansom cab i was in great fear lest the marriage certificate should be found on him but nothing was said about it this i could not understand at all i knew he had it on him and i could only conclude that the murderer whoever he was had taken it from the body and would sooner or later come to me to extort money knowing that i dare not denounce him fitzgerald was arrested and afterwards acquitted so i began to think that the certificate had been lost and my troubles were at an end however i was always haunted by a dread that the sword was hanging over my head and would fall sooner or later i was right for two nights ago roger moreland who was an intimate friend of whyte's called on me and produced the marriage certificate which he offered to sell to me for five thousand pounds in horror i accused him of murdering whyte which he denied at first but afterwards acknowledged stating that i dare not betray him for my own sake i was nearly mad with the horror i was placed in either to denounce my daughter as illegitimate or let a murderer escape the penalty of his crime at last i agreed to keep silent and handed him a cheque for five thousand pounds receiving in return the marriage certificate i then made moreland swear to leave the colony which he readily agreed to do saying melbourne was dangerous when he left i reflected upon the awfulness of my position and i had almost determined to commit suicide but thank god i was saved from that crime i write this confession in order that after my death the true story of the murder of whyte may be known and that any one who may hereafter be accused of the murder may not be wrongfully punished i have no hopes of moreland ever receiving the penalty of his crime as when this is opened all trace of him will no doubt be lost i will not destroy the marriage certificate but place it with these papers so that the truth of my story can be seen in conclusion i would ask forgiveness of my daughter margaret for my sins which have been visited on her but she can see for herself that circumstances were too strong for me may she forgive me as i hope god in his infinite mercy will and may she come sometimes and pray over my grave nor think too hardly upon her dead father chapter xxxiv the hands of justice calton's voice faltered a little when he read those last sad words and he laid the manuscript down on the table amid a dead silence which was first broken by brian thank god he said reverently thank god that he was innocent of the crime no said calton a little cynically the riddle which has perplexed us so long is read and the sphinx is silent for evermore i knew he was incapable of such a thing cried chinston whom emotion had hitherto kept silent meanwhile kilsip listened to these eulogistic remarks on the dead man and purred to himself in a satisfied sort of way like a cat who has caught a mouse you see sir he said addressing the barrister i was right after all yes answered calton frankly i acknowledge my defeat but now i'm going to arrest moreland right off said kilsip there was a silence for a few moments and then calton spoke again i suppose it must be so poor girl poor girl i'm very sorry for the young lady myself said the detective in his soft low voice but you see i cannot let a dangerous criminal escape for a mere matter of sentiment of course not said fitzgerald sharply moreland must be arrested right off but he will confess everything said calton angrily and then everyone will know about this first marriage let them retorted brian bitterly as soon as she is well enough we will marry at once and leave australia for ever but i know her better than you do said the young man doggedly and i know she would like an end made of this whole miserable business at once arrest the murderer and let him suffer for his crime well i suppose it must be so said chinston with a sigh but it seems very hard that this slur should be cast upon miss frettlby brian turned a little pale the sins of the father are generally visited upon the children by the world he said bitterly but after the first pain is over in new lands among new faces she will forget the bitter past now that it is settled moreland is to be arrested said calton how is it to be done is he still in melbourne rather said kilsip in a satisfied tone i've had my eye on him for the last two months and someone is watching him for me now trust me he can't move two steps without my knowing it ah indeed said calton quickly then do you know if he has been to the bank and cashed that cheque for five thousand which frettlby gave him well now observed kilsip after a pause do you know you rather startled me when you told me he had received a cheque for that amount why it's such a large one replied the detective and had i known what sum he had paid into his account i should have been suspicious then he has been to the bank to his own bank yes he went there yesterday afternoon at two o'clock that is the day after he got it so it would be sent round to mr frettlby's bank and would not be returned till next day and as he died in the meanwhile i expect it hasn't been honoured so mr moreland won't have his money yet i wonder what he'll do said chinston go to the manager and kick up a row said kilsip coolly and the manager will no doubt tell him he'd better see the executors but my good friend the manager doesn't know who the executors are broke in calton impatiently you forget the will has yet to be read then he'll tell him to go to the late mr frettlby's solicitors i suppose he knows who they are retorted kilsip thinton and tarbit said calton musingly but it's questionable if moreland would go to them why shouldn't he sir said kilsip quickly he does not know anything about this laying his hand on the confession and as the cheque is genuine enough he won't let five thousand pounds go without a struggle i'll tell you what observed calton after a few moments of reflection i'll go across the way and telephone to thinton and tarbit and when he calls on them they can send him up to me a very good idea said kilsip rubbing his hands and then i can arrest him but the warrant interposed brian as calton rose and put on his hat is here said the detective producing it by jove you must have been pretty certain of his guilt remarked chinston dryly of course i was retorted kilsip in a satisfied tone of voice when i told the magistrate where i found the coat and reminded him of moreland's acknowledgment at the trial that he had it in his possession before the murder i soon got him to see the necessity of having moreland arrested half past four said calton pausing for a moment at the door and looking at his watch i'm afraid it's rather late to catch moreland to day however i'll see what thinton and tarbit know and he went out the rest sat waiting his return and chatted about the curious end of the hansom cab mystery when in about ten minutes calton rushed in hurriedly and closed the door after him quickly fate is playing into our hands he said as soon as he recovered his breath moreland called on thinton and tarbit as kilsip surmised and as neither of them was in he said he would call again before five o'clock i told the clerk to bring him up to me at once so he may be here at any moment that is if he's fool enough to come observed chinston oh he'll come said the detective confidently rattling a pair of handcuffs together he is so satisfied that he has made things safe that he'll walk right into the trap it was getting a little dusk and the four men were greatly excited though they concealed it under an assumed nonchalance what a situation for a drama said brian only said chinston quietly it is as realistic as in the old days of the coliseum where the actor who played orpheus was torn to pieces by bears at the end of the play his last appearance on any stage i suppose said calton a little cruelly it must be confessed meanwhile kilsip remained seated in his chair humming an operatic air and chinking the handcuffs together by way of accompaniment he felt intensely pleased with himself the more so as he saw that by this capture he would be ranked far above gorby and what would gorby say gorby who had laughed at all his ideas as foolish and who had been quite wrong from the first if only hush said calton holding up his finger as steps were heard echoing on the flags outside here he is i believe kilsip arose from his chair and stealing softly to the window looked cautiously out then he turned round to those inside and nodding his head slipped the handcuffs into his pocket just as he did so there was a knock at the door and in response to calton's invitation to enter thinton and tarbit's clerk came in with roger moreland the latter faltered a little on the threshold when he saw calton was not alone and seemed half inclined to retreat but evidently thinking there was no danger of his secret being discovered he pulled himself together and advanced into the room in an easy and confident manner this is the gentleman who wants to know about the cheque sir said thinton and tarbit's clerk to calton oh indeed answered calton quietly i am glad to see him you can go the clerk bowed and went out closing the door after him moreland took his seat directly in front of calton and with his back to the door kilsip seeing this strolled across the room in a nonchalant manner while calton engaged moreland in conversation and quietly turned the key you want to see me sir said calton resuming his seat yes that is alone replied moreland uneasily oh these gentlemen are my friends said calton quietly anything you may say is quite safe that they are your friends and are quite safe is nothing to me said moreland insolently i wish to speak to you in private don't you think you would like to know my friends said calton coolly taking no notice of his remark d your friends sir cried moreland furiously rising from his seat calton laughed and introduced mr moreland to the others dr chinston mr kilsip and mr fitzgerald fitzgerald gasped moreland growing pale i i what's that he shrieked as he saw whyte's coat all weather stained lying on a chair near him and which he immediately recognised that is the rope that's going to hang you said kilsip quietly coming behind him for the murder of oliver whyte trapped by g shouted the wretched man wheeling round so as to face kilsip he sprang at the detective's throat and they both rolled together on the floor but the latter was too strong for him and after a sharp struggle he succeeded in getting the handcuffs on moreland's wrists the others stood around perfectly quiet knowing that kilsip required no assistance now that there was no possibility of escape moreland seemed to become resigned and rose sullenly off the floor i'll make you pay for this he hissed between hie teeth with a white despairing face you can't prove anything can't we said calton touching the confession you are wrong this is the confession of mark frettlby made before he died it's a lie a jury will decide that said the barrister dryly meanwhile you will pass the night in the melbourne gaol ah perhaps they'll give me the same cell as you occupied said moreland with a hard laugh turning to fitzgerald i should like it for its old associations brian did not answer him but picking up his hat and gloves prepared to go stop cried moreland fiercely i see that it's all up with me so i'm not going to lie like a coward i've played for a big stake and lost but if i hadn't been such a fool i'd have cashed that cheque the next morning and been far away by this time it certainly would have been wiser said calton after all said moreland nonchalantly taking no notice of his remark i don't know that i'm sorry about it i've had a hell upon earth since i killed whyte then you acknowledge your guilt said brian quietly moreland shrugged his shoulders i told you i wasn't a coward he answered coolly yes i did it it was whyte's own fault when i met him that night he told me how frettlby wouldn't let him marry his daughter but said he'd make him and showed me the marriage certificate i thought if i could only get it i'd make a nice little pile out of frettlby over it so when whyte went on drinking i did not after he had gone out of the hotel i put on his coat which he left behind i saw him standing near the lamp post and fitzgerald come up and then leave him when you came down the street he went on turning to fitzgerald i shrank back into the shadow and when you passed i ran up to whyte as the cabman was putting him into the hansom he took me for you so i didn't undeceive him but i swear i had no idea of murdering whyte when i got into the cab i tried to get the papers but he wouldn't let me and commenced to sing out then i thought of the chloroform in the pocket of his coat which i was wearing i pulled it out and found that the cork was loose then i took out whyte's handkerchief which was also in the coat and emptied the bottle on it and put it back in my pocket i again tried to get the papers without using the chloroform but couldn't so i clapped the handkerchief over his mouth and he went off after a few minutes and i got the papers i thought he was only insensible and it was only when i saw the newspapers that i knew he was dead i stopped the cab in st kilda road got out and caught another cab which was going to town then i got out at powlett street took off the coat and carried it over my arm i went down george street towards the fitzroy gardens and having hid the coat up a tree where i suppose you found it to kilsip i walked home so i've done you all nicely but you're caught at last finished kilsip quietly moreland fell down in a chair with an air of utter weariness and lassitude no man can be stronger than destiny he said dreamily i have lost and you have won so life is a chess board after all and we are the puppets of fate he refused to utter another word so leaving calton and kilsip with him brian and the doctor went out and hailed a cab it drove up to the entrance of the court where calton's office was and then moreland walking as if in a dream left the room and got into the cab followed by kilsip do you know said chinston thoughtfully as they stood and watched the cab drive off do you know what the end of that man will be it requires no prophet to foretell that said calton dryly he will be hanged no he won't retorted the doctor he will commit suicide chapter xxxv the love that lives there are certain periods in the life of man when fate seems to have done her worst and any further misfortunes which may befall are accepted with a philosophical resignation begotten by the very severity of previous trials fitzgerald was in this state of mind he was calm but it was the calmness of despair the misfortunes of the past year seemed to have come to a climax and he looked forward to the publication of the whole bitter story with an indifference that surprised himself his own name and that of madge and her dead father would be on every tongue yet he felt perfectly callous to whatever might be said on the subject so long as madge recovered and they could go away to another part of the world leaving australia with its bitter memories behind he did not care moreland would suffer the bitter penalty of his crime and then nothing more would ever be heard of the matter it would be better for the whole story to be told and transitory pain endured than to go on striving to hide the infamy and shame which might be discovered at any moment already the news was all over melbourne that the murderer of oliver whyte had been captured and that his confession would bring to light certain startling facts concerning the late mark frettlby brian well knew that the world winked at secret vices so long as there was an attempt at concealment though it was cruelly severe on those which were brought to light and that many whose lives might be secretly far more culpable than poor mark frettlby's would be the first to slander the dead man the public curiosity however was destined never to be gratified for the next day it was known that roger moreland had hanged himself in his cell during the night and had left no confession behind him when brian heard this he breathed a heartfelt prayer of thanks for his deliverance and went to see calton whom he found at his chambers in deep conversation with chinston and kilsip they all came to the conclusion that as moreland was now dead nothing could be gained by publishing the confession of mark frettlby so agreed to burn it and when fitzgerald saw in the heap of blackened paper in the fireplace all that remained of the bitter story he felt a weight lifted off his heart the barrister chinston and kilsip all promised to keep silent and they kept the promise nobly for nothing was ever known of the circumstances which led to the death of oliver whyte and it was generally supposed that it must have been caused by some quarrel between the dead man and his friend roger moreland fitzgerald however did not forget the good service that kilsip had done him and gave him a sum of money which made him independent for life though he still followed his old profession of a detective from sheer love of excitement and was always looked upon with admiration as the man who had solved the mystery of the famous hansom cab murder brian after several consultations with calton at last came to the conclusion that it would be useless to reveal to sal rawlins the fact that she was mark frettlby's daughter as by the will the money was clearly left to madge and such a revelation could bring her no pecuniary benefit while her bringing up unfitted her for the position so a yearly income more than sufficient for her wants was settled upon her and she was allowed to remain in ignorance of her parentage the influence of sal rawlins' old life however was very strong on her and she devoted herself to the task of saving her fallen sisters knowing as she did all the intricacies of the slums she was enabled to do an immense amount of good and many an unhappy woman was saved from the squalor and hardship of a gutter life by the kind hand of sal rawlins felix rolleston became a member of parliament where his speeches if not very deep were at least amusing and while in the house he always behaved like a gentleman which could not be said of all his parliamentary colleagues madge slowly recovered from her illness and as she had been explicitly named in the will as heiress to mark frettlby's great wealth she placed the management of her estates in the hands of mr calton who with thinton and tarbit acted as her agents in australia on her recovery she learned the story of her father's early marriage but both calton and fitzgerald were silent about the fact of sal rawlins being her half sister as such a relation could do no good and would only create a scandal as no explanation could be given except the true one shortly afterwards madge married fitzgerald and both of them only too gladly left australia with all its sorrows and bitter memories standing with her husband on the deck of one of the p and o steamers as it ploughed the blue waters of hobson's bay into foam they both watched melbourne gradually fade from their view under the glow of the sunset they could see the two great domes of the exhibition and the law courts and also government house with its tall tower rising from the midst of the green trees in the background was a bright crimson sky barred with masses of black clouds and over all the great city hung a cloud of smoke like a pall the flaring red light of the sinking sun glared angrily on the heavy waters and the steamer seemed to be making its way through a sea of blood madge clinging to her husband's arm felt her eyes fill with tears as she saw the land of her birth receding slowly good bye she murmured softly good bye for ever you do not regret he said bending his head regret no she answered looking at him with loving eyes with you by my side i fear nothing surely our hearts have been tried in the furnace of affliction and our love has been chastened and purified we are sure of nothing in this world replied brian with a sigh but after all the sorrow and grief of the past let us hope that the future will be peace peace a white winged sea gull rose suddenly from the crimson waters and circled rapidly in the air above them a happy omen she said looking up fondly to the grave face of her husband for your life and for mine he bent down and kissed her the great steamer moved slowly out to sea and as they stood on the deck hand clasped in hand with the fresh salt breeze blowing keenly in their faces it bore them away into the placid beauty of the coming night towards the old world and the new life
