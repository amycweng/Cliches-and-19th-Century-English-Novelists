the millionaire mystery chapter i a midnight surprise steering his course by a tapering spire notched in the eye of the sunset a tramp slouched along the heathton road from the western sky a flood of crimson light poured over the dusty white highway which led straightly across the moor to right and left acres of sear coarse herbage rolled towards the distant hills now black against the flaming horizon in the quivering air gnats danced and flickered the earth panted with the thirst of a lengthy drought and the sky arched itself over the heat of a fiery furnace for many hours the tramp had held on steadily in the pitiless glare of the midjune sun and now that he saw ahead of him the spire and houseroofs and encircling trees of the village whither he was bound a sigh of relief burst from him to ease his aching feet he sat down beside a moldering millstone and wiped his beaded brow with a red bandana he did not swear which was singular in a tramp apparently he had but recently joined the cadging profession for about him there lingered an air of respectability and the marks of a prosperity not wholly decayed he was stout rubicund of countenance and he wheezed like a sick grampus watery gray eyes and a strawberry nose revealed the seasoned toper thick lips and a slack mouth the sensualist as a begging friar of medval times he would have been altogether admirable as a modern tramp he was out of the picture clothed in a broadcloth frockcoat considerably the worse for wear he woreoddly enough for a trampgaiters over his goutylooking boots his black gloves were darned at the fingertips and his battered silk hat had been ironed and brushed with sedulous care this rooklike plumage was now plentifully sprinkled with the white dust of travel his gait in spite of his blistered feet was dignified and his manners were imposing the road was lonely likewise the heath there was no one in sight not even a returning plowman but the recumbent wayfarer could hear mellowed by distance the bells of homing cows beasts as they were he envied them they at least had a place to sleep in for the night he was without a home without even the necessary money to procure shelter luckily it was summertime dry and warm also the tramp affected the philosopher this he remarked eying a sixpence extracted from the knotted corner of his handkerchief is a drinktwo drinks if i take beer which is gouty but it is not a meal nor a bed no one drink and a morsel of breadandcheese but the bed ah he stared at the coin with a sigh as though he hoped it would swell into a shilling it did not and he sighed again shall i have good luck in this place cried he heads i shall tails i shant the coin spun and fell heads ha said the tramp getting on to his feet this must be seen to i fly to good fortune on willing feet and he resumed his trudging a quarter of an hour brought him to the encircling wood he passed beyond pine and larch and elm into a cozy little village with one street this was broken in the center by an expanse of green turf surrounded by redroofed houses amongst themas he saw from the swinging signa publichouse called quaintly enough the good samaritan scriptural said the strangerpossibly charitable let us see he strode forward into the taproom in the oiliest of tones he inquired for the landlord but in this case it appeared there was no landlord for a vixenish little woman lean as a cricket and as shrill bounced out with the information that she mrs timber was the landlady her husband she snapped out was dead to the tramp this hostess appeared less promising than the seductive sign and he quailed somewhat at the sight of her however with a brazen assurance born of habit he put a bold face on it peremptorily demanding bread cheese and ale the request for a bed he left in abeyance for besides the vixenish mrs timber there hovered around a stalwart potboy whose rolledup sleeves revealed a biceps both admirable and formidable bread cheese and ale repeated the landlady with a sharp glance at her guests clerical dress for this and who may you be sir she asked with a world of sarcasm expended on the sir my name is cicero gramp i am a professor of elocution and eloquence ho a playactor mrs timber became more disdainful than ever not at all i am not on the boards i recite to the best families the bishop of idlechester has complimented me on my heres the breadandcheese interrupted the landlady likewise the beer sixpence very reluctantly mr gramp produced his last remaining coin she dropped it into a capacious pocket and retired without vouchsafing him another word cicero somewhat discouraged by this reception congratulated himself that the night was fine for outofdoor slumber he ensconced himself in a corner with his frugal supper and listened to the chatter going on around him it appeared to be concerned with the funeral of a local magnate despite the prophecy of the coin now in mrs timbers pocket cicero failed to see how he could extract good fortune out of his present position however he listened some chance word might mean money ah tis a fine dry airy vault said a lean man who proved to be a stonemason never built a finer i didnt nor my mates neither an muster marlowll have it all to isself such a situation croaked another bang opposite the lady chapel an the view from that there vault i dont know as any corp ud require a finer mr marlowll be lonely by himself sighed a buxom woman theres room for twenty coffins an only one in the vault taint naturallike well chimed in the village schoolmaster twill soon fill theres miss marlow dratted nonsense cried mrs timber making a dash into the company with a tankard of beer in each hand miss sophyll marry mr thorold wont she an he as the squire of heathton as a family vault aint he shell sleep beside him as his wife lawfully begotten the thorolds vault is crowded objected the stonemason why theres threehundredyear dead folk there a very old gentry lot the thorolds older than your marlows snapped mrs timber who was he afore he came to take the moat house five year ago came from nowherea tree without a root the schoolmaster contradicted nay he came from africa i knowfrom mashonaland which is said to be the ophir of king solomon and mr marlow was a millionaire much good his moneyll do him now groaned the buxom woman who was a dissenter ah dives in torment youve no call to say that mrs berry mr marlow wasnt a bad man he was charitable i dont deny an went to church regular assented mrs berry but he died awful sudden seems like a judgment for something hed done he died quietly said the schoolmaster dr warrender told me all about ita kind of fit at ten oclock last thursday and on friday night he passed away as a sleeping child he was not even sufficiently conscious to say goodby to miss sophy ah poor girl shes gone to the seaside with miss parsh to nurse her sorrow it will soon passsoon pass observed the schoolmaster waving his pipe the young dont think much of death miss sophys rich toorich as the queen of sheba and she will marry mr thorold in a few months funeral knells will give way to weddingbells mrs berry ah sighed mrs berry feeling she was called upon for an appropriate sentiment you may say so mr stack such is life cicero munching his breadandcheese felt that his imposing personality was being neglected and seized upon what he deemed his opportunity if this company will permit he said i propose now to give a recitation apropos of the present melancholy event need i say i refer to the lamented death of mr marlow ill have no godless mumming here said mrs timber firmly besides what do you know about mr marlow whereupon cicero lied lustily to impress the bumpkins basing his fiction upon such facts as his ears had enabled him to come by marlow he wailed drawing forth his red bandana for effect did i not know him as i know myself were we not boys together till he went to africa perhaps you can tell us about mr marlow said the schoolmaster eagerly none of us knows exactly who he was he appeared here with his daughter some five years ago and took the moat house he was rich and people said he had made his riches in south africa he did he did said cicero deeply affected millions he was worthmillions i came hither to see him and i arrive to find the fond friend of my youth dead oh jonathan my brother jonathan his name was richard said mrs timber suspiciously i know it i know it i use the appellation jonathan merely in illustration of the close friendship which was between us i am david hm snorted mrs timber eying him closely and who was mr marlow this leading question perplexed mr gramp not a little for he knew nothing about the man what he cried with simulated horror reveal the secrets of the dead never never secrets repeated the lean stonemason eagerly ah i always thought mr marlow had em he looked over his shoulder too often for my liking an there was a look on his face frequent which pointed i may say to a violent death ah say not that my friend dick marlow came to an untimely end this outcry came from cicero it was answered by mrs timber he died of a fit she said tartly and that quietly enough considering as dr warrender can testify but now weve talked enough an im going to lock up so get out all of you in a few minutes the taproom was cleared and the lights out cicero greatly depressed lingered in the porch wondering how to circumvent the dragon well snapped that amiable beast what are you waitin for you couldnt give me a bed for the night course i could for a shillin i havent a shilling i regret to say then youd best get one or go without your bed replied the lady and banged the door in his face under this last indignity even ciceros philosophy gave way and he launched an ecclesiastic curse at the inhospitable inn fortunately the weather was warm and tranquil not a breath of wind stirred the trees the darkling earth was silentsilent as the watching stars even the sordid soul of the vagabond was stirred by the solemn majesty of the sky he removed his battered hat and looked up the heavens are telling the glory of god he said but not recollecting the rest of the text he resumed his search for a restingplace it was now only between nine and ten oclock yet as he wandered down the silent street he could see no glimmer of a light in any window his feet took him half unconsciously as it were by the path leading towards the tapering spire he went on through a belt of pines which surrounded the church and came suddenly upon the graveyard populous with the forgotten deadat least he judged they were forgotten by the state of the tombstones on the hither side he came upon a circular chapel with lanceshaped windows and marvelous decoration wrought in graystone on the outer walls some distance off rose a low wall encircling the graveyard and beyond the belt of pines through which he had just passed stretched the leaguelong herbage of the moor he guessed this must be the lady chapel between the building and the low wall he noticed a large tomb of white marble surmounted by a winged angel with a trumpet dick marlows tomb he surmised then he proceeded to walk round it as that of his own familiar friend for he had already half persuaded himself into some such belief but he realized very soon that he had not come hither for sightseeing for his limbs ached and his feet burned and his eyes were heavy with sleep he rolled along towards a secluded corner where the round of the lady chapel curved into the main wall of the church there he found a grassy nook warm and dry he removed his gloves with great care placed them in his silk hat and then took off his boots and loosened his clothes finally he settled himself down amid the grass put a hand up either coatsleeve for warmth and was soon wrapped in a sound slumber he slept on undisturbed until one oclock whenas say outofdoor observersthe earth turns in her slumber this vagrant feeling as it were the stir of nature turned too a lowing of cows came from the moor beyond the pines a breath of cool air swept through the branches and the somber boughs swayed like the plumes of a hearse across the face of the sky ran a shiver he heard distinctly what he had not noticed before the gush of running water he roused himself and sat up alert and strained his hearing what was it he heard now he listened and strained again voices surely mens voices there could be no mistake voices he heard though he could not catch the words they said a tremor shook his whole body then curiosity getting the better of his fear he wriggled forward flat on his stomach until he was in such a position that he could peer round the corner of the lady chapel here he saw a sight which scared him against the white wall of the mausoleum bulked two figures one tall the other short the shorter carried a lantern they stood on the threshold of the iron door and the tall man was listening they were nearer now so that he could hear their talk very plainly all is quiet said the taller man no one will suspect well get him away easily then cicero heard the key grate in the lock saw the door open and the men disappear into the tomb he was sick with terror and was minded to make a clean bolt of it but with the greatest effort he controlled his fears and remained there might be money in this adventure in ten minutes the men came out carrying a dark form between them as cicero guessed the dead body of richard marlow they set down their burden made fast the door and took up again the sinister load he saw them carry it towards the low stone wall over this they lifted it climbed over themselves and disappeared into the pinewoods cicero waited until he could no longer hear the rustle of their progress then he crept cautiously forward and tried the door of the tomb it was fast locked resurrectionmen bodysnatchers he moaned he felt shaken to his very soul by the ghastliness of the whole proceeding then suddenly the awkwardness of his own position if by chance any one should find him there rushed in upon his mind and without so much as another glance he made off as quickly as he could in the opposite direction chapter ii the hut on the heath im glad its all over said the footman waving a cigar stolen from the box of his master funerals dont suit me yet we must all ave one of our own some day said the cook who was plainly under the influence of gin an that pore miss sophyme art bleeds for er an she with er millions growled a redfaced coachman wot rot come now john you know miss sophy was fond of her fatherthis from a sprightly housemaid who was trimming a hat i dunno why said john master was as cold as ice an as silent as arf a dozen graves the scullerymaid shuddered and spread out her grimy hands oh mr john dont talk of graves please ive ad the nightmare over em dont put on airs an make out as ow youve got nerves cammelliar put in the cook tearfully its me as as emive a bundle of emreal shivers ah well were cut down like green baytrees to be sure pass that bottle mr thomas this discussion took place in the kitchen of the moat house the heiress and miss parsh the housekeeper had departed for the seaside immediately after the funeral and in the absence of control the domestics were making merry to be sure mr marlows old and trusted servant joe brill had been told off to keep them in order but just at present his grief was greater than his sense of duty he was busy now sorting papers in the libraryhence the domestic chaos it was in truth a cheerful kitchen more especially at the present moment with the noonday sun streaming in through the open casements a vast apartment with a vast fireplace of the baronial hall kind brown oaken walls and raftered roof snowwhite dresser and huge deal table and a floor of shining white tiles there was a moments silence after the last unanswerable observation of the cook it was broken by a voice at the open doora voice which boomed like the drone of a bumblebee peace be unto this house said the voice richly and plenty be its portion the women screeched the men sworesince the funeral their nerves had not been quite in orderand all eyes turned towards the door there in the hot sunshine stood an enormously fat old man clothed in black and perspiring profusely it was in fact none other than cicero gramp come in the guise of autolycus to pick up news and unconsidered trifles he smiled benignly and raised his fat hand peace maidservants and menservants said he after the manner of chadband there is no need for alarm i am a stranger and you must take me in who the devil are you queried the coachman we want no tramps here growled the footman i am no tramp said cicero mildly stepping into the kitchen i am a professor of elocution and eloquence and a friend of your late masters he went up in the world i dropped down now i come to him for assistance and i find him occupying the narrow house yes my friends dick marlow is as low as the worms whose prey he soon will be pax vobiscum calls master dick said the footman sez es an old friend murmured the cook they looked at each other and the thought in every mind was the same the servants were one and all anxious to hear the genesis of their late master who had dropped into the moat house as from the skies some five years before mrs crammer the cook rose to the occasion with a curtsy im sure sir im sorry the master aint here to see you she said polishing a chair with her apron but as you saysor as i take it you meanses gone where we must all go take a seat sir and ill tell joe whos in the library joemy old friend joe said cicero sitting down like a mountain ah the faithful fellow this random remark brought forth information which was ciceros intention in making it faithful growled the coachman an why not joe brill was paid higher nor any of us he was just as of living all his life with an iceberg deserved it poor dick was an iceberg sighed cicero pensively a cold secretive man ah said mrs crammer wiping her eye you may well say that he ad secrets im sure and guilty ones too we all have our skeletons maam but would you mind giving me something to eat and to drink for i have walked a long way i am too poor said cicero with a sweet smile to ride as in the days of my infancy but spero meliora talking about skeletons sir said the footman when mr gramps jaws were fully occupied what about the masters ah said gramp profoundly what indeed but whatever it is it has to do with the west indies said the man lor exclaimed the housemaid and how do you know that mr thomas from observation jane my dear thomas smiled loftily a week or two afore master had the fit as took him i brought in a letter with the west indy stamp he turned white as chalk when he saw it and tore it open afore i could get out of the room i ad to fetch a glass of whisky he was struck all of a eapgaspin faintin and cussin orful did he show it to miss sophy asked mrs crammer not as i knows of he kept his business to hisself replied thomas gramp was taking in all this with greedy ears ha he said when you took in the letter might you have looked at the postmark my friend with an access of color the footman admitted that he had been curious enough to do so and the postmark was kingston jamaica said he it recalls my youth said cicero ah they were happy happy days what was mr marlow sir a planter ofofrice hazarded gramp he knew that there were planters in the west indies but he was not quite sure what it was they planted riceacres of it well he didnt make his money out of that sir growled the coachman no he did not admitted the professor of elocution he acquired his millions in mashonalandthe ophir of the jews this last piece of knowledge had been acquired from slack the schoolmaster he was precious careful not to part with none of it said the footman except to dr warrender said the cook the doctor was always screwing money out of him not that it was so much im as is wife i cant abear that doctors wifea stuckup peacock i call her she fairly ruined her husband in clothes miss sophy didnt

take them asked gramp rising i am going to bournemouth to see little sophy and mr thorold i shall tell them of your hospitality before the footman could reply to this generous offer the pageboy of the establishment darted in much excited oh heres a go he exclaimed dr warrenders run away an the quiet gentlemans followed wot dye mean billy wot i say the doctor aint bin ome all night nor all mornin an mrs warrenders in hysterics over him their ousemaid i met shoppin tole me the servants looked at one another here was more trouble more excitement and the quiet gentleman asked the cook with ghoulish interest hes gone too went out larst night an never come back mrs marry thinks hes bin murdered there was a babel of voices and cries but after a moment quiet was restored then cicero placed his hand on the boys head my boy he said pompously who is the quiet gentleman let us be clear upon the point of the quiet gentleman dont you know sir put in the eager cook hes a mystery aving bin staying at mrs marrys cottage she a lone widder taking in boarders ill give a weeks notice sobbed the scullerymaid these crimes is too much for me i didnt say the quiet gentleman ad been murdered said billy the page but mrs marry only thinks so cos e aint come ome as like as not hes cold and stiff in some lonely grave groaned mrs crammer hopefully the quiet gentleman said cicero bent upon acquiring further informationtall yellowbearded with a high forehead and a bald head well i never sir cried jane the housemaid if you aint describing dr warrender did you know him sir cicero was quite equal to the occasion i knew him professionally he attended me for a relaxed throat i was vox et prterea nihil until he cured me but what was this mysterious gentleman like short eh no tall and thin with a stoop long white hair longer beard and black eyes like gimblets gabbled the cook i met im arter dark one evenin and i declare as is eyes were glowworms ugh they looked me through and through ive never bin the same woman since at this moment a raucous voice came from the inner doorway what the devils all this was the polite question cicero turned and saw a heavilybuilt man surveying the company in general and himself in particular anything but favorably his face was a mahogany hue and he had a veritable tangle of whiskers and hair the whole cut of the man was distinctly nautical his trousers being of the dungaree and his peajacket plentifully sprinkled with brass buttons in his ears he wore rings of gold and his clenched fists hung by his side as though eager for any emergency and the sooner the better that was how he impressed cicero who in nowise fancying the expression on his face edged towards the door oh joe shrieked the cook wot a turn you give me an sich news as weve ad news said joe uneasily his eyes still on cicero mrs warrenders lost her husband and the quiet gentlemans disappeared mysterious rubbish get to your work all of you so saying joe drove the frightened crowd hither and thither to their respective duties and cicero somewhat to his dismay found himself alone with the buccaneer as he had inwardly dubbed the newcomer who the devil are you asked joe advancing fellow replied cicero getting into the doorway i am a friend of your late master cicero gramp is my name i came here to see dick marlow but i find hes gone aloft joe turned pale even through his tan a friend of mr marlow he repeated hoarsely thats a lie ive been with him these thirty years and i never saw you not in jamaica inquired cicero sweetly jamaica what do you mean what i wrote in that letter your master received before he died oh you liar i know the man who wrote it joe clenched his fists more tightly and swung forward youre a rank impostor and ill hand you over to the police lest i smash you completely cicero saw he had made a mistake but he did not flinch hardihood alone could carry him through now do he said im particularly anxious to see the police mr joe brill who are you in heavens name shouted joe much agitated do you come from him perhaps i do answered cicero wondering to whom the him might now refer then go back and tell him hes too latetoo late curse him and you too you lubber very good cicero stepped out into the hot sunshine ill deliver your messagefor a sovereign joe brill tugged at his whiskers and cast an uneasy glance around evidently he was by no means astute and the present situation was rather too much for him his sole idea for some reason best known to himself was to get rid of cicero with a groan he plunged his huge fist into his pocket and pulled out a gold coin here take it and go to hell he said throwing it to cicero mariner fata obstant rolled gramp in his deep voice then he strode haughtily away he looked round as he turned the corner of the house and saw joe clutching his irongray locks still at the kitchen door so with a guinea in his pocket and a certain amount of knowledge which he hoped would bring him many more cicero departed considerable uplifted at the village grocery he bought bread meat and a bottle of whisky then he proceeded to shake the dust of heathton off his feet as he stepped out on to the moor he recalled the latin words he had used and he shuddered why did i say that he murmured the words came into my head somehow just when joe was talking of my employer too who is my employer what has he to do with all this im all in the dark so dr warrenders gone and the quiet gentleman too it must have been dr warrender who helped to steal marlows body the description tallies exactlytall fair beard and bald i wonder if tother chap was the quiet gentleman and what on earth could they want with the body any way the bodys gone and as its a millionaire corpse ill have some of its money or im a dutchman he stopped and placed his hand to his head bournemouth bournemouth he muttered ah thats itthe soudan hotel bournemouth it was now the middle of the afternoon and as he plodded on the moor glowed like a furnace no vestige of shade was there beneath which to rest not even a tree or a bush then a short distance up the road he espied a hut it seemed to be in ruins it was a shepherds hut no doubt the grass roof was torn the door was broken though closed and the mud walls were crumbling impatient of any obstacle he shoved his back against it and burst it open it had been fastened with a piece of rope he fell in headlong almost but the gloom was grateful to him though for the moment he could see but little when his eyes had become more accustomed to the halflight the first object upon which they fell was a stiff human form stretched on the mud floora body with a handkerchief over the face yelling with terror cicero hurled himself out again marlows body he gasped theyve put it here with feverish haste he produced a corkscrew knife and opened his whisky bottle a fiery draught gave him courage he ventured back into the hut and knelt down beside the body over the heart gaped an ugly wound and the clothes were caked with blood he gasped again no fit this but murder stabbed to the heart and joewhat does joe know about thisand my employer lord he snatched the handkerchief from the face and fell back on his knees with another cry this time of wonderment rather than of terror he beheld the dead mans fair beard and bald head dr warrender and he was alive last night this is murder indeed then his nerves gave way utterly and he began to cry like a frightened child murder wilful and horrible murder wept the professor of elocution and eloquence chapter iii an elegant epistle on bournemouth cliffs where pinetrees cluster to the edge sat an elderly spinster knitting a homely stocking she wore in spite of the heat a handsome cashmere shawl pinned across her spare shoulders with a portrait brooch and that hideous variety of early victorian headgear known as the mushroom hat from under this streamed a frizzy crop of gray curls which framed a rosy wrinkled face brightened by twinkling eyes these sparkling as those of sweet seventeen proved that their owner was still young in heart this quaint survival of the last century knitted as assiduously as was possible under the circumstances for at a discreet distance were two young people towards whom she acted the part of chaperon doubtless such an office is somewhat outofdate nowadays but miss victoria parsh would rather have died than have left a young girl alone in the company of a young man yet she knew well enough that this young man was altogether above reproach and moreover engaged by parental consent to the pretty girl to whom he was talking so earnestly and no one could deny that sophy marlow was indeed charming there was somewhat of the andalusian about her not very tall shaped delicately as a nymph she well deserved alan thorolds name he called her the midnight fairy and indeed she looked like a brunette titania her complexion was dark and faintly flushed with red her mouth and nose were exquisitely shaped while her eyes were wells of liquid lightglorious spanish orbs about her too was that peculiar charm of personality which defies description alan her lover was not tall but uncommonly wellbuilt and muscular as fair as sophy was darkof that golden saxon race which came before the dane not that he could be called handsome he was simply a clean clearskinned wellgroomed young englishman such as can be seen everywhere of a strong character he exercised great control over his somewhat frivolous betrothed miss vicky as the little spinster was usually called cast romantic glances at the dark head and the fair one so close to one another as a rule she would have been shocked at such a sight but she knew how keenly sophy grieved for the death of her father and was only too willing that the girl should be comforted and miss vicky occasionally touched the brooch which contained the portrait of a redcoated officer she also had lived in arcady but her lieutenant had been shot in the indian mutiny and miss vicky had left arcady after a short sojourn for a longer one in the workaday world at once she had lost her lover and her small income and like many another lonely woman had had to turn to and work but the memory of that short romance kept her heart young hence her sympathy with this young couple poor dear father sighed sophy looking at the sea below dotted with white sails i can hardly believe he is gone only two weeks ago and he was so well and nowoh i was so fond of him we were so happy together he was cold to everyone else but kindly to me how could he have died so suddenly alan well of course dear a fit is always sudden but try and bear up sophy dear dont give way like this be comforted she looked up wistfully to the blue sky at all events he is at peace now she said her lip quivering i know he was often very unhappy poor father he used to sit for hours frowning and perplexed as if there was something terrible on his mind alans face was turned away now and his brow was wrinkled he seemed absorbed in thought as though striving to elucidate some problem suggested by her words wrapped up in her own sorrow the girl did not notice his momentary preoccupation but continued he never said goodbye to me dr warrender said he was insensible for so long before death that it was useless my seeing him he kept me out of the room so i only saw himafterwards ill never forgive the doctor for it it was cruel she sobbed hysterically sophy said alan suddenly had your father any enemies she looked round at him in astonishment i dont know i dont think so why should he he was the kindest man in the world i am sure he was replied the young man warmly but even the kindest may have enemies he might have made enemies in africa she said gravely it was there he made his money and i suppose there are people mean enough to hate a man who is successful especially if his success results in a fortune of some two millions father used to say he despised most people that was why he lived so quietly at the moat house it was particularly quiet till you came sophy im sure it was she replied with the glimmer of a smile still although he had not me you had your profession ah my poor profession i always regret having given it up why did you you know sophy i have told you a dozen times i wanted to be a surgeon but my father always objected to a thorold being of service to his fellowcreatures i could never understand why the estate was not entailed and by my fathers will i was to lose it or give up all hope of becoming a doctor for my mothers sake i surrendered but i would choose to be a struggling surgeon in london any day if it were not for you sophy dear horrid ejaculated miss marlow elevating her nose how can you enjoy cutting up people but dont let us talk of these things they remind me of poor dear father my dear you really should not be so morbid death is only natural it is not as though you had been with him all your life instead of merely three years i know but i loved him none the less for that i often wonder why he was away so long he was making his fortune he could not have taken you into the rough life he was leading in africa you were quite happy in your convent quite she agreed with conviction i was sorry to leave it the dear sisters were like mothers to me i never knew my own mother she died in jamaica father said when i was only ten years old he could not bear to remain in the west indies after she died so he brought me to england while i was in the convent i saw him only now and again until i had finished my education then he took the moat housethat was five years ago and two years after that i came to live with him that is all our history alan but joe brill might know if he had any enemies yes he might he lived thirty years with your father didnt he but he can keep his own counselno one better you are good at it too alan where were you last night you did not come to see me he moved uneasily he had his own reasons for not wishing to give a direct answer i went for a long walktototo think out one or two things when i got back it was too late to see you what troubled you alan you have looked very worried lately i am sure you are in some trouble tell me dear i must share all you troubles my dearest i am in no troublehe kissed her handbut i am your trustee you know and it is no sinecure to have the management of two millions its too much money she said let us dispose of some of it then you need not be worried can i do what i like with it most of itthere are certain legacies will tell you about them later i am afraid the estate will be troublesome to us alan its strange we should have so much money when we dont care about it now there is dr warrender working his life out for that silly extravagant wife of his he is very much in love with her nevertheless i suppose thats why he works so hard but shes a horrid woman and cares not a snap of her fingers for himnot to speak of love love why she doesnt know the meaning of the word we do and bending over sophy kissed him then promptly there came from miss parsh the reminder that it was time for tea very well vicky i dare say alan would like you to give him a cup replied sophy frivolous as ever sophia i give up a hope of forming your characternow alan is doing that replied the girl in spite of her sorrow sophy became fairly cheerful on the way back to the hotel not so alan he was silent and thoughtful and evidently meditating about the responsibilities of the marlow estate as they walked along the parade with their chaperon close behind they came upon a crowd surrounding a fat man dressed in dingy black he was reciting a poem and his voice boomed out like a great organ as they passed alan noticed that he darted a swift glance at them and eyed miss marlow in a particularly curious manner the recitation was just finished and the hat was being sent round sophy always kindhearted dropped in a shilling the man chuckled thank you lady said he the first of many i hope alan frowned and drew his fiance away he took little heed of the remark at the time but it occurred to him later when circumstances had arisen which laid more stress on its meaning miss vicky presided over the teaa gentle feminine employment in which she excelled she did most of the talking for sophy was silent and alan inclined to monosyllables the good lady announced that she was anxious to return to heathton the house weighs on my mind said she lifting her cup with the little finger curved the servants are not to be trusted i fear mrs crammer is addicted to ardent spirits thomas and jane pay too much attention to one another i feel a conviction that during my absence the bonds of authority will have loosened joe said alan setting down his cup joe is a great disciplinarian on board a ship no doubt assented miss vicky but a rough sailor cannot possibly know how to control a household joseph is a fine manly fellow but boisterousvery boisterous it needs my eye to make domestic matters go smoothly when will you be ready to return sophy my dear in a weekbut alan has suggested that we should go abroad what and leave the servants to wilful waste and extravagance my lovemiss vicky raised her two mittened handsthink of the bills there is plenty of money vicky no need there should be plenty of waste no if we go abroad we must either shut up the house or let it to the quiet gentleman said sophy with a laugh alan looked up suddenly no not to him he is a mysterious person said miss vicky i do not like such people though i dare say it is only village gossip which credits him with a strange story just so put in alan dont trouble about him miss vicky was still discussing the possibility of a trip abroad when the waiter entered with a note for sophy it was delivered three hours ago said the man apologetically and i quite forgot to bring it up so many visitors miss he added with a sickly smile sophy took the letter the envelope was a thick creamy one and the writing of the address elegant in the extreme who delivered it she asked a fat man miss with a red face and dressed in black alans expression grew somewhat anxious surely that describes the man we saw reciting so it does sophy eyed the letter dubiously had he a loud voice simmonds as big as a bell miss and he spoke beautiful but he wasnt gentry for all that finished simmonds with conviction you can go said alan then he turned to sophy who was opening the envelope let me read that letter first he said why alan there is no need it is only a begging letter come and read it with me he gave way and looked over her shoulder the elaborate writing miss it began the undersigned if handsomely remunerated can give valuable information regarding the removal of the body of the late richard marlow from its dwelling in heathton churchyard verbum dat sapienti forward to the undersigned at dixons rents lambeth and the information will be forthcoming if the minions of the law are invoked the undersigned with vanish and his information lost faithfully yours miss sophia marlow cicero gramp as she comprehended the meaning of this extraordinary letter sophy became paler and paler the intelligence that her fathers body had been stolen was too much for her and she fainted thorold called loudly to miss vicky look after her he said stuffing the letter into his pocket i shall be back soon but whatwhat began miss vicky she spoke to thin air alan was running at top speed along the parade in search of the fat man but all search was vain cicero the astute had vanished chapter iv another surprise heathton was only an hours run by rail from bournemouth so that it was easy enough to get back on the same evening on his return from his futile search for cicero alan determined to go at once to the moat house he found sophy recovered from her faint and on hearing of his decision she insisted upon accompanying him she had told miss vicky the contents of the mysterious letter and that lady agreed that they should leave as soon as their boxes could be packed dont talk to me alan cried sophy when her lover objected to this sudden move it would drive me mad to stay here doing nothing with that on my mind but my dear girl it may not be true if it is not why should that man have written did you see him no he has left the parade and no one seems to know anything about him it is quite likely that when he saw us returning to the hotel he cleared out by this time i dare say he is on his way to london did you see the police she asked anxiously no said alan taking out the letter which had caused all this trouble it would not be wise remember what he says here if the police are called in he will vanish and we shall lose the information he seems willing to supply i dont think that mr thorold said miss vicky this man evidently wants money and is willing to tell the truth for the matter of a hundred pounds on account remarked thorold grimly as plain a case of blackmail as i ever heard of well i suppose it is best to wait until we can communicate with thiswhat does he call himselfcicero gramp at dixons rents lambeth he can be arrested there if necessary what i want to do now is to find out if his story is true to do this i must go at once to heathton see the rector and get the coffin opened i will come insisted sophy oh it is terrible to think that poor father was not allowed to rest quietly even in his grave of course it may not be true urged alan again i dont see how this tramp could have got to know of it perhaps he helped to violate the secrets of the tomb suggested miss vicky in that case he would hardly put himself within reach of the law alan said after a pause besides if the vault had been broken into we should have heard of it from joe why should it be broken into alan the key i have one key and the rector has the other my key is in my desk at the abbey farm and no doubt phelps has his safe enough your key may have been stolen it might have been admitted alan that is one reason why i am so anxious to get back tonight we must find out also if the coffin is empty yes yes let us go at once sophy cried feverishly i shall never rest until i learn the truth come vicky let us pack when can we leave alan thorold glanced at his watch in half an hour he said we can catch the halfpast six train can you be ready yes yes cried she and rushed out of the room miss vicky was about to follow but alan detained her give her a sedative or something he said or she will be ill i will at once have a carriage at the door in a quarter of an hour mr thorold we can be ready by then i suppose it is best she should go much better than to leave her here we must set her mind at rest at this rate she will work herself into a fever but if this story should really be true i dont believe it for a moment replied alan but he was evidently uneasy and could not disguise the feeling wait till we get to heathtonwait and he hastily left the room miss vicky was surprised at his agitation for hitherto she had credited alan with a will strong enough to conceal his emotions the old lady hurried away to the packing and shook her head as she went shortly they were settled in a firstclass carriage on the way to heathton sophy was suffering acutely but did all in her power to hide her feelings and contrary to alans expectations hardly a word was spoken about the strange letter and the greater part of the journey was passed in silence at heathton he put sophy and miss vicky into a fly drive at once to the moat house he said tomorrow we shall consider what is to be done and you alan i am going to see mr phelps he if any one will know what value to put upon that letter try and sleep sophy i shall see you in the morning sleep echoed the poor girl in a tone of anguish i feel as though i should never sleep again when they had driven away alan took the nearest way to the rectory it was some way from the station but alan was a vigorous walker and soon covered the distance he arrived at the door with a beating heart and dry lips feeling he knew not why that he was about to hear bad news the grayhaired butler ushered him into his masters presence and immediately the young man felt that his fears were confirmed phelps looked worried he was a plump little man neat in his dress and cheerful in manner he was a bachelor and somewhat of a cynic alan had known him all his life and could have found no better adviser in the dilemma in which he now found himself phelps came forward with outstretched hands my dear boy i am indeed glad what good fairy sent you here a glass of port you look pale i am delighted to see you if you had not come i should have had to send for you what do you wish to see me about sir asked alan about the disappearance of these two people what two people asked the young man suddenly alert you forget that i have been away from heathton for the last three days of course of course well one is brown the stranger who stayed with mrs marry the quiet gentleman yes i heard them call him so in the village a very doubtful character he never came to church said the rector sadly however it seems he has disappeared two nights agoin fact upon the evening of the day upon which poor marlows funeral took place he left his lodgings for a walk since then added the rector impressively he has not returned in plain words he has taken french leave said thorold filling his glass oh i should not say that alan he paid his weekly account the day before he vanished he left his baggage behind him no i dont think he intended to run away mrs marry says he was a good lodger although she knew very little about him however he has gone and his box remains no one saw him after he left the village about eight oclock he was last seen by giles hale passing the church in the direction of the moor today we searched the moor but could find no trace of him most mysterious finished the rector and took some port who is the other man asked alan abruptly ah now you must be prepared for a shock alan dr warrender thorold bounded out of his seat is he lost too strangely enough he is answered phelps gravely on the night of the funeral he went out at nine oclock in the evening to see a patient he never came back who was the patient that is the strangest part of it brown the quiet gentleman was the patient mrs warrender who as you may guess is quite distracted says that her husband told her so mrs marry declares that the doctor called after nine and found brown was absent what happened then demanded alan who had been listening eagerly to this tale dr warrender according to mrs marry asked in what direction her lodger had gone she could not tell him so saying he would call again in an hour or so he went and of course he never returned did brown send for him mrs marry could not say certainly no message was sent through her was brown ill not at all according to his landlady we have been searching for both brown and warrender but have found no traces of either humph said thorold after a pause i wonder if they met and went away together my dear lad where would they go to objected the rector i dont know i cant say the whole business is most mysterious alan stopped and looked sharply at mr phelps have you the key of the marlow vault in your possession yes of course locked in my safe your question is most extraordinary the other smiled grimly my explanation is more extraordinary still he took out mr gramps letter and handed it to the rector what do you think of that sir most elegant caligraphy said the good man why bless me he read on hurriedly and finally dropped the letter with a bewildered air bless me alan he stammered whatwhatwhat thorold picked it up and smoothed it out on the table you see this man says the body has been stolen do you know if the door of the vault has been broken open no no certainly not cried the rector rising fussily come to my study alan we must see if it is all right it must be he added emphatically the key of the safe is on my watchchain no one can open it oh dear bless me he bustled out of the room followed by alan a search into the interior of the safe resulted in the production of the key you see cried phelps waving it triumphantly it is safe the door could not have been opened with this now your key my key is in my desk at the abbey farmlocked up also said the young man hastily ill see about it tonight in the meantime sir bring that key with you and we will go into the vault what for demanded the rector sharply why should we go there cant you understand said alan impatiently i want to find out if this letter is true or falseif the body of mr marlow has been removed but iicant gasped the rector i must apply to the bishop for nonsense sir we are not going to exhume the body its not like digging up a grave all that is necessary is to look at the coffin resting in its niche we can tell from the screws and general appearance if it has been tampered with the clergyman sat down and wiped his bald head i dont like it he said i dont like it at all still i dont suppose a look at the coffin can harm any one well go alan well go but i must take jarks the sexton yes i want a witnesstwo witnesses you are one jarks the other it is a gruesome task that we have before us he shuddered again i dont like it profanation if this letter is to be believed the profanation has already been committed cicero gramp repeated mr phelps as they went out who is he a fat mana trampa reciter i saw him at bournemouth he delivered that letter at the hotel himself the waiter described him and as the creature is a perfect falstaff i recalled his facei had seen him on the parade i went at once to see if i could find him but he was gone a fat man said the rector humph he was at the good samaritan the other night ill tell you about him later the two trudged along in silence and knocked up jarks the sexton on the way they had no difficulty in rousing him he came down at once with a lantern and was much surprised to learn the errand of rector and squire want to have a look at muster marlows vault said he in creaking tones well it aint a bad night for a visit i do say but quiet compny muster phelps and muster thorold very quiet what do ye want to see muster marlow for we want to see if his body is in the vault said alan why for sure its there sir muster marlow dont go visiting i had a letter at bournemouth jarks to say the body had been stolen jarks stared it aint true he cried in a voice cracked with passion its casting mud on my arning my bread ive bin sexton here fifty year man and boyi never had no corp as was stolen they all lies comfortable arter my tucking them in only gabriels trump will wake em by this time they were round the lady chapel and within sight of the tomb phelps too much agitated to speak beckoned to jarks to hold up the lantern which he did gram bling and muttering the while ive buried hundreds of corps he growled and not one of ems goed away what ud they go for i make em comfortable i do hold the light steady jarks said the rector whose own hand was just as unsteady he could hardly get the key into the lock at last the door was open and headed by jarks with the lantern they entered the cold earthy smell the charnelhouse feeling shook the nerves of both men jarks accustomed as he was to the presence of the dead hobbled along without showing any emotion other than wrath and triumphantly swung the lantern towards a niche wherein reposed a coffin aint he there quite comfortable wheezed he dont i tell you they never goes from here its a lovely vault no corp ud need a finer wait a bit said alan stepping forward turn the light along the top of the coffin jarks hullo the lids loose an unscrewed gasped the sexton hes bin getting out unscrewedloose gasped the rector in his turn the poor man felt deadly sick there must be some mistake no mistake said alan slipping back the lid the body has been stolen no taint cried jarks showering the light on the interior of the coffin there he is quiet anwhy the old man broke off with a cry the corp aint in his windingsheet phelps looked alan looked the light shone on the face of the dead phelps groaned merciful god he groaned it is dr warrenders body chapter v a nine days wonder there was sensation enough and to spare in heathton next morning jarks lost no time in spreading the news he spent the greater part of the day in the taproom of the good samaritan accepting tankards of beer and relating details of the discovery mrs timber kept him as long as she could for jarks possessed of intelligence regarding the loss of mr marlows body attracted customers these thirsty for news or drink or both flocked like sheep into the inn to think that a corp of mine should be gone creaked he in his aged voice man and boy i niver heard tell of such thingsniver why muster marlow should go beats meay that it does it doesnt beat me cried mrs timber in her most acidulated voice i know who took the body that you dont contradicted jarks incoherently fur passon he dont know so i dont know as how youd know mrs timber it was that fat playactor out of this very house snapped the landlady and how can you prove that mrs timber asked the sexton contemptuously why he had no money for a bed and he had to sleep in the open i dare say he slept in the churchyard and stole the body to sell it back again it being well known as miss sophys a queen of sheba for riches all very well said slack the schoolmaster but if he took away mr marlows body how did he put dr warrenders in its place and how could he without the key of the vault no said the stonemason he couldnt get into that there vault without a key i built him myself me and my mates if that fat man put the doctor there he must have killed him theres a hole in his heart as you could put your fist in its murder cried the man dashing his hand on the table sacrilege and murder it took a good many tankards of mrs timbers strong ale to wash down the sinister word murder every point of the matter was discussed but no one could arrive at any decision slack voiced the general sentiment when he rose to go we must wait for the police said slack but alan thorold was of the contrary opinion he did not wish to wait for the police or to have anything to do with the police the difficulty was that he could not get the rector to take this view and the next morning mr phelps sent the village constable for the inspector at burchester the big market town twenty miles away across the heath meantime at an early hour alan presented himself at the moat house he broke the news as gently as he could both sophy and miss vicky were horrified to think of such things taking place in a christian graveyard cried the little woman wringing her hands sacrilege and murder it makes one believe in the existence of atheists and anarchists and suchlike dreadful peopleit does indeed contrary to thorolds expectation sophy proved to be the more composed of the two she neither wept nor fainted but very pale and very still listened to all that he had to say when he had finished she had only one question to ask who did it she demanded in the calmest voice i cant sayi dont know stammered alan taken aback by her attitude generally we must find out if your father had enemiesbut even an enemy would have had no object in doing this what about the man in bournemouth cicero gramp i intend to go up to london tomorrow and see him if he can tell the truth it will be well worth the money he demands so i think alan cant you go today he shook his head there is so much to do here sophy the rector has gone to break the news of her husbands death to mrs warrender and he has sent over to burchester for the police the inspectorblair is his namewill be here at noon i did not want the police brought into the matter but mr phelps insisted why did you not want to consult the police i am afraid if this vagabond gets wind that the law has intervened he may give us the slip however i shall go up to dixons rents first thing in the morning before the case gets into the papers do you think this man gramp has anything to do with the murder and with the removing of poor fathers body no i dont replied alan promptly he would not dare to give evidence if he were i hear that he was turned out of the good samaritan on the night of the funeral it is likely enough that he saw the removal of the body and possibly the murder naturally such a creature as that wants to sell his information he is a blackmailer this man but i dont credit him with murder or bodysnatching bodysnatching cried miss vicky who was dabbing her red eyes with eaudecologne oh the terrible word alan said sophy after a pause do you believe the man who took my fathers body killed dr warrender i do warrender was out on that night and might have come across the man carrying away the body and the murder might have arisen out of that how do you know dr warrender was out crossexamined sophy mrs warrender told the rector so warrender went to see the quiet gentleman but not finding him in said that he would return he never did and now we know the reason why dont you make certain whether he saw the quiet gentleman brown thats impossible he also has disappeared who was he i dont know said alan gloomily does any one know not to my knowledge perhaps the police may find out sophy what is the matter for the girl was clapping her hands and laughing hysterically it was brown who took my fathers body and killed the doctor she cried i am certain of it why are you certain i feel it i cant say why but your father did not know this man i never heard him allude to the quiet gentleman i dare say not returned sophy doggedly but if the man had nothing to do with it why should he disappear and dr warrender went to see him oh i am sure he is the guilty person he might be an enemy of fathers sophia your father did not know him put in miss vicky who was listening openmouthed to all this oh i am not so sure of that cried the girl impatiently if he did joe will know ring the bell for him did joe know the quiet gentleman alan asked when he had rung i do not think that joseph did said miss vicky he told me that he tried several times to speak to him but got no reply i dont wonder at that replied the young man dryly the man was dumb dumb echoed the ladies didnt you know ah well perhaps not i didnt know myself until the rector told me last night yes he was dumbthat was why the village called him the quiet gentleman oh here is joe joe said sophy going directly to the point have you heard about yes miss said joe interrupting to save her mentioning so painful a subject i know and if i find the swab as did it ill kill him joe said this in a quietly savage way which made miss vicky shudder have you any idea who carried off the body joe no sir i have notbut added the man grimly im going to look for him the old maid shuddered again at the expression in his bloodshot eyes vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord she put in severely all werry good said mr brill but i guess the lord needs an instrument to carry out that text he spat on his hands and added slowly im that instrument had my father any enemies that you know of joe no miss not that i knowed of he had rows as a man should had the capn but i dont know any swab as ud have stolen his corpse and murdered dr warrender said alan who was watching the man as you say sir replied the sailor calmly and murdered dr warrender no i cant rightly call any one to mind did you know the quiet gentleman joe i did not miss brown he called hisselfleastways mrs marry told me so for brown had no tongue i tried to pass the time o day meeting him friendly like on the road but he only put his hand to his mouth and shook his white head i dont know nothing about him do you know a tramp named cicero gramp asked alan after a pause well i did in a way joe drew his huge hand across his mouth and seemed to be considering his reply in this way sir he comed here to the kitchen and put em all wrong with his lies i kicked him outleastways i giv im something to take imself orf what did he come here for joe clenched his teeth and frowned dreadfully i wish i knowed id ha broken his cocoanut said he he was a liar miss savin your presence said e knowed your father the capn which said joe slowly was a dd liebeggin your pardon miss said he knew my father echoed sophy anxiously what did he know about him nothin replied joe firmly make your mind easy missnothin it seemed to alan as though the old sailor wished to intimate that there really was something in marlows past which might be known but that the tramp was ignorant of it he evidently wanted to reassure the girl yet alan was well aware that sophy knew practically nothing of her fathers life he resolved to try the effect of a surprise joe said he slowly it was this tramp who told me the body had been stolen joes hard shiny hat which he had been twisting nervously in his hands fell to the ground his face was a dark crimson when he stooped to pick it up and he stammered hi sir thatthat lubber how did he know that i have to find out he offers to sell the information for a hundred pounds joe rubbed his hands and looked ferocious what i want to know sir is where is the swab in london im going up to see him tomorrow this afternoon put in sophy sharply you are going this afternoon alan certainly my dear alan said promptly ill go this afternoonif the police dont want me the police gasped joe shifting nervously from one leg to the other yes alan darted a keen glance at him mr phelps has sent for the police to investigate this murder of dr warrender well i hope theyll find him sir said joe recovering his stolidity for i make no doubt that the swab as killed the doctor carried off the capns body so i think joe and i am going to london to find out from cicero gramp youll find hell tell you that the quiet gentleman killed dr warrender put in sophy the old sailor choked and looked at her with absolute terror how do you know that miss he asked i only think so the quiet gentleman has disappeared probably he killed the doctor and then took my fathers body it might be so miss if i find him joe repeated his former savage declaration and miss vicky duly shuddered then you cant help us in any way joe said alan eying him thoughtfully no sir i cant i dont know who carried off the capn and i dont know who stabbed the doctor if i did id kill him when you find him sir let me know after which speech the old sailor again pulled his forelock scraped his foot and rolled out of the room he appeared somewhat relieved to get away alan did not quite know what to make of joe the man was so nervous that it seemed as though he knew something and was afraid of committing himself on the other hand this sailor was devoted to sophy and had been in marlows service for thirty years it was only reasonable to conclude therefore that he would wish her to benefit by any knowledge he might possess on the whole alan was perplexed but he kept it to himself determining nevertheless to keep an eye on joe when the door was closed sophy turned to alan alan she said slowly i love you dearly as you know and i wish to become your wife but i swear by the memory of my father that until you find out who has done this wicked thing and bring the man to justice i will not marry you sophy cried thorold entreatingly i mean what i say repeated the girl in a low fierce voice we must avenge my father when the wretch is caught and hanged then ill marry you alan sophia a marriage under such circumstances miss parsh cried sophy turning on the meek old maid do you think i can sit down tamely under this insult to the dead my fathers body has been carried off it must be found again before i marrybefore i can think of marriage alan sophy is right cried thorold drawing the girl to him and kissing her she is right miss parsh i swear also that i will devote my life to solving this mystery your fathers body shall be brought back sophy and the murderer of dr warrender shall hang goodbye dear today i go to london the first step towards the discovery of this crime will be to see cicero gramp he may supply the clue yes yes bribe him pay him anything so long as you get at the truth alan kissed the girl again and then left the room before he started he intended to see the rector and the local inspector of police as he stepped out on to the road he noticed phelps coming along in the hot sunshine the little parson was puffing and blowing and wiping his forehead alan alan he called out in short gasps as he came within speaking distance shes gone shes gone to she gone whos gone where why mrs warrender shes disappeared oh dear me how terrible all this is whew chapter vi the missing key so excited was the little parson that alan feared lest he should take a fit the good samaritan was no great distance away so thither he led him into mrs timbers private parlor now sir said alan when his old tutor seemed somewhat more composed tell me all about mrs warrender but before mr phelps could reply the vixenish landlady made her appearance she was highly honored at seeing the rector within her doors and curtsied a hint for orders and in truth the little clergyman undone with excitement was quite ready to stimulate his jaded nerves eh mrs timber he said yes you might get us a little cognac i think old the best you have mrs timber and a jug of freshdrawn water from the well please alan ill join you said young thorold promptly he too felt that he was in nowise beyond reach of a little stimulant silent for once in her life mrs timber brought of her best which be it said was passing good mr phelps lost no time in brewing his measure and drank it down with gusto thats good alan my boy very good said he setting down the tumbler with a sigh of relief god forgive me i fear to think what my good brethren would say did they see their rector in a publichouse though to be sure the good samaritan is a most respectable hostelry but alan why did you bring me here indeed sir i feared you would be ill out there in the blazing sun i did only what i thought wise but about mrs warrenderyou say she has disappeared eh yes mr phelps wiped his bald head vigorously i went to break the news to her after you had gone to see sophy and i found she had left for london london why london that is just what i wanted to know my dear alan it seems she received last night a letter which threw her into a state of great excitement she was bad enough that way as it was the servant said but this letter it appears drove her into a perfect frenzy do you know what was in the letter i asked thatoh trust me alan to be precise about detailsbut the servant said she did not know mrs warrender put it in her pocket that spoke volumes from the servants point of view all night long it appears she was walking about the room using the most fearful languagegod forgive herand this morning at eight oclock she started off to catch the express at the junction and is she coming back that i dont know my boy mr phelps looked round cautiously and lowered his voice to a whisper she took her jewels with her her jewels yes she had a quantity of jewelry she put all the money she could get from her husband into clothes and diamondsa most extravagant woman alan well shes gone thats certain jewels and all she left no address and said no word about returning what do you think of it upon my word sir i dont know what to think the whole place has gone mad it seems to me the entire village is topsyturvy marlows body stolen warrender murdered and his body placed in poor marlows coffin and now here is mrs warrender cleared out significantly with her jewels and the quiet gentleman brown the dumb man what about him i know he too has vanished but what else im going to tell you sir the key of the vault not your key alan yes my key mr phelps the quiet gentleman has it god bless methat is god forgive me alan are you mad too no sir not yet though i admit im fairly on the way with all this tell me do you know who this socalled quiet gentleman really is no alan i dont i spoke to him but found he was dumb now he too is gone yes with marlows body on his hands and warrenders death on his soul you dont mean that are you sure mr phelps was greatly agitated i go only by circumstantial evidence it is true you know of course the funeral of mr marlow took place in the morning yes yes and at two oclock you took sophy and miss parsh to bournemouth i did well about five oclock brownwell call him that instead of the quiet gentleman though i dont believe it really is his namewell about that time brown walked over to abbey farm he brought a letter purporting to come from me to my housekeeper mrs hester from you alan yes the letter was forged said alan with emphasis it directed mrs hester to allow brown to remain at the farm until i returned it was in my handwriting and signed with my name she knew nothing about brown save that he was staying at mrs marrys and she thought it somewhat strange he should come to stop at the farm during my absence but as the instructions in the letter were quite plain and she knew my handwriting wellthat shows how expert the forgery wasshe gave brown the run of the place in the meantime she wrote to me at bournemouth asking me if all was right and inclosed the forged letter here it is as he saw the handwriting mr phelps started upon my word alan i dont wonder mrs hester was deceived especially when you consider her sight is not good why i myself with my eyes should certainly take it for yours mr phelps wore pincenez but nevertheless resented any aspersion on his optical powers but why on earth didnt she telegraph to you well you know how oldfashioned and conservative she is sir she makes out through the scriptureshow i cannot tell youthat the telegraph is a sinful institution therefore it is not to be wondered at that she trusted to the post i got her letter only this morn as of course it followed me on from bournemouth nevertheless i knew about the loss of the key last night ah the loss of the key yes go alan very well brown being allowed to remain in my house proceeded to make him quite at home in the library mrs hester writing her letterno easy task for hertook no further heed of him he was in the room for quite an hour and amused himself appears in breaking open my desk having forced several of the drawers he found at last the one he wantedthe one containing the key of the vault then he made all things beautifully smooth so that mrs hester should not see they had been tampered with and leaving a message that he would return to dinner went out ostensibly for a walk he returned appears to his lodging and left there again about nine oclock in the evening since then nothing has been seen or heard of him god bless me alan are you sure he has the key positive i looked in my desk last night and it was not there but everything was done so nicely that i am strongly of the opinion that mr brown has served his apprenticeship as a cracksman and that under a pretty good master too no one but he could have stolen that key besides the forged letter shows plainly that he came to the farm with no honest intentions but what i cant understand continued alan biting his mustache is how the man came to know where the key was extraordinaryyes that is extraordinary undoubtedly he it was who stole the body and gained access to the vault with your key but the murder of dr warrender he committed that too i am convinced of it warrender called to see him found he was out and i have no doubt followed him he probably saw brown remove the body and of course interfered upon which the villain made short work of him that is my theory sir and a very sound one too in many respects said the rector but brown could not have removed the body alone he must have had an accomplice true and it is for that very reason i am going to town this afternoon cicero gramp may be able to supply some information on that point it is quite possible he slept in the churchyard and saw the whole businessmurder and all alan alan cried mr phelps horrified do you believe this murder was committed on the sacred soil of the churchyard in gods own acre alan no one surely could be so vile i do sir and at the door of the vault brown as you say yourself cleverly concealed the body in marlows coffin he had no time to screw it down again apparently he must have had a pretty tough job to cut through that lead he had to trust to chance of course that the vault would not be visited until he had got a safe distance away with his booty and indeed but for gramps letter no one would ever have thought of going there in fact this brown is a most ingenious and dangerous criminal he is indeed he is but what could he possibly want the body for ha thats just it i fancy this is a case of blackmail if you remember a millionaires body was stolen in america some few years ago and only restored to the family on payment by them of a very large sum of money oh that is what you think he is after yes i do it is highly probable i think that in a few weeks or perhaps even in less time we shall receive a letter demanding some thousands for the return of the body but surely the police oh mr brown will look after all that you may depend upon it hell make himself quite safe before he goes that far so talented a gentleman as he would not be likely to omit all necessary precautions of that kind humph muttered mr phelps considering and of mrs warrenders suspicious flight what think you i confess i dont know quite what to make of that i have no great opinion of her as a woman still i should hardly credit her with being in league with this ruffian no indeed for that she must needs be the worst of women said mr phelps with warmth why alan poor warrender was simply crazy about her he worked day and night to provide her with the finery she craved for besides she seemed really fond of him who was she asked alan bluntly well i shouldnt like to say it to every one alan but mrs warrender had been an actress an actress under what name that i cannot tell you i called there one day and i heard her reciting shakespeare her elocution seemed to me so fine that i complimented her upon it then she told me that she had been on the stage and had retired when she married warrender thats very strange i always thought she had somewhat of a professional manner about her and her hair alan flava comayellow hair not that i mean for one moment she was what the romans referred to by these words well my boy what is to be done now i am going up to london in an hours time alan glanced at his watch while speaking but youll miss seeing blair the inspector remonstrated mr phelps ill see him when i return you can explain the case as well as i sir i shall bring gramp back with me if i can manage it and mrs warrendershall i tell blair about her i fear you must but let him be circumspect it is not necessary to take any steps against her until we are tolerably sure of the reason for her sudden flight when do they hold the inquest on warrender tomorrow well ill be back tonight and tell you what ive done and alan rose to go one moment my dear boy what about sophy ive seen her and of course i was judicious in what i told her she knows nothing about the loss of the key and my suspicions of brown although funnily enough she herself suspects him bless me on what grounds can she do that oh on the purely feminine grounds that she suspects him she declares she will not marry me until her fathers body is discovered very right very proper i quite agree with her you should start your married life with an absolutely clean sheet alan the young man nodded and as he left the inn he delivered himself of one warning whatever you do keep your eye on joe brill he said significantly whywhy what for because i fancy he knows a good deal more than he is inclined to tell replied alan then without further comment he drove off leaving the rector considerably bewildered at this abrupt interpolation of a fresh name into the persons of the drama meanwhile alan caught his train and in due time or a very fair approach to it arrived in london he took a hasty lunch at waterloo and drove to westminster bridge here he dismissed his cab and set about inquiring for dixons rents the slumits name was highly suggestive of its being suchappeared to be well known the first constable he asked was both familiar with and communicative about it its within easy distance of lambeth palace sir he said a bit rough by night but youll be all right there in the daytime ask any constable near by the palace sir and hell put you right thank you sir alan left the officer of the law well pleased with his unlookedfor halfcrown and walked on towards the palace the second constable could not leave his beat but the bestowal of another halfcrown elicited from him the practical suggestion that a certain young shoeblack of repute should act as guide the shoeblack was quite near at hand and very shortly was enrolled as guide for the occasion together he and alan started off leaving the constable well content though withal a trifle mystified not to say curious the shoeblack led the way and alan followed closely they turned away from the river into a mass of houses where the streets became more and more squalid and the population more and more ragged and unkempt at length after many twistings and turnings they arrived at the entrance to a narrow culdesac and he was informed that this was his destination he rewarded and dismissed the shoeblack and proceeded down the dirty lane almost the first person he saw was a tall woman standing at the entrance of the court closely veiled she seemed to be hesitating whether she would come on or not then suddenly she threw up her veil as she did so alan uttered an exclamation of surprise it was mrs warrender chapter vii in dixons rents at the sound of alans voice mrs warrender started like a guilty thing he was astonished beyond measure at finding her in the same unsavory neighborhood as himself bound for all he knew on the same errand at all events it was surely more than a coincidence that she should be on the threshold of gramps dwelling so to speak mrs warrender he said gravely lifting his hat this is indeed a surprise of course you know what has happened at heathton i know all answered the woman in a rich low voice jarks the sexton told my servant this morning what has happened to poor julian and that his body has been found in the marlow vault are you sure you did not know of it last night asked alan quietly mr thorold the color rushed to her face i mean that the letter which disturbed you so much might have hinted at the murder a letter how do you know i got a letter last night the rector called to break the news to you this morning and your servant told him that you already knew it also that you had left for londonwith your jewels mrs warrender added alan significantly and you followed me cried the woman savagely do you intend to accuse me of my husbands murder i certainly do not and i did not follow you i am here on the same errand as yourself she looked terrified how do you know what my errand is because i can put two and two together mrs warrender i also received a letterat least miss marlow did and from the same manthe man who lives here cicero gramp that is the name you see i was right does he intend to blackmail you also and did you bring your jewels to satisfy his demands she looked down the court they were comparatively alone a few ragged children were playing about and some slatternly women were watching them from doorways a man or two brutalized by drink hovered in the distance but a smart constable who passed and repassed the entrance of the culdesac casting inquisitive glances at alan and his companion kept these birds of prey from any nearer approach finding that they were out of earshot mrs warrender produced a letter and handed it to alan it was written on the same thick creamy paper and in the same elegant handwriting as had been the communication to sophy he read it in silence as he had expected it informed mrs warrender that her husband was dead and that cicero gramp on payment of two hundred pounds could inform her where the body could be found his price had evidently gone up but what struck alan most was the nature of the information now offered cicero declared that he could tell the widow where her husbands body was to be found the body had already been discovered in the marlow vault ergo cicero gramp knew it was there if so had he seen the murder committed and the body taken into the vault it seemed probable indeed it seemed likely that he could solve the whole mystery but strangely enough the prospect did not seem to afford mr thorold much satisfaction he handed back the letter with a dissatisfied smile i think you have wasted your time coming up he said jarks no doubt told your servant that the doctors body had already been discovered why then come up to pay blackmail i want to find out who killed julian she said then you are on your way to see this man yes she shuddered but this terrible place i am afraid then why come here i am going to see mr gramp on miss marlows behalf if you like i will represent you also no thank you i must see him myself very well i suppose you are not staying in town yes at the norfolk hotel i shall remain until tomorrow so as to sell my jewels and bribe this man there will be no need to sell your jewels said alan soothingly i will be responsible for the blackmail have you the jewels with you no i dared not bring them he might have robbed me they are in my bedroom at the hotel then go back at once and look after them i will bring this man there in let us say an hour thank you mr thorold she said i accept your offer i am really afraid to go down that slum he gazed after her fine figure as she walked hurriedly away somehow that haughty air and resolute gait did not fit in well with her expression of fear it was curious he felt there was something strange about mrs warrender however she had been open enough with him so he did not choose to think badly of her the man he sought was not easy to find mr cramp had his own reasons for keeping clear of the police the whole alley was known by the name of dixons rents and thorold had no idea in which of the houses to ask for him he questioned a stunted street arab with wolfish eyes emphasizing his request with a sixpence oh cicero yelped the lad biting the coin yuss hes round about dunno yaint a tec whats that a detective drawled the boy cicero aint wanted is he not by me is cicero generallyerwanted inquired alan delicately the urchin closed one eye rapidly and grinned with many teeth but instead of replying he took to shouting hoarsely for mother ginger the surrounding population popped out of their burrows like so many rabbits and for the next few minutes mother ginger was asked for vigorously alan looked round at the ragged bleareyed slumdwellers but could see nothing of the lady in question suddenly his arm was twitched and he turned to find a dwarf no higher than his waist trying to attract his attention mother ginger for it was she had a huge head of red hair fantastically decked with ribbons of many colors her dress too was rainbowhued like josephs coat she had carpet slippers on her huge feet and white woolen gloves on her large hands her face was as large as a fryingpan and of a pallid hue with expressionless blue eyes and a big mouth alan saw in her a female quasimodo wot is it she inquired evidently mother ginger was vain of her finery and of the attention she attracted is it mr gramp you want mdimbercove yes can you take me to him asked thorold wincing at the pennywhistle quality of her voice is he at home praps he is praps he aint retorted mother ginger with a fascinating leer wot dye want with him this will explain and alan put ciceros letter into her hand give him that she nodded croaked like a bullfrog and vanished amongst the crowd mr thorold found himself the center of attraction and the object of remark this somewhat unpleasant position was put an end to by the appearance of mother ginger who clawed alan and drew him into a house at the end of the court the tatterdemalions gave a yell of disappointment at the escape of their prey and their prey congratulated himself that he had not made his visit at night he felt that he might have fared badly in this modern court of miracles however it appeared that he was safe under the protection of mother ginger with the activity of a monkey she conducted him up a dirty staircase and into a bare room furnished with a bed a chair and a table here alan was greeted by a bulky creature in a gorgeous red dressinggown old and greasy but still pretentious he had no difficulty in recognizing the man whom he had seen reciting on the parade at bournemouth i welcome you mr thorold said cicero in his best turveydrop style mother ginger depart to get rid of the woman mr thorold placed a shilling in her concave claw upon which she executed a kind of wardance and vanished with a yelp of delight left alone with the pompous vagabond the young man took the only chair and faced his host who was sitting majestically on the bed his red dressinggown wrapped round him in regal style so you are cicero gramp began alan i have seen you at bournemouth interrupted the professor of elocution and eloquence true i was there for the benefit of my health and to blackmail miss marlow blackmaila painful word mr thorold how do you know my name it is part of my business to know all names was the answerex nihilo nihil fit if you understand the tongue of my namesake if i did not know what i desire to know my income would be small indeed i visited the salubrious village of heathton and learned there that miss marlow and mr thorold to whom she was engaged were recreating themselves at the seaside with an inferior companion bournemouth was the seaside and i went there on seeing a young lady with a spinster and a gentleman in attendance i noted miss marlow mr thorold and miss parsh and made yourself scarce i did admitted cicero frankly i departed as soon as you were out of sight knowing that my letter would be delivered and that you might call in the police ah a guilty conscience far from it cicero flung open his dressinggown and struck his chest here purity and innocence and peace are enthroned i did not wish to be taken by the minions of the law lest they should wrest from me for nothing what i should prefer to sell for a few pounds besides i wished to see you in my own house a poor establishment said mr gramp looking round the meager room but mine own he bowed gracefully as if for applause come mr gramp said alan diplomatically let us get to business what do you know about this matter about the hundred pounds asked the man with an appearance of great simplicity ill pay you that more or less when i know what your information is worth more or less wont do mr thorold i want from miss marlow or from you one hundred pounds i know and two hundred from mrs warrender ahcicero did not move a muscleshe has told you that i can give you information about the body of her husband yes and she has come to town to see you however i have intercepted her and she is waiting to see you in a place i know of you must come with me mr gramp but cicero shook his head uneasily an englishmans house is his castle he said this is my house my keep my donjon quod erat demonstrandum oh confound your dictionary latin cried alan impatiently you are afraid of the police far from it mr thorold i have nothing to fear from them for one hundred pounds i lay bare my heart ill give you fifty pounds on condition you tell me all you know from mrs warrender you wont receive a penny then she shall never know where lies the body of her late lamented partner she knows that already said alan coolly hacicero gave a dramatic startyou seek to deceive me indeed i do nothing of the sort i found the body myself where may i ask said gramp his thoughts going back to the hut on the heath in the marlow vault in the coffin of the dead man who was carried away ciceros jaw fell he was truly surprised how the devil did it get there from the hut he said the hutwhat hut i want my money before i tell you that mr thorold alan took five tenpound notes out of his pocket here is fifty pounds he said it will be yours if you tell me all you know and come with me to see mrs warrender aha ciceros eyes glittered and his fingers longed to clutch the money such wealth had not been his for many a long day and the police i thought you did not fear them was the reply i dont for i have done nothing to put myself in the power of the law but i am afraid as this body has been found that you will have me arrested and so i shall lose the money if you are innocent of the murder and the sacrilege you wont be arrested gramp and the money i will give you after we have seen mrs warrender on your word of honor as a gentleman yes on my word of honor if you can throw light on this mystery and bring home these crimes to the person who has committed them i am quite willing to pay you i dont know about bringing home the crimes mr thorold said cicero rising but i will tell you all i know in the presence of mrs warrender permit me to assume my visiting garb where is the lady at the norfolk hotel i know it many a glass which cheers have i drained there dulce desipere in loco you dont know horace perhaps i suspect you dont said alan annoyed by this hedgelatin hurry up fifty pounds mr thorold after our interview with mrs warrender amended the other significantly command my services said cicero and rapidly put on his frockcoat battered hat and gloves after he had brushed his greasy broadcloth and dusted his large boots with the red bandana he announced that he was ready the oddlyassorted pair proceeded to the norfolk hotel through the lambeth slums cicero seemed to be very well known and very popular he exchanged greetings with shady acquaintances patted ragged children on the head and arrived at the hotel swelling with pride he felt that he had shown alan he was a man of consequence arrived at their destination they were shown by a slipshod waiter into a shabby sittingroom on the first floor where they found mrs warrender she rose and on seeing cicero gave a shriek of surprise bill she cried with a gasp clara maria exclaimed the socalled cicero my beloved sister what a surprise chapter viii an important interview well i never gasped the widow who womanlike was the first to find her tongue is it really you billybut i might have guessed it from your writing yet it never entered my head she stopped and grew suddenly furious my husband you wretchhave you killed him no clara maria no i came here to give information about his poor body i did not expect to find my sisterthe celebrated miss de crespignyin the person of mrs warrender what is all this about demanded alan quietly is this your brother mrs warrender to my shame sir i confess thisthis creaturemrs warrender brought out the word with a hissthis degraded beast is my brother oh clara maria how can you hold your tongue interrupted the lady angrily you were always a drunkard and a scoundrel now youve come to blackmailing two hundred pounds from me you wretch not one sixpence i have already said her brother majestically arranged pecuniary matters with my friend mr thorold but i wonder at you clara maria i really do considering how we parted is this the greeting of flesh and blood cried mr gramp in a soaring voice and standing on tiptoe is this what human nature is made of the late sir isaac newton was a prophet indeed when he made that remark mountebank hissed mrs warrender curling her handsome lip we were both mountebanks at one time mr thorold he said turning to alan who in spite of his anxiety was watching the scene with unconcealed amusement my sister was the celebrated miss de crespigny i the once noted actor vavasour belgrave and his real name is billy spinks put in mrs warrender scornfully william spinks corrected mr gramp as it may be convenient to call him billy is merely an endearing term to which alas your lips have long been strangers but you neednt talk said cicero becoming angry and therewith a trifle vulgar your name is clara maria spinks and a very good name too retorted the lady cut the scene short billy that is my advice also put in alan who was growing weary i do not want to know any more about your relationship that you are brother and sister is nothing to me i hope mr thorold that you wont reveal my degraded connection in heathton cried mrs warrender much agitated it would ruin me with great difficulty i attained a position by marrying my poor dear julian and i dont want to fall back into the mud where this worm writhes she darted a vicious glance at cicero be content mrs warrender your secret is safe with me denying her own flesh and blood moaned gramp and sat down speech and attitude were most effective and mrs warrender with a spark of her old theatrical humor played back yes i deny you she cried rising quickly and stretching out a denunciatory hand you were always a brute and a disgrace to me look at that creature mr thorold he is my brother our parents were on the stagebarnstormers they wereand played in the provinces for bite and sup they put us on the stage and when thy died left a little money to billy there he was to bring me up how did he fulfil his trust by making me work for him as an actor even in the meanest parts he was a failure i am not much of an actress myself although i was well known as miss de crespigny and billed all over london it was my figure and my looks that did it i appeared in burlesque ten or twelve years ago and i had wealth at my feet i have heard of you said alan recalling his college days and certain photographs of the most beautiful burlesque actress in london he wondered he had not recognized her long before mrs warrender shaking with passion went on as though she had not heard him wealth was at my feet went on the widowwealth and dishonor he she cried and pointed the finger of scorn at the unabashed cicero he lived on me he would have me stoop to dishonor for his sake then i lost my voice the creature treated me basely i left him i ran away to the states of america and appeared in ballets for my looks alone in new orleans i met julian warrenderhe was old but he was madly in love with meand i married him for a home we came to england five years ago and settled at heathton i always did my best to be a good wife although i dare say i was extravagant diamonds yes i have diamonds and i made julian buy me all he could and whyto provide against the days of poverty which i knew would come they have comemy husband is dead god help me her voice rose to a scream murdered she cried this interpolated gramp addressing no one in particular is very painful you beast why do you come into my life again i wanted to know about my poor husbands death and i brought up my jewels to bribe the man who called himself cicero gramp into confessing who had murdered him i find that my own brother is the blackmailer you would extort money from me you wretch never never never i disown youi cast you out william spinks blackguard you were cicero gramp scoundrel thief blackmailer and for all i know murderer you are away with youaway and mrs warrender very white in face and very exhausted in body sat down very good said her brother rising i go without your fifty pounds asked alan sneering i forgot that he said smiling blandly dont give him a penny mr thorold cried the woman with vehemence i promised him the money and he shall have it replied alan coldly i have heard your story mrs warrender and it is safe with me no one in heathton shall know your brother will not speak of it either how do you know that asked cicero with an evil look because you shall not have the fifty pounds until i have your promise to hold your tongue about your relationship to mrs warrender while you are in heathton i am not going to heathton growled gramp like a sulky bear yes you are you are coming to tell your story to inspector blair if you dont not only will you lose your fifty pounds but i will have you arrested as a suspicious character you promised that the police should not touch me i promised nothing of the sort now tell me what you saw of these crimesfor there are two sacrilege and murderand then come to heathton behave well keep mrs warrenders secret and you shall have fifty pounds and your freedom otherwise alan held up his finger oh mr thorold cried the widow wringing her hands if this horrible man comes to heathton i am lost indeed no he will hold his tongue wont you you seem very sure of it said the professor of eloquence of course i am you see mr gramp i have the handling of the late mr marlows money and i can buy your silence not for fifty pounds we shall see about that its either fifty pounds or the police choose cicero folded his arms and bowed his head i will take the money he said and i will hold my tonguewhile i am at heathton giving my evidence afterwards he looked at his sister afterwards said alan smoothly we will make other arrangements now tell your story and tell the truth put in mrs warrender sharply clara maria cicero was about to break forth in furious speech but he restrained himself hodie mihi eras tibi said mr gramp with a strange look at alanif you understand latin i think i am able to follow you my friend you mean today to me tomorrow to thee which would be all right if it was i who quoted the saying but this time it is not your day and as to your tomorrow it may never come we shall see about that said cicero savagely and pointedly alan felt an unpleasant thrill run through him for the mans look was evil beyond telling but he betrayed nothing of this and signed to gramp to continue quite understanding the position cicero reverted to his grand theatrical manner he rose from his chair rested one hand on the back of it and thrust the other into his breast as from a rostrum he delivered his speech and dwelt upon his own words with the gusto of a modern micawber mr thorold and clara maria he began in deep tones a few days ago circumstances connected with money turned me weary and hungry from the seaport of southampton i wentlet us be plaini went on the tramp and in the course of my peregrinations i drew near heathton a salubrious village notorious at the present moment for the crimes which have been committed there i spun a coin my only sixpence to decide if an intrusion into that village would bring me good or evil fortune the coin said good so to heathton i went as i shall shortly pocket fifty quida vulgar term but eloquent clara maria so dont frowni dare not say that my only sixpence told me a lie that sixpence bought me a meal in the heathton publichouse where is that meal or sixpence now eheu fuit ilium go on said alan curtly for the orator paused at the good samaritan i heard much about mr marlow and the funeral and learned a few facts which were of use to me afterwards when you thrust yourself into the kitchen at the moat house i presume you are correct mr thorold i did good business there and i learned from the irresponsible chatter of the domestics a few other facts which may also prove valuable he looked directly at alan as he said this go on go on said thorold again but he felt uneasy i was turned out of the good samaritan by a hardhearted landlady calledappropriately i confessmrs timber as the night was fine i slept in the churchyard opposite the tomb of mr marlow soon after midnight i was awakened by voices i looked out and saw two men one tall the other short who were they alan asked anxiously one i knew later the other one i am still in doubt about as i did not see his face but the names you shall hear the names clara maria when i am ready not before these men went into the tomb remained there for some time and came out with the body they lifted it over the low wall of the churchyard and went i think across the moor you followed cried alan breathlessly no i was afraid i might get into trouble so i ran in the opposite direction i slept the rest of the night in a hayrick far from the churchyard next day i sought the moat house kitchen and listened to the talk of the servants then i went away with the idea of seeing miss marlow at bournemouth as the servants said she was there with mr thorold on the moor i saw a hut i went into it to eat a frugal meal in it i foundcicero paused to give his words due effecta corpse whose corpse that of the man who had assisted to steal the body clara maria your husband dr warrender you liar shrieked the widow making a bound at him oh you liar alan flung himself between these affectionate relatives or it might have fared badly with cicero hold hard mrs warrender he said holding her back let us listen listen to his lies do you hear that he says my husband stole mr marlows body so he did said cicero doggedly im telling you what i shall tell to the police the tall man was dr warrender i saw his face in the lanternlight who the short man was i do not know how did you recognize dr warrender demanded alan when mrs warrender had sat down again i didnt know him at the time but i had his description from the servants tall yellow beard bald head said thorold rapidly yes that was the man who assisted to remove the body and that is the description of the corpse i found in the hut my husbands body was found in the vault you liar cried the widow was it clara maria well all i can say is i dont know how it got there i left it in the hut myself why did you not give information to the police what and get locked up on suspicion of murder no thank you mr thorold i ran away from that corpse as i would have done from the devil whose child you are said his sister bitterly dont miscall your own father clara maria well sir i went on to bournemouth and wrote two letters one to miss marlow and one to my sister although i did not know she was my sister then had i known i had a relative in heathton said cicero with pathos i should have asked for a bed and your sister billy spinks would have set the dogs on you i am sure you would clara maria you were always one for sentimental scenes tell me gramp is this all you know of these crimes put in alan all mr thorold i think sir it is worth fifty pounds humph well see what the police say you have no objection i suppose to come with me to heathton and repeat this story having a clear conscience said cicero with a superior smile i can safely say that i have not but the fifty mr thorold will be paid after you have told blair this story if you are so poor put in mrs warrender where did you get money to buy that writingpaper it was costly paper it was admitted mr gramp with prideit was clara maria i always do things in style if you remember i got a prize at school for letterwriting where did you get the money from a nautical man called joe brilla sovereign a sovereign from joe brill cried alan starting why ah you may ask said cicero in my opinion it was hushmoney hushmoney what do you mean man mean i mean that i believe joe brill was the short man i saw that night yes mr thorold joe stole the corpse and joe killed foully with a knife my respected brotherinlaw hinc ill lachrym chapter ix investigation whilst alan thorold was dealing with cicero and his sister in london inspector blair was cooperating with the rector in obtaining evidence relating to the murder the inspector was a dry dour silent man born in england but of scotch descent he was cautious to a fault and never expressed an opinion without having well considered what he was going to say it was now a common sight in heathton for his long lean figure and the rectors short plump one to be seen constantly together he was now in the rectory diningroom with a good glass of port beside him and mr phelps standing on the hearthrug was supplying him with all the details he had collected in connection with the mystery the case was getting so much more interesting than blair the sad and silent had expected that he was becoming for him quite vivacious he asked the rector one question after another mr thorold has gone to dixons rents sir yes mr inspector i expect hell have some news for us when he returns tonight he seems a clever young gentleman blair said musingly i dare say he will bring this man gramp with him do you think that gramp can point out the guilty person that sir i am not prepared to say offhand if convenient i should like to take a look round certainly where shall we go mr inspector and mr phelps rose briskly to the vault if you please sir afterwards we will call on mrs marry the rector paused at the door i told you all mrs marry had to say about brown quite so sir but i wish to have a look at the rooms occupied by the man also i think it would be as well to examine his luggage can you do that without a warrant ill take the risk said blair coolly an examination may not be quite legal under the circumstances but as brown undoubtedly procured the key of the vault by that forged letter i am entitled to look upon him as a suspicious character should he come back sirof which i have my doubtsi can account for my action humph i think you are right come then and look at the vault to the vault they went and found jarks showing the outside of it to a crowd of morbid sightseers indeed the tragedy had drawn people from far and near to heathton and the usually quiet place buzzed like a hive mrs timber was making her fortune and blessed the day she had turned cicero the tramp out of her house to him alone did mrs timber ascribe the theft of the body as to his connection with the murder of dr warrender she was not so certain come come cried mr phelps in his fussy manner on finding jarks haranguing the crowd this is most ridiculousmost out of place jarks i am astonished at your desecrating the graveyard in this way no desecration reverend sir said jarks in his rusty voice i wos only showing em where i laid muster marlow by comfortable go go awaygo away all of you come on to the right shouted jarks ill show ee where a soocide as they brought in crazy is tucked away a lovely grave with a good view an as nice a stone as i iver seed in my young days hed have been buried in crossroads with a stake but they do trate em kindly nowadays ah yis this way to the soocide neighbors and jarks headed the crowd to the other side of the graveyard the keen cold eye of inspector blair cleared them out more quickly than jarks invitation dear me most indiscreet of jarks said the rector opening the door of the vault come in mr inspector heres a candle tut tut ive burnt my fingers deuce take humgod forgive me for bad language this is the niche mr inspector yonder the coffina very handsome one the lead is cut you perceive ah poor soul and we meant it to last till the great day while the rector ran on in this fashion blair the silent examined the empty coffin he noted that the lead casing had been cut with a sharp instrument and very neatly doneso neatly that the inspector became thoughtful that wasnt done by a man in a hurry he mused but he said nothing and merely turned to mr phelps with a question who screwed down the coffin whobless me let me think yes yes dr warrenderpoor souland joe brill faithful fellow joe would see the last of his master wasnt the undertaker present crank well yes he was but i am sorry to say mr inspectorhere the face of the rector became severethat on that day crank was intoxicated hm who made him drunk himself i suppose rejoined mr phelps a trifle tartly crank requires no one to tempt him few men do sir said blair and again examined the coffin he passed his long delicate hand over every inch of it particularly fingering the lid then he looked round the niche where it rested peered into the others and considered well all that he saw while mr phelps chattered quite so said the detective at length let us go outside he examined the graveyard as carefully as he had done the vault in the angle formed by the lady chapel he found the long grass crushed down and part of it torn up to make a pillow humph a squattingplace said blair who had read a good deal about prehistoric man a tramp has been sleeping here a tramp repeated the rector of course that was cicero gramp who wrote the letter no doubt i dare say he saw the whole business blair continued his researches and came to a halt at the wall which divided churchyard from pinewood he pointed to a loose stone which had been knocked off did you observe this before sir no replied mr phelps raising his pincenez but thats nothing you see the wall has been put together without mortarsimply stones piled one on top of the other a high wind now i dont think a high wind knocked this stone off you will notice sir that it has fallen on the other side excuse me and blair active as a deer leaped over the wall and disappeared into the pinebelt phelps rubbed his nose not understanding these red indian methods in ten minutes the inspector returned i cant find the trail said he but from the evidence of that wall i suspect the body was carried over it where to mr inspector probably to a cart waiting on the highroad which runs across the moor but of course im in the dark as to that let me see the keyhole of the vaultdoor he went back and had a good look at it there were no scratches to be seen humph said the inspector this was opened quietly enough and by a man who knew what he was about there was no hurry or fumbling in putting in the key ah said the rector looking wise what key not this one no mr phelps i dont suspect you probably the key was that stolen from mr thorolds desk by the quiet gentleman you speak as though you were not quite sure there might have been a third key blair said cautiously if so why should brown have stolen thorolds key thats one of the things i have to find out let us call on mrs marry mrs marry was a voluble buxom woman with rosy cheeks and a great amount of curiosity as to matters which did not concern her but clever as she was it seemed that she had nothing to tell about mr brown with many curtsies and much talk she conducted rector and inspector into a gimcrack parlor full of gaudy furniture berlin wool mats antimacassars and wax flowers when jeremiah died explained the widow with pride i spent the nestegg he left me on that elegant set of chairs and sofa also on the curtains table and glass lusters which are considered very fine it was my intent gentlemen as a lone widder to take in single gentlemen and they likes something to tickle the eye a most inviting room mrs marry said the rector perching himself carefully on a fragile chair all varnish and design but entirely wanting in solidity but mr brown ah sir hes gone where we must all go and mrs marry wiped away an imaginary tear but her remark called forth a question from blair who had been making a close examination of the room how do you know he is dead bless the man wouldnt he be back if he wasnt im sure he was comfortable enough and my cooking is above blame thank heaven if any one mr brown went out at nine oclock said blair cutting her short i wont deceive you mr policeman he did he stayed in most of the day and went out in the afternoon at six he came back for his bit and sup and at nine he went out again to take the air he said so at least and i aint set eyes on him since he said so remarked mr phelps on his fingers of course he was dumb sir but not deaf and he conversed on his fingers wonderful i can talk myself that way said mrs marry gravely having a niece as is deaf and dumb in an asylum i expect it was my knowing the language as brought mr brown here to lodge where did he come from london town he gave me to understand sir but he didnt talk muchon his fingersabout himself he was very quiet ate and drank read books what kind of books novels siryellow novels in a foreign tongue here sir is the rosewood bookcase he also wrote a great deal but what i dont know i thought he had ideas of becoming a writing person himself blair opened the bookcase and one by one examined a dozen or so of french novels ranged on the lower shelf they were all by good authors the usual papercovered cheap editionsnothing strange about them no name was written in any one of them he shut up the bookcase with a look of disappointment was your lodger a frenchman he asked lor sir i dunno he talked english with his fingers ive seen him reading the newspapers he did not look like a foreigner remarked the rector ah i quite forgot you knew the man mr phelps can you describe his looks he was not very tall had long white hair and a beard ruddy cheeks and dark eyes he was usually dressed in a gray suit and walked with a stout stick gout in his feet put in mrs marry not at all pleased at being left out in the cold he wore cloth boots for his goutwalked very badly did mr brown strange murmured blair again looking round the room how could an old man helpless through gout in the feet carry off a dead body humph he carried off no dead body cried mrs marry crimson with wrath if its mr marlows corpse youre talking of i believe mr browns bin murdered like the doctor why do you believe so because ive made up my mind to believe it said mrs marry fiercely and id like to see the man as would change my mind so should i remarked blair well mrs marry show me mr browns room i must examine his luggage theres only one box and thats locked ill take the liberty of opening it but you cant im an honest woman whatll mr brown say when he comes back and finds his things gone besides theres a trifle of rent and hold your tongue said the inspector with a glance which quelled her i will take nothing away you forget who i am mrs marry show me the bedroom and the landlady thinking better of it obeyed without further argument the box was therea common brownpainted travelingbox there was no name on it and it proved to be locked the inspector asked for a chisel and forced it open within he found three suits of gray clothes some linen and socks together with a pair of cloth bootsnothing else no name on the shirts no tailors tag on the clothes evidently nothing of mr browns identity was to be learned from his belongings the man from nowhere said phelps gazing blankly around him but inspector blair was not yet satisfied he searched both sittingroom and bedroom questioned mrs marry looked at some torn pieces of paper in the fireplace andfound nothing rector and inspector walked out of the cottage as wise as when they had entered it so far their search had been a failure all that afternoon blair hunted the village for evidence he heard how warrender had called at mrs marrys house how he had left there to follow the quiet gentleman who had been seen by the peasant going in the direction of the moor blair recalled the loose stone dropped from the churchyard wall and his own theory that the corpse had been taken to a cart on the road he sent out the police and had the heath searched even to the hut where the corpse had been but all with no result and as yet he was ignorant of what cicero knew tired and baffled he returned to heathton to the inn here he found a messenger from mr phelps asking him to call at the rectory he hurried there and was met by alan thorold who presented cicero and mrs warrender then the tramp told the story of all that he had seen blair rubbed his chin can the doctor have helped brown to do it he said half aloud no he did not cried mrs warrender angrily my husband was as good a man as ever lived why should he steal a corpse humph why indeed blair recollected something he had seen in the vault of which he cared not to speak until he could be more certain so he held his peace even if the late lamented dr warrender did violate the sanctity of the tomb said cicero softly who killed the late lamented dr warrender perhaps the shorter man who helped him said the rector that was hold your tongue just now whispered alan for cicero was about to mention joe brills name well come to that later whos that it proved to be mrs marry who came in with part of a torn envelope in her hand on the envelope was an obliterated stamp but the writing had been torn off i found this in mr browns room she said on the floor by the edge of the carpet how it escaped my dusting i dont know blair looked at this piece of evidence jamaica stamp he said strange cried the rector i know marlow was at one time in jamaica and my husband dr warrender came from jamaica said the widow there was silence they looked at one another but no one had any explanation to offer chapter x another disappearance in the course of his investigations mr blair had examined the servants at the moat house from the footman he heard of the west indian letter and of the effect it had produced upon mr marlow search had been made for that letter as likely to throw some light on the mystery but without success evidently mr marlow had thought it important enough to destroy his secret whatever it might have been had gone to the grave with him it was a strange coincidence that the man brown should also have a correspondent in jamaica he it was who had stolen the key of the vault from alans desk again dr warrenderwho as his wife told alan had been in jamaicahad been murdered between these three men thenmarlow brown and warrenderthere was evidently some connectinglink had there not been warrender would not have assisted to remove the body of the millionaire and brown by stealing the key would not have helped him there is no doubt in my mind that brown was the short man seen by gramp blair said to alan and he was followed from mrs marrys by dr warrender who was bound on the same errand you mean the theft of the body i think so brown had the key and gramp saw them remove the corpse he saw warrender corrected alan not brown i judge the other was brown from the theft of the key and the fact that warrender called to see him and then followed again both men have disappearedat least one has the other is dead and who murdered him brown said the inspector with conviction i am sure of it how can you be sure because something unforeseen happenedthe murder probably in the ordinary course of things i take it brown would have come back to fetch his luggage and would have gone away in a manner less likely to arouse suspicion probably he and warrender had a quarrel when they put the corpse in the cart brown killed the doctor and then drove away but blair argued alan you forget that the doctors body was seen in the hut even if brown had dragged it therewhich i admit he might have donei dont see how he could have brought it back again to the vault i do mr thorold it was brown who had the key most likely he put the dead body in a place of safety then came back the following night to hide it away in the safest place he knew ofto wit the vault if you recollect no alarm as to the loss of marlows body was given or was likely to be given warrenders dead body would not have been searched for in the vault it is at least highly improbable that the vault would have been opened that is true assented alan but that cicero by chance saw the affair i dare say we should have remained in ignorance of the business for many a long day no one would have gone to the vault a very clever man this brown very clever but for the accident of cicero having slept in the churchyard he would have got off scotfree as it is i dont see how we can hunt him down his gout his dumbness his white hair and beard may have been assumed the fact of the linen left at mrs marrys being unmarked is proof enough that he was disguised perhaps said alan doubtfully what i cant make out is how he knew i had the key of the vault in my desk did you mention it to any one only to mr phelps where in the churchyard after the funeral we were all round the vault and the service was just over phelps locked the door with his key and asked me where mine was i said in my desk in the library was brown present at the funeral yes i think i caught a glimpse of him was there a crowd round the vault door when it was closed there was but i didnt notice brown on that occasion blair nodded very probably you were too much taken up with the business in hand yet ill swear brown was in the crowd and heard you say where the key was the clever scoundrel made use of the information that same afternoon i believe you are right said alan clenching his fist oh i do wish we could find the villain but what object could he have had in stealing the body i can guess mr marlow was a millionaire well in a small way yes in a way quite big enough to pay a handsome ransom mr thorold the inspector smiled depend upon it we shall hear from this socalled brown he will ask a good few thousands for the return of the corpse oh it is not the first time this game has been played well if brown writes well have him arrested for the murder humph said blair shaking his head that is easier said than done he has been too clever for us so far he may prove too clever in the matter of obtaining the reward of his wickedness well mr thorold the inquest takes place tomorrow but i havent got much evidence for the jury he was right all his talk had been built up upon theory and on the slenderest of circumstantial evidence the fact that brown the mysterious had stolen the keyand even that was not absolutely proveddid not show that he had stolen the body cicero could not swear to his identity and even presuming that he had committed the sacrilege there was no evidence that it was he who had murdered warrender and so the inquest on the body of the illfated doctor was held the theft of the millionaires corpse being merely a sideissue can it be wondered that the jury were puzzled all that could be scraped together by blair was put before them cicero related his midnight experience mrs warrender told how her husband went out to see a patient mrs marry how the doctor called at her house and afterwards followed brown finally alan and his housekeeper gave evidence as to the loss of the key and the forged letter was produced out of this sparse detail little could be made and after some deliberation the jury brought in the only verdict possible under the circumstances the deceased has been murdered by some person or persons unknown most unsatisfactory said blair grimly but there is no more to be said what can you do now asked alan shall you give up the case that depends upon you sir or rather upon miss marlow in what way in the money way mr thorold im a poor man and must attend to my duties all the same if miss marlow will offer a reward i will do my utmost to find out who stole her fathers body and who murdered the doctor why couple the two crimes because sir in my opinion brown committed both give a reward mr thorold and ill do my best otherwise as i have other urgent matters on hand i must drop the business but i dont deny continued the inspector stroking his chin that if i were a moneyed man id work at this business for the sheer love of it it is a kind of criminal mystery which does not happen every day the reward shall be offered said alan miss marlow will be guided by me needless to say sophy was guided by him indeed so eager was she that the remains of her father should be recovered that had not alan suggested it she would have offered a reward herself also she was anxious to assist mrs warrender who in spite of her vulgarity and somewhat covetous disposition was really a wellmeaning woman the result of this was that two rewards were offeredone thousand for the detection of the person who had stolen the body and a like sum for any information likely to lead to the arrest of warrenders murderer so here were two thousand pounds going abegging and hundreds of people hoped to have a chance of gaining the money the case was so strange and mysterious that it had attracted not a little attention and the fact that the missing body was that of a millionaire added to the interest excited by the fact of its disappearance the london papers were full of leaders and letters suggesting solutions of the mystery the provincial press took up the cry and throughout the three kingdoms every one was talking of the case it was even said that miss marlow the present possessor of all this wealth would marry the person who secured the thief and the murderer i wont marry you alan dear until my fathers body is back in the vault said sophy but at the same time i wont marry any one else but suppose i fail to find the body sophy then i must remain a spinster for the rest of my life in that case you condemn me to be a crusty old bachelor never mind we can still be friends and lovers id rather we were man and wife sighed alan but he did not believe that she would cling to this idea of perpetual spinsterhood for any length of time as for miss vicky she thought sophy mad to have thought of such a thing and took her roundly to task a woman ought to marry she said breaking through the barriers of her ordinary primness do you think if my darling had lived i should now be a wretched old maid no indeed it would have been my delight to have been an obedient and loving wife to edward im sure i wish he had lived cried sophy embracing her and i wont have you call yourself crabbed you are the sweetest dearest woman in the world so poor edward thought sighed miss vicky fingering the precious brooch which always decorated some portion of her small person alas the day how often he told me so but he died for his country on the field of glory she cried with a thrill of pride and in spite of my lonely old age i dont grudge his precious blood noblenoble edward and she wept dont cry any more vicky its your obstinacy im crying at sophia if your poor dear pas remains are not found within a certain time marry mr thorold and be happy i canti wont how can i be happy knowing poor father isnt at rest his soul is at restthe earthly tabernacle is nothing come sophia dont break with your lifes happiness alan and i understand one another vicky i dare say we shall marry some day but the body must be found lord grant it ejaculated miss vicky piously and said no more for she found that the more she argued the more obstinate sophy grew amongst those who had hopes of gaining the reward was cicero he had come out of the ordeal of a public examination unscathed and was now in the possession of his wellearned fifty pounds being anxious to remain in heathton for the purpose of prosecuting his inquiries he magnanimously forgave mrs timber and took up his quarters at the good samaritan now that he had money and paid his bill regularly the good lady considered it politic to treat him with more civility although after the manner of women she felt constrained to remind him every now and again of his former poverty but these remarks did not affect mr gramp in the least he regarded her no more than if she had been a fly and sailed about the village in a suit of new broadcloth and the best of tall hats airing his eloquence he became an attraction at the inn and discoursed there every evening in fine style mrs warrender was much averse to his staying on at heathton she lived in constant dread lest the relationship between them should be discovered but cicero never mentioned itnor did he ever mention her still she felt doubtful and one evening on the plea that she wished to hear more of what he knew about her husbands murder she sent for him he arrived to find her in a low evening dress glittering with diamonds and looking very handsomeso handsome indeed that even he could not refrain from giving vent to his admiration upon my word you are a juno clara maria he said when they were alone there is money in you yet i know what you mean billy replied the doctors widow coldly but im not going on the stage again in burlesque or anything else how are you going to live he asked with brutal candor thats my business retorted mrs warrender i have enough to live on even without selling my jewels perhaps i shall marry again im sure you will clara maria you always were a determined woman hold your tongue and tell me how much longer do you intend to disgrace me here how can i tell you if i am to hold my tongue said cicero coolly as to staying here im not disgracing you that i know of no one knows you are my ungrateful sister billy if i wasnt a lady id ungrateful indeed you brute go away at once no clara maria not till i find out who killed my brotherinlaw i never knew him said cicero wiping away a tear but as his nearest relative i must avenge him that wont do billy said his sister sourly you only want the reward both rewards clara maria with two thousand pounds i could be a gentleman for the rest of my life that you will never be i would do nothing you never have you lazy vagabond dont interrupt and insult me clara maria but work with me work with you gasped mrs warrender at what at this case clara maria i believe that the secret of this mystery is to be found in the island of jamaicain the past life of mr marlow now your husband knew the late lamented millionaire in jamaica and he might have left some papers relative to the acquaintance if so let me see them and ill get on the track of the assassin we will share the reward my husband did leave papers mrs warrender said thoughtfully but i wont show them to you billy youd take all the money no ill read his papers myself and if i can find anything likely to reveal the name of the person who stole the body and murdered julian i shall tell mr thorold you wont get the reward cried cicero in an agony oh yes i will im as clever as you are billy thank you for the idea you wont work with me no said she firmly i wont i know you of old and i want you to keep out of my way leave this village and ill give you twenty pounds what when there is a chance to make two thousand no clara maria then earn the reward yourself theres joe brill he might tell you what you want to know mocked mrs warrender my husband said he was with marlow for thirty years i wish i could ask joe brill said cicero gloomily ever since he tipped me the sovereign i have suspected joe brill but hes gone gone gone where i dont know i only heard the news tonight hes gone away without a word and vanished and cicero groaned chapter xi the stranger that joe brill had disappeared from heathton was perfectly true so far cicero was correct but in stating that the man had vanished without a sign he was wrong newsto be precise gossiptravels more quickly in a village than in a town it also gets more quickly distorted for the intimacy of villagers is such that they are readier than less acquainted folk to take away from or add to any talk about those whose everyday life they know so well joe brill had left a letter for sophy who in much alarm consulted miss parsh the consultation was overheard by the footman who told the servants without mentioning the letter about which he was not very clear himself having caught only scraps of the conversation the kitchen discussed the news and retailed it to the baker who with the assistance of his wife a noted gossip spread it broadcast over the village thus in the evening it came to ciceros greedy ears and so it was that he came to tell his sister that joe brill had disappeared without a sign sophy knew better isnt it dreadful she said to miss vicky joe is very cruel to leave me like this in my trouble he knows that i look upon him as one of my best friends to be thirty years with father and then to leave me oh dear vicky what does it mean for answer miss vicky read the letter aloud it was badly written and badly spelt but it was short and to the point amended it ran as follows honored miss i am called away on business which may turn out well for you when ill come back miss i dont know but wait in hope stand by and nail your colors to the mast dont trust no one but mr thorold your prayers honored miss are requested for your humble servant joseph brill most extraordinary said miss vicky and laid down the letter to gaze blankly at sophy i shall go mad with all this worry cried the poor girl taking the letter oh dear vicky everything has gone wrong since father died hush dont talk of it sophia your pas remains have gone but his soul is above dr warrender has been buried and the verdict of twelve intelligent men has been given we must think no more of these matters but josephs letter is more of a mystery than all the rest put together finished sophy just listen to the nonsense joe writes im called away on business what business vickyand how can it turn out well for me he doesnt know when hell come back that means he wont come back at all wait in hope hope of what for goodness sake vicky and alanof course ill trust no one but alan how absurd to put that in then he finishes by asking my prayers just as though he were going to die vicky is joe mad no joseph is too clearheaded a man to lose his wits its my opinion sophia that hes gone to search for your poor papas remains this was alans opinion also when he read the letter and heard of joes disappearance he questioned the servants but they could give no details the page who slept in the same room declared that he woke at six oclock to find joes bed empty but this did not alarm him as joe was always the first in the house to be up so alan went to the railwaystation and learnt there that the old sailor carrying some things tied up in a handkerchief had taken the train to the junction a wire to the junction stationmaster who knew joe elicited the reply that he had gone on to london by the express beyond this it was hopeless to attempt to trace him for at waterloo station joe had vanished into the crowd and was lost alan told the lamenting sophy that nothing could now be done but wait for his return but will he return demanded the girl tearfully i think so i agree with miss vicky joe has gone to search for your fathers body but he has no idea where it is if he did he would surely have told me or you alan knowing how anxious we are he may have a clue and may want to follow it up himself and i believe sophy that joe knows more about the matter than we think do you remember that he gave cicero a sovereign to leave the moat house what of that only that a sovereign was a large sum for a servant like joe to give he thought no doubt that cicero knew too much and he wanted to get him away before he could be questioned it was his guilty conscience which made him so generous guilty conscience alan what had joe done nothing so far as i know replied thorold readily but i am convinced there is something in your fathers past life sophy which would account for the violation of the vault joe knows it but for some reason he wont tell i questioned him about the ridiculous sum he gave to cicero but i could get no satisfactory explanation out of himnor could blair you dont think he was the short man with dr warrender on that night alan asked the girl somewhat tremulously no i do not i asked the boy who sleeps in the same room he said that joe went to bed as usual and that he never heard him go out besides sophy i am certain the accomplice of warrender was brown the quiet gentleman yes he had the key of the vault and also by the evidence of the stamp he had something to do with jamaica perhaps he knew your father there perhaps he did joe would know joe will not speak and at all events he has gone we must wait until he comes back are you not going to make any more search for the body alan my dearest i have not the slightest idea where to begin the case has baffled the police and it baffles me i have made inquiries all round the country and i can find no one who saw brown with your fathers dead body or indeed anything else which might have aroused suspicion there is only one hope that we may get it back the reward no although blair and i believe cicero intend to work for that the hope lies in the chance that brown whoever he is may have taken away the body for blackmail in that case we may get a letter demanding moneyprobably a large sum we must pay it and have your fathers remains brought back and the murder alan ah that is a difficult part when brown stole the body he did not intend to commit murder that came about in some unforeseen way the danger that he may be arrested for the murder may keep brown from applying for blackmail always supposing sophy that such is his object in that case we may never recover poor father i am afraid not however we must live in hope this conversation ended in the usual unsatisfactory way on the face of it there was nothing to be done for alan could obtain no clue brown if brown were indeed the guilty person had managed so cleverly that he had completely cut his trail even the offer of the reward brought forth no fresh information the mystery was more a mystery than ever in his capacity of trustee alan had looked through the papers of the dead man he found no documents or letters whatever relating to his life in jamaica yet there were plenty dealing with his doings in south africa twenty years before he had left kingston with the child sophy he brought her to england and placed her in the hampstead convent then he sailed for the cape and had made his fortune there fifteen years after he returned to buy the moat house and settled sophy came to live with him and he had passed a quiet peaceful time until his sudden death so far all was clear but the jamaica life still remained a mystery when he died he was over sixty what had he done with himself during the forty years he had lived in the west indies joe could have told but joe as mysterious as his master had disappeared and even if he had remained alan could have got nothing out of him the old sailor as had been proved both by thorold and the inspector was as dumb as an oyster did marlow ever mention jamaica alan asked mr phelps when next they met once or twice in a casual sort of way he said he had sailed a good deal amongst the islands and joe was a sailor i wonder if marlow went in for trading there its not impossible said the rector but that fact even if we knew it to be true could throw no light on the disappearance of his body i dont know i have a good mind to go to jamaicato kingstonto make inquiries the west indian island area is not so very large if marlow had been a trader there twenty years ago he would still be remembered amongst them i might come across some one who knew of his past life you might assented phelps with an amount of sarcasm surprising in so mild a man if marlow were his real name the two were sitting over their wine in the twilight amid the glimmer of shaded candles this last remark of the rectors so surprised alan that he turned suddenly and knocked his glass off the table after he had apologized for the accident and after the dbris had been collected by the scandalized butler the squire asked mr phelps what he meant it is hard to say what i mean the rector sipped his port meditatively marlow was always a mystery to me undeniably a millionaire and a gentleman alan and while here a man of clean life and i have met people in londonthe worthy parson dabbled a little in shareswho knew him in south africa he was highly respected there and he made his millions honestly so far as millions can be made honestly in these gambling days but i always felt that there was some mystery about the man it was warrender who gave me the clue ah warrender came with marlow to heathton yes but there was no mystery about that warrender told me that he had met marlow at kingston jamaica afterwards the doctor settled in new orleans there he met his wife who was on the stage he did not do very well so mrs warrender urged him to return to england he did so and met marlow by chance in london where they renewed their acquaintance sorry to see that warrender was so unfortunate marlow brought him down here where he did very well i dont think he did well enough to have supplied mrs warrender with her diamonds sir alan dont speak evil of the dead she did not get the diamonds from marlow but legitimately my dear boy from her husband and where did he get them his practice must have brought him in little enough no i wont say that the fact i think is that there was some understanding between the two men and that marlow gave warrender money he must have given him a good deal then those jewels represent a lot seems like a kind of blackmail sir on that point alan i would prefer not to give an opinion and warrender helped to steal the body of his patron mused alan strange but about this idea of a false name well it was at dinner one evening the ladies had retired and i was alone with marlow and warrender talking over our wine just as you and i might be now alan the doctor had taken a little too much and on one occasion he addressed the other man as beauchamp marlow flashed one fierce glance at him which sobered him at once i made no remark on the incident at the time but it stuck in my memory then you think that mr marlow was called beauchamp in jamaica warrenders slip gave me that impression said the rector cautiously how very strange murmured alan toying with his glass do you know the will of course i am trustee sophys trusteewhy yes all the money goes to her doesnt it most of it there are legacies to myself joe brill and miss parsh sophy gets the rest on conditions what conditions one is that she marries me the other that she pays two thousand a year to a man called herbert beauchamp it was the rectors turn to be startled bless me the same name it would appear so perhaps this herbert beauchamp is a relative of the socalled marlow the money is to be paid into the occidental bank of london for transmission to him where is he i dont know but now that you have told me so much i shall take the first instalment myself to the occidental bank and make inquiries about the man the manager may be able in some measure to account for all this i hope so i hope so cried the bewildered rector for the mysteries seem to me to deepen meanwhile went on alan calmly i shall see mrs warrender she may know something that will be useful to us i dont think so the rector said doubtfully bless me why should she it was long afterwards that she met the doctor in new orleans well he might have told her about marlow at all events ill see her you know added alan curling his lip mrs warrender is fond of money and amenable to bribery thorold was usually correct in his forecasts of what would happen but this time he was quite wrong the widow received him kindly and told him absolutely nothing acting on the advice given her by cicero she had been searching through the papers of her late husband she had not found what she sought but she had found quite enough to show that there was a mystery in mr marlows past lifea mystery which was sufficiently important to be worth money it was the intention of this astute woman to play her own game a game which had for stake a goodly portion of sophys millions and she had no desire for a partner to cicero and to his wish to join her she soon gave the goby and when alan came upon the scene she gave him to understand that she knew nothing her intention was to prepare her bombshell alone and when it was ready to explode it in sophys presence that her knowledge would be profitable to her from a financial point of view she felt pretty secure for the same blood ran in the veins of clara maria warrender and of cicero gramp i wish i could help you mr thorold she said but i knew nothing of mr marlow my husband never spoke to me about his life in jamaica did he leave any papers lots of rubbish but nothing that could enlighten us as to mr marlows past can i see them oh i am so sorry but i burnt them he did not believe her and went away with the conviction that she was playing a deep game meanwhile a new personage had come upon the scenea man who told an astonishing story and who made a no less astonishing claima slight dark brighteyed man accurately dressed but foreign looking he presented his card at the moat house with a request to see miss marlow captain lestrange exclaimed sophy who is he thomas looks like a foreigner miss shall i show him in yes she said and the visitor was announced almost immediately he started theatrically when he saw the girl sophy annoyed by his manner drew back captain lestrange she queried coldly captain lestrange was the reply and your father chapter xii a strange story sophy neither screamed nor fainted at this extraordinary announcement indeed it appeared to her so very ridiculous that she felt more inclined to laugh however she controlled her feelings and spoke very quietlyso quietly that the visitor was somewhat disconcerted why do you make this strange assertion she asked looking again at his card because it is true what proof can you give me of its truth three proofs sophy if i may call you may not interrupted the girl flushing i am miss marlow for the present assented the man with an ironical smile soon you will be miss lestrange three proofs then i have firstly i can tell you the story of how i lost you secondly there is the resemblance between us and thirdly i have the certificate of your birth oh it is easily proved i can assure you she shivered he spoke very positively what if his claim could be substantiated she looked at him she glanced into a near mirror and she saw with dismay that there was a strong resemblance like herself lestrange as he called himself was slight in build small in stature he also had dark hair and brilliant eyes the contour of his face the chiseling of his features resembled her own finally he had that spanish look which she knew she herself possessed so far as outward appearances went she might well have been the daughter of this rakishlooking stranger he smiled from her furtive glance into the mirror he guessed her thoughts you see the glass proclaims the truth said he think of your supposed father richard marlowtall fair blueeyed saxon in looks like myself you have the spanish look and possess all the grace and color of andalusia i always thought you would grow up beautiful your dear mother was the loveliest woman in jamaica she did not answer but the color ebbed from her cheeks the courage from her heart it was true enough that she in no way resembled mr marlow this man might be her father after all yet he repelled her the glance of his glittering eyes gave her a feeling of repulsion he was a bad man of that she felt certain but her father she fought against her doubts and with a courage born of despair she prepared to defend herself until help arrived her thoughts flew to alan he was the champion she desired i expect my guardian mr thorold in a quarter of an hour she said in a hard voice you will be good enough to relate your story to him i prefer to hear it when he is present you dont believe me no i do not mr marlow treated me as his daughter and i feel myself to be his daughter do you expect me to believe you to rush into your arms without proof i have shown you one proof a chance resemblance counts for nothing what about the certificate he produced a pocketbook and took out a piece of paper this is a copy of the entry in the register of the church of st thomas at kingston you will find it all correct marie marie what do you mean that paper will inform you said lestrange coolly sophy read the certificate truly it seemed regular enough it stated that on the th of june was born at kingston in the island of jamaica marie annette celestine lestrange the names of the parents were achille lestrange and zelia his wife sophy could not suppress a start the th of june was her birthday the date of the year was also correct she was twentyone years of age now she turned to him you are achille lestrange your fatheryes i dont admit that monsieur why do you call me monsieur you are french are you not french by descent if you will but i am a british subject also i am a roman catholic you are of the same faith yes i am of the true faith i am glad of that said lestrange indolently he was as indolent as graceful and reminded sophy of a fullfed tiger i am pleased to hear that marlow allowed you to retain your faith since he took from you your father and your name do you know that my father is dead pardon me he is alive and sitting before you sophy ignored his remark do you know that mr marlow is dead she asked again ah now you speak as you should yes i heard something about his death the fact is i have only just landed from a royal mail steamer at southamptontwo days ago in factso i know very little but i have heard of the disappearance of his body it is town talk in london one cannot open a newspaper without coming across theories of how it happened and the murder of dr warrender do you know of that also of course the two things go together as i understand marlows body is lost warrender was stabbed how unfortunate that two people i knew should be out of the way when i come to claim you did you know dr warrender asked sophy quickly as i know myself was the answer twenty years ago when you were a child a mere infant he practised in the town of falmouth jamaica he left after certain events which happened there and i believe practised again in new orleans he married there too it was said yes his wife lives at heathton ah i shall be glad to see her has the man who murdered her husband been discovered no he cannot be found nor ever will be i suspect said captain lestrange coolly from what i read the whole criminal business was conducted in the most skilful manner i wonder why they stole poor dicks body poor dick retorted the girl indignantly are you speaking of my father of the man who passed as your fatheryes marie i am pray dont call me marie i am sophia marlow as you please temper again oh how you remind me of zelia she was confounded at the cool assurance of the man nothing seemed to ruffle his temper or banish his eternal smile he was more hateful to her than ever never would she acknowledge herself his daughter even should he prove his claim she was of age and her own mistress the will of richard marlow left the money not to my daughter but to sophia marlow so there was no possibility of the money being taken from her then she thought of alan he would stand between her and this man and even as this thought came into her mind the door opened and thorold came forward eagerly to meet her but on perceiving the stranger he stopped short lestrange rose and bowed in a foreign fashion oh alan cried sophy i am so glad you have come i was waiting for you and i also remarked lestrange who is this gentleman sophy demanded alan he calls himself captain lestrange here is his card captain in the army of the peruvian republic said the man and this young ladys father confound youwhatwhat oh yes alan he says he is my fatherthat my true father stole me from him here is the certificate of my birth he says and herelestrange pointed to sophyhere is my second self can you deny the resemblance by the way who are you the inquiry was made with graceful insolence and was meant to provoke the young man into losing his temper but in this it failed i am alan thorold he said quietly the squire of heathton and i am engaged to marry miss marlow pardonmademoiselle lestrange interpolated the captain and resumed his seat i claim this young lady as my daughter good said thorold coldly your proofs the resemblance between us the certificate of her birth and the story of how i lost my dear marie twenty years ago the resemblance i admit but that goes for nothing as to the certificate it is that of marie lestrange and not of sophy marlow is not the birthday of miss marlow as you will call her on the th of june yes said sophy before alan could stop her the day and the year are both correct i am twentyone and i was born on the th of june very good and at kingston at kingston admitted the girl but for all that i am not your daughter i agree with miss marlow said mr thorold let us hear your story that it will convince me i do not promise ah cried the foreigner with an ironical smile none so blind as those who wont see what a pity that marlow and warrender are both dead oh you know that as i had the honor of telling miss marlowlestrange put so sneering an accent on the name that alan felt inclined to kick himi know that i landed in england from jamaica only two days ago but as you know every one is talking of the mystery and by this time i know the case as well as you do alan winced and sophy glanced at him apprehensively would her champion fail her would this man prove his claim she was in deadly terror lest he should but alan had no intention of yielding go on he said again miss marlow and i will hear your story very good i am glad to see that you have the british instinct of fair play i will be as brief as possible and you can ask me any questions you wish my name is achille lestrange the man who is mentioned in that certificate i amor rather i wasa captain in the peruvian army i retired after the war between that country and chili however i have ample means to live on and i retain my military rank out of sheer vanity if you will all this said alan is beside the point it is necessary to explain my position more than twenty years ago i was married at kingston to zelia durand we had one childa little girlthe same who now sits beside you i wont hear of it cried sophy angrily we shall see he went on cheerfully you may change your mind when i have got to the end of my story i regret to say that mrs lestrangei do not call her madame explained the captain because i am truly english in speech and mannerwell mrs lestrange had a bad temper we did not get on well together and besides i was jealoushis eyes flashed fireyes i was jealous of herbert beauchamp herbert beauchamp alan thought of marlows will and of the legacy how did this man come to know the name chapter xiii a strange storycontinued captain lestrange recovered from his momentary emotion and raised his eyebrows at alans involuntary exclamation i beg your pardon mr thorold nothing said the other hastily i fancied the name was familiar ah you may have heard marlow mention it no he never spoke of his past life he had good reason to be reticent as you shall hear but here sophy burst out be good enough to continue your story without vilifying my father your father sneered the captain the storythe story cried alan i continue said lestrange with a nod as i say i was jealous of beauchamp for before our marriage he had been an admirer of my zelias and as a matter of fact she was a singularly attractive woman you might guess as much added he blandly seeing that her grace and beauty are reproduced in her daughter but to continue zelia had many admirers three of whom she distinguished above the othersmyself herbert beauchamp and my cousin jean lestrange i was the lucky man who won her jean ceased to pay any attention to her after the marriage but beauchamp was persistent i remonstrated with himwe nearly had a duelbut to no purpose and i am sorry to say that zelia encouraged him proceed with your story and leave my mother alone cried sophy alan started for he remembered with a pang that sophy had told him her mothers name was zelia but he kept silent and a terrible dread came over him that this man would prove his statements after all meanwhile the narrator went on pleasantly beauchamp he said fingering his mustache was a sugarplanterat least he was supposed to be one he had a plantation some miles from the town of falmouth which is on the other side of jamaica it was there that dr warrender practised he was a bachelor in those days and he was considered rather a wild fellow probably for that reason he was a bosom friend of beauchamps do you mean to infer that beauchamp was wild well not exactly i must be honest he was adventuresome rather than wild he was fond of yachting and had a smart sailing boat in which he used to cruise amongst the islands warrender frequently went with him beauchamp was a very handsome man and extremely popular with women i know that to my cost he added bitterly when he set his affections on zelia she was my wifeshe was the mother of my childyet she eloped with him iidont believe it said sophy in a suffocating voice if it were not true my child you would not be sitting there under the false name of sophia marlow one moment put in alan clasping the girls hand you have yet to prove that miss marlow is marie lestrange if you would not interrupt so often i could do so said the man insolently as i say zelia ran away with beauchamp he brought his yacht to kingston when i was absent and sailed off with her she carried with her my childmy adorable marie here lestrange fixed an affectionate look on sophy i returned to find my home dishonored he went on my life wrecked jean came to console me he also had heard of beauchamps treachery and that the boat had sailed for falmouth we followed here lestrange broke down whether his emotion was genuine or not alan could not say he looked at sophy and she at him having fought down his emotion the captain resumed his seat and his story jean and i arrived at falmouth there we heard that zelia was very ill and that beauchamp had taken her to his plantation dr warrender our informant said was in attendance the whole town knew that she was my wife that she had dishonored me and that i was on my may to settle accounts with the man who had wrecked my happiness my cousin and i rode out to beauchamps plantation for it was within a few miles of falmouth as i said the night was dark and stormywe arrived in pouring rain and by the wailing of the negroes we knew that death was in the house yeshe grew dramaticzelia was dead torture remorse sorrow had brought about her punishment you are very ready to condemn her said alan she had dishonored me cried the man waxing melodramatic it was well that she should die i rushed away to her room where she lay calm in death and jean remained to arrange matters with beauchamp i challenged him to a duel jean was my second but beauchamp refused to fight andhe murdered jean murdered your cousin queried alan skeptically yes i was praying beside my wifes bed i heard cries for help and when i came out i found jean dead stabbed to the heart by beauchamp the scoundrel had fledhe had taken my child with him why should he have encumbered himself with the child to wring my heart replied lestrange savagely he knew that i loved my little marie he carried her away i would have followed but all my troubles and the shock of zelias death brought on an attack of fever i rose from my bed weeks later to hear that beauchamp had vanished on the night he committed the double crimes of murder and kidnapping he went on board his yacht at falmouth and was never heard of again i searched for him everywhere but without success what about his estate asked alan there he has been cunning it seemed that he had long since planned to elope with zelia and that some weeks before he had sold his land he took the money with him and the child had zelia been alive she would have gone too as months and years went by i gave up hope and i believed that the yacht had foundered suddenly sophy got up much agitated i can listen to this no longer she said you are telling lies her mothers temper muttered lestrange zelias masterly way of crushing argument dont call her my mother cried sophy i wont have it i am not the child that was taken away by beauchamp i never knew any one of that name probably not replied lestrange smoothly there were reasons for its being kept from you but mr thorold mr thorold is waiting to hear the end of the story said that gentleman coolly i have yet to hear who beauchamp is and how you traced him this is mere evasion the captain was losing his temper somewhat you know who the man is as well as i do i am waiting to hear how you connect the two what two asked miss marlow but in her own heart she knew the answer yet like a loyal soul she kept true to the memory of the dead lestrange took no notice of her you are either very dull or very cunning he said addressing alan pointedly the latter i think how did i find beauchamp again in a curious way i saw an illustrated paper in jamaica which gave a portrait of the famous south african millionaire richard marlow the face had on its right cheek a jagged scar jean gave that scar to beauchamp with his diamond ring no doubt it was the drawing of blood which led to the murder then you assert that marlow was none other than herbert beauchamp i do also that sophia marlow is my child whom he carried away i have mourned her for twenty years by the accident of the illustrated paper i have traced her at southampton i heard of marlows death so i knew that he had escaped punishment on earth but at least i have found my dear child marie i am not your child she cried i will never acknowledge you as my father in that caselestrange rose to his feet and looked very sterni must appeal to the law alan laughed the law cant help you he said sophy is over age and her own mistress even if you can prove your case you cannot force her to go with you natural affection dont talk to me about natural affection cried the girl i know nothing about you nothing in the world will make me go with you but if i tell my story to the world cried lestrange hinting a threat tell it by all means said thorold putting his arm round sophy you can hurt only the memory of the dead even if marlow as you assert killed your cousin he is dead and beyond your reach are you so sure he is dead sneered the man of course we are sure cried sophy indignantly didnt i see him dead in his coffin well said lestrange preparing to go it is most extraordinary to me that he should have died so suddenly and so conveniently his body too has been stolen that also is convenient do you mean that he is alive yes he feigned death to escape me how could he have known that you were coming i dont know was the answer but i shall find out it shall be my business to search for the body of richard marlow do said thorold calmly and when you find it you will gain the reward of a thousand pounds i shall gain more than that mr thorold my daughter never never leave this house sir and dont come near me again the man moved towards the door he had picked up the certificate and put it in his pocket you turn your own father out into the street he said very good i shall take my own means of punishing you for your want of filial respect it is to the bad influence of mr thorold that i owe this reception be assured mr thorold that i shall not forget it to revert to the tongue of my progenitors i shall say au revoir but not adieu we shall meet again and clapping on his hat with a jaunty air captain lestrange walked out of the room when the door had closed after him sophy turned to alan do you think this story is true she asked i must admit that there appears to be some truth in it was the reply the certificate is correct as to your age your birthday and your birthplace and the name of your mother also is correct then am i that mans daughter not necessarily he may have assumed the name he mayoh i dont know what to think but even if he proves his case you wont go with him never never how can we find out the truth joe might know i wish he would come back i wonder if after all your father can be alivemarlow i mean how can that be we both saw him dead dr warrender gave a certificate of the death why do you ask well it is strange in his will a sum of two thousand a year is left to be paid to a man called herbert beauchamp through the occidental bank and he says that my father was herbert beauchamp i know can your father have feigned death to avoid him impossible he did not know captain lestrange was coming well said alan slowly there was that west indian letter which agitated him so much it might have been a warning however it is no use theorizing ill go to the occidental bank and find out herbert beauchamp you wont find that he is my own father alan i am sure of that he may be a relative no no he is not a murderer he is deadquite dead i dont believe a word of the story alan sighed time alone can prove its truth or falsehood sophy he said chapter xiv the enmity of captain lestrange that same evening the rector was coming in to dine with alan the young man was glad that he had asked him for he was anxious to consult his old friend about the strange tale he had heard and about the steps which should be taken to prove its truth or falsity he stayed with sophy till it was nearly six oclock miss parsh had not been called into counsel she was too timid they thought and too likely to lose her head moreover alan felt that she would give the girl overmuch sympathy and make her nervous so he did all the bracing he could advised her not to take the old lady into her confidence and rode home to the abbey farm in the cool twilight as he passed the good samaritan mrs timber came flying out in a flutter of excitement sir sir mr thorold she called and then as he checked his horse is the gentleman all right hes a furriner and i never did hold as they could pay honest what are you talking about mrs timber asked the young man utterly bewildered why of the gentleman you sent to me sir i sent no gentleman stay do you mean captain lestrange yes sir thats his namea nasty french name he said you recommended my house im sure im very much obliged mr thorold here mrs timber dropped her best curtsy and smiled a sour smile but i arsk again sir is he good pay alan was amazed at the captains impudence in making him stand sponsor for his respectability i dont know anything about the gentleman mrs timber he said giving his horse the spur he is a stranger to me oh is he muttered the landlady to herself as alan galloped off well he dont get nothing out of me till i sees the color of his money the idea of giving mr thorolds name when he had no right to ah i doubt hes a robber of the widder and the orphan but ill show him and mrs timber full of wrath went into her hotel to have it out with her new lodger alan rode fast and hard in the waning light between the flowering hedgerowsrode to get away from his thoughts the advent of lestrange with his cutanddried story with his accusation of the dead and his claim to be sophys father was ominous of evil alan had his own uncomfortable feelings but of these he decided to tell no one not even phelps although phelps was his very good friend in taking this resolution alan made a very serious mistakea mistake which he found out when it was too late to remedy his injudicious silence he had just time to dress for dinner before his guest arrived knowing that mr phelps was dainty in his eating mrs hester had prepared a meal such as the good rector loved alans wine was of the best and he did not stint it so mr phelps addressed himself to the solemn business of dinner with the conviction that he would enjoy himself and alan kept his news to himself until they were in the smokingroom then when his guest was sipping aromatic black coffee and inhaling the fragrance of an excellent cigar the young squire felt compelled to speak and exploded his bombshell without further notice mr phelps i have unpleasant news he said filling his pipe the clergyman looked piteously at the excellent cigar and took another sip of the coffee oh alan my boy must you you can judge for yourself replied alan unable to suppress a smile sophy had a visitor today indeed any one connected with these mysteries which so perplex us in one way yes in another no he is a captain lestrange lestrange lestrange repeated the rector i dont know the name who is he sophys father said alan simply and lighted up while mr phelps remonstrated my dear alan if this is a jest it is no jest sir but i fear a grim reality this man comes from jamaica dear me marlow came from jamaica does he know he knows all marlows past life the devahem god forgive me for swearing and who was marlow according to lestrange a murderer phelps dropped his cigar and stared at his old pupil alan are you mad no at the present moment i am particularly sane this man says that marlow was a murderer and he himself claims to be sophys father take some green chartreuse mr phelps and ill tell you all about it the rectors nerves had received such a shock at the abrupt way in which alan had told his news that he very willingly poured himself out a liqueur then he relighted his cigar and signed to the young man to proceed if i must hear it sighed he such a pity too when i was so comfortable ah man is born to trouble go on my dear lad you will find it really interesting said thorold encouragingly and told his story in as concise a way as he could the narrative was interrupted frequently by the rector when it was ended he was too much astonished to make any remark and the other had to stir up his intelligence what do you think of it sir reallybless mei hardly know do you believe it alan there are so many things in it which i know to be true that i cant help thinking the man is honest in so far as his story goes said alan gloomily whether sophy is really his child i cant say she is certainly very like him and the certificate appears to be genuine again mr phelps you heard warrender call marlow beauchamp and as i told you a sum of two thousand a year is by marlows will to be paid to a herbert beauchamp what if he should be marlow himself i canti wont believe it cried the rector rubbing his bald head the man is as dead as a doornailyou saw the corpse yourself alan the body was put in a leaden casing hermetically sealed and that in a tightlyscreweddown oaken coffin even if marlow had been in a tranceif that is what you meanhe could not have survived that he would have died of suffocationhe would have been asphyxiated bless my soul i dont believe it for one moment but how do you account for the income left to herbert beauchamp he must be a relative said the rector but the same christian name mr phelps still of course that is not impossiblehe might be a relative i will see the manager of the bank and insist upon knowing the address of this man supposing he wont give it then i shall call in the police i must get to the bottom of this affair why should that body have been stolen perhaps lestrange can tell you alan the little parson jumped up in a state of wild excitement what if he should be the quiet gentlemanbrown impossiblehe landed at southampton only two days ago oh so he says but you must find out if it is true i will examine the passengerlist of the last steamer it is strange said the rectorstrange that marlowlet us call him marlowshould have died so opportunely if you remember he was much worried by a west indian letter he received a week before his death yes i believe that was written to warn him against lestrange to escape being arrested on a charge of murder hehewell what did he do he didnt feign death at all events said mr phelps bless me alan i know the feel and the look of a corpse ive seen dozens besides you studied for medicineyour knowledge must tell you yes i could have sworn he was as you say dead as a doornail of coursealan cast about in his mind for some hypothesisthat isthe shock of impending danger hinted at in that letter might have killed him he died in a fit sir and died very suddenly humph you didnt attend him ia layman my dear sir warrender attended him and warrender was his bosom friend in jamaica alan warrender must have recognized him as beauchampmust have known sophy was not his daughtermust have known that he had been accused of murder in jamaica quite so said alan composedly and so mrs warrenders diamonds are accounted for he blackmailed marlow i can see it plainly then the murder ofof warrender whispered the rector with a look of terror ah we are still in the dark about that marlow being dead could not have killed him humph i wonder if lestrange is the quiet gentleman after all alan said phelps suddenly joe brill what about him do you think he is guilty he was devoted to his master warrender possessed his masters secret and joe might have killed him and have run away to escape arrest alan shook his head there was no suspicion against joe he said why should he have run away his guilty conscience perhaps a man who had nerve enough to commit such a murder and take the corpse of his victim back to the vault wouldnt have any conscience to speak of besides the boy who slept in joes room says he was not out on that night no noof course not said the rector then it cant be joe well i give it up i dont said alan grimly i go to london tomorrow to solve the mystery this he did he left next morning and was away for three days leaving mr phelps to console and protect sophy from any annoyance on the part of lestrange who remained in the village the captain propitiated mrs timber by the payment of a weeks board and lodging in advance and this was enough to convince the landlady that he was a most estimable person naturally enough he and cicero gramp came into contact and equally naturally cicero did his best to find out what business the captain had in heathton but this was no easy task for lestrange was guarded in speech and did not at first encourage his advances judging very truly that mr gramp was a scoundrel and could be dangerous but finally he decided that the gentleman in broadcloth if properly handled could be converted into a useful tool and he determined to make use of him in that capacity the intimacy began one night when cicero having taken more than was good for him allowed his tongue to wag more freely than usual lestrange thus became aware that it could dispense useful knowledge i tell you what it is my noble captain said cicero with drunken gravity you are a clever mani am another why shouldnt we get that reward by working together really my friend i hardly see what i can do i am a stranger here thats why we ought to work together you are not in these parts for nothing the gossip of servantsah gramp looked significantly at lestrange oh i heard how you were turned out of the moat house what do you mean my dear friend asked the captain in silky tones oh that youve got some game onso have i let us work together pooh pooh you are talking nonsense nonsense which may mean money see here i know that you were kicked out of the moat house ah the gossip of menials pardon me but i was not kicked out you were young thorold did it he wants all the money and hell get it by marrying that girlif i let him if you let him what do you mean mean why that i hate young thorold and that i want a few thousands oh and how do you intend to get them never you mind if we work togetherbut then we dont cedant arma togwhich means youre a soldier im a lawyerso thats all right goonight and he staggered off leaving lestrange with much food for meditation the outcome of this was that next morning the captain met cicero halfway and later in the day sophy received a note from lestrange asking to see her if she would not consent he added mr thorold would be placed in a position of great danger after some reflection sophy sent for mr phelps and they decided to see the scamp so on a saturday morning captain lestrange was received in the library of the rectory well sir said phelps and what have you to say about mr thorold only this was the reply that he is a scoundrel indeed the rector stopped sophys exclamations on what grounds on the grounds that it was he who stole the body of richard marlow chapter xv trouble the rector and sophy looked at one another and then at lestrange smiling and confident they knew alan too well to credit so monstrous an accusation for one moment indeed the idea appeared so ridiculous to sophy that she laughed outright lestrange frowned you laugh now he said you will weep later what i say is true thorold stole the body of your fatheryour supposed father he sneered for say what you like you are my child i dont acknowledge the relationship retorted the girl with spirit and i never will mr marlow was my father i shall always think of him as such as to your accusation of mr thorold it is merely another trick to cause me trouble i suppose you will say next that he murdered dr warrender i say nothing of the sort replied the captain nettled by her open contempt yet he may have done so for all i know but i state only what i can prove you cannot prove this ridiculous charge cried the rector mr thorold is incapable of such a crime ah drawled the other coolly you see mr thorold is scientific and does not look upon his deed as a crime what do you mean by that asked mr phelps sharply i mean that mr thorold was once a medical studentat least i have been told as much it is true quite true said sophy opening her eyes for in her innocence she did not see what the man meant but the rector did and winced he anticipated the accuser you mean that mr thorold stole the body for scientific purposes for dissectionyes mr thorold is i understand an enthusiast in surgery marlowor rather i should say beauchampdied of an obscure disease and warrender and thorold removed the body to hold a postmortem on it they were the men seen by cicero grampyou see i know all about it they probably carried the body to the moor hut to dissect it whether they quarreled or not i do not know nor do i know if it was thorold who killed the doctor all i say is that those two stole the body oh indeed remarked mr phelps ironically and thorold put the remains of dr warrender back in the vault i suppose and what did he do with marlows body i dont know buried it on the moor very likely mr thorold had not the key of the vault cried sophy indignantly it had been stolen by the quiet gentleman so i understand retorted lestrange sharply and who says so mr thorold himself believe me sir he turned to the rector that key was never stolen thorold had it in his pocket he lied about that for his own safety i dont believe it said mr phelps decisively thorold was at bournemouth on the night the crime was committed i know he was cried sophy with emphasis he was with me and miss parsh you are wrong both of you he came back to heathton on that night and returned to bournemouth before dawn i understand it is only an hours journey from here it is not true insisted sophy uneasily i saw mr thorold at eight oclock that night at the soudan hotel i dare say but at ten oclock he was at heathton how can you prove that if you will permit me said lestrange and rising he left the room before mr phelps and sophy could exchange a remark he was back again with a man who had evidently been waiting jarks cried the rector much annoyed and what has jarks to do with this preposterous story if you ask him he will tell you said lestrange politely and resumed his seat the rector looked indignantly at his sexton who as minor official in the church should have quailed before his superior but there was no quailing or cringing about jarks the old fellow was as malicious as a magpie and as garrulous looking more rusty than ever he stood twisting his greasy old hat and shifting from one leg to the other oh i seed muster alan yes i seed un on the night o the funeral i were in the yard a lookin at em as id tucked away an i clapped eyes on muster alan he wor lookin at the vault where id put away the last of em he wor about what time was that asked mr phelps with severity well it might be about ten muster phelps sir and what were you doing out of bed at that hour lookin at em retorted jarks wiping his mouth lor bless you muster phelps all in the yards mown handiwork save some of the old uns i like to see em all quiet an humble in their narrow homes ay an i seed muster alan an he sez ive come to look round jarks an you neednt say as ive bin about heres money for ye ay he did say that an guv me money course i said nothin as there isnt no law agin folk walkin round to see how them as has passed away is gettin along how long was mr thorold with you it might be about five minutes sir he went to ketch a train at the halfhour to go back to miss sophyhopin i sees you well miss with a pull of his forelock to the girl who was standing pale and trembling at this disastrous confirmation why didnt you tell me this jarks lor bless you miss sophy twas little use vexin you sides when i found muster marlow was gone arter bein put away comfortablelike in the vault i did say to muster alan arterwards as it wasnt friendlylike of him to upset my handiwork but muster alan he says as he had nowt to do with the takin of him an how he got out of the vault being screwed and soldered down was more than he knew so he being the squire miss sophy it wasnt my place to say nothin i knows the station of life ive bin called to it was your duty to come to me said the rector severely naw naw jarks shook his head taint no good makin bad blood muster phelps muster alan wor in the yard but he didnt take the last of em away i say he did put in lestrange with emphasis ay ay you thinks you knows a lot but i tell you you dont if it wasnt that i let slip to that fat un while mazed wi drink as i seed muster alan youd niver have knowd naught naw but when the wines in jarks he talks foolishlike ay he babbles as a babe does jarks who is this fat man he speaks of asked sophy my other witness replied lestrange promptly you can go jarks send in cicero the sexton nodded wiped his mouth and backed to the door with a final excuse as i wor sayin muster phelps twouldnt be right to blame jarks for holdin the tongue o he muster alan wantin it so but the red winewhich is to say beer an such likemaketh the heart of jarks glad as sez holy scripture an ill go now wishin you an miss sophy happiness an long life after which apologetic speech the old sinner creaked out of the room pulling his forelock you see said lestrange with a triumphant look at the other two thorold was in heathton and in the churchyard on that night it would seem so but that does not prove he took away the body put in sophy my second witness can prove that come in cicero the fat man resplendent in new clothes rolled into the room pax vobiscum said he the rector turned an angry glance on him this is not the time for playing the fool he said cuttingly you are a cunning rogue but some day you will overreach yourself now then out with your lie lie i scorn to pervert the truth reverend sir i shall tell the truth in puris naturalibus i hope not threw in the rector laughing in spite of himself at this abuse of quotation which means reverend sir went on the old scoundrel coolly that in the hut on the heath i found the corpse of dr warrender but not the body of my father said sophy no but i saw that taken away from the vault undoubtedly miss marlow the body was carried to the hut for the purpose of dissection by mr thorold he was foolish enough to leave behind him evidence of his iniquitous purposes behold and cicero produced a lancet in his most dramatic manner nota bene said he grandly phelps bent forward and took the instrument in his hand it had an ivory handle on which were carved two letters a t you found this in the hut he asked i did reverend sir it must have been dropped by mr thorold if not how did it come there i pause for a reply why did you not tell mr thorold about this demanded sophy i bided my time to blackmail him she cried with scorn a harsh word miss sophia certainly i would have demanded a small payment from mr thorold had i shown him that but mr thorold insulted me it matters not how nemo me impune lacessit miss sophia and i determined to punish the young man my military friend was good enough to enter into partnership with me for the purpose of clearing up this matter hence i told him of my discovery there is no more to be said save this put in lestrange who appeared to be getting somewhat weary of ciceros cumbersome diction that here is the proof that it was thorold who carried off the body do you believe now in his guilt i reserve my opinion said the rector who could not but acknowledge to himself that things looked black for alan i dont cried sophy rising if fifty men with fifty lancets came to tell me this story i would not believe a word against mr thorold he can explain i believe in him firmly and to prove my belief i shall marry him as soon as i can youll do nothing of the sort cried lestrange losing his temper i am your father and i command you to come with me and i am my own mistress and i refuse she said quietly you cant frighten me i dont believe your stories nor do i said the rector when mr thorold comes back he will no doubt be able to explain his presence in heathton on that night and also the loss of his lancet he shall explain it to the police cried lestrange in a threatening manner no no said cicero apprehensive at this mention of his natural enemies let us take counsel together cannot this matter be adjusted so that mr thorold may escape the reward of his iniquitous proceedings sophy looked at him with a satirical smile then she turned to address lestrange as the senior partner in this firm of scoundrels how much do you want she asked the captain winced he did not like the question to be put quite so crudely i do not understand he said i think you do how much do you require to hold your tongue say five thousand whispered mr gramp but lestrange shook him off and marched to the door very upright and indignant i will let you know my price ah said sophy scornfully when i have seen the police finished he and marched out cicero had to follow but he turned at the door and winked he will not go to the police said he in a hurried voice might i suggest five be off you scoundrel cried the rector indignantly and thrust him out then he resumed his seat and looked at sophy well said he alan can explain said she decisively but if lestrange goes to the police he wont she said cicero will stop that meanwhile i wait for alan they talked on for a long time but could come to no conclusion undoubtedly alan had been near the vault on that night had been in the hut and had said nothing of these things to any one it certainly looked suspicious but sophy insisted that her lover could and would explain in spite of appearances she had faith in alans honesty and in alans honor that same evening she dined with the rector without even miss vicky in attendance towards the end of the meal alan walked in unexpectedly he looked somewhat downcast but there was no sign of fear in his bearing after greetings had been exchanged he sat down with them neither the rector nor sophy was anxious to inform him of the accusation which had been brought against him how went the business asked mr phelps badlyfor us was the reply lestrange certainly arrived by the boat he said he came by i saw his name achille lestrange on the passengerlist of the negress ah the devil speaks true sometimes said the rector and what about beauchamp yes yes cried sophy did you find him did you see him no replied alan quietly but i heard of him beauchamp is dead chapter xvi alans defense dead repeated sophy after a pause then was this mr beauchamp really my father or a relative i think he was mr marlow dear said her lover gravely no doubt your father intended to feign death to escape lestrange but it would seem that he overdid it and really died i saw the manager of the occidental bank he informed me that he had received a letter telling him that beauchamp was dead how long ago was this a little over a week who wrote the letter that he refused to tell me had he seen this mr beauchamp to whom the money was to be paid never your father had informed him that he had left an income to beauchamp and that drafts for the money were to be sent to a certain placewhere i dont know the manager sent a draft but it was returned to him with a letter stating that the man was dead for my own part i believe that mr marlow was beauchamp his plan to hide himself from lestrange has succeeded only too well mr phelps now joined in then i understand alan that you think marlow is really dead i do if he had only feigned death then beauchamp would be receiving his income in my opinion the two men are one and the same i believe lestranges story so far humph said the rector who was really of the same opinion but let us leave this question for the moment and talk of the other you say that lestrange arrived on the day and by the boat he asserted that he did i saw the passengerlist myself if he had not been on board his name would not have been there even he could not falsify a passengerlist then our idea that lestrange was the quiet gentleman is false it must be sir the manlestrange i meanwas not in england when the quiet gentleman lived in this village i believe brown had to do with the stealing of the body and the murder but then brown is not lestrange who he is i dont know alan cried sophyfor if what lestrange stated was true this hypocrisy was detestableyou are not straightforward with me indeed i am he said with a stare of astonishment i have told you of my discoveries why should i deceive you why indeed said the girl bitterly you know how much i love you yet you keep me in the dark about matters which concern us bothmatters which i if any one have a right to know he might have had some inkling of what she meant for his face turned a dark red nevertheless he held himself well in hand and looked inquiringly at the rector what does she mean sir i think you can guess said phelps more coldly than he had ever before spoken to alan no upon my word i sophy rose from her chair and closed his mouth with her hand dont dont she cried despairingly i cant bear it captain lestrange she hesitated ah said alan fiercely i might have guessed he had been making mischief well and what does he say that you stole my fathers body alan iistole the body yes chimed in the rector and he further says that you took it to the hut on the heath where warrenders corpse was found oh indeed cried the young man derisively and did i murder warrender too alan alan oh dont jest if you love me alan tell me the truth sophy what do you mean he pushed away his plate and rose do you believe this mans tale for one moment am i the man to violate a graveto drag the remains of a man i respected and honored to the light of day you must be mad to think of such a thing how dare he bring forward such a terriblesuch a dastardly accusation for what reason does he say that i did it out of revenge i expect said phelps he dislikes you alan he says you took poor marlows body to dissect it and bases his lie upon some gossip of my having been a medical student i suppose cried the young man now thoroughly angry ill thrash the scoundrel within an inch of his life oh alan i am so gladso thankful i said so didnt i mr phelps you didnt do it do itof course i didnt do it why should i phelpsalan forgot his respect for the rector in his ragedo you believe this lying story knowing you as i do i dont believe it but i must say that lestrangehe is a very dangerous manmakes out a strong case against you oh let me hear on what grounds alan sophy came forward and took him by the lapels of his coat before we tell you anything confess if you have kept anything from us he looked at her in a puzzled manner then a light seemed to dawn upon him he glanced at the rector now i understand mr phelps jarks has told you told me what asked the rector with wellfeigned ignorance i see i see alan sat down again its all right sophy i kept that from you only that you should not be worried so lestrange found outfrom jarks i supposethat i was at heathton on the night of the funeral yes yes oh alan is it true trueof course it is why should it not be true does the fact of my having been here corroborate this cockandbull story you ought to know me better sophy and you too phelps i couldnt believe iti didnt cried the girl nor i we both told him that he lied but i must admit that things looked bad for you as he put it why didnt you tell us you were at heathton on that night why did you come was there any serious reason for such secrecy no reason whatsoever replied the young man frankly save the trifling one that i did not want to bother sophy with my suspicions yes i came by the train from bournemouth and i returned at halfpast eleven i had to go to another station to keep my secret you know jarks saw me in the graveyard about ten and as i wished to keep my visit quiet for the reason i have told you i gave him something to hold his tongue it appears that he did not i suppose lestrange bribed him well no said the rector not exactly jarks in his cups told that scoundrel gramp and he told lestrange oh so there are two of them in league to make trouble a proper pair of scoundrels but said sophy more composedly you have not told us why you came i came said her lover determined now to make a clean breast of it to look at the vaultto see that all was safe the rector uttered an exclamation of astonishment did you expect then that there would be some foul play well i hardly know sir it was this way after mr marlow received that letter from the west indieswhich doubtless warned him that lestrange was on his trackhe was much worried he would not tell me the reason but kept speaking of some shock he had had which might cause his death and i dont know if the scoundrel will let my body rest in its grave he said in a fit of passion i asked to whom he alluded but he would say no more when he died so unexpectedly his words came back to me i wondered if he had enemies who might disturb his remains and all that day after the funeral i felt so bothered about it that i could not rest without coming back to see if all was well and you found nothing wrong nothing sir i was in the churchyard for about a quarter of an hour i examined the door of the vault and saw everything was right as i came away i met jarks the rest you know you saw no signs of that tramp in the churchyard none i expect he was sleeping when i was there according to his story it was after midnight when the vault was opened alan said sophy much relieved how is it they did not know at heathton station that you were here i did not go to heathton station i stopped at murbury and walked from there across the heath i went back the same way i did so simply to keep the tongues of gossips quiet i did not want you to be worried sophy and after all he said after a pause beyond the chance words of your father i had no reason to think that anything was wrong ah if i had only stayed in the churchyard all night i should have prevented this trouble the vault would never have been broken into and poor warrender would still be alive the rector nodded approval of this speech and poured himself out a glass of wine which poor man he sadly needed lestranges accusation had been disproved still there remained the evidence of cicero sophy put the question which was in the rectors mind captain lestrange brought cicero here alan she said abruptly and hecicero i meandeclared that you were in the hut on the moor that night i was not cried young thorold hotly i was never near the hut why should i have been ask yourself as i had to walk to and from murbury and spend a quarter of an hour in the churchyard had i time to cross the moor all the distance to the hut of course you know i dont believe it but cicero well and how can he prove i was there he said impatiently he found something there which belonged to you what a lancet a lancet and why mine warrender was a doctor he took away the bodywhy should the lancet not belong to him if he had intended to dissect the bodywhich he might have for all i knowhe would want one no doubt mr phelps said dryly but this lancet had your initials on the ivory handle it is your lancet alan and it is now in ciceros possession hm thats queer initialsyes it might be mine but how did it get there did you ever lend a lancet to dr warrender no not that i can remember then there was the other man his accomplice brown the ha cried alan starting up and pacing the room i see i see see what cried sophy eagerly how the lancet came to be found in the hut the quiet gentleman stole it stole it of course did he not steal the key of the vault from my desk there was a case of lancets in the same drawer he took one ha this proves to me that brown stole the body and murdered warrender a clever scoundrel he stole my lancet to throw suspicion on me alan clenched his hands and looked upward in gods name what does this roguery mean it was indeed a perplexing case they were all in the dark and such gleams of light as came served only to confuse them the more lestrange could not be the quiet gentleman for as had been proved by alan he had landed in england only the week before brown was the deus ex machina who could put matters right and brown had vanished he could reappear only at the risk of being charged with murder why had the body been removed if it were a case of blackmailing the claim would have been made long since the police were apparently as much at a loss as alan himself and blair does blair know of this accusation asked mr thorold suddenly i am certain he does not answered the rector emphatically in the first place it was only made today lestrange i am sure wants money and would come to us before going to the police if he does not want money cicero does put in sophy scornfully in the second place resumed mr phelps blair is away where has he gone i cant say but he will be back in a fortnight well said alan moodily i dont know if he will be much good when he does come i shall see this firm of scoundrels at the good samaritan and threaten them with the police unless they tell all they know lestrange is as bad as cicero and i know him to be a scoundrel whats that this exclamation was drawn from him by the violent ringing of the doorbell before the sounds had ceased miss vicky red hot and agitated rushed in a most unladylike manner into the room oh sophy mr phelps mr alan i really never joseph brilloh that joseph brill hes back again chapter xvii joes evidence for a moment the three gazed in silence and amazement at the old maid she stood before them all tousled and red with haste a figure of fun she would not have recognized for herself her buckram demeanor had for once given way to the real woman alan was the first to speak and he jumped up from the table with a shout of joy from an unexpected quarter in the most unexpected manner help had come and at the moment when it was most needed joe brill cried mr thorold he is the very man i want where is he miss vicky at the moat house i went to the kitchen for a moment he was therehe had just come in i thought he was a ghost declared the little lady solemnly indeed i did until he convinced me that he was flesh and blood what explanation did he make asked sophy anxiously noneto me he said he was ready to explain his absence to mr thorold did he then he shall have the chance go back to the moat house miss parsh and send on joe to the good samaritan why there of all places asked the rector because i am going to see lestrange and force the truth out of him there shall be an end to all this devilment he accuses me does he cried thorold with an ugly look let him have a care lest i accuse him and prove my accusation too with the help of joe brill joseph cried miss parsh quite at sea what can he do he can prove if lestranges story is true or false story mr alan what story never mind vicky put in sophy catching miss parshs arm she saw that alan was growing impatient come back home and we will send joe on to the inn come you look quite upset and i am upset wailed the poor woman i ran all the way to tell you that joseph had returnedlike a thief in the night she added oh dear me and im so hot and untidy i dont like these dreadful things miss vicky suddenly caught sight of herself in an adjacent mirror and made a hasty attempt to arrange her disordered dress oh what a spectacle for a genteel gentlewoman to present a glass of wine mr phelps i beg of you the rector poured out the wine in silence then turned to alan shall i come with you no sir joe and i are quite able to deal with this brace of blackguards remember that lestrange is a dangerous man alan so am i retorted the other grimly if i happen to find a whip handy i dont know what i might be tempted to do but if joe declares that lestrange is sophys father he is not my father cried sophy his story is a lie i am the daughter of richard marlow sophia this manyour father wailed miss vicky oh dear what is all this ill tell you when we get home said the girl alan i will send joe to the inn at once and she led the weeping vicky from the room let me come alan you will want a witness joe will be witness enough said the young man decisively no sir better let me see him alone there may be rough work your cloth deuce take my cloth cried the rector bless me may i be forgiven my cloth might keep the peace i dont want the peace kept retorted thorold unless that creole frenchman apologizes ill thrash him the rector stared and well he might all the wellbred composure had gone from alans face and manner the veneer of civilization was stripped off and man primeval man showed naked and unashamed he stared back at the clergyman and for quite a minute the two looked at one another then the younger man turned and left the room and mr phelps made no attempt to stay him he knew that he might as well have tried to chain a whirlwind he bowed to circumstances and sat down again to his wine i hope to heaven hell keep himself in hand he muttered without his usual selfapology for swearing lestrange is dangerous but alan in his present mood is more so i should not care to be the man to meet him with that look on his face dear dear the little man sighed i wish all these mysteries were over and done with and we could resume the quiet tenor of our way meantime alan was making for the inn it was just on nine oclock and the night had turned out wet as he had no overcoat the rain was soaking him but he did not care for that his blood was on fire to meet this man and force the truth out of him he was certain that lestrange could explain much if he chose and whether he chose or not alan intended that he should speak out he was determined that an end should be put to these troubles the rain whipped his face and drenched him but he walked on steadily there was no gas in heathton which was so far uncivilized and the roads were dark and miry not until he got into the principal street did he leave the mud and the darkness behind him then before him glimmered the feeble lantern over the door with which mrs timber illuminated the entrance to her premises alan could hear the drowsy voices of the villagers sitting over their ale in the taproomheard above the rest the pompous speech of cicero who was evidently playing his favorite part of sir oracle in the hall mr thorold was found by the landlady the woman pervaded the house like a fly and was always to be discovered where she was least expected she recognized alan curtsied and awaited instructions take me he said abruptly to captain lestrange lor sir mrs timber in her amazement overstepped the bounds of class you said he was no friend of yours sir nor is he come show me his room he is in i suppose catch him wetting himself she said leading the way with a sour smile hes a furrin jackodandy that he is not but what he dont pay reglar but i see the color of his money afore my meat goes down his throat this is the door sir very good and mrs timber should joe brill come show him in here joe brill yelped the landlady throwing up her hands you dont mean to say as hes back mr alan well i never did and i thought hed run away because of the murder you think too much mrs timber some day you will get yourself into trouble now go and dont forget my orders chilled by the severity of his tone mrs timber crept away somewhat ashamed alan knocked at the door heard the thin voice of lestrange call out entrez and went in the man was lying on the sofa reading a french novel by the light of a petroleum lamp and smoking a cigarette when alan appeared he rose quickly into a sitting position and stared at his visitor of all men the last he had expected to see was the one he had so basely accused the thought flashed into his mind that thorold had come to have it out with him but lestrange whatever his faults was not wanting in a certain viperish courage he rose to greet his enemy with a smile which cloaked many things goodevening mr thorold he said with a wary glance to what am i indebted for this visit you shall know that before long replied alan closing the door he was now considerably cooler and had made up his mind that more was to be got out of this man by diplomacy than by blind rage have i your permission to sit down he asked with studied politeness certainly my dear sir will you smoke no thank you have some refreshment then no thank you ah sneered lestrange throwing himself again on the couch your visit is not so amiable as i fancied you come as my enemy considering your behavior it would be strange if i came as anything else my behavior i refer to your interview with mr phelps and miss marlow mademoiselle lestrange if you please ah that is for you to prove i shall prove it said the other quite unmoved in open court that will be a harder task than you imagine retorted alan quickly but i am not here to discuss miss marlows parentage my errand is to ask you why you have accused me of taking away the body of her father richard marlow was not her father replied the man with heat so you saywe can pass that point as i told you before i speak of the charge you have thought fit to bring against me it is a true one i am willing to take it into court you may be brought into court sooner than you expect remarked alan dryly and from the sudden start the man gave he saw that the shot had gone home on what grounds do you base this charge if mr phelps reported the interview correctly you must know said he sullenly to save time retorted alan i may as well admit that i do know jarks and cicero speak the truth lestrange looked surprised then you admit your guilt no that is quite another thing i admit that i was in heathton on that night when jarks saw me what i came for does not concern you captain lestrange but i can prove also that i was back in bournemouth before twelve oclock you will observe that i can establish an alibi upon my word i really believed you guilty cried the captain with sincerity no doubt was the scornful reply the wish is father to the thought i will thank you not to accuse me falsely again you have to explain away the finding of the lancet that was stolen from my desk with the key of the vault by a man called brown whom i believe to have been guilty of a crime you need not try to fasten the guilt upon me i can defend myselfto use your favorite phrasein open court if necessary your word is enough protested lestrange i was wrong to accuse you very wrong you did it out of spite no no i really believed what you wished yourself to believe interrupted alan in his turn it was my intention to have given you a thrashing captain lestrange sir the man started up white with rage but i have changed my mind pursued alan without noticing the interruption i now intend to take another course if you do not at once leave heathton i shall bring a charge against you of defamation of character oh lestrange shrugged his shoulders you are a true english shopkeeper a man should protect himself by more honorable means i know very well what i am about sir i wish to bring you into contact with the law for that reasonunless you goi shall bring the action and what can the law do to me he asked defiantly i have committed no wrong you intend to oh i know that you are innocent of taking marlows body and of murdering warrender but you are here to blackmail miss marlow on the threat of proclaiming her dead father a murderer i am here to claim my daughter shouted lestrange fiercely sophia marlow i know nothing of but marie lestrange is the daughter of achille lestrange and ithe captain struck his breasti am he while he was still posing in a very effective attitude the door opened and mrs timber ushered in joe brill hardly had it closed when brill took a step forward staring at lestrange as though he had seen a vision lestrange turned white this time not with rage but with fear in the silence which ensued alan looked from one to the other wondering what revelation was about to be made joe was the first to speak you swab cried joe dd if it aint captain jean chapter xviii a portion of the truth joe was not in the least changed wherever he had been in whatever nefarious transactions he had been engaged he was still the mahoganycolored tough old sailor whom nothing could surprise or alarm after having greeted lestrange he hitched up his trousers in true nautical style and touched his forehead you wished to see me sir he said to alan and took a sidelong glance at the captain that polished scoundrel had for once lost his coolness and colorless with rage was glaring at the seaman like a devil joe said the squire as soon as he could take in the situation you are making a mistake not me sir i knows a shark when i sees one but this is captain achille lestrange curse me if he is cried joe vigorously achille werent no captain this ones a captain right enough and a blazing fine lobster he is jeans his name sir but he aint a scotch girl for all that no its the french lingo for john i am achille lestrange persisted the captain very shrill and very short of breath this man is a liar say that again and ill knock the teeth down your throat growled joe like an angry mastiff achille be blowed i knowd you twenty year ago in the islands i did and a bad lot you were then jean lestrangewhy there never was a wuss lot i never did think much of achille for all his money but you joe spat to show his disgust then this man is not sophys father gasped alan oh he sez that does he the lubber missys father why he aint fit to be her shoeblack achille was the girls father said lestrange sullenly he saw that it was useless to lie in face of joes positive knowledge and if im not her father im her uncle thats a dd lie put in joe you werent no more nor achilles cousin what you are to missy i dont know but she wont have nothing to do with you you landshark joe do you mean to say your late master is not sophys father i do sir its got to come out somehow if only to put a stop to that devils pranks shes the daughter of achille lestrange who was murdered by marlow finished the captain savagely ah my friends i have still some cards left youll have no teeth left growled joe making a step forward youre a liar captain jeanyou always was mr marlow beauchamp corrected lestrange with a glance at alan beauchamp it is continued brill coolly oh you neednt be afeared that im going to lie but mr beauchamp never stabbed munseer achille and you know it you lubber let me get at him mr thorold no no joe alan kept the irate seaman back well deal with this gentleman in a better fashion sit down joe while we talk it over joe nodded and sat down on a chair which he placed directly before the door with a glare that showed he noticed and resented this action lestrange resumed his seat he was too clever a man not to recognize that joes cunning would dislocate his plans but he was evidently determined to fight to the last at present he held his tongue for he wanted to hear what joe would say he preferred for the moment to remain strictly on the defensive it was with a thankful heart that alan thorold realized the value of joe as an ally at one time he had really believed that lestrange was truly sophys father and although she would never have admitted the relationship still it was satisfactory to know that the man had no claim on her obedience the knowledge of lestranges falsehood cleared the air somewhat for one thing it proved conclusively that the captain had come to blackmail the girl his claim to be her father was doubtless made in the hope that she would accompany him back to jamaica and would give him control of her money failing thisand lestrange had long since realized that there was no doing anything with sophy in a paternal waythere remained the chance that to preserve marlows memory from stain she might buy his silence thus lestrange argued and alan with his eyes on the mans expressive face guessed his thoughts and answered them no lestrange he said with decision you wont get one penny we shall see about that was the rejoinder of course we are going to see about it now you will be brought to your bearings sir joe you say that this man is jean lestrange yes sir but may i ask mr thorold how you know about the shark i have heard the story from his own lips joe he claimed to be achille lestrange and miss sophys father did he now the swab and you know sir how mrs lestrange ran away to mr beauchamp from the way her husband treated her i know achille treated zelia well interrupted the captain only too well thats another lie retorted joe he was fondlike of her the first year they were married but it was you captain jean who made a mess of them you made him jealous of mr beauchamp and he treated her crool no wonder she ran away poor lass did the way achille treated zelia give beauchamp any right to murder him he didnt murder him you know he didnt he did i say achille was found stabbed to the heart on the veranda of beauchamps house zelia was dead and your master took the child away to his yacht at falmouth you were on board yes said joe coolly i wos and it wos well for you captain jean that i wasnt near the house that same evening id ha wrung your neck i would anyhow master didnt kill munseer achille there was a warrant out for his arrest however i know that captain jean and it was you who got it out and i know as you came over here after master from seeing his picter in the papers we both knowed you were coming captain jean alan interposed was that the west indian letter joe yes sir it was master got a letter from a friend of his in jamaica telling him this swab was after him to say as hed murdered munseer achille which added joe deliberately eyeing lestrange is a dd lie then who killed achille sneered the captain quivering with rage i dunno rightly replied mr brill stolidly i wasnt in the house that night or id ha found out but master ran away because he knew youd accuse him out of spite but mr barkham of falmouth believed master was innocent and knowd where he was and what was his new name twas he wrote the letter saying as captain jean was on his way to england to make trouble barkham muttered lestrange ah he was always my enemy a shark like you captain jean aint got no friends remarked joe sententiously do you think that barkhams letter caused mr marlows death asked alan do i think it sir why i knows it after twenty years of hearing nothing the shock as you might say killed my master then he was guilty and my accusation was a righteous one to make chimed in lestrange a clean conscience fears nothing mr beauchamps conscience was a darned sight cleaner nor yourn captain jean but you had the whiphand of him as all those in jamaica thought hed murdered munseer achille from them quarreling about him coming after his wife but master didnt do iti swear he didnt more like you did it yourself added joe with a look of contempt though i dare say you aint man enough to stick a knife into any one alan thought for a few minutes then turned to lestrange i think you must see that you have failed all round he said quietly your plot to pass as miss marlows father is of no use now the accusation against me is not worth considering as i have shown if necessary i can defend myself on the whole captain lestrange you had better go back to jamaica not without my price said the adventurer ah blackmail well i always thought that was at the bottom of it all a man with clean hands and honorable intentions would not have joined hands with a confessed rogue like cicero gramp but may i ask on what grounds you demand money i can prove that beauchamp killed my cousin what good will that do beauchamp is dead and beyond your malice ay that he is said joe approvingly hes gone where you wont get him i reckon youll go the other way when your time comes you blasted swab lestrange writhing under these insults jumped up and poured out a volley of abuse which the seaman bore quite unmoved ill not go without my money he raged and a good sum too otherwise i shall see the girl if you annoy miss marlow again ill have you arrested said alan sharply we dont permit this sort of thing in england i shall put the story of beauchamps wickedness in all the papers as you please it cannot harm the dead and will that girl stand by and see her fathers memory disgraced you seem to forget said thorold with quiet irony that he was not miss marlows father well there is no more to be said if you make yourself a nuisance the law shall deal with you and ill deal with him myself said joe ill make them eyes of yours blacker than they are by nature leave him alone joe hell go now i wont go cried the man ill have my price alan shrugged his shoulders i shall have to give you that thrashing after all let me do it sir put in mr brill who was simply spoiling for a row and he stepped towards lestrange the mans courage genuine enough of its kind suddenly gave way before the ferocity of the sailor he sprang up ran into an inner room and bolted the door joe uttered the roar of a baffled tiger never mind joe were quit of him now he will leave heathton ill wait for him at the station muttered joe following the young squire out of doors taint right that the swab should get off scotfree outside the rain had ceased alan looked at his watch and finding that it was late turned his face towards home suddenly he recollected that joe had not explained his absence well joe where have you been he asked sharply after him joe pointed his thumb over his shoulder when masters body was carried away i thought that shark might have done it i knowd he was coming from jamaica so i went to southampton to see when he arrived you did not see him no was the gloomy reply but i seed the list of passengers in one of them boats and his name wos on it he couldnt have done it i found that out myself no lestrange is innocent if id knowd he wos on his way here to make trouble with missy id have waited said the sailor but i thought if i dropped across him id keep him off he stole a march on you joe and you have been at southampton all this time i have sirthere and in london but its all right now mr alan he wont worry miss sophy any more but now you know sir why i gave a sov to that tramp he talked about one as sent him and i thought he wos talking of captain jean so i hurried him away as soon as i could lest miss sophy should hear i understand joe but cicero knew nothing at that time ah joe clenched his fist hes another as needs a beating beg pardon sir but i suppose you aint found out who killed the doctor no i believe myself it was that man brown who was called the quiet gentleman do you know who he was joe no sir i do not replied joe doggedly goodnight mr alan and he walked off in great haste the young squire pursued his way to the abbey farm and all the way wondered if joes sudden departure hinted at an unwillingness to talk of brown ill ask him about the man tomorrow muttered alan but on the morrow he had other matters to attend to while he was at breakfast a card was brought to him and he jumped up with a joyful cry inspector blair he said throwing down the card show him up mrs hester ah i wonder what he has found out chapter xix a reappearance i am glad to see you blair sit down and have some breakfast aha the inspector rubbed his hands as he looked at the wellspread table i never say no to a good offer thank you mr thorold i will peck a bit you are looking well blair never felt better in my life mr thorold i have good cause to look jolly enjoyed your holiday no doubt said alan as he assisted the officer liberally to ham and eggs where did you spend it in brightonpleasant place brighton blair looked so jocular and chuckled in so pleasant a manner that the squire guessed he had good news however he resolved to let blair tell his story in his own way what took you to brighton of all places he asked tentatively well you might guess joe brill took me joe brill the inspector nodded i followed him there but i have seen joe he tells me he was at southampton and in london no doubta clever fellow joe he knows how to hold his tongue well mr thorold i hope your troubles about this matter of the lost body will soon be at an end blair alan bent forward in a state of great excitement you have found out something about it yes enough to gain me a thousand pounds not enough to gain you two thousand pounds no blairs face fell but i intend to get that also however i have learned all about the theft of mr marlows bodyhow it was removed and why it was removed by jove how did you find out through joe brill somehow i suspected joe from the first that sovereign he gave cicero gramp you knowi always fancied there was something behind his anxiety to get that man away so i had him watched and applied for leave of absence when he left heathton i followed as a tourist chuckled blair oh i assure you mr thorold i make a very good tourist and he went to brighton yes direct to brighton i went there and found out all about it you dont mean to say that he stole the body ay but i do and with the best intentions too was he the short man cicero gramp saw with warrender he was the short man replied blair finishing his coffee then why did he not tell me alan burst out angrily i saw him last night yet he said nothing he knew how anxious miss marlow is about the loss of her fathers body not her father corrected the inspector achille lestrange was her father what alan started from his seat you know that i know allthe elopement in jamaica the kidnapping of marie lestrange whom we know as sophy marlow the coming of jean lestrange to blackmail the girl andandall the rest of it you see mr thorold i interviewed joe brill this morning and he told me all about your conversation with that rascal i am posted up to date sir joe brill had no business to keep me in the dark said the squire angrily he should have relieved my mind and miss marlows miss lestrange hinted blair no sirsophia marlow she is and sophia marlow she will remain until she changes her name for mine her father is dead and jean lestrange has no claim on her sophia marlow mr inspector if you please well wellas you please we shant quarrel about a name have you anything to smoke mr thorold alan got him an excellent cigar and returned to the point why did joe keep me and miss marlow in the dark he asked acted under orders mr thorold whose orders mr marlows or rather i should say mr beauchamps blair alan gasped out the name his face was white and he was appalled at the news for the moment he believed the inspector must have taken leave of his senses oh i dare say your astonishment is natural said the inspector lighting his cigar i was astonished myself to find the dead man alive and kicking yet i should not have been for i suspected the truth alan had not yet recovered from his amazement you suspected that mr marlow was alive he said faintly on what evidence on circumstantial evidence said blair smartly when i examined the coffin with mr phelps i noticed what he did not at the sides small holes were bored in inconspicuous places and the shell of the leaden case was pierced only one inference could be drawn from thisthat the man had designedly been buried alive the design must have been carried out by warrender and the short man i suspected joe from the fact of his having given that sovereign to cicero and i watched him presuming my belief to be correct i made certain that sooner or later he would rejoin his master as i say he went to brighton i followed close on his heels to a boardinghouse in lansdowne place there i saw mr marlow did he recognize you of course while he was living at heathton i had seen mr marlow several times on business he made no attempt when i saw him at brighton to disguise himselfnot thinking i suppose that his clever scheme to frustrate lestrange would come to light in this way but blair you did not know about lestrange then true enough but i soon heard the whole story mr marlow told it to me himself as you may guess he was in a great way about my having discovered him and seeing no means of evading the truth he told it i insisted upon it in fact and now i know all and how did it come about blair held up his hand no mr thorold said he i shall leave mr marlowi think we had better continue to call him soto tell his own history he can do it better than i besides added the inspector rising briskly i have business to do what sort of business you can judge for yourself i want you to come with me wherewhat to do to see mrs warrender you see it was her husband who carried out this scheme of feigned death to deceive lestrange marlow accused of having murdered achille in jamaica was afraid that this captain jean would have him arrested now warrender was in beauchamps house at falmouth jamaica when mrs lestrange died and he knew all about it it is my belief added the inspector slowly that beauchamp is innocent as he asserts himself to be and that warrender knew as much but my dear blair protested alan in that case warrender could have told marlow the truth and could have stopped jean lestrange from making mischief i dare say he could but he did not warrender my dear mr thorold was a blackmailing scoundrel who assumed the mask of friendship to bamboozle marlow i had considerable difficulty in impressing this view on marlow for strange to say he believed in the doctor joe did not however and joe told me a few facts about warrenders practice in jamaica which showed me that the doctor was not the disinterested person he pretended to be no i am sure warrender knew beauchamp to be innocent and kept the fact quiet so as to retain a hold on the man and get money out of him now do you understand why i want to see his widow no replied alan not following the inspectors hypothesis i do not if warrender kept the truth from marlow he would most certainly have kept it from his wife the woman would have babbled even against her own interests as women always do mrs warrender can tell you nothingi feel sure of that you forget that the doctor may have left a confession of his knowledge would he have done that said alan doubtfully it would have been a foolish thing and when do criminals do other than foolish things was blairs response the murderer usually returns to the scene of his crimeas often as not sets out its details in writing it is impossible to account for the actions of human beings mr thorold it would not surprise me in the least to hear that warrender had written out the whole story in a diary if so his wife must have found it amongst his papers and she will be disposed to sell itat a long price if she had found such a document she would have shown it to me or to sophy before now by no means if she knew that marlow were alive then of course she would realize that the document was valuable but she believes him to be dead humph said alan you seem very certain that such a document exists perhaps i am too sanguine admitted blair but mr marlow gave me a full account of what happened on the night achille was murdered moreover he swore that he was innocent and i believe him as to warrender he was a scoundrel and i am sure that like all scoundrels he has left a record of his villainies in black and white if this is so i can prove marlows innocence and he can defy lestrange by this time alan and the inspector were walking along the road which led to heathton it was a bright sunny morning and alan was in high spirits how happy blairs news would make sophy and warrender what about his death he asked does marlow know who killed him strange as it may seem he does not mr thorold he is as ignorant as you or i that death is a mystery still but if warrender was killed on the heath i cant explain mr thorold hear marlows story and you will be as much in the dark as i am but i suspect lestrange so did i replied alan speaking in the past tense but i learned for certain that lestrange was not in england on the night of the murder i proved that too said blair thoughtfully yet i cant help thinking there is some trickery lestrange is at the good samaritan yes dancing on miss marlows doorstep in the hope of getting money does he receive any letters i dont know why merely an idea of mine ill tell you later on what i think you are keeping me very much in the dark blair said alan somewhat piqued i dont care to show incomplete work replied the inspector bluntly i believe i can unravel the whole of this mystery but i dont want to show you the raw material let me work it out my own way mr thorold and judge me by the result as you please so long as you do it i dont care how you go about it i am working for two thousand pounds said blair and i dont intend to let any one else have it that blackguard tramp would like to be the man alan laughed he has already made a clutch at it by accusing me of the theft of mr marlows body the inspector nodded and smiled grimly the two are working in unison said he rubbing his hands but ill catch them by the way said thorold is mr marlow coming back here to be caught by lestrange no i think not he is not such a fool if you want to see him you must go to brighton i shall go tomorrow blair i am most anxious to hear the story of that night a strange storymore like fiction than truth truth is always stranger than fiction blair assented they walked on through a steep lane which led into the high street of the village as they breasted this mrs marry with a basket on her arm met them she was evidently excited well mrs marry said alan kindly what is it the poor dear isnt dead after all cried the panting woman i declare mr thorold you could ha knocked me down wi a feather when i saw him saw who why mr brown sirthe quiet gentleman he has come back chapter xx the amazement op alan thorold mrs marry delivered her startling piece of news with an air of triumph she did not guess for one moment how very important it was or in what peril it placed the quiet gentleman he came back last night she continued and he told me with his fingers how he had been lying ill in london town poor dear he took it into his head to go for a jaunt he says and went by the night train he meant to have come back to me next morning but a nasty influenza took him and kept him away im that glad hes come back i cant tell cried mrs marry joyfully for he do pay most reglar and gives not a bit of trouble innocent babe that he is and having imparted her news she hurried on down the lane the two men stood looking at one another brown back again said alan now we shall know the truth if he knows it said blair drylyhe was less excited than his companionbut i doubt if we shall learn much from him mr thorold if he had anything to do with the murder he would not have come back but he must have something to do with it man have you forgotten that it was he who stole the key of the vault from my desk no said blair pointedly nor have i forgotten that he did not use the key it was joe brill who opened the vault indeed and where did joe get the key not from mr phelps for he still has his key ha cried alan suddenly did joe get it from brown no he did not the key was not used at all there was a third key in existence of which neither you nor mr phelps were aware marlow had had it made to provide against the contingency which arose he had always resolved to feign death should lestrange track him so he kept the third key and joe used it on that night well even granting that such is the case why should brown have stolen my key and how could he have known that it was in my desk i think we discussed that point before replied the inspector composedly and that we came to the conclusion that brown overheard your conversation with mr phelps on the day of the funeral where are you going to see brown i am determined to get the truth out of him blair looked at him well mr thorold he said i dont suppose it will do any harm for you to see the man meanwhile i will go on to mrs warrenders but you ought to come with me and arrest him i do not think i have sufficient evidence to procure a warrant mr thorold a charge of murder is serious you see pooh pooh i dont want him arrested for murder but on the charge of breaking open my desk i could do that certainly well you go and see him mr thorold while i interview mrs warrender ill call along at the cottage later you neednt let brown out of your sight until i come youll arrest him if you wish it ill take the risk very good im off and with an abrupt nod alan ran down the lane blair looked after him with a queer smile on his dry face he had his own ideas regarding the termination of alans attempt to make brown the mysterious speak out mrs warrender was at home when the inspector called at first she felt she could not see him for the idea of coming into contact with the police was abhorrent to her she wondered if blair could have discovered the relationship which existed between herself and cicero and it was her anxiety to ascertain this which made her grant the inspector an interview if her brother were playing her false the more she knew about his plans the better would she be able to frustrate them mrs warrender was a capable woman and had a genius for intrigue she was quite decided that she could hold her own even against the trained intelligence of a police officer and so it came about that the gentleman in question was shown into the drawingroom a meretricious gaudy apartment which betrayed in furniture and decoration the tawdry taste of the doctors widow she came forward to receive him in an elaborate teagown of pink silk trimmed with lace and in spite of the early hour she wore a quantity of jewels blair had an eye for beauty and could not deny that this lady was a fine woman though perhaps too much of the ponderous type he wondered why she did not wear mourning she could have cared but little for her husband he thought to appear in gay colors so soon after his untimely end but in truth mrs warrender had never professed to be an affectionate wife she had married for a home and made no secret of it goodmorning she said with a sharp glance at blairs impassive face i understand that you belong to the police and that you wish to see mewhy i cannot conceive if you will permit me to explain myself i will soon give you my reasons said the inspector in his best manner may i sit down thank you now we can talk at our ease i suppose it is about the sad end of my poor husband she said in tones of grief which her gay attire somewhat belied have you found out the truth no but i hope to do sowith your assistance she looked up suddenly if you think i killed the poor lamb you are mistaken she said i can account for all my actions on that night policeman this last was hurled at blair with the object of keeping him well in mind of her condescension in receiving him i never had the slightest suspicion of you he protested my errand has to do with quite a different matter and might i suggest he added a trifle testily that i am usually addressed as inspector blair oh of course if you insist upon it she cried with a shrug inspector blairwill that do that will do very well thank you he paused and stared hard at the expensive teagown and the aggressive jewelry until the widow became restive are you rich he asked abruptly what has that got to do with you cried mrs warrender furiously remember you are talking to a lady to a rich lady or to a poor one upon my soul this is too much mind your business inspector blair this is my business he retorted keeping himself well in hand i merely asked you the question because if you are not rich then i come to make you so what do you mean answer my question first are you rich and he took another good look at the dress and the jewels no she said sullenly i am not my husband left me fairly well off but not with so much money as i expected then you would not object to making some more her eyes lighted up with the fire of greed i should i should i am dying to leave this dull village and take up a position in london but i cannot do it without money she paused then clapped her hands i see she cried sophy marlow is going to compensate me for the death of my husband it would be easy enough with all the millions she has i am sure it would assented blair coolly but i dont mean to supply you with money for nothing you what have you to do with the matter a good deal mr thorold and miss marlow will rely on my advice oh miss marlow jeered mrs warrender sitting up that is her name is it inspector blair are you sure it isnt marie lestrange he leaned forward and caught her wrist in a grip of steel so you know the truth then he said give me the confession what confession what do you mean she cried trying to release her hand the confession left by your husband in which he tells the story of achille lestranges murder iii dont know yes you do yes you dono lies he shook her wrist you know that marlow never murdered captain lestrange let go my wrist cried mrs warrender and succeeded in wrenching herself free what do you mean by behaving like this i know nothing about the matterthere blair jumped up and made for the door very good then you lose the money i have got for you come back come back she followed him to the door and laid her hand on his shoulder dont be in a hurry is thereis there money in it if you have the confession yes how much we will talk of that when i know the truth have you a confession yes i have she thought she might with safety admit as much i found the whole story of mr and mrs lestrange and mr beauchamp amongst my business papersmy husbands papers i should say it was signed and witnessed in new orleans it seems warrender was dying there and wanted to tell mr beauchampmarlow i meanthe truth so he had the confession drawn up by a lawyer afterwards when he got well he did not destroy it beauchamp was innocent of the murder then yes he knocked achille lestrange down but he did not kill him aha i thought so chuckled blair rubbing his hands who did mrs warrender drew back with a look of cunning on her face thats tellings said she relapsing into the speech of her people i dont part with my secret unless i get my price name your price two thousand pounds what cried the inspector two thousand pounds for clearing the memory of a dead man my dear lady five hundred is nearer the mark two thousand she repeated if sophy marlow has the millions left by her supposed father she can well afford that humph well see i must speak to mr thorold first you have the confession i havesafely put away it was my intention to have seen sophy marlow about it but i thought id wait to see what price you could get put in blair quite so im a woman of business if i dont get my price i burn that confession you dare not i can have you arrested remember she snapped her fingers pooh she said i dont care for your threats this is my one chance of making money and im going to take it two thousand pounds or nothing ill think it over said blair i am to have the refusal of that confession mind what do you want to make money too certainly said blair with irony i am a man of business she laughed and took leave of him in a very amiable frame of mind when he had gone she smirked in front of a mirror and took a long look at herself two thousand pounds she cried and my own savings im not so old after all ill run away from cicero and marry again ha ha ive made a deal this time and she went in to luncheon with a most excellent appetite while this interview was taking place alan had been at mrs harrys cottage having received no orders to the contrary she ushered him into the sittingroom there sat the quiet gentleman in his gray suit at sight of alan he started violently goodday mr brown said his visitor looking closely at him i have come to see you about that key you stole you are dumb i believe but not deaf so no doubt you follow my meaning the quiet gentleman made a step forward and to the amazement of his visitor he spoke alan he saidalan thorold the young man dropped into a chair white and shaking he knew that voicehe knew what was coming with a laugh the quiet gentleman pulled off his wig and beard dont you know me alan he asked richard marlow gasped alan herbert beauchamp was the quiet reply chapter xxi the story of the past come alan said beauchamp after a pause you need not be tonguetied with astonishment i sent blair on to tell you all that had happened so you must have known that i was alive yes yesbut your disguise stammered the young man i expected to see brown you are not brown never could have been for when he was here i have seen you and him at the same time thats all right my boy i was not brown as you say and who brown was i know no more than you do but i am brown now with emphasis and brown i shall remain until i can show myself with safety as richard marlow not that i intended to stick to that name no if blair is right and that scoundrel warrender has left papers to prove my innocence i shall take my own name but this disguise it is a plot between me and blair it was necessary that i should be on the spot so we thought this was as good a mask as any oh depend upon it alan i am perfectly safe here from jean lestrange as he spoke beauchamp was putting on his wig and beard and when this was done to his satisfaction he seated himself on a chair opposite to alan looking the very image of the quiet gentleman thorold did not wonder that mrs marry had been deceivedthe completeness of the disguise would have deceived a cleverer woman still said he doubtfully if the real brown should reappear we will have him arrested for the murder of warrender said beauchamp quietly yes i am convinced he is guilty else why did he steal the key of the vault blair told me about that he must surely be some tool of jean lestranges no not the man himselfi am aware of that blair saw the passengerlist are you certain that the quiet gentleman killed warrender no because i did not see the blow struck i was insensible at the timebut it is a long story and to make things perfectly clear i must begin at the beginning one moment alan beauchamp crossed to the door and turned the key i dont want mrs marry to come in she will hear your voice and believing you to be dumb ill speak low come nearer to this chair first tell me how sophy is very well but much cast down she thinks you are dead and that your body has been stolen oh beauchamp cried alan passionately why did you not trust sophy and me you would have spared us both many an unhappy hour i wish now that i had told you but i acted for the best i had little time for thought i expected daily that lestrange would appear if i had only considered the matter rather morebut there its done and we must make the best of it sophys tears will be turned to smiles shortlyif indeed she still loves me knowing that i am not her father and the old man sighed you need have no fear on that score said alan with a faint smile he was getting over the first shock of surprise sophy would have nothing to do with jean lestrange although she half believed his story she always insists that you are her true father she will welcome you back with the greatest joy she must welcome me secretly secretlywhy should your innocence be established you would surely reappear as richard marlow what and have the whole story in the papers no alan i shall spend the rest of my life under my true name of beauchamp and live on the two thousand a year i left myself in my will you and sophy can marry and take the rest of the money i shall travel and take joe with me well perhaps it is the best thing to do said thorold but tell me how was it that the manager of the occidental bank reported you dead joe wrote to him by my order to say so when joe came to me at brighton and told me how the death of warrender had complicated matters i was afraid lest i should be traced and perhaps accused of a second murder so i thought it best to put it about that i was dead and end all pursuit if you had only trusted me sir all this trouble would have been avoided i merited your confidence i think i knowi know indeed on that day when i spoke to you of the probability that my body would not be allowed to rest in its grave i had half a mind to tell you but somehow the moment passed even then i had designed my plot of feigning death it was the only way i saw of escaping lestrange tell me the story from the beginning said alan i know only scraps the beginning was in jamaica alan said beauchamp sadly all this trouble arose out of the love i had for sophys mother poor zelia if only she had married me i would have made her a good husband as it was she chose achille lestrange a rou and a gambler a spendthrift and a scoundrel i could never tell sophy what a bad man her father was he treated poor zelia abominably but was that altogether his fault beauchamp joe hinted that jean lestrange caused much of the trouble so he did the scoundrel jean was if anything worse than his cousin though there was not much to choose between them but jean was madly in love with zeliaworshiped her with all the fierce passion of a creole when he lost her he vowed he would be revengedhe sowed dissension between them on my account he hinted that you were in love with her i suppose yes and he was right cried beauchamp with emphasis i was in love with zelia and pitied her from the bottom of my heart well a year after sophy was born things came to a crisis i was at kingston and my yacht in the harbor there i saw a good deal of zelia and one night she came on board with her child and asked me to take her away lestrange had struck her the beast and she had refused to live with him any longer at first i hesitated but she was in such a state of agony that i consented to take her away from her wretched life i had to go first to falmouth to fetch some things which i did not wish to leavei had sold my plantation some time before having made up my mind to leave jamaica so we sailed reached falmouth in safety and i went to my estate leaving joe brill on board ah that was why joe could not say who killed achille precisely joe knew little of the events of that night but he believed in me and stood by me like the noble faithful fellow he is but to continue zelia arrived at my house only to die worry and melancholy had brought her to a low state of health and she caught a fever on the very night jean and her husband came in pursuit she died i had made all arrangements to sail i had sold my estate and had sent the proceeds to england it had been my intention to have married zelia when achille had divorced her to adopt little marie and to start life afresh in a new land her death put an end to these plans but the murder beauchamp i am coming to that warrender was attending zelia when she died and he was in the house when achille and jean arrived i was quite determined he should not get the child for zelia had left some money and i knew well that achille would soon squander it well lestrange demanded his wife i told him she was dead he declined to believe me and we quarreled i am naturally of a fiery temper continued beauchamp with some agitation and i knocked him down on the veranda the blow stunned him and he lay there like a dog was jean present yes he saw me knock achille down then he went away to see the body of zelia i had to look for the child intending to take her to my yacht until such time as i could obtain the guardianship when i came out again i found warrender kneeling down beside the body of achille he was dead not from the effects of your blow cried alan incredulously no he had been stabbed to the heart while senseless by whomwarrender i dont know warrender always swore that his hands were clean of blood and certainly he had no reason to murder achille i suspected jean but warrender told me that jean had been in zelias room praying beside the body he advised me to fly yes yes but who killed achille well i supposed it must have been a negro whom achille had brought with hima zambo called scipio who was devoted to his mistress and who hated his master on hearing that zelia was deadknowing as he did that her husbands brutality had probably had a good deal to do with ithe might have stabbed achille as he lay senseless on the veranda at any rate warrender said that he found him dead when he came out to this day i dont know who killed him it must have been either warrender scipio or jean i am inclined to suspect scipio however at the time there was nothing for it but flight if i wanted to escape an accusation of murder you see bow strong the evidence was against me alan i had taken away achilles wife and child he had come in pursuit i had quarreled with him and knocked him down he had been found dead therefore i fled with the child can you blame me no said alan decisively under the circumstances i dont see what else you could do so you escaped i did i went on board my yacht and told joe all of course he believed in my innocence and strongly advised me to leave at once we sailed down the coast of south america round the horn and home to england i called myself richard marlow and i sold the yacht under another name at a french seaport i had plenty of money and there was no one who suspected my past i suppose the news of the murder had not reached england no i believe there was a casual reference in one of the papers but that was all the yacht was supposed to have foundered i felt secure from pursuit and determined to start a new life i gave out that marie was my daughter and i called her sophy then i placed her in the convent at hampstead with a sum of money for her education and besides that i secured a certain sum on her for life in case of my death when this was settled i went to africa there fortune tired of persecuting me gave me smiles instead of frowns i made a fortune in the goldmines and became celebrated as richard marlow the millionaire the rest of my story you know up to a point said alan significantly i know how you bought this place and settled here with sophy but the letter from barkham ah joe told you about that did he said beauchamp composedly yes the letter was from an old friend of mine called barkham he told me that jean lestrange had recognized my portrait in an illustrated paper and that he intended to come to england to hunt me down the letter was sent to the office of the paper and by them forwarded here you may guess my feelings i thought myself lost i showed the letter to warrender and he suggested that i should feign death i jumped at the idea made a will allowing myself an income under my true name of herbert beauchamp got another key of the vault fashioned from the one which afterwards was taken to phelps and took joe into my confidence then warrender drugged me what did he give you asked alan you looked really dead i cant tell you the name of the drug he said it was some vegetable preparation used by the negroes then i diedapparentlyand i was buried they had bored holes in the coffin and that night when you were all absent joe and warrender took me out of the vault and carried me to the hut on the heath where warrender revived me it was while he was doing this that he heard a noise and ran out he never came back and when i was myself again we went out to find his body he was quite dead stabbed to the heart and lying some distance from the hut who killed him i do not know but how did his body get into the vault joe did it after he had got me away he dragged the body into the hut and next night came back and took it to the vault he put it into the coffin never dreaming that any one would look for it there nor would they and all would have been well had it not been for that man cicero gramp he saw too much and he was interrupted by a sharp knock at the door chapter xxii the beginning of the end alan started to his feet at that imperative summons had beauchamp been overheard by mrs marry had his disguise been penetrated had she brought some one to witness the discovery these thoughts rushed through his mind with lightning speed and for the moment he lost his presence of mind not so the man who was truly in danger adopting the peculiar shuffle of the quiet gentleman he crossed the room and opened the door as the key turned in the lock alan fully expected to see lestrange menacing and sinister on the threshold but the newcomer proved to be blair how are you getting on mr thorold he said stepping through the door which beauchamp locked behind him you know now who the quiet gentleman is dont look so scared sir cant help it muttered the young man this business has been rather too much for me i thought when you knocked that lestrange had run his prey to earth he wont get much out of his prey if he does said blair with a nod to beauchamp i have seen mrs warrender the old man turned as white as the beard he wore andandwhat does she say he stammered say blair seated himself and chuckled she says two thousand pounds will pay her for that confession then it does exist warrender knew the truth of course didnt i tell you the man was a blackmailing scoundrel faith and his wife is not much better two thousand pounds for a bit of paper and for my freedom said beauchamp excitedly oh to think of being free from the horror which has hung over me all these years and warrender knew the truth what a scoundrel he always swore that he knew nothing and i paid him money to hold his tongue about my supposed guilt ungrateful wretch he and his wife arrived in england almost penniless i met him in london and as he knew my story i brought him down here i helped him in every way how was it he left a confession behind him it is an old confession replied blair it seems that warrender fell ill of fever in new orleans his conscience smote him for his villainy and he made a full confession signed it and had it witnessed when he recovered he did not destroy it but kept it safely with the rest of his papers there mrs warrender found it and she is now prepared to sell it for two thousand pounds a nice sum upon my word grumbled blair she shall have it said beauchamp eagerly i would pay five thousand for that confessioni would indeed i dare say but mrs warrender will give it to you for the lesser sum sir does she know that i am here did you tell her not such a fool mr beauchamp shed have asked five thousand if she had known that the woman has the blackmailing instinct like her brother put in alan then observing the looks of surprise directed at him by the other two he added didnt you know cicero gramp is mrs warrenders brother i found that out in london a nice pair of jailbirds cried blair id best get that confession at once or shell be giving it to cicero and theyll demand more money mr beauchamp can you give me a check no he said shaking his head you forget blair i am dead and buried and whats more i do not intend ever to come to life again as marlow but mr thorold as sophys trustee can give you the money if blair will come to the abbey farm i will do so said alan rising i agree that the sooner the confession is obtained the better or cicero may give trouble by the way who was it killed achille blair was it the doctor himself no no cried beauchamp it was scipio the negro i cant tell you that and the inspector shook his head mrs warrender declares that you are innocent mr beauchamp but she declines to give any further information until she has received her pound of flesh she shall have it this very day said alan putting on his cap come blair mr beauchamp will you remain here yes i am safer as the quiet gentleman than as anything else you dont want me to bring sophy here not until we get that confession alan sophy might make a scene when she met me mrs marry would learn the truth and the news would spread if lestrange knew all would be lost get the confession alan yes i think that is the best plan goodday mr brown said the inspector speaking for the benefit of mrs marry and with alan he left the house alone again beauchamp fell on his knees and thanked god that his innocence was about to be vindicated for years he had lived in dread of discovery now he was about to be relieved of the nightmare talking as they went of the strange and unexpected turn the case as blair called it had taken the two men walked through heathton and out on to the country road on turning down a quiet lane which led to the abbey farm they saw a ponderous man behaving in a most extraordinary manner he danced in the white dust he shook his fist at the sky and he spun round like a distracted elephant blairs keen eye recognized him at once very pretty mr cicero gramp he observed dryly are you in training for a balletdancer the man stopped short and turned a disturbed face on them ill be even with him he gasped wiping his streaming forehead oh the wretch oh the judas gentlemen proceed and leave an unhappy man to fight down a whirl of conflicting emotions e pluribus unum quoted cicero in a pathetic voice that is meai ai i utter the wail of orestes and like orestes you seem to be mad observed alan as the fat man returned to his dancing and no wonder mr thorold i have lost thousands lestrange cicero could say no more he was choked with emotion and gave vent to his feelings by shaking his fist at the sky ah said blair who had been taking in the situation lestrange you have found a cleverer villain than yourself he has gone away roared cicero with the voice of an angry bull yes you may look he went this morning bag and baggage i dont know where he is save that he roams the wilderness of london and my moneyhe paid his bill to mine hostess of the hostel with my money the deuce he did said alan and how did you come to lend him money i do not mind explaining said mr gramp with a defiant glance at the gentleman who represented the police i went into partnership with lestrange he had no money i lent him a goodly part of your fifty pounds mr thorold on an undertaking that i should get half of what he received from miss marlow a very creditable bargain remarked alan grimly but you invested your cash in a bad cause mr gramp i saw lestrange last night and assured him that he would not get one penny of the blackmail he proposed to extort i dare say after my visit he found the game was up and thought it advisable to clear out i should recommend you to do the same so should i put in blair significantly or ill have you arrested as a vagabond without proper means of support i am a professor of eloquence and elocution cried cicero his fat cheeks turning pale at this stern hint you dare not arrest me and you mr thorold will be sorry if you do not employ me employ you in which way to hunt lestrange down alan shrugged his shoulders i do not wish to see the man again but i know something about him promise to pay me some money and ill show you a letter written to captain lestrange which came to the inn after he left i took it and opened it to find out his plans well you are a scoundrel said alan looking mr gramps portly figure up and down by opening another persons letter you have placed yourself within reach of the law i dont care cried cicero recklessly i am desperate will you pay me for a sight of that letter yes said the inspector before alan could reply if it is worth paying for on the other hand you could be arrested for opening it come the letter cicero produced the document in question and kept firm hold of it while he made his bargain how much mr thorold if it proves to be of use replied the young squire leisurely ill pay you well leave the amount to me the tramp still hesitated but inspector blair becoming impatient snatched it out of his hand and proceeded to read it aloud it was a short note to the effect that if the writer did not receive a certain sum of money at once underlined he would come down to heathton and tell all also underlined to miss marlow these few lines were signed o barkham barkham exclaimed alan that must be the man who warned beauchamp that lestrange was coming i wonder what he knows humph grunted blair putting the letter into his pocket very likely he will be able to tell us sufficient to enable us to dispense with mrs warrenders confession i am not particularly anxious to pay her two thousand pounds for nothing two thousand pounds wailed cicero with his eyes staring out of his head oh clara maria has she got that out of you my own sistermy very own wept the old scamp and she wont go shares yet i offered to work with her he finished i dont think youll get a sixpence out of her said alan a desire to grab money evidently runs in your family however if this letter turns out to be of any assistance in clearing up these mysteries ill see what i can do mr gramp seeing no other alternative accepted this offer when am i to get it he asked sulkily when i choose alan replied tartly go back to the good samaritan and dont let me catch you annoying your sister or ill make it hot for you and he moved away followed by blair cicero shook his fist at them and spent the rest of the day making futile guesses as to how much they would give him whats to do now blair asked thorold abruptly i shall pay mrs warrender and get the confession you can take it to mr beauchamp and set his mind at rest and youwhat will you do catch the train to london i shall go straight to the address given in this letterblair tapped his breastpocketand see barkham and he added i shall see lestrange will he be with barkham i think so helestrange i meanwent away before he got this letter it is likely enough that he has gone to london to see his accomplice if barkham were an accomplice he would not have written warning beauchamp of lestranges departure from jamaica it is on that point i wish to be clear retorted blair it seems to me that barkham is running with the hare and hunting with the hounds well i hope youll find out sufficient to solve the mystery said alan bringing the conversation to a close but i confess i am doubtful the check duly written and safely deposited in the inspectors pocket the two men set out on their visit to mrs warrender who was graciously pleased to accept the money in exchange for which she handed over the confession alan and blair read it on the spot and were greatly astonished at the contents then the inspector hurried away to catch the london train and alan set out for mrs marrys cottage taking with him the precious document mrs warrenderfearful lest the check should be stoppedleft for london by a later train she had decided that she would cash it herself the moment the bank opened the following morning her business capacities were indeed undeniable alan returned home tired out with the days work and was glad enough to sit down to the excellent meal provided by mrs hester but his troubles and excitements were not yet over hardly had he finished his dinner when a note from sophy was brought in come at once she wrote lestrange is here chapter xxiii one part of the truth after his interview with alan captain lestrange had come to the conclusion that it would be the best and wisest course to retreat before the enemy alan knew much brill knew more and the two together might prove too much for him moreover since his design of passing as sophys father had been rendered useless it was not necessary that he should remain in heathton therefore he paid his account at the inn with money borrowed from cicero and departed in hot haste before that gentleman was afoot it was not until he got to the junction that he began to wonder if he was acting judiciously it struck him that he should have made at least one attempt to get money out of sophy for some time he pondered over this question and finally decided to leave his baggage in the junction cloakroom and steal back to heathton under cover of darkness true his accomplice barkham was waiting for him in london but he would not get much of a welcome from that gentleman unless he brought money with him moreover after joes intimation that it was barkham who had warned beauchamp of the plot to hunt him down lestrange had had no confidence in him but that barkham knew enough to be very dangerous he would have left him out of his calculations altogether he decided at last that he must get money out of sophy bribe barkham to return to jamaica and then deal alone and unaided with the lucrative business of extracting further blackmail having made up his mind to this course of action he loitered about at the junction until he could with safety return to heathton it was during this tune that he had a surprise while lurking in the waitingroom he saw blair arrive by a local train and catch the london express what could he be doing was he hunting him down the very idea terrified him and he began to congratulate himself on having remained at the junction had he known that blair was now on his way to see barkham he would have had still greater cause for alarm matters were indeed coming to a crisis but lestrange did not guess that the crisis was so near at hand when he had seen the lights of the london express disappear he took his seat in a local train which was timed to leave shortly after eight oclock on arriving at heathton he left the station hurriedly and stole through deserted byways to the moat house here he asked for miss marlow and sent in his card on which he had scribbled news of your father the lie which was not all a lie gained him the interview he sought but before seeing him sophy sent off the note to alan then she induced miss vicky to retire and received her visitor alone in the drawingroom the captain entered the room with a somewhat cringing air his nerve was gone and with it a goodly portion of his courage miss marlow on the contrary was quite mistress of herself and of the situation she had heard from joe brill amongst other things that this man was not her father and she now felt no fear of him he was anxious and ill at ease like a culprit before a judge good evening captain lestrange said sophy sitting very erect in her chair you wish to see me i believe why have you come to make reparation miss marlow oh she said ironically then i am not your daughter i expect you have heard as much from joe brill replied lestrange looking at her gloomily no you are not my daughter but you are my cousin marie lestrange although you choose to keep your name of sophia marlow i keep the name of the man who has been a father to me in that case you should call yourself beauchamp he retorted may i sit down thank you well i suppose you are wondering why i have come to see you she glanced at the card to give me news of my father i presume she said do you mean my real father no i mean the false one your real father died long ago he was murdered by beauchamp he was not cried sophy vehemently and started from her seat i have heard the story from joe and i know now why you came here but nothing will induce me to believe that he killed my father my mother fled to him from the cruelty of her husband and you were at the bottom of all the trouble yes he cried fiercely i was i loved your mother dearly she gave me up for achille and i swore i would be revenged i sowed dissension between them it was through me that zelia fled with beauchamp do you think i am sorry for what happened i am not i hated achille but he is dead i hate beauchamp for your mother loved him and he also is dead interrupted sophy you cannot harm him are you so sure he is dead sneered lestrange i saw his dead body cried the girl with emotion you saw him in a state of insensibility brought about by warrenders devilish drugs said the captain sharply i dont believe beauchamp is dead if he had been why should his body have been carried off you declared that mr thorold did that and i do not say so now thorold had nothing to do with it but i am quite sure that warrender had in order to escape me beauchamp allowed himself to be drugged by warrender and that was why warrender assisted at the removal of the supposed dead body i feel certain that beauchamp is alive alive oh i hope so i hope so my dear father cried sophy only prove that he is alive captain lestrange and i will forgive you all you forget that i am his enemy was the fierce reply were i able to prove that he is alive i should at once have him arrested for the murder of your fathermy cousin it is not true it is not true it is and you know it beauchamp must have had some very good and strong reason for allowing himself to be buried alive so as to escape me but for your sake and for my own i will leave beauchamp should he be indeed alive to the punishment of his conscience what do you mean i mean that i want money you are rich and you can pay me give me a thousand pounds and i will go away and never trouble you again i refuse she walked up and down the room in a state of great agitation if you were certain that mr beauchamp was aliveif you were certain he had committed that crime you would not let him escape so easily i would i would i am tired of the whole business no no insisted the girl i dont believe you if i gave you money i should only be supplying you with the means to cause further trouble if my dear fatherfor i shall still call him sois alive i will leave the matter in his hands and hang him and save him retorted the girl firmly you can go captain lestrange i shall not give you one penny lestrange made a bound and caught her wrist take care he cried shaking with rage i am desperatei will stick at nothing if you do not give the money i want i shall go to the police go go i defy you little devil muttered lestrange and he gave her arm a sharp twist she screamed for help and as though in answer to her summons alan appeared at the door with an exclamation of rage he sprang forward seized lestrange and flung him on the floor you hound he cried panting you dog alan alan thank heaven you are here let me sit down alan ii feel faint while alan was assisting the girl to a chair lestrange rose slowly from the ground the sudden and opportune arrival of the young squire disconcerted him greatly and he began to think it was time to retire if sophy refused him money when alone she would most certainly not yield to his demand now that her lover was beside her so with deadly hatred in his heart he stole towards the door which was still open on the threshold he recoiled with a shrill cry of fear before him stood herbert beauchamp alias richard marlow youyou here after all beauchamp shutting and locking the door after him strode into the room yes i live to punish you jean lestrange hold him alan while i speak to sophy the girl with a pale face and staring eyes was looking at the man who had come back from the grave he approached and took her hands my poor child he said in caressing tones do not look so alarmed i am flesh and blood you are alive father gasped sophy amazed and somewhat terrified yes he kissed her i feigned death to escape from this man come sophy have you no welcome for me it is true that i am not your father butafter all you are as dear to me as ever she cried putting her arms round his neck you are my true fathermy real father i shall never think of you as anything else oh thank godthank god and she wept and kissed him by turns amen said beauchamp in a solemn tone but we have much to do before things are put straight there is the cause of all my trouble and i must deal with him he rose and crossed to where lestrange white and shaking was in the grip of thorold what have you to say for yourself lestrange the man made a violent effort to recover his selfcontrol and partially succeeded i have to say to you what i shall shortly say to the world you are a murderer that is a lie it is no lie you murdered that girls father that is a lie repeated beauchamp sternly do you think i am a judas to kiss that innocent girl if i knew myself to be her fathers murderer i knocked your cousin achille senseless and well he deserved it but it was not i who stabbed him to the heart it was you jean lestrange ii gasped the wretch his lips white his limbs shaking under him you daretotoaccusemeof i do not accuse you said beauchamp solemnly out of the mouth of the dead you are condemned here is the confession of warrender and in it he tells the truth you are the murderer of achille sophy uttered a cry of horror and throwing herself back on the couch hid her face from the guilty wretch he strove to speak but no words came and he continued to look silently on the ground but for the support of thorold he would have fallen warrender continued mr beauchamp himself almost as great a villain as you knew the truth these twenty years but he kept silence in order to terrorize me to extort money from me it was he who proposed that i should escape you by feigning death knowing as he did that i was innocent well he has been punished i did not kill him at all events cried lestrange savagely i know you did not you were not in england at the time but you killed achille yes you left the room where zelia lay dead you found achille senseless on the veranda and you stabbed him to the heart warrender saw you commit the crime it is all set out here and signed by warrender in the presence of two witnesses can you deny it lestrange moistened his dry lips looked at sophy at beauchamp then suddenly shook off alans hold no i dont deny it he said in a loud harsh voice you have been one too many for me i am so poor as to be almost starving so i dont care what becomes of me hang me if you like i hate you beauchampi have always hated you the more so when i found how much zelia cared for you and i loved her though that was not the reason i killed her husband for she was dead then and could never be mine but i killed him so that blame might rest on you and i wanted the custody of the child because i should have been able to handle the money i found achille senseless where you had knocked him down i did not intend to do it but i had a knifeand the devil put it into my head to stab him then you fled and the murder was laid at your door and had you not done me harm enough wretched man without hunting me down said beauchamp sternly i wanted money he cried recklessly i saw your portrait in the paper and i arranged with barkham who was as hardup as i that we should come to england and get some of your money he played the traitor and wrote you that letterwhy i dont know as he stood to make as much as i did but for that letter i should have found you alive and i should have forced you to pay me as it turned out you escaped me and will you escape me do you think asked beauchamp with emphasis i dont knowi dont care call in the police and have me arrested if you like i have played a bold game and lostdo your worst he folded his arms and stared defiantly at the man whose life he had ruined beauchamp looked irresolutely at him then he turned to sophy who pale and quiet was clinging to her lovers arm the daughter of the man whose life you took shall be your judge said the millionaire sophy is he to go free or shall the law take its course let him golet him go murmured the girl his death shall not be upon my soul let him go and repent i agree with sophy said alan thorold let him go and repent finished mr beauchamp go jean lestrange and seek from an offended god the mercy you denied to me lestrange pulled himself together and put on his hat with a wouldbe jaunty air he tried to speak but the words would not come and he slunk out of the room like a beaten hound and that was the last they ever saw of jean lestrange chapter xxiv the other part of the truth shortly afterwards mr beauchamp returned to his lodgings as the quiet gentleman having been informed by alan on his way to the moat house that lestrange was there with sophy he had taken off his false wig and beard to confound him but now in spite of the girls protestations he put them on again no child no he said i am as dead as richard marlow and i shall not come to life again what purpose would it serve it would only cause a scandal and the papers would be full of the story i have no wish to be a nine days wonder but father what will you dowhere will you live oh said he with a smile i dare say you will carry out the terms of the will and let me have that two thousand a year i shall take my departure from mrs marrys as the quiet gentleman and appear in london as herbert beauchamp you can join me there and we can go on our travels but what about me cried poor sophy who had found her adopted father only to lose him again you shall marry alan but i want you to be at the wedding father i shall be at the wedding child and i shall give you away alan looked at him in surprise then you will be recognized and the whole story will come out so it would if you were married here answered beauchamp composedly but the wedding must take place in london cant you see alan that sophy must be married to you under her true namemarie lestrange oh must i cried the girl in dismay i think so otherwise i doubt if the marriage would hold good you are right said alan after a pause we must do as you say but i am sorry i wanted to be married here and i wanted phelps to marry us there is no reason against that bring him to london and tell him the whole story but i will never be called marie no no you will always be sophy to us said her lover kissing her and we will go abroad with mr beauchamp for our honeymoon with my father cried sophy embracing the old man my dear and only father he sighed as he kissed her goodby he was devoted to his adopted daughter and felt deeply parting with her even to so good a fellow as alan thorold but he comforted himself with the thought that they could be much together abroad and so taking this cheerful view of the situation which had been created by the villainy of lestrange the exmillionaire as he may now be called withdrew to his lodgings it was there that alan took leave of him promising to call the next morning a thankful heart was herbert beauchamps that night the sorrow of his life was over the dark clouds had lifted and now under his own name and with a good income he could spend the rest of his days in peace lestrange had slunk back into the night whence he had emerged leaving one part of the mystery cleared up by his confession it still remained to discover who had been the murderer of the unlucky warrender and that came to light the very next day alan did not wait until beauchamp had departed for london to acquaint his revered tutor with all that had taken place on the afternoon of the next day he proceeded to the rectory and told the whole story to the amazed and delighted phelps nothing would serve but that he must go at once to mrs marrys and see with his own eyes the man who had been buried alive but alan restrained the rectors impetuosity by pointing out that mrs marry supposed brown the quiet gentleman to be dumb if by any chance she should hear him speak all secrecy would be at an end ay ay assented mr phelps true enough alan true enough mrs marry is a terrible gossip and we must keep the matter quiet i dont want my churchyard to be made the subject of another scandal but i must see marlowi mean beauchamp god bless me i shall never get his name rightmay i be forgiven for swearing bring him here alanbring him at once i must see my old friend after all he has suffered this alan agreed to do and an hour later appeared with beauchamp and sophy phelps received his old friend as one returned from the dead and insisted upon having several points cleared up which he felt to be obscure how about getting away marlow he asked you had no clothes how did you manage but i had clothes replied beauchamp we prepared all our plans very carefully joe took a suit of clothes to the hut and brought money with him then i walked to the nearest town and caught the train for london there at a quiet hotel a box in the name of beauchamp was waiting for me i slept there and went on to brighton and took rooms in lansdowne place i was comfortable you may be sure joe came down to see me and told me all the trouble which had ensued upon the death of warrender ah said alan reflectively we dont know who murdered him and we never shall know it could not have been lestrange and if it were the quiet gentleman he has escaped us i wonder who that quiet gentleman was said sophy we all wonder that my dear put in the rector but i fear we shall never know well what does it matter said beauchamp with more asperity than he usually showed whoever murdered warrender gave him no more than he deserved the man was a blackmailer although the money he got out of me was obtained under the guise of friendship he could have saved me years of agony had he only spoken the truthay and honesty would have paid him better than dishonesty no doubt but the man is dead let us not speak evil of the dead said phelps but there is one question i wish to ask you marlowbeauchamp i mean how was it that the pageboy swore joe brill was never out of the room on that night joe drugged the lads supperale and slipped out when he was fast asleep he did the same the next night when he had to take warrenders body to the vault that was my idea for i was terrified lest i should be traced by the murder and i wanted to get rid of the evidence of the crime that tramp confound him spoilt all they were interrupted by the entrance of a servant with the card of inspector blair he was admitted at once leaving a companion whom he had brought with him in the hall you must excuse my intrusion sir he said addressing mr phelps but i have already been to the moat house and to the abbey farm in search of mr thorold here i am said alan what is the matter blair you have some news i have sir i have been to london and i have brought back with me a gentleman whom mr beauchamp may know and he summoned the gentleman in the hall barkham exclaimed mr beauchamp you here mr barkham was a dapper dark man not unlike lestrange with an expression which a schoolboy would have called sneaky he did not recognize mr beauchamp until that gentleman stripped off beard and wig then he hastened to acknowledge him mr beauchamp he said in a servile voice i hope as i warned you of lestranges plot you will hold me blameless why what have you been doing i will tell you interposed blair this gentleman as you see bears a slight resemblance to captain jean lestrange he and the captain were hard up in jamaica and seeing your portrait mr beauchamp in the papers they thought they might have a chance of extorting money from you in case lestrange got into trouble here he wished to have an alibi so he left for england under another name and mr barkham here came to southampton in the negress as captain lestrange yes yes said barkham nervously but i warned mr beauchamp that lestrange was coming quite so but you did not tell him that lestrange was masquerading as a dumb man in heathton what cried alan and sophy in one breath was lestrange the quiet gentleman yes replied blair with triumph he confessed as much to barkham here that was why he wore the gray wig and beard and assumed dumbnessoh a most effective disguise quite a different person he made of himself he came down to keep a watch on you mr beauchamp in order to plunder you when he thought fit your unexpected death took him by surprise and upset his plans then barkham as jean lestrange arrived at southampton and our quiet gentleman disappeared from his rooms here to reappear from london in his own proper person as captain jean lestrange no wonder that with so carefullyprepared an alibi we did not guess it was he who had been masquerading here ha exclaimed alan and he stole the key of the vault mr barkham can explain that and other things said blair significantly wait cried sophy rising excitedly i knowi know it was lestrange who murdered dr warrender yes admitted barkham he did there was a deep silence which was broken at length by beauchamp the scoundrel he said hoarsely and i let him escape what cried blair jumping up you let him escape mr beauchampand when you knew that he killed achille lestrange it was my wish struck in sophy i thought he might repent such scoundrels never repent miss marlow said blair he has committed two murders he may commit two more but ill hunt him down he cant have gone far yet no i dont suppose he has said alan he was here last night by the way how did he kill dr warrender and why barkham the little man obeyed the voice of the inspector and meekly repeated his story lestrange he said did not believe that mr beauchamp was dead he heard mr thorold say something to the rector about the key of the vault god bless me cried phelps so you did alan yes said the little man nodding then he stole the key he sent for the doctor to ask him about the burial the doctor came but lestrange was out did warrender recognize him asked beauchamp abruptly no sir he did notat least not then well lestrange waited and waited to enter the vault when he went at last he found warrender and another man taking the body out he followed them to the hut on the heath he tried to look in and he made a slight noise warrender came out and in the moonlight he recognized lestrange who turned to run away but the doctor caught him and they struggled then lestrange knowing that he would be arrested for the murder of achille in jamaica stabbed the doctor to the heart terrified at what he had done he lost his head and hurried up to me in london at first he refused to tell me anything but i made him drink said barkham with a leer and so i got the whole truth out of him you scoundrel cried thorold call me what you like was the sullen rejoinder i wanted to get money out of beauchamp myself and wrote to warn him that i might have a claim on his gratitude i was afraid to come here i sent a letter to lestrange asking him for money and it got into this policemans hands he traced me and brought me down here that is all i know but as mr beauchamp is alive i ought to have something after all it was i who warned him you shall have fifty pounds said beauchamp sternly but you must leave england i dont know that i will let him said blair he should have communicated with the police ill turn queens evidence if you like said barkham i dont care if i am arrested or not i have had nothing but this fifty poundsand you call that gratitude mr beauchamp let him go blair if you can consistently with your duty said beauchamp ill see was the reply hullo whats that gramp what do you mean by rushing into the room it was indeed cicero who stood hot and puffing at the door he took no notice of blair but addressed himself to alan mr thorold he said i have information if you will pay me well you shall be paid if what you have to say is worth it then i must tell you that lestrange was the quiet gentleman you see this lancet he stole it out of your desk and gave it to me to say that i found it in the hut this proves that he was the quiet gentleman and i believe he murdered dr warrender you do you scoundrel cried mr beauchamp but you are too latewe know all too late cried gramp good heavens to think of my getting nothing and clara maria two thousand pounds little remains to be told lestrange was traced to southampton but there the trail was lost much to the disappointment of inspector blair who although he duly received the two thousand pounds never ceased to regret the mans escape alan paid him the reward gladly for without him the mystery would never have been solved and mr beauchamps innocence would never have been established sophy and alan were married in the presence of the exmillionaire and of miss vicky after the ceremony the former left england with joe he bought a small yacht in which he and his faithful servant sail the waters of the mediterranean no one has ever guessed the truth mrs marry continues to lament the loss of the quiet gentleman but she has always believed him to have been one and the same person that mr beauchamp was the second representative of the part she never dreamed mr marlow is dead to the heathton villagers and to this day they talk of the mystery which surrounded the disappearance of his corpseindeed the vault has the reputation of being haunted barkham left england with his fifty pounds and mrs warrender returned to america with her two thousand and her many jewels there she married a canadian doctor and vanished altogether cicero received a small sum and now spends his time frantically hunting for clara maria in the hope of extorting a share of her money but clara maria is a clever woman and he is not likely to come across her sophy and alan are supremely happy in their life at the abbey farm they make frequent trips to the continent where they meet mr beauchamp miss vicky too is happy she has sophys son and heir to care for and what more can she want the heir to millions says the old lady and what a mystery there was about it all to this day i dont understand everything few people do is alans reply the millionaires mystery will always remain a mystery in heathton billing and sons ltd printers guildford
