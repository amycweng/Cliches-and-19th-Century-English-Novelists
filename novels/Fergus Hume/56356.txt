liar take that heres the repayment the man who had spoken first went down like a log he was a redheaded creature with a rasping voice and an aggressive manner evidently one of those who bullied his way through the world for want of a bold spirit to stand up to him in this instance he found his match for the handsome face of the young fellow he insulted was sternly set and considerably flushed after the war of words came the blow from the bully his fist passed harmlessly by the head of this antagonist and a welldelivered return blow caught him fairly on the jaw then redhead lay down to consider the lesson he had been taught you confounded scoundrel said the other standing over him you may be thankful that i dont wring your neck youre no good in the world that i can see and would be better out of it guess youd like to send him on the journey into kingdom come suggested a weatherbeaten little man near at hand who looked like a sailor i just would said the young man panting what does the ruffian mean by making me a target for his brutal wit hed leave the world fast enough if i had my way lie still this to redhead who was rising but the prostrate man did not obey the injunction having some fight left in him yet he scrambled to his feet and rushed with a lowered head at his enemy like a bull but the other was ready he skipped aside and the redhead met the wood of the counter with a sickening thud this time he dropped insensible the sailor man knelt beside the defeated i guess youd better skip lancaster said he youve done it this time an the police are coming it was not the police but the attendants who forced their way through the crowd in the bar seeing this lancasters friend by name dicky baird and by profession an idler of the west end seized his chums arm and dragged him out of the bar by main force no use waiting for a summons said dicky when the two were in the vestibule i think youd better get home frank the other stared at a poster which announced that a new musical comedy would be produced that night at the piccadilly theatre with miss fanny tait in the chief part im not going till i see her he said pointing to this name what fairy fan why all the row was about her because he abused the woman shes a good sort and i like her very much you know i do but theres no love not on your part perhaps but starth loves her and you knocked him down i wish id killed him said lancaster between his teeth dont talk rashly frank said the other with uneasiness if anything goes wrong with starth youll get into trouble malice aforethought said lancaster carelessly pshaw the man isnt hurt hell be up and swearing before the play begins it seemed that he was right for a tall bulky dark man approached with a smile starths all right said he with a nod youve swelled his eye a bit frank but thats all berrys going to put him into a hansom and now wed better get to our seats the others assented and the trio moved into the theatre as they passed down the steps leading to the stalls they caught a glimpse of captain berry conducting a swaying figure to the door how did the row begin asked dicky when they were seated starth said i didnt know who my father was said frank well you dont do you thats neither here nor there starth has nothing to do with my domestic business hm said baird to himself thoughtfully frank lancaster was a dark horse and although dicky had known him for some years he was not aware of his private history lancaster kept that to himself and seemed unnecessarily annoyed by the question of baird dicky could see nothing in starths remark which should lead to a free fight though to be sure fairy fans name had likewise been mentioned however frank seemed indisposed to speak and like a wise man baird held his usually toofree tongue miss tait commonly known as fairy fan was a popular musichall star who danced gracefully and sang sweetly for a salary largely in excess of her merits she had deserted the halls for the theatre and tonight was her first appearance in the seaside girl hence the large audience and the subdued excitement at the present moment she was dancing like a fay and singing like a lark but the three men nevertheless talked all the time jolly little thing aint she said dicky she comes from the californian slopes did she pick up those diamonds there asked the dark man who was a rhodesian called darrel and acquainted with stones of price no banjo berry who is her uncle gave them to her hes a rich man and lavishes his money on his niece why does he let her appear on the boards then asked darrel heavily ask frank here hes a friend of berrys im not growled lancaster still ruffled by his late encounter i cant bear the creature his niece is worth a dozen of him is she his niece questioned the rhodesian millionaire yes theres no doubt about that i respect miss berry immensely i thought her name was tait on the bills in private shes miss fanny berry her uncle is rich but in spite of that shes so vain that she likes to appear on the stage i like her and youre in love with her contradicted baird a trifle anyone would love such a pretty woman but i wouldnt ask her to marry me no starth will do that she wont have him said frank snappishly hes a bad lot a very sore lot at present put in baird smiling its his own fault replied lancaster why cant he leave me alone its not the first time hes quarrelled with me because he knows you are a rival in the affections of fairy fan rubbish dicky dont get that bee in your bonnet starth can marry her for all i care i merely admire her and only came into contact with her when berry wrote asking if i could write her a couple of songs i came and saw and and she conquered said darrel who is berry i fancy ive met him before if hes the same man he hasnt any morals well say principles remarked baird berrys a fierytempered tom thumb who talks american slang through his nose concerning an interesting past of a superlatively shady description been a south sea blackbirding skipper from the looks of him and i expect he made his money in that way ever met him los angeles now i come to think of it said darrel frank looked up uneasily who is he anyhow dont know responded the millionaire imperturbably he was running an apple orchard when i dropped across him clean shot too baird laughed sounds like a retired pirate of sorts but hes on the square now he and miss berry have rooms in bloomsbury and go to church and have the entry of some decent houses frank knows all about them only that shes a nice woman and a good woman and that berry is a ruffian he wont let starth marry her i hope not said darrel darkly ive known starth a long time and hes a bounder but hes got an uncommonly pretty sister as beautiful and sweettempered as he is the reverse hush lets stick to the play were talking too much frank certainly couldnt be accused of chattering as he was rather silent even the rattling chorus and the jokes of the low comedian could not banish the frown from his brow and he became aware that a man was looking at hima fairfaced effeminate little man with light eyes and a deprecating manner lancaster in no very good temper scowled at the man who immediately turned away his head as he did so the first act ended amidst loud applause an eighteen months run if the other act is as silly pronounced baird but the management wont keep fan all that time shes as freakish as a cat and her uncle is rich enough to allow her to snap her fingers at the treasury she is a cat from the looks of her said darrel grimly come out boys ill put up the drinks dicky assented affably as the night was warm but frank remained behind i dont want to run the risk of meeting starth again he might come back to fetch his sister said the big rhodesian yonder she is in a box with an old lady what a pretty girl said the frivolous dicky and departed lancaster raised his glasses rather curious to see what miss starth was like he beheld a slender dark girl as unlike her brother as possible plainly dressed in some gauzy stuff with a string of seed pearls round her neck she looked about twenty years of age but might have been even younger apparently she had all the unappeasable curiosity of youth for her dark eyes roved round the theatre with great eagerness finally they rested on frank and she flushed when she found he was looking directly at her first she looked away after the manner of girls then she stole a stealthy glance at the rude young man and finally became engrossed in conversation with the elderly lady who was her companion frank still looked he was most polite to the sex but this face interested him so much that he stared almost rudely twice their eyes met in spite of miss starths ostentatious indifference she coloured and heto his astonishmentlikewise blushed there was something about her which took his heart by storm to be sure he was susceptible where a woman was concerned but it seemed absurd to be fascinated by a girl after a few leaguelong glances still she was distinctly agreeable to him fairy fan he admired after the manner of youth but she was a pinkandwhite doll beside this glorious creature who looked like a queen where could his eyes have been to admire the fragile charms of miss berry when true beauty was to be found alone in a stately brunette with coils of shining hair and eyes like fathomless lakes in the starshine fan had been franks rosaline this vision of loveliness was his juliet which means in plain english that he had fallen in love at first sight but as he assured himself calmly such a passion was at once ridiculous and impossible all the same he continued to behold vanity until his divinity grew really angry and concealed herself behind an envious curtain which shielded her beauty at once lancaster became aware of his bad manners hang it i should like to apologise he thought as his friends returned and then considered dismally that he had quarrelled past all reconciliation with the brother of his angel and that there was no chance of a meeting starth hated frank virulently because miss berry openly approved of the young mans good looks and genuine talents but even before fairy fan appeared to enchant a london public starth and lancaster had never been able to meet without snarling at one another like dogs frank was not to blame being goodnatured and much too indolent to fight but starth snapped at everyone that he should have so charming a sister was extraordinary even dicky the most critical of men thought so ripping girl miss starth said he i didnt notice grunted lancaster not wishing to have baird know too much on account of that gentlemans long long tongue he might repeat things to starth who could find offence everywhere the second act requires no description it was like the first but slightly more incoherent fairy fan had it all her own way as the low comedian had not yet had time to invent his part when the curtain fell on a pronounced success with fan standing in the midst of flowers baird bustled out to the bar again with darrel and his chum it was to discuss the prospects of the play that they went frank did not notice that the neat man with the light eyes was following them he was taken up with the weatherbeaten berry who rejoiced over the triumph of his niece he was a small man and had a hard face that might have been hewn out of ironwood his lips were tightly closed his eyes were grey and closeset and he carried himself in a bouncing aggressive way which must have cost him many a fight in the naked lands where bounce is not approved of berrycaptain by courtesylooked quite out of place amidst civilised surroundings a peajacket a tarpaulin hat a streaming bridge and a rocking plunging tramp ship would have been more in keeping with his piratical appearance why such a captain kidd should accompany his niece to london and play the part of a sober citizen puzzled a great many people baird amongst the number but banjo berrysuch was his odd namealways explained profusely having no call to do so whereby the more astute assumed and not unreasonably that he had something to hide well said this mariner gaily i guess the plays a go a great success said frank so indifferently that the little man looked at him sharply lancaster was wont to be more enthusiastic where fairy fan was concerned she sang your chanty well he remarked following them to the bar first rate assented lancaster hows starth sent him home in a cab of sorts replied berry still puzzled i guess hell wake up and apologise tomorrow morning not to me said frank aggressive at once in spite of the charming sister i dont want to have anything to do with him ah pistols and coffee for two is your idea of a meeting was the captains reply youd like to see him buzz into the everlasting darkness i guess before frank could reply his arm was plucked in the crowd he did not see who it was for the moment there was a rush of thirsty souls to the bar and berry disappeared in the mob still the unknown kept his hand on lancasters arm and drew him towards the door with a gentle pressure rather surprised frank allowed himself to be so drawn thinking it was one of his friends but when the crowd grew thin he found himself face to face with the small neat man well said frank interrogatively im glad you didnt answer said the man with the light eyes it is dangerous to answer that man captain berry why the stranger opened the swing door and stepped into the street he did not even wait for frank but walked along the pavement dexterously avoiding the people as he walked taken by surprise by this odd demeanour lancaster followed and managed to catch up with the man as he was turning into a side street which was deserted what do you mean asked lancaster catching the man by his coat who are you the other stopped under a lamppost and laughed in an elfish way no matter who i am he said in a precise voice but what i am is another and more important matter well what are you asked lancaster more and more puzzled a man who can read faces and hands and tell the secrets of the future said the other gravely bah was franks disgusted exclamation a charlatan just so a charlatan yet i am sufficiently interested in you to warn you against coming danger do you know me no i dont know your name or your face nor anything about you i happened to be in the bar when you hit that redheaded man and i saw that the little fellow captain berry is that his name well he was trying to foment the quarrel he is your enemy nonsense he has no cause to be my enemy that is the worst kind of enemy to haveone who pretends friendship and strikes in the dark i read your face sir and the face of the redheaded man if you two meet again he hesitated well asked frank sharply if we meet one of you will die in spite of his scepticism lancaster felt a chill run through his veins at this speech rubbish he said roughly which one i shant tell you that replied the unknown you may consider my reply rubbish also but there is that in your face sir which hints at coming trouble your fate and the fate of the redheaded man are bound up together also there is a woman how do you know that asked frank thinking of fan she is a relative of the redheaded man said the unknown and it is probably here he broke off abruptly i shant tell you any more i may be wrong i may be right but the signs are there what signs goodnight sir said the man and passed swiftly away before frank could retain him lancaster walked to his rooms without returning to the theatre he laughed at the warning so vague and absurd did it seem all the same it haunted him and he had cause to remember the man afterwards he never saw the seer again but as after events proved undoubtedly the man was no charlatan chapter ii reaping the whirlwind lancaster was by way of being a journalist and managed to struggle along on an inadequate income he had no influence and sweated freely for his money a few farseeing editors assured him of a brilliant future but did not seem anxious to assist him to realise their prophecies no one knew who lancaster was or where he came from as he never spoke of his past for five years he had been in town and unable to do anything else had drifted into journalism but in his heart he cherished the notion of startling london with an uptodate novel pending the joy of waking up to find himself famous he acted as theatrical critic for the daily budget a paper which paid the lowest prices for the best procurable talent and eked out his income with stray articles occasionally he wrote verses and in this way had made the acquaintance of fairy fan who had read some of his attempts in the papers and thought that he might compose words fit for her rosy mouth to sing she took a fancy to him for he was handsome and wellbred but even miss berry pretty and astute woman as she was could not learn anything of lancasters past cleverly as she tried to find out her uncle using coarser methods tried also but failed likewise only to one man had frank unbosomed himself and that was to eustace jarman who had first extended to the lonely young man a helping hand a memory of starths words made lancaster wonder if jarman had revealed anything and he would have sought out his friend to ask him directly had not jarman dwelt in essex however frank concluded that starth had merely made the remarks about his parents in a casual way and without any real knowledge so he dismissed that matter easily from his mind but he could not so easily dismiss the memory of the quarrel especially as the charming face of miss starth floated persistently before his mental vision jarman had introduced frank to starth three years before and the two men had never got on well together by mutual consent they avoided one another until miss berry brought them together to quarrel over her beauty starth thereafter became more and more insulting until his behaviour resulted in the row of the previous night had frank not seen the beautiful sister he would not have cared much having small regard for the brother as it was he felt depressed the next morning seeing in that final quarrel an insurmountable barrier to making acquaintance with his divinity being in this frame of mind he was both surprised and pleased to receive a note from starth asking him to call that afternoon between four and five it seemed that starth wished to apologise as he had gone rather farso he stated in his noteon the previous night lancaster was astonished that starth should behave thus reasonably the action was unlike him but as the olive branch was held forth and as there was a chance of meeting the sister lancaster decided to accept no answer was required so starth evidently expected him to come frank finished his work for the day and went to his rooms to dress himself more smartly if miss starth were to be present he wanted to appear at his best but if she were not it was at this point that lancaster sat down to consider how did he know that the note might not be a trap he thought it strange that starth should come forward in this way and at a second meeting the man might try to revenge himself for his punishment a black eye is not forgiven easily by any man and starth was the last person to let bygones be bygones then again if there was to be trouble miss starth would not be there and the careful dressing would be wasted lancaster was no coward but he did not wish to accentuate his bad relations with starth he had half a mind to send round stating that he could not come but the hope that after all his divinity might be present decided him to go having made up his mind he completed his toilet and ended by stowing away a pistol in his hip pocket it was a loaded derringer which frank sometimes took with him when he went round the slums on dangerous business connected with his journalistic work on the present occasion it was taken merely to intimidate starth should he have arranged a trap the mans a coward thought frank as he issued forth into the july sunshine so if he threatens in any way i can show him the pistol if necessary id rather use my fists as i did last night but for all i know he may have a revolver handy its as well to be on the safe side all the same he rather despised himself for this precaution and twice was on the point of returning to his room to discard the weapon still starth was a dangerous man and might use something lethal only to be met with by a revolver and if nothing happened no one would ever know that helancaster was thinking of himselfcarried a pistol in spite of his experience of life frank was callow in many ways else he would not have armed himself in so unnecessary a manner starth lived in a south kensington side street a blind alley where the houses were small and each was fronted by a weedy garden lancaster found himself after a brisk walkhe never took a cab unless forced to and disliked a bus ridefacing a blank dismal house of two storeys with green shutters it had not been painted for years and the front was blistered weatherstained discoloured and generally dilapidated some attempt had been made to cultivate the patch of ground in front but beyond rearing a few marigolds and pansies the attempt had not been successful up a path bordered by oyster shells frank advanced to a rustic porch of green latticework entwined with dusty creepers and rang a jingling little bell whose shrill summons he could hear while waiting he casually noticed that the righthand window was slightly open although the blind was pulled down before he could observe further the door opened so suddenly that it almost seemed as though the person behind had been waiting in the passage the person was a small sluttish servant with gooseberry eyes and a pasty white face she was attired in her best blue dress and wore a large picturehat trimmed with more flowers than adorned the garden also she had on gloves and carried a yellow umbrella as soon as she saw frank she burst into voluble speech yer the gent as wishes to see mr starth and i am glad to see you sir for he said as you was goin to be ere at four it now bein halfpast and im goin out my young man waiting for me this way sir and please be quick as i am in a hurry missus ave gone out too but the teas all ready and the kettle on the fire almost before she finished this incoherent address she conducted the astonished frank up a stuffy staircase and into a front room hastily shoving him into this she banged the door and hurried away presumably to meet her young man lancaster puzzled by this reception and by the mean look of the room in which he found himself halted at the door waiting for his host to speak starth was sitting in an armchair by the window with a book he threw this down and advanced to his visitor with outstretched hands im glad youve come lancaster he said eagerly i am so ashamed of myself that i hardly know what to say say nothing more said frank laying aside his hat and cane i am only too glad to come to an understanding i cant comprehend why you quarrel with me jealousy said starth quickly and sat down of me and miss berry well you neednt be i dont love her starth pulled down the blind so as to prevent his discoloured eye showing up too badly i thought you were to marry her he remarked certainly not such an idea never entered my head who said so captain berry frank looked puzzled then laughed i should have thought berry more ambitious for his niece i havent any money thats just it said starth slowly if you are poor how did you come to give her those diamonds i never did i heard you gave them to her starth laughed and glanced round the stuffy room would i live in this dogs kennel if i could afford such stones he said my dear lancaster im desperately hard up between my sister and myself there is enough to live on no more i saw your sister last night said frank yes she lives in essex but happened to be in town so i got her a box she went back this morning with mrs perth is that the lady who was with her starth nodded she and my sister live together in a small cottage at wargrove but i neednt bore you with my family history i want you to accept my apology i do starth but why did you mention my parents it was the only thing i could think of to make me angry i suppose hm you know nothing about me no is there anything interesting to know i fear not said lancaster my story is a dull one still i thought that jarman might have said something he said nothing i never asked about you responded the other quickly fact is lancaster i dont think you and i ever got on well together my fault im afraid as i have such a bad temper i am jealous too as i love miss berry and want to marry her you can for all i care said lancaster quietly i did admire her greatly but i never had any intention of marrying her as to the diamonds who told you that i gave them to her no one directly but berry hinted why should he hint said frank thoughtfully he knows im as poor as the proverbial church mouse do you think he wants me or expects me to marry his niece yes i do said starth promptly and that was why i grew jealous then i cant see his reason i have no money no position and no influence miss berry doesnt love me the captain says she does said starth quickly oh thats rubbish she likes me because i write her songs and we get on well together as for love frank shrugged his shoulders have you never been in love lancaster frank grew red and shook his head looking down meanwhile starths jealous eyes followed his every movement and he eagerly waited for an answer but none came frank could not bring himself to say that he had fallen in love with a girl he had seen but once and to say it to her brother in place of gratifying starths curiosity he changed the subject what a queer servant that was who admitted me he said she was quite angered because i had delayed her appointment with her young man had i known id have been punctual its tilly said starth carelessly a queer creature as you saya london slavey of the regular type i believe mrs bettsthats my landladygets her cheap from a workhouse i let her go to see her young man because mrs betts who keeps her well in hand is away at the wedding of some cousin or another ive got all the house to myself till nine oclock but i say lets have tea frank made no objection as he was thirsty and starth went down to get the hot water pending his return lancaster strolled about the room and looked at the photographs there was one of the beautiful girl he had seen on the previous night and he nearly stole it also he was taken with a gorgeous portrait of a tall thicklipped negress which had an arabic inscription written at the foot who is this starth asked frank when his host returned with the teatray and a kettle of hot water starth glanced at the photograph a girl called balkis i believe she comes from zanzibar i met her at the docks when i was exploring an opium den hm she looks as though she had a temper she has took a fancy to me and gave me her picture with that writing its something about allah and good luck i believe i saw her a good many times at that opium shop she runs it i believe lancaster sat down while starth made ready the tea it struck him from these remarks and from a certain strange odour in the room that starth smoked opium perhaps the drug was accountable for his queer tempers and utter disregard of decency frank began to be rather sorry he had quarrelled with the man since if he smoked opium he was to a certain extent not accountable for his actions starth with his swollen face and discoloured eye looked queer and grim and had a haggard look about him which hinted at excess of some sort here you are said starth passing along a cup do you take sugar or perhaps he added as he handed over the basin you would like a drink of whisky teas good enough for me said frank sipping well starth im glad weve come to some sort of understanding i hate rows so do i but jealousy always makes my blood boil but you see youve no cause to be jealous i can see that now but berry kept hinting that it was an arranged thing between you and fan hm ill have a talk with him hes no right to make false statements of that kind i wonder what his game is im certainly not a desirable match for his niece putting aside the fact that she doesnt care two pins for anyone but herself are you sure of that lancaster said starth with rather an anxious look im mad about her and want to marry her i shouldnt like banjo berry for a connection myself said lancaster setting down his cup what a strange taste that tea has they never clean the kettles here said starth hastily its smoke or fur inside the kettle or something my tea tastes bad also frank refused another cup and smoked a cigarette while starth related his feelings for fairy fan in detail also he mentioned that he hoped to see much of lancaster and that he should like to introduce him to his sister this last remark made franks heart leap with joy but somehow he could not find words to thank his host starth seemed to recede a long way and his voice sounded like that of a phonograph lancaster tried to rise but sank back in his chair drowsily he felt sure that there was foul play as he saw faintly the man lean forward to scrutinise him but his brain was clouded his speech was thick and wave after wave of something deeper than sleep poured over him his last thought was something about opium being in the tea but he could not put this into words after that last effort of the mind to overcome the lethargy his head fell back and he became unconscious in after days frank never could be got to tell his dreams the mere memory of them would make him shudder far away in the land of sleep he wrestled with unknown foes and passed a time of sheer agony not to be paralleled by any experience of the waking hours he seemed to have slept for centuries when he came to himself on the sofa with a furred tongue and an aching head there was a faint light in the room as the blinds were up and for a few minutes the young man still half stupefied with the drug could not grasp the idea of his whereabouts then after an effort or two at thought his selfconsciousness came back with a rush he rose slowly and staggered into the centre of the room only to stumble over a body it was a body for he fell on top of it his memory became clearer with the horror of the discovery he remembered his visit the empty house the drugged tea and recalling his dread of foul play on the part of starth he slipped his hand round to his hippocket the derringer was gone when he made that discovery frank leaped to his feet with a strangled cry by this time he had his wits about him but still remained a vague fear of the thing on the floor his frock coat had been removed and cast on the carpet beside the sofa he found it by the feel and obtained a match out of the ticketpocket striking this he bent over the dead it was starth great heavens said frank under his breath starthdeadshot assuredly shot for there was a small hole under the left eye the bullet must have passed into the brain killing the poor wretch instantaneously as the match flickered out frank was left alone in the halfgloom beside this dead thing trying to think how the poor wretch had come by his death then it dawned anew on him that his pistol was gone that the man had been shot who had slain him what revolver had been used the first question he could not answer but the second answered itself since his weapon was gone it assuredly had been used to commit the murder but was it murder what about suicide frank tried to argue the case as he did so the clock on the mantelpiece struck nine the sudden tingle of the bell set his blood leaping he recalled how starth had expected mrs betts and tilly back at that hour and making a dash for his coat he hastily struggled into it he must not be found here with the dead man the row on the previous night his foolish words his weapon his being alone in the house with a man with whom he was well known to be on bad termsall these things would weave a rope to hang him realising his danger with a gasp frank lighted another match and found cane and hat but he had no more matches although he desired to search for the derringer all he wanted now was to get away and he hastened down the stairs in a state of agony the perspiration standing on his brow and his heart in his mouth there was no difficulty in opening the door he closed it again and went down the path through the gate and on to the road here a streetlamp threw a strong light under it stood a girl and a young man my sir said tilly catching sight of his face you have been a time with mr starth i ope he aint angered he lancaster waited to hear no more but walked rapidly down the lane he knew not whither all he wanted was to get away from the gallows from the dead chapter iii a friend in need popular prejudice regards essex as a damp marshy flat inhabited by mosquitoes rheumatic yokels and children of the seamist but eustace jarman dwelt on a farextending plateau whence from his study window he surveyed tilbury gravesend the mouth of thames river and vast tracts of meadowlands divided into irregular squares by erratic hedges his home was three miles from the nearest railway station as the crow flies and being cut off from civilisation by acres of furzegrown common was as isolated as his misanthropic soul could desire jarman had the reputation of being a solitary man and those who knew him in literary circles hinted at the destroying influences of the inevitable woman but eustace never explained after a journalistic career in town he disappeared into the essex wilds and devoted himself to writing musichall sketches short tales and articles on countries he had visited as he had been round the world twice or thrice and knew the manners and customs of various peoples he was well paid for his contributions the cost of living at wargrove was nil and jarman was supposed to be saving money at times he would vanish into the far east or seek south america when there was a chance of trouble between tinpot republics but he always returned to his essex plateau to live a hermits life miss cork waited on him and looked after his simple needs and miss cork mentioned frequently that he was the queerest gent she ever set eyes on the shanty as he called his place was an old farmhouse buried amongst elm and oak trees and surrounded by an orchard and a flower garden all more or less in ruins jarman would not allow the place to be tidied up as miss cork suggested loving better the eccentric untrimmed look of his property the hedges grew sprawling at their own sweet will long grass flourished up to the very door and poppies sunflowers and straggling rosetrees showed above this miniature jungle eustace possessed three rooms two of which were occupied by beds for himself and any chance friend and a third apartment large and airy which served as a study a diningroom a smokingroom and a parlour in this last were collected trophies of jarmans travels ranging from japanese curiosities to south sea oddities books alsobut these were everywhere and overflowed from the study into the passages into the hall up the stairs and in some degree into the bedrooms everywhere there was a scent of tobacco smoke and eustace loafed about in flannel bags with an old shooting jacket and a worn cricketing cap on the back of his head the house was not very large and jarman was over six feet but he moved with a dexterity remarkable in so huge a man and was as handy as a woman in looking after his housekeeping miss cork lived at the back and merely acted as lieutenant in carrying out her masters orders when she wished to introduce feminine innovations eustace protested he loved his savage bachelor life and his hermitcrab shell too much to desire newfangled customs extra civilisation especially of the womanly kind meant extra work and eustace was a lazy man it was a wet july night when lancaster sought this refuge all day it had been raining hard and jarman was just thinking of putting on his waders for his usual walk when miss cork entered to announce a visitor on her heels followed frank and eustace stared when he saw him the stare was excusable for lancaster appeared in a silk hat a frockcoat and patentleather boots he was mired with clay from the roads torn by the furze of the common and dripped like an insane rivergod also without invitation he collapsed into the nearest chair while jarmans jaw fell still lower at the sight of his white face his clenched mouth and his glassy eyes miss cork half blind saw few of these things but she withdrew to the kitchen to soliloquise on the costume of the visitor inappropriate alike to the weather and the country meanwhile jarman behind closed doors continued to stare what is the matter he asked at last i caught the last train from liverpool street explained frank in faint tones and walked across the common im dead beat give me a whisky and soda jarman supplied this refreshment speedily and again demanded explanations but youd better get into a dry kit before you make em said he bustling about what a crazy rig to negotiate the country in been drinkin do i ever drink you ass not your style i know but thats the sort that generally goes a mucker in the end cut into my bedroom and ill hand you out a few things hang it man hold up lancaster who had lurched against the big mans shoulder pulled himself straight and tried to smile jarman could see that the poor young fellow was on the verge of hysterics being overwrought and quite broken down therefore he spoke roughly to brace the slack nerves with a few choice expletives he chased frank into the bedroom made him strip to the skin and after a thorough towelling saw him inducted into a pair of flannel trousers and a faded blazer together with a woollen shirt and a pair of old slippers then he demanded if frank was hungry and led him back to the parlour no im not hungry said frank dropping into a chair near the fire for eustace approved of a fire when the rain fell but another whisky not a bit of it youll get squiffy you must eat but i want to tell you later later meantime bread and meat jarman looted the kitchen and having sent miss cork to bed boiled the kettle and returned with a tray this he placed before his guest and stood over him while frank forced ham and bread down a most unwilling throat then he gave the young man a pipe mixed him a second glass of whisky of the weakest description and demanded explanations i can give them in one word said frank now more composed murder jarman stared again and whistled then he went to see that the door was closed and returned to his seat who have you been killing no one but im in danger of being accused i am innocenti swear i am innocent eustace all right old man replied jarman patting his junior on the back i know you wouldnt come to me if you were guilty if i were would you shelter me hm depends upon the kind of murder i dont mind a fair fight sort o killing fact ive shot a man or two myself in the great waste lands but i didnt shoot starth i really didnt starth what is he dead dead shot dead but not by menot by me eustace chewed his pipe and stared into the fire pulling hard he appeared to be worried poor girl said he at length frank understood on the instant does she love her brother do you know her asked eustace without looking up lancaster shook his head i saw her last night at the theatre her brother insulted me and asked me to see him today as he wanted to apologise wait jarman threw up his hand the whole truth if you please im telling the truth if you will only listen apologising doesnt sound like starth objected eustace i thought so when i got his note and i am convinced now that his invitation was a trap to have you shot how do i know he was shot himself by whom i cant say i was lying in a stupor when it happened druggedwith opium hinted jarman yes did you know that starth all along jarman placed the tips of his fingers together see here frank i know miss starth very well she lives here with an old lady called mrs perth their cottage is only a stones throw away from my diggings i met the brother there in the long ago and and introduced him to me i wish you hadnt its too late now seeing that the mans dead to raise objections i never approved of walter starth a bad lota very bad lot he never liked you i dont know why but i didnt think it would come to this jarmanfrank started from his seatyou dont suppose sit down you ass jarman pushed lancaster back into his chair i wouldnt take things so quietly if you had killed him barring that im glad the mans out of the world he was no use in it my own wordsmy own words when and where at the piccadilly theatre last night i shouted them in the bar after i knocked him down hm shouldnt talk like that frank its foolish i know it is im in a fix thats why i come to you well said eustace refilling his briar the best thing you can do is to tell me everything from the start where am i to start from you know about fairy fan yes and about starths love for her he looked upon you as a rival and the knowledge didnt increase his liking for you well frank straightened himself and forthwith delivered a succinct account of all that had taken place from the encounter on the previous night to his leaving the house in sand lane south kensington i took the underground to liverpool street and caught the down train by the skin of my teeth i didnt even return to my diggings as i was afraid of being arrested im a marked man now eustace the police will hunt me down and i am innocent why didnt you give the alarm when you found starth dead man alive that would have delivered me into the power of the law i know that just asked the question to see what youd say hm its a nasty case for you the circumstantial evidence i knowi know who knows better than i frank rose to pace the room anxiously i spoke foolishly about starth being better out of the world at the theatre i took my pistol with mei was alone in the house with himthat servant saw me leave and i daresay noticed my agitation jarman its awful i dont see how im going to get out of the danger theyll hang me steady old man they wont hang you i wont let them then youll help me to get out of the country no if you cut youll surely be caught by tomorrow every seaport in the kingdom will be watched you must stay here but ill be traced i dont think so plenty of men go up and down on this line in frockcoats and tall hats i dont suppose anyone took particular notice of you the train was crowded all the better theres safety in a crowd no frank dont leave england stop here and ill fix you up some sort of disguise the very daring of the thing may be your salvation the police will never think that you will remain so near town ill make things safe with miss cork and shes the only person who has seen you when we get time to turn round we can sift matters out what a good chap you are jarman nothing of the sort if you were guilty i shouldnt chance the risk of being an accessory after the fact as it is ill see you through the business its a nasty affair theres no denying that i expect the sister will come over tomorrow to ask for my assistance oh frank jumped up nervously do you think shell recognise me of course not she only saw you once and that at a distance besides i dont suppose she inquired your name finally as i intend to disguise you she wont guess that anything is wrong you work the typer yes good then youll stop here as my secretary ill dictate and youll work the machine with your moustache cut off dyed black hair a stained face and a pair of goggles for weak eyes no one will recognise you but no one hereabouts knows me except miss starth and she only saw me in the glare of the electrics for a few minutes frank youre an ass the police gazette will have a full description of you everyone will be on the lookout thank heaven youre of the commonplace type pink and white fair hair blue eyes wellgroomed military figure and all the rest of it how will my blue eyes match black hair well say youre irish and you can fix up a brogue trust me ive been in several holes myself and know how to get out of the deepest but jarman who do you think killed the man i cant say that until i know more the reason is to be found in walter starths past he has sown the wind pretty freely and i can hardly wonder at his reaping this whirlwind do you think he intended to trap me asked lancaster yes hes not the man to apologise and the house being empty on that evening shows that starth was up to some trickery maybe he intended to kill you however he never intended to die himself how do you know he may have committed suicide bosh starth was the last man in the world to have such an idea he wasnt cowardly enough i will say that besides if he wished to commit suicide he would scarcely invite you to see him do it i dont know he might have left a letter saying i shot him and then got out of the world to hang me jarman shrugged his huge shoulders thats an extreme measure of revenge if he wanted to get you into trouble he would certainly like to be present to see how you took your gruel another thing from what you say your pistol was used i think so at all events it was taken from my pocket hm he searched you anything else missing the note in which he asked me to call that proves starth set a trap i thinkno i dont i cant deliver an opinion until i know more go to bed and sleep i cant sleep said frank passionately im ruined but for all that he dropped into a deep slumber almost as soon as his head touched the pillow worn out poor wretch said eustace chapter iv two hundred pounds reward what do you think of my new secretary miss cork asked jarman next morning when his housekeeper was laying the table he put the question purposely to arrange matters for the disguise i didnt see quite rightly mr jarman my eyes being weak young and dark and irish his eyes are weak to the extent of blue glasses i didnt see them sir no poor chap he broke them crossing the common left his baggage in london and got lost in our country oh hell know it soon mr jarman im an essex woman myselfbillericay wayand the country is easy whats the gentlemans name sir desmond said eustace lying with an unmoved face desmond oneil ill remember sir and oh miss cork i shouldnt mention about his late arrival and loss of baggage if i were you the irish are sensitive as well i know from politics mr jarman no sir ill say nothing miss cork was a tall lean woman with watery grey eyes and grey hair screwed into a castiron knob behind her lips were thin and her nose red by reason of tightlacing miss cork had a good figure and improved it in her own opinion by making her waist smaller she usually wore a grey dress with cloth slippers and moved like a shadow for many years she had been with eustace who had produced her from a london policecourt where she was being charged with vagrancy but he never told anyone this and miss cork bore a high character but she was not popular as she never gossiped and a woman who does not gossip in a village is not fit companion for those who want to know their neighbours affairs eustace knew that she would hold her tongue nevertheless he was glad that her limited vision had not been able to take in frank lancaster as he had been as it was mr desmond oneil appeared late at the breakfast and miss cork bringing in the bacon and eggs silently avowed the truth of her masters description the new secretary was brownskinned with dark hair and a cleanshaven face shaded about the eyes with blue spectacles miss cork was rather doubtful about the cleanshaving from the glimpse she got of him on the previous night she fancied he had worn a moustache and this she mentioned to jarman it was a smear of clay explained eustace the poor chap was tumbling in the mud all the time were you mired oneil he asked aloud i was that responded the irish gentleman wondering why his host kicked him under the table the mud do splash high in essex said miss cork im a billericay woman myself mr oneil then she left the room and jarman explained but frank continued uneasy i dont like the looks of that woman he said is she honest oh quite except what she says about billericay shes invented the idea of being a native of those parts as the villagers here dont like strangers but shes been with me for three years i picked her up in london where well it isnt fair to give her away shes had a past although i dont know the rights or wrongs of it but shell hold her tongue suppose a reward is offered will she sure she owes me too much to play me false said jarman pouring out the coffee and wheres the reward to come from the government pooh government wont offer much even if it offers any which isnt likely no one else will plank down the money miss starth hasnt much and there are no relatives make your mind easy about the reward there wont be a cent offered for your apprehension whats miss starths name asked frank who made a fair breakfast mildred responded jarman with a flush shes the sweetest girl you ever met i saw that from the glimpse i caught of her said lancaster and wondered why jarman coloured through his tan he scented a rival but could not be sure and of course was unable to ask questions besides in spite of his newlyborn passion his position was so dangerous that he had but one thought namely how to escape being hanged on circumstantial evidence frank wished to talk of the matter the moment breakfast was over but this eustace would not allow youll have enough of it before you win free he said we must wait until we hear what the newspapers have to say i daresay theres nothing in the morning lot but this afternoon we may read something then again i expect to see mildredi mean miss starth shes sure to be wired for frank noticed the slip and became convinced that eustace admired the girl more than a little however his brain was too filled with his own danger to think of anything else and he accompanied jarman on an exploring tour round the village the idea was that his arrival and appearance and position as secretary should be made as public as possible so that he might become an accepted fact after the first few days the villagers would accept him as part of the shanty household and cease to discuss him the subsequent indifference would be another element of safety so round the village that afternoon the two went arminarm jarman took his new secretary into several shops and then to the postoffice which was conducted by a fat woman who read all the letters and made all the mischief she could early as it was she had a piece of news oh mr jarman said she puffing for the day was hot and muggy after the rain whatevers come to miss starth i saw her driving like a mad thing to catch the two train and she only keeps a donkey tooleastways its mrs perth who does i suppose she was going to town mrs baker then i hope it isnt to a funeral mr jarman for her face was as white as a winding sheet ah well it aint none of our business no said eustace emphatically it certainly is not thats what i say replied mrs baker not seeing the intended rebuke as i always says to baker if people managed their own affairs without being talked about people wouldnt be so bothered and how do you like the country sir this last was to frank it is extremely pretty replied lancaster cautiously ah when youre here long enough youll say so sir but i suppose youve just come he came last night mrs baker from ireland dear me i get butter from there and will you be staying long sir i hope so answered lancaster seeing why jarman had brought him into the company of this inquiring lady i am mr jarmans secretary well im glad youve a companion at last mr jarman though a wife would be more to a single gentlemans mind and i always thought goodmorning interposed eustace hastily and left the shop tucking a bundle of newspapers and letters under his arm when they got some distance along the road he laughed what do you think of mrs baker he asked she seems to be a kind of gazette i suppose you took me in so that she could talk of my personal appearance and my engagement as a secretary and all the rest of it precisely the wider you are known the safer you will be mrs baker will describe your appearance and detail how you came from ireland where she gets her butter well send a few letters through her hands addressed to desmond oneil and then shell drop talking so even if you are traced by any chance frank there will be no danger of a detective connecting you with the man who is wanted lancaster shuddered its like a nightmare he said yesterday i was a free man with a career before me now im an outlaw with a price set on my head its unpleasant but waitwait time works wonders the real criminal may be discovered let us hear what news has come to rose cottage is that where miss starth lives yes she and mrs perth share the place their united incomes are just enough to keep them in comfort is miss starth engaged asked lancaster with a side glance no said the other with unnecessary fierceness why do you ask well shes so pretty that i thought oh bother your thinking broke in eustace testily mildred isnt the girl to get engaged in a hurry you seem to know her well calling her by her name ive known her for some years and as she is something of a poetess i help her to get her poems into print she looks on me as a kind ofof father added jarman colouring frank nodded he guessed the truth but was too languid to argue it but he couldnt help asking what mrs baker had been about to observe when eustace left the shop was she speaking of miss starth i dont know mrs baker is by way of being a matchmaker and always couples names there was a rumour that i was engaged to mildred it wasnt true no ive had enough of women seven years ago in frisco jarman checked himself impatiently whats the use of raking up old tales you seem very interested in miss starth naturally said lancaster sadly seeing what i am supposed to have done if she knew she would denounce me not on the evidence you have placed before me said jarman shes a sensible girl and the death of her brother will add to her income what an unpleasant speech said frank in vexed tones we live in a world of facts my boy besides that beauty is no loss by this time they had arrived at the common here jarman turned down a shady lane and passed through an arcade of chestnut trees at the end of this was an open space surrounded by trees and amidst these a thatched cottage that might have come out of a fairytale from the quaint look of it the walls were whitewashed the windows of lattice work and in front of it flourished a garden filled with oldfashioned flowers evidently the delight of those who had planted them a white paling fence separated it from the lane and over the gate of this leant an elderly lady frank recognised mrs perth she was a delicate old dame with an ivoryhued face smooth white hair and dressed severely in black from head to foot even to a black straw hat she beckoned to eustace he knew well enough why she was in mourning but for obvious reasons asked questions why are you in black mrs perth no bad news i hope i dont know if you call it bad or good she replied with some asperity walter has been murdered frank in the background winced and dug his cane into the turf but eustace took the intelligence with wellfeigned surprise murdered mrs perth how terrible who murdered him ah thats what has to be discovered mildred received a letter this morning telling her that walter had been found last night shot through the head in his rooms in sand lane also he was stabbed in the breastright through the heart stabbed also began frank incautiously when jarman interposed my new secretary mrs perthmr desmond oneil he comes from ireland i am happy to meet you mr oneil said the old lady in a most stately manner what was it you said i waswasonly expressingmymy surprise stammered frank that the man should be stabbed as well as shot put in jarman ever watchful i dont wonder at it wasnt one mode of death enough apparently not the shot must have killed him too as it was under the right eye the right eye objected frank and it was on the tip of his tongue to correct the speech but he swallowed his words how horrible you may well say that we dont know all the details yet said mrs perth addressing eustace and mildred has gone up to town to hear what she can the police are in possession of the house let us hope the assassin will be found let us hope so muttered frank and then aimlessly strolled away to a little distance to overcome a qualmish feeling hes rather a nervous chap explained jarman to mrs perth bad health and weak eyes he does indeed look pale mr jarman i fear im not looking well myself this morning no wonder said eustace the shock well it was a shock to us both interrupted mrs perth speaking low but to tell you the truth mr jarman mildred is more grieved than i am i never liked walter heaven forgive me for speaking ill of the dead butwell mr jarman you know what a bad man he was well bury his reputation with him poor wretch but this mrs perth did not seem inclined to do he led mildred a truly awful life she continued but for my influence she would have parted with her income to him moreover he wished her to marry one of his disreputable friends i never knew that cried eustace and looked displeased now that he had acquired the knowledge who is it mr denham you met him here when walter brought him down ugh jarman looked disgusted an effeminate little dandy but i dont think there was any harm in him mrs perth he was an ass pure and simple and disreputable insisted mrs perth he came from the united states and neither his manners nor his principles are english i believe he had money and for that reason walter desired to bring about the marriage eustace fidgeted i oughtnt to ask of course said he but did thisdid denham propose certainly not said the old lady promptly i saw to that no mr jarman say what you will walter is better out of the world than in it had he lived he would certainly have ended in gaol think what such a disgrace would have meant to mildred oh i think starth would always have kept on the safe side said jarman he had a great notion of looking after his own skin had starth have youhas his sister any idea as to who killed him no walters life was distinctly apart from ours i never allowed him to come to rose cottage more often than was necessary as he worried mildred and indeed myself he knew a bad lot of people and most probably met his death at the hands of one of them but i must say added mrs perth frankly that it was kind of this mr berry to inform us of the tragedy berry cried lancaster who had again strolled within earshot yes mr banjo berrya most peculiar name do you know him jarman answered for obvious reasons i was speaking about him this morning said he hastily i suppose the mention of the name in connection with this case recalled it to your mind oneil yes said frank taking his cue banjo berry is not an ordinary name did you ever meet him mrs perth no mr starths friends were not mine replied the old dame stiffly but this mr berry must have been most intimate with walter as he says in his letter to mildred she was again addressing jarman that he intends to offer a reward of two hundred pounds for the detection of the assassin lancaster dropped his stick in sheer amazement and to prevent any betrayal eustace took his arm with a significant pressure well mrs perth anything i can do shall be done he said cheerily you will let me know when miss starth returns certainly we shall both be thankful for your aid mrs perth retired into the cottage and the two friends went on their way frank in a state of bewilderment what does berry mean by offering a reward he gasped he means to hang you said jarman promptly but hes my friend hm heas you told mehas said that so often that i begin to think he is your enemy why i have given him no cause to hate me hm who knows he was a friend of starths that didnt matter said lancaster starth himself hinted that berry wished me to marry his niece if i was undesirable as her husband before i am still more undesirable as an outlaw jarman thought then asked questions how did you meet berry he called to ask me to write some songs for fairy fan having seen my poetry in the magazines i see observe frank berry sought your acquaintanceyou did not seek his he brought you and starth together again well he did i dropped starths acquaintance as you know because we didnt get on well he came to know fairy fan somehow and i was constantly meeting him there and this woman made running with you both well she was capricious some days she would snub me and flirt with starth on other days she would give him the goby and stick to me quite so she divided her favours to arouse jealousy between you frank coloured and looked uneasy if you put it that way she did what was berrys attitude i can hardly say save that whenever he was present starth and i always had a row hm a kind of male ate said jarman musingly berry was speaking to starth last night before starth insulted you yes but what has that got to do with it everything frank i tell you this man berry is at the bottom of the whole mystery he got you into the trouble now he means to hang you lancaster stared but his reason he asked jarman made an extraordinary reply because of the scarlet bat chapter v the inquest there was considerable excitement over the murder in sand lane especially in theatrical and journalistic circles the deceased was a wellknown figure in bohemia as for years he had consorted with actors with reporters and with sundry idle men who doing nothing themselves sought the company of those gifted with creative and mimetic powers walter starth being cursed with enough to live on had developed into a thorough loafer and chose bohemia to dwell in because its gaslight attractions were congenial to his mind occasionally he wrote an article or short story himself and sometimes walked on in a melodrama as a guest but he never did any real work preferring idle talk and constant drinking he was not a favourite with the slaves of the lamp but his burly figure and red head were excessively familiar consequently there was immense curiosity manifested regarding his untimely and terrible death who had killed him that was the first question which everyone asked but before the inquest took place it was known that frank lancaster was the assassin how the rumour had started no one knew but somehow within twentyfour hours after the discovery of the body lancasters name was on every lip now frank moving in the same bohemia was as great a favourite as starth was the reverse and at the outset everyone declined to believe that he had slain starth in so brutal a manner but afterwards the open enmity between the two men was recalled their attentions to fairy fan were mentioned and an exaggerated version was given of the quarrel in the piccadilly theatre when the inquest was held it was quite believed that lancaster was the guilty man his flight proved his guilt frank concealed under the dyed hair and brown face of desmond oneil wished eustace to be present at the inquest but jarman did not think it wise to put in an appearance captain berry will be there said he and as i stated before i am pretty sure that for some unexplained reason he is your enemy it is probable that he has made himself acquainted with as much of your sayings and doings as he can gather and he doubtless knows that i am your friend ill keep out of it frank lest captain berry should be induced to run down here and ask questions if so he might spot you in spite of your disguise besides well see all that there is to be seen in the papers and what isnt reported mildred will explain when she returns is she stopping in town for the inquest yes mrs perth has gone up also as the poor girl is much cut up a brother is a brother however bad he may be frank reflected for a few moments eustace said he at last do you remember what i told you about starth taunting me with not knowing my father thats true you know yes but afterwards he confessed that he said that only to get you dandered how did he know that he would rile me in that way why should he hit the bullseye with a potshot i fancied at the time that you might have told him something no denied jarman i keep my pores open and my mouth shut its probable that starth learnt something about your family history from the egregious berry but how does berry come to know anything thats one of the things we must find out one of the elements connected with his attitude towards you do you think he knows what the scarlet bat means yes he knows more than you do and on the face of it he purposely made your acquaintance to get you into trouble witness the way in which he brought you and starth together and secured fairy fans aid to make bad blood between you he wanted starth dead and you hanged at least i think so but of course im groping in the dark but whats hanging to it asked frank much puzzled i dont know money i should say so far as i know theres no money worth all this trouble on berrys part coming my way observe my son said jarman paternally so far as you know that is the crux of the whole thing you are as puzzled as myself over the meaning of the scarlet bat as its the only mystery about you save the reason of berrys enmity i take leave to jam the two mysteries together when they make one we may perhaps be able to get at the truth i dont see how were to start said lancaster knitting his brows nor i wait till the inquest is over then well have something to go upon berry will be a witness as to your quarrelling with the dead man berry will collect evidence to make the case blacker and when berry has done his worst well know his cards see then you and i will play our game with a hidden hand and now my son start in with the typing i have to get this story sent in tomorrow and you must do something to keep up the fiction of being my secretary while jarman and his friend were engaged in literary pursuits in essex the inquest was being held in london on the body of walter starth after the jury had surveyed the corpse and had particularly examined the bullet hole and the knife wound either one of which was sufficient to cause death the police inspector in charge of the case detailed facts he had been called in by mrs betts the landlady of the deceased and found walter starth dead in his sittingroom the body was on the floor with a wound in the heart and a bullet hole under the left eye no knife had been found but a pistolto be more accurate a derringer revolverwas discovered in the fireless grate there was no sign of a struggle everything was in its place the man apparently taken by surprise must have died instantly it was impossible to say whether he was knifed first or shot afterwardsbut that was part of the doctors evidence a card had been found torn in two and lying on the floor it bore the name of frank lancaster and an address on the silver plate of the derringer were the initials f l so the inspector presuming that lancaster owner of the pistol was the assassin had called at that address given on the card to arrest him at this point the coroner said that witness was assuming too much inspector herny submitted that the revolver used was the property of lancaster that the torn card bore his name and that the servant matilda samuels stated that a man answering to the description of lancaster had called to see the deceased also lancaster and starth had quarrelled at the piccadilly theatre on the night before the committal of the crime and lancaster had been heard to threaten the deceased finally captain berry whom the inspector had come into contact with at lancasters chamberswhere he was paying a visitstated that the two men were bitter rivals for the hand of his niece miss berry known on the stage as fairy fan why was not lancaster arrested asked the coroner he fled sir replied herny after the committal of the crime he did not return to his rooms the last seen of him was when he passed matilda samuels a few minutes after nine oclock the doctor who had examined the body deposed that either wound was sufficient to cause death from the condition of the body he thought that the man was killed between six and eight oclock it was the doctors opinion that starth had been shot first and stabbed afterwards he could give no absolute reason save that if the suspected person using a knife had thus secured his end he would hardly fire a shot into a dead body especially into the head the noise would have attracted the neighbours said the doctor and as the man was dead there would be no sense in acting so foolishly but in a vindictive spirit the assassin might certainly have mutilated the body with the knife i am convinced that he killed starth with the revolver the coroner interposed twice the witness had referred to the assassin as he how did he know that the criminal was a man the doctor answered that he did not know but the presumption favoured a male criminal it was improbable that a woman would be such a straight shot the doctor had been in south america and talked so and moreover the knife had been driven so deeply into the heart that he doubted whether a woman would have strength to make such a wound besides after firing the shot and securing her purpose a woman would never have had the nerve to stop in the room for over an hour there is no evidence that any woman stopped in the room for an hour the witness explained that he was thinking of inspector hernys remark of lancaster having been seen by the servant leaving at nine if lancaster were guilty he must have stopped in the room with his victims body for over an hour the murder took place between six and eight and lancaster did not leave till after nine most irregular these remarks said the coroner discontentedly you have no right to assume so much which wound killed the man either wound would cause death said the doctor sticking to his opinion but it is my belief the shot was the cause the mutilation was an afterthought when this witness stepped down mrs betts the landlady was called she knew nothing at all on that day she had gone to a weddingone of her cousinsand had been absent from midday till halfpast nine she returned to find tilly the servant in hysterics and her lodger dead she then called in the police mrs betts never knew that her lodger expected anyone he had said nothing to her she had never given tilly permission to go out during her absence and had severely reprimanded her for leaving the house it was tillys duty to have remained in until mrs betts returned the landlady declared that she never heard of any quarrel that she never saw lancaster and that she knew of no one likely to have killed her lodger mr starth was a quiet gentleman in the house whatever he may have been outside he rarely had a visitor captain berry was one of the few who called sometimes mr starth would go away for a week and always returned looking ill all this and much more of little account was extracted from the garrulous landlady but she could throw no light on the darkness of the crime she was succeeded as a witness by tilly whose evidence was delivered amidst floods of tears the poor little wretch had been severely frightened when she entered the house after leaving her young man i went to take mr starths lamp she said sobbing as he allays liked oil an not gas he was lying a deaden so i owled and dropped till missus shook me up there wasnt anyone in the house but that gentleman what called come out just as i wos talking to alf he looked white an queer like i spoke of the long time hed bin but he said nothin and jus cut were the two men on good terms asked the coroner well sir said tilly hesitating i cant ardly say for certing i wos left in the ouse when missus went to the weddin and mr starth he called me up arskin if i wos in the humour to see alf which is my young man a bricklayer i sed right oh and he tells me i could cut when a gentleman called to see him there might be a row ses he cos this gent ates me awful an i dont want you to ear bad language ses he so i gets ready for alf and when the gent comes after four and very late he wos i shoves him into the room and cuts did you hear the greeting given by starth to lancaster no i jus shoves him in and cuts it was lancaster who called yuss mr starth ses as the gent he expected wos lancaster by name an a fair yelleraired cove he seemed to ate im tho he ses as it wos lancaster who ated im finished tilly confusedly do you think mr starth got you out of the house so as to quarrel freely with his visitor yuss he said as there would be a row could anyone have got into the lower part of the house during your absence tilly stole a look at hardfaced mrs betts why bless yno sir i wos perticler about lockin an barrin the winders but mr starth could ave let anyone in i left him with mr lancaster thats all i knows wen i come back after leaving alf i sawr im dead wen i brought the lamp i nearly dropped with orror an after puttin the lamp down i ran to woller on the kitchen floor with fear till missus come an shook me up i wos too feared to holler fur the perlice when tilly was dismissed with a streaming face to the companionship of alf who lurked at the back of the court captain berry was called the little skipper looked harder than ever and delivered his evidence in a dry fashion with unwinking eyes and without saying more than was needful his language smacked of the great waste lands yes sir i guess i knew the corpse and lancaster they fair hated one another and there was always a shine between them when they met my niece sent em fair crazy they both wanted to marry her but she shied when they asked her she didnt want to run in double harness with either not much i tried to make them two boys friends but they wouldnt cotton to one another nohow starth did liquidate considerable and at the piccadilly theatre made trouble oh he came right along callin lancaster highandmighty names i wanted to put the stopper on starths jaw but lancaster sailed in and levelled him straight a pretty hitter is lancaster but i dont call it square of a man to wish another out of the world did lancaster say that asked the coroner berry spat and nodded several times you bet he said hed like to wring starths neck that hed be better out of the world than in it and that hed like to kick him out of the world oh there was an holy show i took starth home but he never let on that he was goin to make it up with lancaster next day they made no appointment as i heard on oh i guess lancaster had a row with starth in his own shanty and let out at him with the derringer a clean shot sir berry spat again the knife dont know anythin of th knife but i heard as lancaster was in frisco once so he might have imported a bowie yes sir that wound was made by a bowie berry said much more to the same effect and appeared to be quite sure that lancaster was guilty he was followed by baird who had been imported into the case by the skipper on a word to inspector herny baird admitted reluctantly that lancaster had threatened to kick starth out of the world and that the two men were on the worst of terms afterwards followed the cause of the trouble fairy fan exquisitely dressed and quite overcome with emotion deposed that the two men both asked her to marry them she refused both as she wished to stay with her dear uncle starth and lancaster hated one another but she never thought it would come to this starth usually started the quarrel but it was always lancaster who threatened he frequently expressed a wish that starth was dead lancaster told her that when slumming for his newspaper he sometimes carried a revolver the weapon produced in court was his she had seen it once it had belonged to his father lancaster said the elder lancasters name was frank also hence the initials on the silver plate the death of starth and the wickedness of lancaster had inflicted two several shocks on her so that she had been out of the bill at the piccadilly theatre she never thought lancaster was so bloodthirsty he always seemed to be such a quiet young man starths language was certainly most insulting mildred starth was then called she deposed that she was a sister of the deceased she lived in essex and saw very little of her brother they got on pretty well but she was fond of a quiet life and her brother was never happy unless he was leading a fast one on the night previous to the murder she was in town her brother was in the box at the piccadilly theatre that was the last she saw of him he seemed excited and a little overcome with drink she had heard him express hatred of lancaster but he was careful in her presence not to explain the reason she had never heard him threaten lancaster but twice she had heard him express fears lest lancaster should kill him he described lancaster as a ruffian from san francisco witness had never seen the accused man this formed the gist of evidence collected by the police and it was quite enough to permit the coroner making a speech strongly condemning lancaster he said that no doubt lancaster had intimated his intention of calling on starth as there was no reason to believe that starth who was manifestly afraid of his opponent had invited him to come lancaster had undoubtedly brought the revolver with him and it would seem that he had called on deceased with the intention of committing the murder perhaps starthas seemed probablehad torn lancasters card in two the pieces having been found and the insult had fired lancasters rage hence the murder it seems that no one heard the shot at all events no one could be found who could give such evidence the jury must therefore take the doctors opinion that starth had been shot between six and eight it was impossible to say why lancaster had remained behind with his victims body until nine but he apparently did as he was seen leaving the house by the servant matilda samuels the jury had inspected the body they had heard the evidence and the cause of death and on the facts before them would give their verdict this was easily given without the least hesitation the jury brought in a verdict of wilful murder against frank lancaster after that the crowd went out and the neighbourhood buzzed with excitement the one question asked was whether the police knew the whereabouts of the guilty man the police did not and to a reporter inspector herny confessed that he had absolutely no clue lancaster had vanished like a water bubble chapter vi a scrap of paper when the big dailies arrived at the shanty containing accounts of the inquest lancaster was perfectly convinced that jarman was right captain berry was his enemy sure enough though for the life of him frank could not conjecture the cause of such hostility also it seemed as though fairy fan was likewise against him sinceaccording to frankshe lied freely during her five minutes evidence starth might have asked her to marry him he explained to his friend when they were strictly alone but i certainly never did had you any idea of doing so lancaster hesitated not being willing to reveal his deepest and most sacred feelings even unto this staunch friend i dont know to what lengths my infatuation might have carried me oh then you did love her said jarman alertly that depends on what you call love i certainly had a fancy for her i thought her pretty and fascinating and she was always on her best behaviour with me i think she liked me more than a little eustace laid one big finger on the daily telegraph significantly it looks like it said he berrys put her against me replied frank in disturbed tones ill swear that she would never lie like that unless she was put up to it in some way she did like me although she was always too selfish to love anyone but herself jewels and laces carriage and pair admiration and cutting a dashthat was what fairy fan desired i could not offer her these things so she was careful not to compromise herself with me in any way i never got so far as asking her to marry me though i dont know but what i mightnt have been such an ass had i not changed my mind and what caused you to change your mind my son frank looked oddly at the big man and then fixed his eyes studiously on his pipe while making an evasive reply i saw someone i liked better he explained and then my admiration for fairy fan seemed to vanish like a cloud of smoke after i saw that other face i thought no more of fan and was able to tell starth with a clear mind that i didnt care about her id have danced at his wedding with pleasure hm and who is theno i have no right to ask that but to continue with the ladys evidence we know the the first and the second i never expressed any wish to her that starth should die i told her certainly that i sometimes carried a revolver when slumming but i never mentioned that it belonged to my father nor did i show it to her lastly i never said to fan that my fathers name was the same as my own was it well yes francis same as mine and did the revolver belong to him it did i got it from my aunt there was a silver plate on it with my fathers initials and my own of course she might have seen the revolver produced in court said jarman thoughtfully but why should she state that it was your fathers chance shot suggested frank no she knew the initials on it were your fathers and not yours hm shes in this conspiracy along with berry lancaster rose to pace the room in an exasperated manner why should there be a conspiracy he demanded youve asked me that before said jarman calmly and i have replied that i think money is at the bottom of it evidently berry forced his acquaintance on you and fairy fan made the running to create jealousy and bring about this catastrophe money my boy frank sat down in despair i dont see it he said pushing his hands into his pockets supposing there is money though for the life of me i cant think where its to come from why is it needful for me to be hanged before berry and fairy fan get it thats what puzzles me said eustace nodding if they wanted you out of the way they could have polished you off at sand lane as easily as they did starth do you think they killed him i do or else they employed someone else to do it but you were lured there to be inculpated in the crime and begad theyve managed finely to put the rope round your throat the moneywell i cant make it out considering the means theyve taken to get you into trouble but theres money in the matter some way and a mighty big sum too seeing theyve gone as far as murder but its all so vague and all supposition on your part i admit it all the same i can theorise in no other way unless well what is it i was going to say that perhaps its blackmail they may find out where you are and come forward offering to save your neck from being wrung if you pay them well that inculpates themselves besides if i am entitled to money of which i knew nothing it was easy enough for fan to marry me then all would have been square for berry and her without having had to slay starth and outlaw me sure enough groaned jarman who was getting more and more puzzled what it all means i cant say you have been outlawed in due form and the police are after you all you have to do is to remain quiet and not give yourself away as you nearly did to mrs perth the other day i hadnt my feelings under control said frank her talk of that stab in the breast startled me i cant understand why i didnt see it at the time did you feel the mans heart no the sight of the bullet wound under the left eye was enough for me all i wanted to do was to get away and hide well then as you had only a match and didnt feel the poor mans heart its easy to see how you missed the knife wound jarman took up the paper again the doctor says that starth was shot first and mutilated afterwards but why should the poor wretch have been mutilated at all i cant say it looks like a piece of savagery to me though to be sure i think mutilations a wrong word to be used for a clean stab if his ears had been cut off now or dont said frank with a shudder its horrible the man was shot dead and then stabbed to make sure thats how i read it well the person who sent him into the other world must have been anxious to make certain this time it was eustace who paced the room i only heard of one corpse being treated like that before where was that asked lancaster in san francisco some years ago who was it and why was he slain twicefor thats what it amounts to jarman did not answer immediately it was close on eight oclock and he stood looking out of his study window into the luminous night he and the secretary had been haymaking throughout the afternoon and the shaven expanse of a particularly rough lawn was dotted with haycocks picturesquely disposed beyond was the untrimmed hedge which jarman could never allow to be cut and under this grew straggling white rosebushes the flowers of which showed starlike in the glimmering light over the hedge through a vista of leafy elms could be seen the farextending country and the lights of tilbury in a long line like flying illuminated railway carriages a clear starry sky and a yellow harvest moon completed the beauty of the scene and the nightingales were singing wildly in the copse at the bottom of the meadow jarman heaved a sigh of delight its a peaceful scene said he with a look of pure pleasure why do i go into gaslight and noisy crowds when i can dwell always in this arcadia well you dont said frank not seeing where this speech would lead to you havent been in a london theatre or drawingroom for ages true enough i keep out of those things but i was saying that san francisco was noisy were you i didnt hear you said frank then as jarman again made no reply he spoke up rather pettishly his position didnt soothe his nerves in any way poor fellow you can trust me eustace how do you know i was becoming confidential because you talked sentiment about the scene before you eustace returned to his seat and laughed rather sadly youre an observer my son said he yes you have told me about your pastwe must have a repetition of that story some day for reasons you will easily understandnow ill tell you my romance about a woman yes did you ever know a romance that didnt include a woman and this one of mine included a corpse too shot and stabbed bothin the streets of frisco six or seven years ago the mans name was anchor are you talking of the corpse asked lancaster settling himself of what else he was a lucky miner and having made no end of money he built a new raw palace near frisco where he settled with his wife ah said frank intelligently shes the woman quite so and i loved her for all i was worth till i found her out eustace remarked lancaster finding these details scrappy if you will start in an sail plainly i wont interrupt jarman took a pull at his pipe ill give the gist of it in a few words said he slowly i was doing some journalistic work in frisco and ran across anchor he was a big burly rough chap but a whacking good sort we chummed up and he invited me to see him i was introduced to mrs anchor and fell in love with her what was she like you promised not to interrupt never mind what she was like my taste then is not my taste now mildred thought frank but said nothing i think she liked me more than a little but after i visited at her house for a time i found that anchor was turning nasty jealous i suppose eustace nodded but upon my soul he had no cause to be i was as straight as a die its not my fashion to loot other mens wives i think mrs anchor did her best to make him jealous after a time i became sure and then found outit matters not howthat she wished to get rid of her husband i was to be the man to remove him confound did she want you to murder the man well that was her idea but all this i didnt find out for a long time anchor grew nasty and i rarely went to his house but mrs anchor used to come and see me in the city sometimes was that quite straight no it wasnt in one way but you see she came to tell me that she was afraid that her husband would kill her i wasnt up to her game then a third man came in his name was sakersa nasty dry badtempered chap he and mrs anchor became thick as thieves then she gave me the goby oh i suppose she hoped sakers would kill her husband yes it seemed that anchor was ruined his wife spent all his money and the raw new palace was sold the pair came to live at frisco and sakers loafed on the front with mrs anchor were you still in love with her i was i tell you frank i really did love that woman she was the most fascinating woman i ever met and ive flirted with them in all countries well after a time she chucked sakers and came to me i gathered that she knew of some money which could be got if her husband was out of the way how well i didnt inquire she proposed so plainly that i should shoot anchorseeing that even her pranks couldnt make him jealous enough to get up a duelthat i grew angry that was an eyeopener but even then if shed dropped the business i might have gone on loving her but she up and slanged me properly then i saw what a bad mind she had and showed her the door what her scheme was i dont know after that a week later anchor came to see me to make trouble no poor chap he came to make it up said that he had been mistaken in me and that he didnt believe all the lies that were told about my being in love with mrs anchor then he cried and said that she had bolted with sakers why wasnt he man enough to follow and shoot he was off that night to chicago where the two had gone but he came to see me to explain it seemed that there was some moneyabout a millionthat he had something to do with he promised to see me again before he left for chicago and to give me some papers about the matter it was by the midnight train he was going and he was to call back at eight i went to the door of my house with himit was in a quiet side street and we stood chatting at the door but why didnt he bring the papers with him asked frank he didnt know if id take them and moreover was afraid of being robbed and killed bywell i cant say who by but sakers was mixed up in the business i see mrs anchor had told sakers what she told you and he less scrupulous intended to kill anchor to get these papers thats about the size of it but the whole thing was so vague that i couldnt get at the pith of it anchor would tell me nothing until he came back with the papers at eight all he said when we shook hands at the door was tamaroo well go on tamaroo what he didnt get any further said jarman for at that moment he was shot shot in the open street it was a quiet side street and being about mealtime there was no one about also it was almost dark the man who shot anchor must have been concealed in a corner close at hand i turned and saw him cutting along the street i followed calling for the police but he bunked into a crowded street and i lost him i went up to a policeman and made him come back with me i had been away for fifteen minutes on the chase anchor was still lying before my door but in addition to the shot wound there was a knife in his heart in this instance frank the knife was left in the wound it was a brandnew bowie and nothing could be made of it in the way of evidence what happened then well at first i was thought to be guilty but i soon cleared my character anchor was buried and i never saw nor heard of mrs anchor nor sakers again what about the papers i never heard anything of them either but it appeared that when anchor was seeing me a negro came to his lodgings to wait for him as he didnt turn up the negro skipped i fancied he might have been an emissary of mrs anchors to steal those papers but none were found and who killed anchor well i fancy sakers fired the shot but who knifed him i cant say frank rose and walking to the window stretched himself its a gruesome story said he and what did tamaroo mean i cant tell you that was the one word the poor fellow said before he was stretched a corpse well frank after that i got sick of the west and came home a strange romance very but i cant make top nor tail of the business it is strange that anchor should have been both shot and stabbed as starth was for that reason i tell the story keep it to yourself frank i do not care about wearing my heart on my sleeve ill say nothing assented lancaster and you know quite enough to round on me if i do i sayhe peered through the window into the moonlightwho is the lady jarman rose and looked over franks shoulder there was a white figure crossing the lawn its mildredmiss starth frank made for the door ill go to my bedroom he said i am not able to meet her yet as i might give myself away besides she may wish to talk to you about the case hm yes its just as well clear out ill let you know all that is needful so frank disappeared and jarman opened the front door to his visitor mildred looked very weary she wore a white dress with black bows and saw him looking sideways at it when she entered the study i havent had time to get proper mourning she said sinking into a chair mrs perth is furbishing up an old dress for tomorrow i wasnt thinking of that said jarman mendaciously have some wine miss starth you look so tired im worn out that awful inquest and poor walters death she hid her face in her hands its all so sudden so terrible i have been in bed ever since i returned so mrs perth told me i know the verdict do you think it is a true one asked mildred suddenly jarman was taken aback how should i know the jury say that mr lancaster killed walter but as i was leaving the room someonei dont know whoslipped a paper into my hand i have brought it to you as i cant understand she handed jarman half a sheet of notepaper on it was written in an unformed childish hand three wordsfrank innocent tamaroo tamaroo jarman leaped up tamaroo what does it mean chapter vii cupids bargain while jarman was receiving miss starth at the door miss cork had brought in the lamp and pulled down the blinds in the yellow light mildred could see that his face was pearly white as eustace was not usually emotional she guessed that the paper she had given him must be interesting enough to surprise him out of his ordinary self what is it she asked nervously oh what is it her nerves were slack poor girl from the anxieties of the last week jarman did not answer directly that he should have stumbled on the word tamaroo in this unexpected manner immediately after telling his story to frank surprised him not a little the coincidence was extraordinary and he suspected providential he could not see what connection there could be between the murder of anchor in san francisco and that of walter starth in sand lane but the mysterious word tamaroo seemed to link the two perhaps it might prove the clue to the mystery of the last crime jarman sat down to hurriedly arrange his thoughts but he was unable to answer mildred for a time after her exclamation she remained quiet clasping and unclasping her hands shaken to the core of her soul by the disturbed looks of this ordinarily phlegmatic man i dont know what it means confessed jarman finally and looked again at the paper this is written by an uneducated person and by one who knows lancaster well enough to address him by his christian name who slipped it into your hand i dont know said mildred again i was passing out with the crowd after the verdict had been given and i felt this being pushed into my hand my fingers closed on it mechanically for the moment i never thought to look round for the person when i examined it outside it was of course too late hm thats a pity if we could only find who wrote it there might be some chance of clearing up the mystery then you think there is a mystery mr jarman about your brothers death certainly i do i know lancaster very well indeed it was i who introduced him to your brother and i am absolutely certain that he is not the man to commit so brutal a crime but his threats on the previous night objected mildred mere foolish speaking and far from proving his guilt they to my mind hint at his innocence had he intended to kill your brother he would have been more circumspect in his language but if mr lancaster is innocent why did he run away jarman shrugged his shoulders you cant expect a man to have all his wits about him at such a moment he washere jarman was about to explain the drugging but on second thoughts he did not think it wise to appear to know too muchhe was in the house alone with your brother whom he had threatened he continued and when the murder took place saw that there was every chance of his being accused to avoid being arrested on circumstantial evidence he fled have you any idea where he is asked miss starth quickly no replied jarman deliberately i have not seen frank lancaster for some months he was always in town and as you know i rarely go up you believe him to be guilty everything seems to point to his guilt i admit that but i am convinced from what i know of him that he is perfectly innocent if so said mildred shrewdly he must at least know who killed my brother seeing that he left the house after the death i dont profess to explain said eustace who was unwilling to lie more than was necessary to shield lancaster did your brother ask lancaster to call on him no replied mildred decisively walter was rather afraid of mr lancaster they were bad friends for some reason and mr lancaster threatened to give walter a thrashing did he threaten to kill him mildred hesitated well walter said that mr lancaster would shoot him if he got the chance as he always carried a revolver lancaster only carried a revolver when he went slumming he wasnt slumming when he visited at sand lane no i cant explain that all i can say is that from what i know of lancaster he might have thrashed your brother but he certainly would not murder him but mr darrel tells me that mr lancaster was very bitter against my brother when did he tell you that said jarman who knew darrel and regarding him as a possible rival did not approve of him overmuch today when i got up mr darrel is staying at the rectory for a few days you know he is a friend of the rectors yes i know replied eustace thinking he must put frank on his guard since darrel might recognise him why did darrel come down on a visit to the rector but he also said that he came to see if he could help me in any way i can do all the help that is necessary said jarman jealously i told him so and then captain berry is anxious to assist hm said eustace pulling his big moustache mrs perth told me that he had offered a reward very good of him captain berry was a great friend of walters he wrote me the sad news almost immediately almost too immediately replied jarman what time did you get his letter by the eleven post then it must have been posted in london before midnight and the fact of the murder was not known to the general public till next morning how came captain berry to have such early information i dont know said miss starth blankly do you think i think nothing interposed the big man quickly i have never met berry and i know nothing about him but mrs perth doesnt seem to entertain a good opinion of him mildred in spite of her grief and sadness could not help smiling you know that mrs perth never approved of walters friends she was my governess you remember and still thinks its her duty to look after me and after that denham man oh he is only a boy said mildred with contempt and a very silly boy walter brought him down twice but i dont suppose hell come here again where did starth meet him at captain berrys mr denham came from san francisco with captain berry they are great friends and thereby hangs a tale muttered jarman who was intensely suspicious of the skipper and his associates well and what are you going to do now miss starth i can do nothing she said with a helpless gesture i have seen our lawyer about walters affairs and walters income comes to me i dont know what to do about his death except wait for the capture of lancaster miss starth moved uneasily i am not revengeful she said and my brother was not such a good man as he should have been but if mr lancaster is guilty he ought to be punished yes if he is guilty but presuming his innocence he will have an opportunity of proving that when he is tried ah said jarman pulling again at his moustache then you anticipate that he will be captured captain berry says he will never rest until he is captured we had a long talk about the matter has berry any clue no neither has inspector herny since that servant saw mr lancaster leave the house nothing more has been heard of him i dont want him to be captured his being hanged wont bring poor walter to life and that paper makes me doubt if he is guilty did you show this to berry asked jarman who still held the paper no i showed it to no one not even to mrs perth i wished to consult you about it i am glad you said nothing miss starth said jarman may i keep this paper i may be able to find out something you know certainly i shall be glad if you will help me i wish to help you in every way you know that jarmans voice shook a little and the woman in mildred took the alarm she rose to go whereupon jarman insisted on seeing her to rose cottage but there is no need protested mildred the moon is shining and i am quite safe dont trouble its a pleasure insisted eustace putting on his cap and being thus obstinate mildred let him have his own way she was even secretly pleased as she liked eustace extremely they stepped out into the moonlight and took their careful way between the haycocks the night was very still occasionally there would float towards them an outburst of song from the copsehidden nightingales diversified by the hoot of an owl or the whirr of a distant train steaming towards london mildred had simply thrown a lace shawl over her head to run across to the shanty and her face looked wonderfully pure and white in the ivory radiance of the moon eustace felt his pulses throb with suppressed excitement and the blood tingled pleasantly in his veins he was in love with mildred he was jealous of darrel and these passions lifted him somewhat out of his usual self the romance of san francisco appeared the veriest prose beside this lyrical night yet he felt that he could not break in upon the grief of the girl with his tale of love and so walked sedately by her side holding himself well in hand as they passed into the lane and under the chequered shadows of the elms mildred felt the influence of her companion she was not in love with jarman or with anyone but she liked and admired him immensely and granted that the fairy prince did not come along was not unprepared to listen should he speak still the feeling of sorrow for the death of her brother lay heavily upon her and she sighed as the cool night wind ruffled her dark hair after a time to break the silence she asked jarman about the new secretary mrs perth told me that he was very handsome she said oh hes goodlookin enough replied eustace but his spectacles rather spoil him weak eyes you know i was not aware that you intended to engage a secretary i have so much work to do you might have engaged me said miss starth reproachfully i can type quite as quickly as you can dictate and you know i am always glad to assist you i know that said jarman suppressing a strong inclination to take her in his arms we have done some work together you have i dont know what i should have done without you to correct my verses and help me to get them printed i was only sixteen when i showed you my first poem yes and very shy you were over it natural in a schoolgirl i am not a schoolgirl now mr jarman who knew that better than eustace i wish you were he muttered why you should be glad to see me grow up mr why so formal miss starthmildred call me eustace i should like toeustace said the girl franklytoo frankly alas for any feeling of love to lurk in the words you know how fond i am of you and she squeezed his arm playfully mildred he could stand it no longer although he felt that this was not the time to speak of love but the influence of the hour of her words and the feeling of jealousy inculcated by darrels arrival made him confess his secret mildred yes she detected the change in his voice and grew nervous iilove you mr jarmani mean eustace i didnt mean to speak went on the man rapidly i know you have heavy troubles to face but i wish to help you if you would accept me as your husband if you would lean upon me through life i would do all that i could to save you from being worried under the shadow of the trees a stonesthrow from the white gate of rose cottage mildred stood still her hands clasped before her a shaft of light piercing the leafage shed its radiance on her beautiful face and eustace put a constraint on himself under his breath he quoted the arabic proverb blessed be allah who made beautiful woman eustace i never thought of this and you are angry nono im not exactly angry but you love me thenyou love me she could feel his breath on her cheek and shrank away from the passion expressed in his deep voice i am not angry but i dont love you wait she flung up her hand as she heard his sigh i like youoh yes i like you more than anyone i ever met more than darrel mr darrel i dont care a bit for him i wish you wouldnt talk so she stamped her foot you know how troubled i am about poor walters death and we were getting on so nicely you and walter no poor fellow you and i we were such companions and i always told you everythingand now talking like this miss starths eyes filled with tears its a shame i cant help loving you well i love youin a way no dont come any nearer iilooked on you as aafather sobbed mildred oh heavens theres no more to be said after that let me remain in that relationship no that ismildred dried her tears and became alarmed because she thought she was inflicting painthat isyou know i dont mindwell if you cant guess does that mean you will marry me asked jarman catching his breath mildred rolled her handkerchief up into a ball and became more of a woman and less of a schoolgirl i will marry you on one condition what is that he asked eagerly that you find out and punish the person who killed walter jarmans heart leaped do you mean lancaster he asked alarmed noif what that paper says is true i mean the real person you say that mr lancaster is innocent and i know you too well to doubt your word find the real person and she bent forward as though to seal the bargain with a kiss but before her face could touch his own she drew back and flittered towards the gate mildred he cried mildred goodnight floated back faintly and he heard the closing of the door alone with the night and with his great happiness he tried to realise his good fortune she doesnt love me yet he thought as he walked back to the shanty on tiptoe excitement but she willshe will heaven bless her how could i have loved mrs anchor this is the real thing and mildredoh what a boy i am yet he wiped his face of course ill find out who killed her brother both to win her and to save frank dear frankpoor fellow jarman felt immensely sorry for lancaster being as it were out in the cold i must tell him and tell him he did blurting out the news almost before he filled his pipe i say frank im going to start in and find out who killed starth he declared miss starth has asked you to do so said frank trying to suppress his jealousy yes and she is going to reward me if i am successful with her hand lancaster stared iihope youll be happy he gulped shell get a good husband and i an angel for a wife an archangela madonnaa saint said frank incoherently but his heart ached chapter viii a pleasant surprise the rectory was like a beehive mr arrow was the happy father of ten healthy children and his wife was pretty well worn out looking after them one of the boys was at sandhurst a couple were at school but the majority of the children remained to make the old house lively why darrel who loved his comforts should come to such a noisy establishment arrow could not conjecture although he was glad to welcome him darrel himself declared that he came to see his old tutor and arrow accepted the flattering compliment but when he found that his guest paid three visits to rose cottage in as many days the rector began to mistrust the excuse however he said nothing to darrel as the rhodesian was rich and might be trusted to do something towards launching the young arrows into the bleak world darrel was a big man as huge as jarman but black and sulky in his looks his manners were soft and he resembled a large tomcat more than anything else particularly when speaking as he positively purred with the children he was a favourite as he always presented them with gifts but it was understood that on condition of this largess they were to leave him alone consequently he had all his time to himself and spent it dodging about rose cottage or filling the little parlour with his gigantic person mrs perth rather liked him as he was always deferential to her and she was not averse to his courtship of mildred for that was what his continual and not always welcome presence amounted to but the girl herself thought darrel possessed a violent temper and always declared that she would not marry him if he were as rich as vanderbilt however as the rhodesian came ostentatiously to condole with her on account of her trouble she could not very well express herself as she wished moreover in a measure she was now engaged to jarman but she told no one of the agreement she had made with him not even mrs perth it was now over a fortnight since the death of starth and as he was buried mildred was recovering her spirits she had never cared particularly for her brother who was something of a bully and had seen so little of him that his death made scarcely any difference in her life consequently beyond that she was in mourning she showed little sign of the catastrophe and walter had only himself to thank for the calmness with which she accepted his decease one afternoon mrs perth was out and darrel sat with mildred drinking tea in the parlour it was a small room filled with chintzcovered furniture and looked extremely cool the window was open and darrel who felt the heat sat near it cup in hand he was dressed in spotless flannels and looked betterlooking and less black than usual mildred in her sombre dress was fanning herself vigorously i wish i could feel as cool as you do she said enviously its more looks than anything else replied darrel in his heavy way im warm enoughquite how ill stand town i dont know when are you returning asked miss starth indifferently tomorrowif you dont want me to stay i have no control over your movements mr darrel but the coldness of the tone had no effect i mean that there may be something i can do for you now that your brother is dead mr jarman is looking after things for me thank you said mildred stiffly the only thing you can do is to find out who killed walter darrel raised his bushy eyebrows theres no difficulty about that miss starth the verdict of the jury was wrong i cant believe that this mr lancaster committed so horrible and apparently purposeless a crime have you any reason to believe him innocent mildred for obvious reasons did not answer this question directly i cant see his motive she said looking down pensively the evidence of that lady at the inquest i know nothing about any lady retorted the girl flushing then to change the conversation and mark her sense of darrels bad manners she asked a question did you know mr lancaster darrel nodded i thought i told you he said he was sitting next to me on that night i saw you in the theatre the night before the tragedy said mildred shuddering what is he like to look at fair chap blue eyes and wait miss starth recollected the man who had stared at her do you mean to say that he was the gentleman who sat next to you yes i said so fair hair and i know she broke in hurriedly he was looking at me our eyes met and heoh he didnt look like a man who would commit murder i shouldnt have thought it of him myself said darrel but if he didnt who did thats the point i wish you to find that out if you will certainly ill do my best on conditions conditions mildred stared and looked annoyed yes said the rhodesian stolidly promise to be my wife and ill hunt down lancaster mildred gasped this was the same bargain as she had made with eustace so the situation was duplicated but she more than liked jarman and cared very little for darrel moreover now that she knew the suspected man was the one who had stared at her and to whose face she had taken a fancy she was inclined to agree with eustace that he was innocent so refined a man could not possibly have committed so brutal a crime and finally she was displeased that darrel should again broach a subject about which she had asked him to be silent i told you before and i tell you again mr darrel that i cannot become your wife she said with some heat why not asked the man stolidly mildred grew exasperated because i dont love you love may come after marriage i prefer it to come before she declared i wont marry you yes you will said darrel closing his obstinate mouth your brother was in favour of the match at one time but not lately i know and i cant understand why he changed whether he changed or not doesnt matter said miss starth sharply the thing is out of the question no it isnt ive made up my mind to marry you and marry you i shall she rose and turned on him indignantly do you threaten me darrel rose also but did not reply directly i never made up my mind yet to get a thing that i didnt succeed he said i wanted to be rich and i am rich i want you to be my wife and i intend to make you my wife no no no she stamped her foot three times oh yes said darrel calmly think it over i go to town tomorrow but will come back in a month ill expect my answer then take it now she cried indignant at his impertinence no thats not the answer i require he said collecting his cane and hat you must say yes i wont darrel took not the slightest notice but held out his hand mildred declined to take it and repeated her refusal the big man turned to the door ill come in a month for my answer said he and went out mildred was very angry at his persistence but she had quite as strong a will as darrel and determined that nothing would induce her to become his wife but she dreaded his return as she knew he was not easily shaken off for the moment she was minded to tell eustace but a reflection that such a confidence might lead to a quarrel made her change her mind but ill never marry that darrel she declared nevernevernever i wonder indeed if ill marry eustace i like him but i dont love him and one should love when here she blushed and sat down her thoughts wandered to the pleasant face of the young man in the theatre and she recalled his persistent gaze he had evidently been attracted by her and she no said mildred to herself ill never believe that he murdered walter after which remark she began regretting that she had made a bargain with eustace decidedly her conduct was flighty but late events had unsettled her mind she was not usually so vacillating but at the present moment she was too bewildered and upset to know her own mind save that she would never marry darrel and perhaps not eustace she concluded meantime eustace was in the seventh heaven for the last few days he had gone about singing and lancaster was rather exasperated it seemed unfair that jarman should have all the happiness and he should have nothing but trouble then he blamed himself for being selfish jarman had been and was a good friend to him and jarman had known mildred for many years he frank had not even spoken to her so it was ridiculous and ungrateful of him to be jealous of his best friend on such slight grounds he did all he knew to preserve a cheerful face but at times grew gloomy eustace put his fit of the dismals down to a too vivid realisation of his danger he would not allow frank to speak more than was necessary about the murder as he did not wish him to brood over it but he was not idle and one morning announced that he was going to to town ill be away for the day he said so you can make yourself comfortable frank look out that darrel doesnt see you darrel has gone back to town said lancaster so one of the young arrows told me he returns in a month mildred will be glad he has gone he was always hanging round her why didnt you put a stop to that i have not the right as yet you see i am not formally engaged to mildred and will not be until i have discovered the assassin why not denounce me and bring about the engagement at once said frank with some bitterness jarman stared because in the first place you are innocent and in the second i should not like to build up my lifes happiness on your ruin i thought you knew me better than that my friend forgive me i am a beast said lancaster penitently but the fact is iihe gulped down the truthi am not myself dont wonder at it considering the fix you are in cheer up i may learn something today likely to give me a clue to the truth from whom from your friend fairy fan lancaster jumped up from the breakfasttable what you look surprised but it is so i am going to see her todayby appointment and he displayed a perfumed note frank glanced over it and discovered that miss berry would be pleased to see mr leonard grant at her rooms in bloomsbury at one oclock on that day why did you write to her asked frank handing this back the use of my nom de plume should tell you that replied jarman i want to have a quiet chat with that lady so i wrote as leonard grantunder which name i produce my sketchesand asked her if i could do one for her as i have a certain reputation she seems inclined to entertain the idea why didnt you write under your own name what an ass you are frank firstly the nom de plume is required to intimate who will write the sketch since eustace jarman is unknown as a dramatist secondly did i write in my own name i might give myself into the hand of berry he must have learnt from starth that i am your friend and thus might seek to know too much you could baffle his inquiries oh yes but if he chose to come down and see me i could not baffle his spotting you its best to be on the safe side and even in that disguise the man is clever enough to recognise you that doesnt say much for my disguise said frank grimly pooh the makeup is good enough to baffle a casual observer but captain berry is exceptionally clever he might not recognise you certainly on the other hand he might no frank as leonard grant ill see miss berry and learn all i can she wont discuss the matter with you perhaps not but ill try and get her on the subject i may even meet with berry and then well see if i cant pump him so you make yourself comfortable here frank while i go to town i think you might take the newspaper to mrs perth and meet mildred i dont know her said frank flushing mrs perth will introduce you said jarman and i am sure you will get on well with her too well thought frank but he said nothing not even if he would go over to rose cottage jarman bustled about and finally set off across the heath which was the nearest way to the railway station his plan of action was to seek berry and his niece as a complete stranger and to learn if he could what they were about to do he had a clever pair to deal with but jarman was smart himself and not for nothing had rubbed shoulders with the astute citizens of the great republic moreover apart from his wish to please mildred and to save frank there was a certain element of exhilaration about this chase after an unknown criminal that appealed to his love of adventure ive got detective fever he thought as he swung into a thirdclass smoking and the disease wont be cured till i run the true assassin to earth on arriving at liverpool street shortly after twelve he walked to the tube railway at the mansion house station and thereby gained oxford street from tottenham court road he strolled to bloomsbury crescent where miss berry dwelt with her uncle and reached the door of the house a few minutes before one oclock a neatlydressed maidservant admitted him into a cool drawingroom while the maid informed her mistress of jarmans arrival or rather that mr leonard grant was at hand eustace looked curiously round the room from its contents he hoped to learn something of the character of fairy fan but there was no need to read her character in this way almost before he commenced his examination she appeared at the door and came forward with a smile suddenly she stopped and the colour ebbed from her face jarman gasped and stared as well he might mrs anchor he said under his breath mrs anchor i might have guessed chapter ix the old romance mrs anchor alias miss fanny berry was a pretty little creature even when the searching morning sunlight was full on her face she had no absolute need of paint and powder to make her attractive in a tea gown of delicate blue with a head of fluffy golden hair and a piquant face she lookedas the saying isas pretty as a picture jarman eyed her sternly and wondered how he could ever have loved a woman possessed of such obviously meretricious charms her mouth was hard and there was an unpleasant glitter in her blue eyes which did not bode well for eustace after her failure in san francisco the lady was intensely suspicious of jarman deeming him too scrupulous eustace saw the inquiring light in her eyes and having his own game to play he pretended to forget the past and to be overjoyed at the meeting now that he knew who fairy fan was he felt quite certain that captain berry would answer readily to the name of sakers and hoped to see him before the termination of the interview meanwhile to abate the suspicions of the little lady he made himself agreeable and eustace could be extremely pleasant when it suited his book mrs anchor he said advancing with outstretched hands this is a surprise an agreeable one i hope replied the lady with an artificial laugh but searching his face keenly very agreeable i have often thought of you mrs anchor womanlike her thoughts reverted to his love and she strove to see if she yet had him in her toils but eustace did not flush and the calm expression of his face baffled the reading of his thoughts a puzzled look which meant iwonderwhyyoucalled crept into her expressive eyes but beyond this she governed her feelings excellently but eustace had interpreted the look and to rearrange their friendship hastened to explain i have never seen you at the theatre he said easily taking a chair so it never struck me that fairy fan who was delighting the british public was the same as mrs anchor of san francisco nor is she replied the little woman seating herself on the sofa after the sad death of my husband i took my maiden name again miss berry inquired eustace fanny berry she replied nodding i am over here with my uncle she glanced uneasily at the door thinking he might come in his name is banjo berry he is a merchant captain but in frisco you knew him as edward sakers oh i thought i know you did she interrupted petulantly and so did everyone else but he is my relative and nothing more owing to some trouble connected with the casting away of a fruit schooner on a south sea reef he was obliged to call himself sakers as i told you my husbands behaviour became so impossible that i had to leave you never told me that said jarman serenely but at our last interview you hinted that i might fight anchor with revolvers i dont deny it the man treated me shamefully i was a good wife to him miss berryas it is best to call hersqueezed out a tear but hehewell whats the use of going over the old ground you know how jealous he was and i know how he loved you said eustace pointedly what about yourself she responded flippantly i never lost the right of calling myself your husbands friend no she taunted you hadnt the pluck to do that you pretended to love me yet when i would have given you myself and a fortune you drew back the price was too high and you got someone else to put him out of the way fairy fan rose indignantly i never did she declared vehemently i was in chicago at the time when anchors conduct became unbearable i went with my uncle to that city it was there that we heard of his death shot and stabbed wasnt he yes but not by menot by my uncle although he was angry at the way in which i had been treated i left anchor and intended to get a divorcebut circumstances made me his widow did it make you a rich woman also asked eustace remembering the last interview he had with her no she said quietly you never gave me time to tell you about the money anchor speculated and lost his fortune however he knew through some indian of a treasurea spanish treasure which was buried in a certain place i wanted him to tell me the secret but he would not when he died he took the secret along with him i am as poor now as i was then and i shouldnt be acting at the piccadilly theatre if i wasnt why was the death of your husband necessary to your learning the secret demanded jarman quickly fairy fan arranged herself on the sofa and took out a case which she opened it wasnt she said blandly selecting a cigarette but i feared i wouldnt get a divorce and so i wished him out of the way you were too scrupulous although all you had to do was to pick a quarrel with him you were a better shot than he was i dont commit murder even for love mrs anchor berry if you please love she repeated lighting the cigarette you dont know the meaning of the word had you really and truly loved me you would have rid me of the man who struck me did he strike you i was beaten black and blue i told you so she retorted would any woman put up with that treatment i hated the man she clenched her small fist and her face grew angry i would have killed him myself had i been able perhaps as you didnt you got someone else to how dare you say that eustace jarman winced as she called him by the old name i tell you i knew nothing of the matter if you have come here to denounce me for the murder of my husband you have wasted your time there is no evidence which can connect me with that crime or my uncle either we are quite at our easequite i never thought of doing such a thing said jarman drily my coming here is a pure accident i live in essex and rarely come to town i had not the slightest idea of your identity it was simply and solely to write you a sketch and make money that i came why did you write under a false name bah you understand well enough i am known as leonard grant in this line as im not proud of the occupation of writing these drivelling things youso far as i knewwere a stranger to me i wrote you under the name i was best known by to do the sketch fan dont call me fan she said petulantly well i treated you so badly that i dont deserve much at your hands my dear he said with feigned penitence but for the sake of old times let me call you by the old name my uncle will not like it he will be here soon and should he hear you call me by so intimate a name he will be angry he is very very particular jarman privately thought that an exskipper who had cast away a schooner and had to change his name for that reason had no need to be so scrupulous but he did not believe in the relationship and suspected that fairy fan was telling glib lies however it suited him to accept the story she set forth and he swallowed the scrupulous captain banjo berry along with the other fiction ill call you miss berry when he comes but till then he looked imploringly she gave him a coquettish smile very well till then eustace jarman knew perfectly well that she was calculating to make use of him and wished her to think so should she accept him as a colleague in the swindle which she and her socalled uncle were perpetrating he might more easily penetrate the secret of starths murder then tell me fan was it ever discovered who killed anchor how you harp on that eustace yes an old partner of his whom he cheated in connection with a mining claim shot him and who thrust the knife into his heart a chinaman he found the body or rather he found anchor dying and intended to rob him when anchor opened his eyes and tried to sing out for the police lo keong knifed him the chinaman has been hanged but the man who fired the shot got away and now dont lets talk any more about the matter it gives me the horrors im doing very well here and i hope to make a lot of money then i shall retire and marry again fairy fan shot a second provocative glance perhaps she said hm jarman resolved to startle her so walter starth was not to your taste he woefully failed to bring about the desired result fan was too old a hand to be startled youve been reading the papers she said jarman nodded i saw that both starth and the man who is supposed to have killed him loved you they did and i refused both of them nice boys but a couple of paupers if i marry again i marry money but why do you use the word supposed frank lancaster murdered starth sure enough so the jury say but and so i say i know exactly how it happened starth thought that i was going to marry lancaster and they had a row then frank who always carried a revolver shot him and knifed him afterwards like your friend lo keong did anchor that was strange admitted fan thoughtfully i dont think such a nice boy as frank would act so brutally and its odd that my husband should have been treated in the same way a coincidence i suppose said eustace indifferently knowing that fan was watching him closely whats become of lancaster i dont know i wish i did he should hang i thought you liked him as a nice boy so i did she replied but i liked starth better oh jarman found it difficult to believe this she eyed him suspiciously and he would have explained himself further but that banjo berry followed by a young man entered the room uncle said fan rising and anticipating eustace who do you think leonard grant who wants to do the sketch is well this is very curious said berry shaking eustace by the hand in the warmest and most friendly way jarman of frisco thats me responded eustace how are you sakers berry winked dont need that name now said he theres no chance of my getting run in for piling up that old schooner at samoa im banjo berry now mown name and its a hummer in the south seas ive been explaining all that to him said fan impatiently i say mr jarmaneustace observed the punctiliousnessdo you know this boy natty denham the boy socalled was a callow young gentleman of twentyfive darkhaired and browncomplexioned he had a pleasant smile but rather a vacant expression and in jarmans mind was sized up not exactly as a fool but as a youth of rather weak will he thrust forward a slim hand and gave eustace a nerveless handshake how do you do he said talking very fast i never met you in frisco but i saw you often im chicago mself and came to this old country along with the captain and miss berry you never met in frisco asked fan addressing jarman no i heard you talk of mr denham though it seemed to eustace that both fan and her uncle were rather relieved by this admission and he wondered what connection this fool could have with the game the two were playing he fancied that denham was the pigeon and berry co the hawks it also struck him that if he could get natty to himself he might find out something always supposing that the young fellow knew anything later on after a desultory and friendly conversation natty gave him an opening i say said he you live down in essex yes at wargrove natty nodded to fan and the captain i knew he said cant understand how it slipped my memory what slipped your memory bub asked berry sharply why that hehe nodded towards eustacewas in essex when starth took me down to see that pretty sister of his he said something about jarman i remember now why didnt you tell me natty said fan in so cooing a voice that eustace guessed she was thoroughly angry i forgot cant remember anything rattled on the youth i saysuddenly turning to eustaceawful about poor starth eh oh give it a rest cried berry savagely youve done nothing but jaw of that since it happened jarman wasnt it you who introduced him to lancaster quite so hm guess lancasters an almighty friend of yours eh well he was drawled jarman seeing that his reply was awaited with much interest but now eustace shrugged his shoulders i dont much care to consort with criminals right sir you dont happen to know where hes skipped to certainly not he legged it sharp to escape the police he wont escape me said berry grimly im goin to get that young man lynched you bet i loved starth just like a son jarman laughed yet starth wasnt a lovable man he said oh there was no end of good in him when you got at it replied the little skipper solemnly besides we had a scheme on to make money what sort of a scheme never mind said berry hes dead now and the schemes up a tree i suppose miss starths cut up said denham to eustace naturally her only brother i guess she needs a heap of consolation went on the young man artlessly its just in my mind to go down and see her jarman was not at all pleased at this proposition and was inclined to reply in the negative but a bright thought struck hima very daring thought of the nature of bluff denham was a fool and not at all observant it might be that if he came down and saw mr desmond oneil he might be able to dispel any suspicions which might afterwards take shape in the minds of fan and her uncle with this idea he gave natty an invitation come and stop with me he said cordially there is no one with me but my secretary an irish chap called oneil youd get on well with him natty seemed inclined to accept but looked at berry for instruction the skipper nodded go by all means and have a good time you never ask me said fan reproachfully to her old lover im afraid a bachelor establishment is not quite a paradise to ladies said eustace laughing but if you will spend the day ill be very pleased when will you come down he asked denham berry answered he can come on saturday said he as im going tomorrow to see an old friend for a couple of days ill be back in the morningsaturday morning that is i dont want fan to be left is it balkis youre going to see asked denham jarman nearly uttered an exclamation of surprise for balkis was the name of the negress in the portrait which lancaster had seen in starths rooms berry didnt seem pleased at nattys speech and fan frowned but they both laughed indulgently it isnt balkis said berry but a marine officer im seeing in connection with lancaster hes left the country and i think i know the ship hes skipped by thats clever of you said jarman rising to take his leave if you catch him captain youll do more than the police huh scoffed berry your police are fools most people in this old country are i can squash the lot of them lancaster too you bet eustace laughed when on his way home he was pretty certain that having already made a false start about lancaster berry would not squash him jarman hoped to gather a great deal from nattys prattle chapter x a queer mark frank was not at all pleased when he heard that denham was coming down to the shanty the experiment was too risky as there was every chance that the young man would recognise him in which case he would at once put the revengeful berry on the scent but jarman did not look at the matter in this light and explained himself after sundry questions have you met denham often he asked yes he was always dodging round the berry establishment i thought he lived with them no he had diggings some way off berry so he told me is a kind of guardian to him does a man require a guardian at the age of twentythree denhams twentyfive hes almost the same age as i am although i look older said lancaster and i should think seeing what a fool he is that he will require a guardian all his life then you think hes more fool than knave asked eustace ruminating frank nodded emphatically i dont think hes a rascal at all whatever the captain may be denhams just a silly goodnatured ass who would give his head away he has a weak will and is quite under the thumb of berry did you fraternise with denham no his cackle got on my nerves but he knows me well enough to spot me should i betray myself then you must not betray yourself said eustace decidedly so far as looks go he wont know you i would defy even a detective to penetrate your disguise denham may twig me by my voice i dont think from what i saw of him that he is so observant besides i shall give you something to roughen your voice you can say you have a cold frank stared at his friend you seem to be up to all the tricks jarman nodded i thought of being a detective myself once and i practised for a time i have all the materials for disguise here i told you so when i made you up as desmond oneil i can get into the skin of a character with ease and thats what you have to do you are not frank lancaster remember but desmond oneil from county kerry but i say eustace why do you want denham down here well i wish him to report to the berry lot that there is no concealment about me they may suspect that i know something of your whereabouts and i dont want either one to drop down upon me denham is a fool and what he sees he will report to them in his artless fashion consequently berry and fan will trust me i want to get in with them and learn what they are up to do you think denham can tell you no said eustace promptly i dont whatever the game is that boy is in the dark he has much too loose a tongue for berry to trust him with his secrets but whats berry bothering about him for thats what i want to find out denham may know something for instance he mentioned the name of balkis as i told you whats the use of that asked frank gloomily this much starth had her portrait and berry is in touch with her i want to learn why berry calls at an opium shop at the docks hes going there im sure to see balkis the two were standing by the window chatting in this way as eustace repeated the name of balkis there sounded a low moan which made the speakers turn miss cork with the tablecloth over her arm stood at the open door her thin face as white as the linen she bore apparently she had entered silently as was her wont to lay the table for luncheon and had overheard the name like a statue she stood her vacant eyes fixed on jarman whats the matter he asked miss corks lips moved balkis she said in a whisper what about balkis do you know the name balkis said miss cork again then she threw down the cloth and ran back to the kitchen eustace followed and found her moaning in a chair rather brutally he shook her whats all this he asked miss cork went on moaning i had a child she began then shut up and not another word could he get out of her after many fruitless inquiries eustace returned to the sittingroom to explain i told you i didnt trust her said frank whose fears took shape at once she is a silent secretive woman i am sure she will get me into trouble why should she know that name i cant say and now she talks of some childher own she says but you neednt be afraid frank shes as true as steel i dont trust her said frank doggedly where did you pick her up jarman driven into a corner replied reluctantly in a london court a policecourt inquired lancaster then when he received a nod went on then shes dangerous what do you know of her past nothing she never speaks of it the poor wretch was taken up for vagrancy and afterwards was handed over to the missionary i knew the chap and he told me what a capital cook the woman was and how she needed a good home to put her right she came to me as miss cork and i have had no reason to regret having played the part of a good samaritan but its strange that the name of balkis should upset her wont she explain no she is a very obstinate woman when the fit takes her but the fit apparently did not seal miss corks mouth on this occasion a soft knock at the door told of her return and she presented herself quietly picking up the cloth she proceeded to lay the table and without looking at the men proceeded to exculpate herself i ask your pardon she said in her whispering voice i ask your pardon mr jarman and yours sir but the name balkis here she stopped and laid her hand on her heart i had a child of that name ah said jarman sympathetically while frank still looked suspicious and the name brings sad memories to you miss cork nodded im a married woman she said softly but my husband left me to starvewith the child andand and the child died no she burst out fiercely the child was stolen by whom miss cork stopped and her fingers worked convulsively as though they were clutching at a throat i wish i knewi wish i knew she said savagely and the expression of her lean face surprised jarman who had always considered her an apathetic woman perhaps his looks warned her that she was betraying too much of her unknown past for she pulled herself up with a faint titter im a billericay woman myself she began when jarman cut her short thats nonsense he said sternly you know you are not ive said all i have to say said miss cork quite irrelevantly and if you arent pleased mr jarman ill go i dont want you to go and i ask you nothing he replied my child was called balkis went on miss cork and she was stolen five years ago ive been looking for her ever since she will be seventeen years old by now and i lost her five years agoyes five years ago she kept on repeating ive been looking for her ever since a strange name balkis said jarman watching her my husband was in the east it came from the east that name im a billericay woman myself and she giggled then shook her head and withdrew swiftly the two men looked at one another shes quite mad and harmless said eustace quite mad and dangerous replied frank i dont trust her confirmed in this opinion by the strange demeanour of miss cork he watched her closely she muttered to herself frequently and kept counting on her fingers sometimes she would utter the name of balkis and laugh her laughter was not pleasant it did not seem to frank that she retained any pleasant memories of the nameyet if it was that of her child she should have done so jarman did not trouble about miss corks eccentricities the meals were well cooked and well served and there was no fault to be found with the womans housekeeping she was odd in her manner and appeared to be labouring under suppressed excitement twice frank caught her listening but not in sufficiently open a way to admit of rebuke as his position was a delicate one he became alarmed but trusting in jarmans influence over the woman and his claim to her gratitude he tried to dismiss his fears denham duly arrived and speedily made himself at home thanks to some herbal decoction given to him by eustace lancaster welcomed the visitor in a hoarse voicea regular nestlings note natty did not recognise in mr oneil the dark secretary the fairhaired frank lancaster whom he had seen frequently in bloomsbury he was completely deceived and frank felt more at his ease being now certain that his disguise was all that could be desired and luckily natty did not give him much of his frivolous company as he was mostly with jarman or hanging round rose cottage by this time frank introduced by mrs perth had made the acquaintance of his divinity she likewise never suspected any disguise and was quite at her ease with the new secretary franks heart beat hard when she offered him her hand and he could hardly see her face for a mist before his eyes now that he heard her voice and saw her gracious manner he fell more in love with her than ever it was a strange feeling and one that he had not experienced in his wooing of fairy fan but from the misery he suffered there was no doubt that it was genuine passion mildred was very amiable with him and they were together a great deal mrs perth had taken a fancy to frank whose manners she pronounced perfect and talked much to him she even discussed the death of walter starth and the probability of lancaster being the assassin but by this time frank had schooled himself into hearing the case talked of without moving so much as an eyelid in a couple of weeks he became quite an accepted fact in the life of rose cottage and indeed of the village even mrs baker had ceased to ask him questions several letters addressed to desmond oneil with the dublin postmark had arrived so mrs baker was quite satisfied that he came from the country whence she procured her butter from being a nine days wonder in that quiet essex hamlet frank became a comparative nonentity which was exactly the state of things jarman wished to bring about thus when denham arrived on his three days visit there was nothing likely to connect the secretary with the bedraggled man who had arrived so late at night and miss cork in spite of her odd ways and lancasters suspicions kept her own counsel most faithfully one afternoon frank now quite at his ease in his disguise strolled over to the cottage to ask for afternoon tea he brought a book of poems in his pocket for mildred was fond of hearing him read frank could read admirably which is a rare accomplishment and often he would declaim poems to mrs perth and mildred but on this occasion there was no chance of enjoying browning for jenny arrow from the rectory was present she was a kittenish damsel of eighteen with a freckled face a turnup nose and a gay vivacious manner also she had a vein of romance and cherished an unrequited affection for the dark secretary she confided this to mildred doesnt he look a romance dear said jenny when gazing from the drawingroom window she saw frank approach dont you love him milly mildred laughed i have had quite enough of love she said that denham boy worries my life out then theres your brother billy oh billys an ass said jenny contemptuously he falls in love with everyone he sees i suppose you will marry mr darrel certainly not said mildred quickly what put such an idea into your head jenny the young lady nodded sagaciously oh i know said she its not to see poor pa that mr darrel comes down here ma saw that ma says hes in love with you and being rich youre sure to marry him i would never marry for money jenny said mildred thinking of eustace mr darrel will never make me his wife oh but hes so very rich then marry him yourself i would rather marry mr oneil mildred laughed again but all the same for some reason inexplicable to herself felt annoyed here is mr oneil youd better propose mildred if you reveal my loveoh how i shall hate you but mildred watching the approaching figure of the man she knew merely as oneil did not reply she was wondering why she was so attracted towards him he was not particularly goodlooking nor had he shown any marked preference for her society indeed she had laughed with mrs perth over the attentions which oneil paid the old lady but there was something about the secretary which made mildreds pulses beat as they never beat in the presence of jarman perhaps although she never knew it was a case of telepathy for frank was always moved beyond his usual self when in her presence but he never revealed it by his manner mildred however was not sufficiently a psychologist to analyse her feeling so did not search too closely into the reason of her sensations still she could not help wondering why she felt annoyed by jennys silly remark i think you had better take that denham boy said mildred to jenny he bothers me greatly and hes the kind of donkey who would fall in love with anyone i dont regard myself as anyone said jenny with dignity besides hes not half so nice as mr oneil mildred acknowledged this with a sigh and welcomed oneil with a blush which he marked and wondered at where is mr jarman she asked he has gone bathing with billy and denham said frank standing outside and looking in at the window i have done my work and came to be rewarded with whatcakes and ale asked jenny languishing their modern equivalent in the shape of afternoon tea lets have it outside on the lawn oh mildred do miss starth assented mrs perth is lying down she said and as the room is rather hot we may as well have a picnic on the lawn forthwith she ordered the tea which was brought out by the one servant of the establishment but jenny had to lay the cloth and frank was told to place the tables under the noble elm in a few minutes they were all seated mildred and frank in chairs and jenny lying gracefully on the lawn every now and then she looked up adoringly at the secretary who took no notice but mildred did and so strong became that absurd feeling of irritation that she could willingly have slapped jenny after a desultory conversation jenny asked when denham was returning to town billy will be sorry when he goes hes awfully fond of mr denham the adventures that mans had in america are extraordinary he comes from america doesnt he asked mildred idly jenny nodded and billy says hes been a sailor he thinks he doesnt look much like a sailor said frank contemptuously he has been wrapped up in cottonwool all his life oh no he hasnt indeed said miss arrow eagerly he has lived in mexico and among the indiansnot the red indians you know but amongst those cortez found the aztecs said mildred my dear girl there are none left oh yes there are mr denham says so billy calls him natty because thats his name and he and billy are going to explore for hidden treasure theres lots of it in mexico denhams been reading romances said frank disbelievingly no insisted jenny hes had all sorts of adventures why when he was just a baby he was carried off by these indians how do you know he says so and they tattooed him on the left arm billy says frank sat up suddenly on the left arm he asked with what with a scarlet batthe queerest thing billy says oh whats the matter frank profoundly moved had fallen back in his chair chapter xi franks story seeing franks disturbed face mildred also became alarmed but he managed to pacify both her and jenny in a few words it was impossible to tell the truth therefore he was obliged to romance i think the heat is too much for me he said smiling and your mention of tattooing miss arrow recalled a disagreeable story tell it to us said jenny eagerly i love ghastly tales i wouldnt shock you by repeating this one said lancaster finding it difficult to improvise its about a leper mildred uttered an exclamation of disgust ugh how dreadful i dont want to hear it i do cried miss arrow with the avidity of a ghoul you must tell it to me on some other occasion mr oneil i will if you will tell me more of mr denhams tattooing jenny shook her head i dont know any more you must ask billy he has this scarlet bat on his left arm thats all i know did he ever tell billy how it came to be there i told you the indians marked him i cant say the reason frank was silent he was particularly anxious to know why denham was marked in this peculiar way and resolved to find out before the young man returned to town as it was the tattooing was another link in the chain which to his mind connected berry with the crime however he kept his ideas to himself and would have taken his departure to think them out at leisure but that he had a purpose to achieve connected with the photograph of balkis he knew that walters effects had passed into the hands of mildred and wished to obtain the portrait for reasons which he afterwards explained to jarman mildred herself gave him a chance of introducing the subject without awakening suspicion you have been working too hard she said in reference to lancasters late emotion and it is so very hot perhaps i have he assented glad of the excuse but jarman is anxious to get a new story finished quickly its an eastern tale tell it to us said the bold jenny sitting up and hugging her knees jenny how can you corrected mildred mr oneil must keep all those sort of things quiet i can tell you this much miss arrow that jarman wants a few words of arabic and we cant find them i never knew him to be at a loss before said mildred well he is this time so you can crow over him miss starth he is anxious to get some arabic letters you havent such a thing i suppose he added half jokingly good gracious where could i wait she said rising theres a portrait which belonged to poor walter there are some arabic letters on it mrs perth told me they were arabic but she may be wrong as a governess she ought not to be put in jenny get it mildred while miss starth hastened into the house jenny stared up into franks face in quite an embarrassing way are you going to stay long at the shanty she asked that depends upon mr jarman oh then youll stay as long as you like hes very fond of you he is a very good friend to me said frank quietly jenny nodded he is to everyone i think mildreds fond of him he has helped her a lot with her poetry i like him better than mr darrel do you know mr darrel i have heard of him replied frank cautiously i dont like him at all said jenny shaking her head vigorously hes a great friend to pa and ma and very rich but he doesnt come down to see them she tittered no mildreds the attraction does miss starth like him asked frank quickly she says she doesnt but of course hes so rich but i would rather she married mr jarman wouldnt you frank was spared the pain of replying to this embarrassing query by the return of mildred with the portrait which she placed in his hands its the picture of a negress she said and the letters at the foot they are arabic sure enough who is the woman i dont know it is a fancy portrait i suppose probably can i take this away with me for a few days to copy the letters miss starth ill return it safe oh take it by all means look jenny theres beauty jenny sat up and looked at the face earnestly its something like mr darrel she said at length nonsense said mildred looking in her turn at the picture but really i dont know what do you think mr oneil there was a resemblance to darrel the same sulky expression and thick lips and arrogant air perhaps shes a relative of his giggled jenny he was born in the west indies you know this portrait was taken at some place in rotherhithe said mildred pointing out the photographers name but it is like mr darrel quite as ugly said jenny though its mean of me saying that she added for mr darrel gave me a lovely brooch last time he was down hes coming again in a month do you know mildred yes i know replied miss starth in no very pleased tone frank slipped the portrait into his pocket as billy arrow came on to the lawn followed by jarman and natty billy was nearly twentyone and a sandhurst cadet but a great deal of the schoolboy remained in him weve had a rippin time said the young gentleman throwing himself on the lawn would you like some tea asked mildred rather tea would be saucy let me get it and billy swept into the house like a whirlwind frank saw that jarman looked rather disturbed and wondered what could be the reason he guessed that he had learnt something relative to the berrys from natty and was anxious to know what it was but he could not question eustace at the moment therefore curbed his curiosity until a more seasonable time meantime natty was paying compliments to mildred you do look well miss starth he babbled in his inconsequent wayand what a slapping day we had an a dip you should have come along mr oneil frank suppressed a smile thinking how soon his disguise would have vanished had he accepted this offer i have been more pleasantly engaged he said here comes billy and the tea billy was a firstrate hand at getting what he wanted he brought a tray laden with strawberry jam a large bowl of devonshire cream some hot cakes and a fresh pot of tea youll starve us out of house and home billy said mildred when these were arranged before her what will mrs perth say shed say eat well and not too quickly said billy selecting a cake while jarman looked on amused youre still a boy billy so am i said natty taking a slice of bread and cream in spite of being nearly twentyfive im not that till the twentyfifth of september you know frank looked up quickly and glanced sideways at jarman that was the date of his own birthday and then he like natty would be twentyfive this coincidence taken in conjunction with the tattooing puzzled him not a little jarman also looked perplexed and asked a question where were you born denham he demanded at zacatecas in mexico prattled natty no end of a place but i went to school in new orleans yes sirto a slapup school my dad said id have to have the best education possible so that i could look after the money when it came are you coming into a fortune asked frank ratherto no end of a fortune but its a long yarn ill tell it to you some night jarman its good for your books i shall be delighted to hear it i get the money after my twentyfifth birthday said natty and then ill buy you all presents billy shall have a horse and what will you give me asked jenny a husband replied natty and you miss starth ill have a husband also said mildred frivolously and then was sorry when she said it recalling nattys attentions jarman also was annoyed and addressed himself to the young man you must first catch your hare he said gravely and i suppose your guardian captain berry will have to be consulted no i guess not his control ceases when i get the dollars on your twentyfifth birthday after my twentyfifth birthday i cant say how long jarman said no more being afraid to press his inquiries natty was a babbling fool still it was not wise to arouse his suspicions he might mention them to captain berry and fan when there would probably be trouble and jarman wished that estimable couple to look upon him as one wholly unconcerned in their shady doings by assuring them of his lack of interest he hoped to throw them off their guard the conversation became more or less frivolous as was natural amongst such young people jarman was the eldest present and he felt his forty years painfully he even began to ask himself if it were fair that he should make mildred his wife she was young he was elderly and he remembered the proverb of may and december he was not exactly december yet but he was getting rapidly into the sear and yellow leaf the reflection made him sad when he went home with franknatty remaining behind to play a game of tennis with billyhe talked very little frank likewise was silent for a time but ultimately he spoke first i was rather startled today he said as they neared the shanty eh what was that nothing wrong no but jenny arrow told me that denham according to billy had a scarlet bat tattooed on his left arm i know said jarman quietly i saw it today when he was bathing i intended to surprise you with the news strange that you should have made the discovery on the same day as i did the long arm of coincidence again i suppose frank paid little attention to this being taken up with his own thoughts you know i have a scarlet bat tattooed on my right arm jarman nodded i remember and i suggested that as it was the sole mystery in your life it might have to do with berrys desiring to have you hanged now that we know denham is marked in a similar way it puts the matter beyond a doubt i cant see how said frank frowning wait till we get inside said jarman then we can talk at our ease not another word was spoken until they entered jarmans den and sat down in the coolness the blinds were down and there was a pleasant darkness jarman closed the door then took a seat opposite to that into which lancaster had thrown himself tell me again of your past he said i want to refresh my memory theres so little to tell that i wonder you dont know every word by heart said the other drearily you only told me once and my memory is a bad one go on while jarman lighted his pipe frank told how he had been sent home from san francisco by his father when he was two years of age and placed under the care of a quaker aunt called miss dorothy drake she lived in devonshire at a place called kingsbridge went on lancaster and there i was brought up till it was time for me to go to college i studied at the elizabethan grammar school in that town my father was always coming home but never appeared then when i was ten he stopped writing altogether but my aunt had the money for my education sent to her regularly i went to oxford as you know and then came five years ago to make my mark in london and a pretty mark i have made said frank bitterly you never spoke of this past to anyone no my aunt particularly told me not to do so i cant see myself why i should have kept silence though he added frowning theres nothing wrong about my past that i can see no it would seem as though your father was anxious you should live as quietly as possible so as not to attract the attentions of adventurers of the berry type i dont understand well that tattooing on your right arm you never knew what it meant no i asked my aunt and she could not tell me it was on my armthe scarlet bat i meanwhen i came from america denham i understand says that his tattooing was done by indians hm he might believe that said jarman sceptically and i daresay hes as ignorant of what the symbol means as you are but berry knows what makes you think that because he is hounding you down and you are marked in a similar way to that boy whom he has in his clutches do you think denham is in his clutches i am sure of it the boy believes in him thoroughly and is quite under berrys thumbpoor wretch he knows nothing about the significance of the scarlet bat or berry would not trust his babbling tongue within reach of my ears but you told me that there was a chance of your learning something about yourself yes aunt dorothy said that when i was twentyfive she had been told by my father to give me a sealed envelope what it contained she did not know in fact jarman my aunt knew nothing save that my father was a great traveller that he married in america and that when my mother died he sent me home she thinks he is dead because she has not received a letter from him for so long i dont agree with her as all this time the money has been forwarded for my education and keep are you still receiving money yes twenty pounds a month but i dont touch it aunt dorothy is poor so i give it to her and work for my own bread and butter hm youre a good fellow who pays you the money white saon lawyers in the city cant they tell you anything maybe they might be able to do so but they refuse all they say is that the money comes from their san francisco agents and that they are empowered to pay it to me have they any papers no i asked them they said they had none i must wait for that sealed envelope on your twentyfifth birthday mused jarman observe my son denham states that he is to come into money after his birthday he is the same age as you are and his birthday is on the same day which makes it stranger there is money knocking round as you guessed but i cant see how it is to come my way you may learn when you open that envelope ill know soon then next month im twentyfive poor aunt dorothy i wonder what she thinks of my scandal didnt you write her no how could i i feared lest the police might see her and make inquiries she is a truthful old lady and although she would not betray me she would give herself away by being confused no eustace its best that my aunt should know nothing of my whereabouts well she will know soon as i intend to call on her next week what for asked frank surprised to get that envelope and to learn all i can from her about your fathers life in america theres money i tell you frank and it comes either to you or denham how do you make that out because you are both marked with the scarlet bat and berry said eustace with emphasis is doing his best to get that money chapter xii the unexpected happens denham took his leave with profuse thanks to jarman for a pleasant visit he departed without the least suspicion that frank was other than he was represented to be eustace drew a breath of relief when he dismissed him at the railway station thats all right he thought as he took his way homeward denham will represent me as a kind friend and will do away with any suspicion in the berry mind as to my having a card up my sleeve now i can make another move the next move was to see miss dorothy drake and learn all particulars about the sealed envelope also frank wished to know what had become of his effects which had been left behind in his london rooms as his nearest relative it was probable that miss drake would lay claim to them until such time as he should reappear eustace therefore decided to go a few days after denhams visit and called on mildred to explain his absence for obvious reasons he did not explain himself too fully not until frank was proved innocent did jarman wish her to know that he was identical with mr oneil i shall only be away a week mildred said eustace taking her hand you wont forget me in that time i am not likely to forget you at all replied the girl wearily mildred you are not looking well the weather is so trying she said hesitatingly and walters death has damped my spirits i wish you would not dwell on that my dear he was not worth it still he was my brother when all is said and done if he had only died a natural death i would not mind so much but it is terrible to think of his tragic end are you making any attempt to discover the truth yes my journey is connected with the attempt where are you going no said jarman smiling dont ask me that not until i am successful shall i reveal my methods and at present i am groping in the dark have you no clue eustace hesitated i can hardly say that i have there are certain suspicions in my mind which may or may not prove correct but when i return i may be able to tell you something do your suspicions still point to the innocence of mr lancaster yes said jarman firmly i am more convinced every day that he is the victim of a conspiracy but his innocence will be hard to prove mildredhe again took her handwhen im away i want you to be kind to oneil he has no relatives poor fellow and is in sad trouble dont let him feel lonely mildred nodded but could not trust herself to speak had she consulted her own inclinations she would have seen nothing of the secretary during the absence of his employer daily she grew more and more interested in the socalled oneil she learnt to watch for his coming to hang on his words he had said nothing to her likely to be construed into admiration and was always cold and guarded in his utterance but this very coldness increased her liking for him she assured herself that it was merely liking but in her heart she knew that love had awakened the thought of this coupled with the remembrance of her halfengagement to eustace made her nervous and confused she could not meet her lovers eye and he returned to his home wondering at the inexplicable change however he finally put it down to grief for the loss of her unworthy brother and to prevent her from brooding he asked frank to see her as frequently as he could during his absence certainly said frank with an effort to be cheerful if you do not think she will find me out how can she she has never set eyes on you at close quarters as you were no muttered lancaster guiltily recalling the night in the theatre and the genesis of his futile passion i suppose not then to change the subject he asked eustace to be sure to let him know all that transpired between himself and miss drake and give her my love and tell her you are innocent oh she wont need to be told that said frank aunt dorothy will never believe that i did such a wicked thing heaven bless her by the way you dont think there is any chance of berry coming down not the slightest any suspicions he may have entertained about my knowing your whereabouts will be dissipated by the babble of natty i took the greatest care to load him up with a story likely to satisfy even the suspicions of captain banjo i shouldnt be surprised added jarman reflectively if berry approached me with an offer to join forces what good would that do him well i know about the murder of anchor and moreover as i was your friend i mightin his opinionknow something likely to help him in acquiring this fortune then you really think there is a fortune after the talk of natty about his birthday i am perfectly sure that there is a great deal of money knocking about it ought to come to you but berrys machinations unless thwarted will put it into the pocket of denham if so he wont benefit oh yes he will rejoined eustace grimly when denham is in possession of the fortune he will die as starth did he will follow poor anchor to the other world in the same way then fan and berry will retire to live happy ever afterwards its all theory grumbled frank quite so but thats my reading of the mystery however your aunt may throw some light on the subject she will probably tell me more of your fathers life than she told you but lancaster was not to be convinced i dont think she knows anything he said better see those lawyers white saon ill look them up when i return to town jarman having settled his plans went off and frank found himself in sole possession of the house miss cork waited on him assiduously and he noticed that she was not so eccentric as usual as yet he had not tried the experiment of letting her see the photograph of balkis which was his true reason for obtaining it from mildred frank did not believe miss corks story of the lost child and was certain that her emotion at the mention of the name was due to some other and less respectable cause it might be that she knew balkis herself and as balkis knew berryaccording to nattys slip of the tonguemiss cork might be able to throw some light on the mystery of the black womans connection with starth frank determined to place the photograph where miss cork could see it and then when she was moved to terror or surprise by the sight of the face to insist on an explanation what she said might not lead to the detection of the true assassin but it might reveal something about berry likely to show why he was conspiring against the life and liberty of an innocent man but this again was all theory as was jarmans belief that the tattoo mark of the scarlet bat was at the bottom of berrys rascalities still if frank wished to win clear of his difficulties it behoved him to try in all directions on the chance of finding a clue to the mystery frank therefore displayed the photograph of the big negress in a prominent position for the startling of miss cork and then took his way to rose cottage he knew that seeing he loved mildred he ought not to go in spite of the unsuspicious jarmans direct wish but lancaster loyal as he wished to act towards his friend could not help drinking in the sweet poison by this time he was convinced that mildred liked him more than a little and he gave himself a kind of delicious pain in watching this fruit which he could never hope to pluck he thought that when she knew his real name her liking would vanish to be replaced with loathing for the assassin of her brother as she must surely think lancaster to be then she could marry jarman and be happy frank argued in this way all the same he knew that he was giving way to weakness in trusting himself in her sweet presence this feeling was so strong on him when he approached the cottage that he was minded to retreat and make some excuse for not calling again what made him change his mind was the sight of darrel in the garden but that frank was in love and knew that darrel was a suitor for mildreds hand a timely thought of his danger would have made him retreat as it was he went boldly forward trusting in the perfection of his disguise it had not been pierced by denham so it was unlikely he would be unmasked by so slowthinking a man as darrel and it made the young man furiously jealous to think that darrel should persecute mildred with his attentions he tried to think that in coming between he was actuated by friendship for jarman but in his own passionate heart he knew well that it was a personal resentment mrs perth had brought her everlasting knitting into the garden and was seated in a cane chair under the elm near her was mildred looking in franks helpless eyes more beautiful than ever and to make him the more jealous mildred was winding a ball of red wool for mrs perth from a skein held by darrel the rhodesian was as usual big and sullen and appeared much too gigantic for the little garden it was a modern picture of hercules and omphale and frank realising his own helplessness raged inwardly as he was smilingly welcomed by mrs perth mildred after a nod cast down her eyes with a flush on her face and attended assiduously to her work hercules scowled im so glad to see you said mrs perth in her precise voice do you know mr darrel naturally frank said that he had not the pleasure and was introduced at once darrel lifted his heavy eyes with a grunt and paid no further attention to the secretary but he was quite as jealous as frank and mildred the cause of this feeling in both breasts became aware that the weather was thundery however she chatted brightly and divided her attentions equally being helped by mrs perth that good lady never suspected what was going on under her nose your cold is better said mrs perth when frank was seated as a matter of fact it was as eustace had left off giving frank the means to hoarsen his voice after the departure of denham it is better said frank almost in his usual tones jarman has been doctoring me ill soon be well darrel pricked up his ears and looked at the dark young man have i ever met you before he asked frank kept his countenance although he felt that he was in an awkward position i think not he said coldly while darrels lazy eyes strayed over him slowly mrs perth put in a brisk word mr oneil comes from ireland she said have you ever been in ireland mr darrel no he responded still eyeing lancaster who sustained his scrutiny unmoved i should never have taken mr oneil for an irishman that means you have no brogue said mildred to frank smiling but he had one when he came mr darrel you have been here a long time to get rid of it then said darrel just a few weeks replied frank calmly mrs perth with the best intentions brought lancaster under the guns of the enemy you came just when we were in deep grief over that horrid murder she said clicking her needles yes i remember you saying something about that said frank i have been in scotland said darrel suddenly and taking sidelooks at lancasters unmoved face so i dont know what has happened have they caught the man who did it mr lancaster said the old lady no they have not and i hope they never will said mildred flushing from what mr jarman says i believe mr lancaster is innocent oh said darrel turning away his eyes from frank so jarman takes up the cudgels on behalf of this murderer i remember he was a friend of lancasters and is said frank incautiously you should know said darrel quietly and with a keen glance being his secretary i have heard jarman speak of this matter replied frank he knew that darrels suspicions were aroused and tried to keep the colour from his cheeks he looked directly at darrel and the eyes of the two men met it was darrel who first withdrew his gaze no he said at length youre not a bit like lancaster although you have the same tone of voice has he indeed said mildred with interest lancaster was fairhaired and whiteskinned went on darrel whereas i am a dark celt said frank drawing a long breath as he deemed the danger was at an end well dont talk any more about the matter put in mrs perth sharply youll upset mildred and the affair is too horrible to discuss upon this hint darrel turned the conversation into other channels and devoted himself to mrs perth frank thus had an opportunity of chatting with mildred they talked on the most indifferent subjects but all the time each one knew what the other wanted to say such sudden love seems incredible to those who have never loved but anyone who has fallen a victim to the great passion knows how suddenly the devouring flame blazes into a conflagration the two had seen little of one another all things considering and they had never become confidential yet they loved one another and it needed only an unguarded moment of emotion for the truth to be openly acknowledged between them darrel with his sideglances saw their embarrassment their flushed cheeks their efforts to appear easy and took note of all but with great selfcontrol he continued his conversation with mrs perth for quite an hour he talked and then rose to take his leave at the same moment as frank announced his intention of departing i am stopping at the rectory said darrel when they passed through the gate you come my way i think for some little distance replied frank always on his guard but suspecting no evil on the part of his companion for a time they strolled on in silence down the lane and out on to the dusty white road then darrel commenced to converse on indifferent matters and told stories about africa also he stated his experiences in america i was at los angeles he said frank remembered how at the theatre he had said that he met berry at los angeles but made no comment on the remark darrel still continued to talk till they halted in a quiet side road whence frank branched off to the shanty there darrel stopped miss starth is in love with you he said abruptly his jealous eyes on the young mans face what do you mean demanded the secretary indignantly and you are in love with her went on the rhodesian i dont know what right you have to say these things this much right said darrel calmly i love miss starth and i intend to make her my wife if you clear out and leave her alone ill say nothing if you dont ill have you arrested you understand me lancaster franks heart almost stood still i am not bah said darrel cutting him short and pointing to his left hand when you disguise yourself you should remove your ring i fancied it was your voice when you spoke and i saw that habit you have of slipping that ring up and down your finger also the ring itself i remember it quite well frank cursed his folly the ring was a noticeable one set with two black pearls more of a ladys ring than a mans it was but he wore it because it had belonged to his mother there was no chance of keeping up his assumed character in the face of such evidence but i assure you darrel i am innocent he protested i dont care two cents if you are innocent or guilty said darrel coolly starth was never a friend of mine and objected to my marrying his sister ive set my heart on making her my wife because i love her with all my soul she loves you no she doesnt she loves you persisted darrel do you think i cant tell im too deeply in love with her myself to make any mistake im not going to have you queering my pitch if you leave her alone and clear out ill hold my tongue and if i dont ill write to the london police inspector herny will be glad to get you into his clutches now you know and without further words darrel turned on his heel and lumbered down the road like a heavy clumsy steer for a few moments frank stood alone in the shadow feeling as though the brightness had died out of his life he felt that he did not much care if he were arrested so wearing was the rle he was playing but the thought that mildred would be told that she would look upon him with loathing made him shudder he tried to stifle his thoughts and hurried into the house to think what was best to be done at that moment he sorely missed the wise head and staunch friendship of jarman the door of the shanty was wide open wondering at this for miss cork was of that suspicious nature which always kept windows barred and doors closed frank stepped into the drawingroom he glanced towards the mantelpiece where he had placed the photograph of balkis it was gone a sudden suspicion seized him he went to the kitchen it was empty miss cork had vanished and had taken the portrait with her chapter xiii a quaker lady kingsbridge is the quaintest of towns and was of great importance before the era of steam then fruit schooners ran as far as the azores and smuggling was a fine art but now the glory and excitement has departed and kingsbridge is a quiet clean country town set in the heart of the devonshire hills at the top of the steep high street dwelt miss dorothy drake and from her window she could behold the silver waters of the estuary and a panorama of undulating lands the window was miss drakes favourite seat and there she sat knitting for many a long hour watching the landscape changing under the wonderful colours of the sky she was a quiet homely little person usually clothed in a grey stuff gown and wearing the white closefitting cap of the sect she belonged to her serious face was the hue of old ivory and she had mild blue eyes the pensive expression of which added to the calm look soothed all to whom she spoke when anyone was in trouble he or sheit was usually a shecame for advice and comfort to miss drake and both were freely given she kept only one servant a stout wench called kezia who adored her mistress and who made it the study of her life that miss drake should be comfortable the old lady had a little money of her own and with this and the twenty pounds a month which came from america she lived in what she regarded as a luxurious way but miss drakes luxury would have been the penury of other and more modern people the room in which she sat was as quaint as herself and almost as small the furniture was old and polished brightly by kezia the curtains and hangings were faded but the room was brightened by numerous antimacassars worked by its owner there was a china cupboard containing hoarded cups and saucers strange seashells on the mantelpiece and portraits in oil of miss drakes ancestors on the walls she did not claim descent from the famous sir francis but admitted that she derived her blood from a distant branch of the family at all events the love of travel and seafaring was in the drake blood for two of miss drakes brothers had been merchant captains and her only sister had travelled in quest of a situation to america they were all dead now and miss drake remained awaiting her summons in the small room in the small house at the top of kingsbridge high street miss drake missed her nephew she was much attached to him and had done her best to bring him up since the time when he was entrusted to her charge at the tender age of two years but franks ambitions had led him to london and miss drake knowing that it behoved him to fight the battle of life had let him depart with a sigh sometimes he came to see her and these occasions were always festivals when the news of franks trouble came miss drake sturdily refused to believe it and prayed earnestly that franks innocence would be made evident in gods good time she firmly believed that it would all the same in spite of her undoubted faith miss drake was much agitated over the matter as the weeks went by and nothing was heard of frank she fretted over his disappearance until the good kezia grew quite alarmed but after a time so long as no mention was made of the matter she became calmer and waited patiently for the result of her prayers when eustace called she was at once alarmed divining that the arrival of this stranger had something to do with the trouble of her poor lost boy she saw her visitor at once and gave him tea out of wonderful eggshell china eustace liked the old lady at sight and strove to set her at her ease in this he succeeded for by the time they arrived at the most serious portion of their conversation miss drake was quite alert she had been greatly cheered by jarmans insistence on franks innocence though i never believed he was guilty she said in her quiet voice friend jarman thou hast been a brother to him thy reward will come i dont ask for any reward miss drake i am not the man to see a fellow like franksuch a good fellow toogo under without doing my best to help him well i have told you that he is with me in disguise and you know all the circumstances of the crime so much friend jarman as the police could tell me the police oh has inspector herny been here miss drake nodded and looked at her knitting with her head on one side like a brighteyed robin this mr herny took possession of franks goods in the name of law and order he found a letter addressed to me and learnt that i was aunt to my poor boy he came to learn if frank had fled to me i thought he would said jarman drawing a long breath i was not able to tell him anything resumed miss drake but i insisted that frank was innocent beyond a few papers all franks goods have been sent here i have paid up the rent of his rooms and they are now let to another tenant so when frank comes to me friend jarman he will find that his worldly affairs are as settled as i in my poor weak way could arrange them you have done splendidly miss drake and now that we know how we stand i will come to the object of my visit i want you to help me to prove franks innocence miss drakes hands trembled and she stopped knitting gladly would i do so but thou art mistaken i can do nothing that depends upon what you know of franks father i know very little friend jarman my sister ruth met him in san francisco and married him i never saw him myself why do you ask well its this way miss drake i believe that frank is the victim of a conspiracy which involves a lot of money you know that he had a scarlet bat tattooed on his right arm truly i know that many a time have i seen it when he was a child but i do not know what it means did you never inquire from whom could i inquire friend jarman frank knew nothing and his father would not tell me i never asked as i did not think it was worth while but had i inquired friend lancaster would not have replied according to ruth he was a silent and secretive man is mrs lancaster alive now alas no she died when giving birth to the boy friend lancaster kept the baby with him for two years then as he was going on some expedition he sent the child to me with a stipend of twenty pounds a month i brought up the lad as i best knew how he had a good education at the school here and then departed to college afterwards he dwelt in london as you know that is his story all i know but the twenty pounds is paid regularly miss drake nodded through white saon of kirk lane london i wished frank to take it to himself but he always refused i use a part of it but much i put aside so said the old lady looking over her spectacles if he should be tried or if he is in need of money now friend jarman i have a hundred or so waiting for him it will come in handy said jarman idly he was disappointed at the scanty information afforded by the old lady have you any letters from mr lancaster he asked miss drake rose and produced from a cabinet a bundle of envelopes with the american postmark these she placed in jarmans hands and having obtained permission he examined them carefully while he did so the old lady examined him stealthily and anxiously twice she frowned as if trying to solve some problem theres nothing here likely to throw any light on the subject said eustace tying up the bundle again in the faded blue ribbon what didst thou expect to find friend jarman eustace pinched his nether lip in perplexity i thought to find some mention of banjo berry he said frowning for it seems to me that he is at the bottom of all this business for some reason he wants frank hanged an evil manan evil man said miss drake shaking her head oh hes one of the worst continued eustace but in these lettershe laid his hand on the bundlethere is no mention of him these only ask after the boy and announce the remittance of money but i notice said eustace looking at his hostess sharply that there are no late letters miss drake nodded quite so friend jarman for many years there have been none friend lancaster stopped writing to me when his son was aged ten that is nearly fifteen years ago so i understand said eustace pondering frank is twentyfive in september his birthday is in a few weeks the old lady took off her spectacles and rubbed them with a vexed air she appeared about to say something but closing her mouth firmly she went on knitting jarman was annoyed as he saw that she was not quite open with him however he made no direct comment but resumed the conversation as though he had noticed nothing do you think old mr lancaster is dead he asked i cannot say i think he is said miss drake with a worried look but frank thinks otherwise friend jarman he would have gone to san francisco to learn but that i asked him to wait till his twentyfifth birthday jarman recalled nattys remark that he was entitled to money after his birthday in september frank was the same age and was born on the same day so it would seem from miss drakes remark that to his birthday also there was something attached is frank entitled to any money he asked is there a will or there is no money as far as i know friend jarman said miss drake rising she paused then went on but my heart misgives me why should it there is some mystery about the boy continued miss drake still agitated that mark on his arm is strangeand then the sealed letter it was for the mention of the sealed letter that jarman had been waiting now that miss drake had mentioned it of her own free will he no longer disguised the object of his visit it was to get that letter that i came down why asked miss drake suspiciously because i think it may solve the mystery of berrys enmity miss drake he went on earnestly this man berry has in his clutches a fellow called denham who seems to be an ass as far as i can judge denham is of the same age as your nephew and was born on the same day he also has a scarlet bat tattooed but he is marked on the left arm i believe that there is a sum of moneya fortuneperhaps the one to which denham alludes berry is trying to get frank out of the way so that denham may obtain the money in which case he will have the handling of it of course this is all supposition but i can account for the extraordinary circumstances in no other way miss drake heard him quietly her bright eyes fixed on his earnest face i believe thou art a good man friend eustace she said and for the sake of my poor boy i will trust thee sixteen years ago just before friend lancaster stopped writing he sent me an envelope which he asked me to give frank on his twentyfifth birthday i intended to do so with my own hands but as this trouble prevents me from doing so i will give the letter to thee she stopped and folded her hands as though in prayer i trust i am doing right she murmured to herself but the man seems good and kindly i swear you can trust me miss drake i have franks interests at heart i shall take the letter back and ask frank to open it but it was not to be opened until his twentyfifth birthday under the circumstances i think it should be opened at once pleaded jarman earnestly there is no good to be gained by waiting and remember frank is in great danger should berry succeed in tracing him he will denounce him at once to the police if frank is tried i dont see what defence he can put forward but he is innocent poor lamb i am sure of that but the circumstantial evidence is too strong miss drake thought for a few moments friend jarman she said at length by his unhappy position frank is tied hand and foot and thou must act for him if thou dost think that the letter is vital to the proving of his innocence why not open it now eustace shook his head i cant say if the letter will prove his innocence he said doubtfully but it may be a clue to the mystery i prefer that frank should open the letter i will get it for thee said miss drake rising one moment said jarman as she walked to the door have you ever heard the name of tamaroo no a strange name but i know it not its not mentioned in the letters either said eustace to himself as the old lady left the room yet it has something to do with the scarlet bat and that i am certain has to do with the mystery a queer affair he thrust his hands into his pockets and looked out of the window i cant see what it all means miss drake returned and placed in his hands a commonlooking envelope which from the fold had evidently come inside another letter it was addressed to my son francis and was sealed with red wax jarman drew near the window and looked at the seal then he muttered an ejaculationthe scarlet bat again yes said miss drake divining his astonishment the seal is the same as the mark on the poor lads arm i am more convinced than ever that this has to do with the solution of the mystery said jarman placing the letter in his pocketbook wherever we look we meet with the scarlet bat i shall take this to frank and on my way to wargrove i will call on white saon they may know something by the way have you a photograph of mr lancaster yes ruth sent me a photograph taken with her husband when they were married and miss drake taking a picture in a silver frame from a distant corner of the room showed it to jarman mrs lancaster was a sweetlooking mild woman not unlike miss drake her sister but lancaster was a picturesque resolute man with a firm mouth and a pair of rather fierce eyes frank resembled both his parents but favoured his mother most jarman examined the photograph carefully then rose to go i shall tell you what this contains when frank opens it he said and if possible i shall get frank to come down and see you chapter xiv a public clue jarman did not let the grass grow under his feet with the sealed letter in his pocketbook he returned that same evening to london he put up at a small hotel for a few hours and leaving his bag there went to see white saon towards midday had he consulted his own inclinations he would have gone immediately to wargrove as he had a great curiosity to see frank open the sealed envelope but he thought it best to follow on the warpath as long as possible on the chance of something new turning up it didnt do to waste time with so active an enemy as berry near the mansion house he met dickey baird who was always prowling about the city in connection with mysterious stocks and shares his friends declared that dickey lost more money than he madebut dickey always talked with the air of a rothschild he knew jarman very well and saluted him gaily eustace was not averse to talking with baird thinking dickey the ubiquitous might have something to say of the captain and his niece after the exchange of a few words jarman introduced the subject of the murder as speedily as he dared without attracting attention i say dickey have you heard anything of lancaster no poor chap hes cleared out i daresay hes in america in fact i know a fellow who thought he saw him in liverpool no doubt replied eustace thinking it was best to encourage this idea and put berry on a wrong trail the most sensible thing he could do was to cut but i say jarman you dont believe that hes guilty dont you asked eustace alertly no or if i do added dickey rather inconsequently it was an accident ill never believe that a good chap like lancaster killed another in so brutal a way what do you mean by an accident well you see frank rather admired starths sister ha said eustace with a start i remember she was in a box rather looking the beauty of the world ripping girl just the sort of diana of the chase id like to marry go ongo on well frank thought she was a ripper and wished to know her of course starths rowdy manners prevented a proper introduction frank never intended to quarrel with starth on that night he was all for making it up and getting to know the beauty but starth was so insulting that frank had to stand up for himself he lost his temper did frank and made a lot of silly speeches which were used afterwards in evidence against him hang it added dickey in an injured tone that beastly berry hauled me into the thing and i had to tell the rot that frank had been talking i said he was a silly ass at the time but he never meant any of it it was all sheer rage at that pig starth and you know he was a pig jarman i wonder you made a friend of him he wasnt much of a friend you introduced frank to him anyhow only in a casual way go on lets hear your theory well the last thing lancaster said to me on that night was that he was sorry he had such a row and that he wished he could make it up i guess he went to see starth next day for that purpose there was another row and frank shot him he would carry that revolver of his though i was always telling him what a fool he was so if he did shoot jarman he shot in a rage same as when he called the names i hope hell save his neck do you think theres any chance he wont not so far as the police are concerned but the skipper swears hell hunt him down you know he offered a reward of two hundred yes has anyone got it dickey shook his head no and berrys offering five hundred now i cant think why hes so keen on catching frank he pretended to be a friend of his and wasnt fond of starth from all i saw although they were as thick as thieves do you think berry really means business asked eustace after a time all this offering a reward might be an advertisement for fan it might but if jaw goes for anything hes bent on collaring frank he swears hell hunt him down if it costs him a thousand i say he added looking wise i believe berry and starth were in business as partners over something and the business has gone bang thats what made berry mad what sort of business i cant say but when starth was drunk he used to jaw about a million pounds he hoped to make some day berry shut him up once pretty sharp when he burbled like that so i think berry was in it if its anything shady you may be sure berry has something to do with it said eustace goodbye dickey i must be off when on his way to kirk lane jarman mused over the information he was sure now that the invitation of starth had been a trap into which the man himself had somehow fallen the amount at stake was a million which was large enough a sum in berrys eyes to justify even the murder of one man and the hanging of another no wonder berry offered a reward for the apprehension of frank if in the capture lay his chance of securing so large a fortune but what puzzled eustace and what had puzzled him all along was why it should be necessary to hang frank had lancaster been entitled to the money it would have been sufficient to have killed him and while lying drugged on the sofa he could easily have been despatched indeed the drug itself might have been administered in a sufficient quantity to polish him off its an infernal mystery said jarman flogging his brains to arrive at some conclusion i cant see the pivot on which the thing turns perhaps these lawyers may supply a clue messrs white saon were most respectable solicitors they occupied a dingy dark office at the top of kirk lane at the end furthest from cheapside the senior partner was engaged but jarman was told that he could see saon he had with him a letter of introduction from miss dorothy drake and sent this in with the clerk after some delay he was conducted into a kind of dusthole with a grimy skylight packed with books and boxes and law papers in the centre of this sat a spickandspan gentleman of over fifty with a heavy face and a smiling easygoing mouth he held the open letter of miss drake and welcomed jarman politely we are very glad to see any friend of our esteemed client said mr saon and what can i do for you mrmrhe consulted the lettermr jarman i want to know something about mr lancaster said eustace the smiling face grew serious i dont quite understand said mr saon stiffly we have no knowledge of the whereabouts of that unfortunate young gentleman had he placed himself in our hands we should have done our best at his trial as it is we are in darkness i see you are unwilling to speak openly said jarman mr saon placed the tips of his fat fingers together why said he its a delicate positiona very delicate position you come to us armed with a letter from an esteemed client who asks us to tell you all you may ask but the client in question mr jarman happens to be a lady and ladiesif you will pardon merarely have any idea of business i have however replied jarman drilyalthough he could not blame the lawyer for his cautionand when i tell you that i am the most intimate friend mr lancaster has perhaps you will not object to tell me something about his father mr saon sprang from his seat in sheer surprise his father he repeated dear me mr jarman i understood you to inquire about the sonour unfortunate client oheustace passed over the point of the remarkthen you admit that frank lancaster is your client you allude to the son i presume of course i said frank the fathers name is also frank replied saon if you dont mind we will talk of father and son as more explicit may i ask why you make these inquiries i wish to prove the innocence of the son oh then you believe him to be innocent certainly i do what do you say mr saon coughed delicately i say nothing the facts are not before me i sincerely hope that the son is innocent but if he had been well advised he would have placed his case in our hands and then would have been hanged for his pains said eustace roughly for he saw that this dignified gentleman was bent solely on making money and whether frank had been proved innocent or guilty would have been equally pleased provided the bill of costs was discharged as a matter of fact i advised the son to lie low ah then i understand that you have seen him since his misfortune i have i was the first person he came to saons face showed great interest are you aware that there is a reward offered for his apprehension by a friend of the deceased eustace nodded grimly i know the amount of the reward and the friend also do you wish me to earn it no no certainly not you shock meyou inexpressibly shock me mr jarman but if you really know the whereabouts of our unfortunate client tell him to come to us and ill do nothing of the sort interrupted jarman the evidence is too strong against him but if he is innocent innocent men have been hanged before now mr saon no sir you let me manage the matter in my own way when i have in my hands sufficient evidence to save lancasterthe son of coursefrom being hanged out of hand you will step in wellsaon scratched his chini am not prepared to say but what that may not be the wiser course and you wish to get some information from us to bring about this state of things i do you receive a sum of money monthly from frisco from san francisco corrected the heavy man we do does mr lancaster the father send it that i cant tell you our agents there are very respectable as you may guess and for many years they have sent us this sum monthly we pay it to miss drakeour esteemed clientat the request of that unfortunate young gentleman but it is understood that the money really goes to him is mr lancaster the father alive we cannot say have you ever asked your respectable san francisco firm no certainly not there is no need to we receive the money and we pay it over that is all that concerns us do you know anything about the father nothing absolutely nothing twentythree years ago he sent home the son to miss drakeour esteemed clientand arranged with our san francisco agents to pay a monthly sum of twenty pounds for the childs keep the child is now the unfortunate young man in question but the money is still paid i know nothing more would you mind making inquiries of your agents saon shook his stupid head i dont think it would do mr jarman no i really dont think it would do so long as the money arrives we have no right to pry into private business but to save frank lancaster not even for that we have our own high position to think of jarman could have thrown a book at the head of this dignified ass who would have let a man die to preserve what he called his position but it was no use getting angry lest the man should refuse to say more therefore jarman swallowed his temper and continued his questions do you think the father is still alive saon did not reply for a moment then he looked up i said just now that i did not know he said in a more reasonable tone but the fact is i do do you think that such information would really be of service to the son i am sure of it then i can tell you that mr lancaster senior is dead dead and when did he die that i cant say it was a negro who told us a negro jarman looked astonished and wondered what was coming you may well look surprised mr jarman but a negro came to see usa greyhaired negro possessed of great muscular strength although he was but small he inquired about mr lancaster the son as he had information to impart to him about the death of mr lancaster the father he refused to tell us anything beyond what i have said why didnt you send him to the son asked jarman testily because we did not know where the son was to be found oh the negro came after the murder of starth yes a week later we told him that our unfortunate client had been accused of the crime and had escaped justice the negro then departed although we offered to do all we could towards proving the will jarman pricked up his ears is there a will i suspect there is mr jarman and i suspect that the negro is the bearer of it had mr lancaster the father made his will in san francisco he would have executed it in the office of our esteemed agents as it is we have not heard from them but strange to say added saon the twenty pounds has been paid this month as usual i really dont know what to make of it nor i i suppose there must be a will i think so since the late mr lancaster is dead and was a man of means if you can find this negro what is his name interrupted eustace we cannot tell you that he refused to inform us in fact added mr saon drawing himself up for an african he was impertinent why didnt you kick him said eustace rising hm is this all you can tell me all and if you will let us know where mr lancaster the son is to be found we shall have much pleasure in proving the will the will has to be found first and the negro said eustace coolly and also frank lancaster has to get his neck out of the noose before he can let himself be arrested quite so i admire your caution mr jarman still if mr lancaster the son will only place himself in our hands jarmans patience with this old ass was exhausted he would be hanged within the month goodday and he hurried away leaving saon a frozen statue of indignation but he was not so indignant as eustace returning to his hotel silly fools he said wrathfully to himself theyd juggle with a mans life just to get their costs frank shant show up to be slaughtered by them if i can help it that negro hm and balkis is a negress i wonder if the man was a spy of berrys trying to find out the whereabouts of frank i must think this over upon my word lamented eustace hailing a hansom the more i go into this case the more mysterious it seems well theres one comfort the sealed letter may give us a clue to the mystery ill go down by the six train and may know all about it before retiring to rest at his hotel he alighted and went in then he suddenly recollected that he had not sent a wire to frank to be on the safe side although he was sending it to oneil he went to the telegraphoffice himself on his way hither he knowing the neighbourhood well took a short cut through some bystreets as he was turning a corner he heard a fresh young voice singing some song the burden of which was tamaroo tamaroo hardly believing his ears eustace dashed round the corner to hear who was repeating the last word which poor murdered anchor had uttered he came nearly on top of a ragged urchin a true guttersnipe who was dancing gaily in the gutter to the music of his own minstrelsy oh he gits a eavy screw tamaroo tamaroo an is father is a jew tamaroo tamaroo where did you hear that song interrupted eustace seizing the boy garn away with y its mown words an music ow tamaroo where did you hear the word thats my business tie it up cocky said the brat see here my lad you tell me where you got the word tamaroo and ill give you a shilling wot a whole bob right yare govner twas melia told it me melia kin read an she got it orf a wall a hour ago it ull be all over londing soon ow tamaroo tamaroo aint it a prime word show me where amelia got it eustace saw that the melody of the word had caught the boys ear but he could not understand what he meant the boy conducted him down one street and up another till he brought him up against a huge hoarding before some houses in the course of erection there appeared the huge placard of a scarlet bat with outspread wings as on franks arm beneath was printed in gigantic red letters the mysterious word tamaroo chapter xv a strange disappearance jarman returned fuming to wargrove he was a clearheaded man who liked to foresee what was coming so that he might arrange his plans but at the present moment he could not see an inch before his nose and rather lost his temper in consequence the unexpected appearance of the scarlet bat and of the mysterious word tamaroo on london hoardings perplexed him extremely at first he thought that this might be a new move on the part of the astute berry but on consideration dismissed this idea berry is not anxious for publicity argued eustace when in the train as it would attract attention to his underhand schemes to get this money again i dont believe denham knows anything not even the meaning of the tattooing on his left arm he would want to be told why the bat appeared on posters if it was berrys work and the captain might not be disposed to furnish an explanation no there is some other person taking a hand in this game and with that person i must come into contact if the person is an enemy of berrys we may work together to thwart him on the other hand the person who has plastered london with these posters may want the fortune himself in which case he will be equally an enemy to frank he may want him hanged also but it may be a woman conjectured jarman that balkis seems to be mixed up in the matter not to mention the negro who called on the lawyers hm i wonder what the barbaric element is doing in this galley he turned and twisted and argued the matter in every way but by the time he arrived at wargrove he was as much in the dark as ever his only chance of making any discovery likely to elucidate the mystery lay in the contents of the sealed letter anxious to see frank and to tell him all his adventures jarman walked rapidly to the shanty when he reached it he was surprised to find that it was shut up windows and doors were barred and not having a key eustace could not obtain entrance into his own home there was no sign of miss cork or of his friend what does this mean jarman asked himself can frank have been arrested but in that case miss cork would still be here the situation was puzzling so jarman set to work to learn details and make discoveries he sought out an old gardener who lived in a cottage adjacent to his own house this ancient bowles by name was a bent wheezy old creature very garrulous jarman could not have hit upon a better man for information as jacob bowles had the key of the shanty that dark gentleman he guv it to me said bowles surrendering the key to its owner tother day he guv it to meyou might call it the day afore yesterdayyes you might muster jarman the dark gent he guv it me sayin as youd be back muster jarman and would be wishful to get into your house like did he leave any message asked eustace still perplexed bowles scratched his head i cant say rightly as he did muster jarman do you know what has become of miss cork no muster jarman i cant rightly say as i do but my missus she did say as mrs baker saw miss cork gitting to the station three days back aye muster jarman you might say three days eustace remembered that this was the day of his departure and questioned the female bowles but she simply repeated the information given by her husband adding that miss cork had been seen by the ubiquitous mrs baker walking rapidly towards mardon railway station across the common as you might say said mrs bowles cautiously considerably perplexed eustace returned to his deserted house it was plausible to think that frank might have taken fright and have fled but the disappearance of miss cork was remarkable so far as jarman knew she had always expressed herself pleased with the situation and certainly never stated that she was going he hurried into the house hoping to find some message from frank in this he was not disappointed for on the writingtable lay a letter addressed to jarman the big man wrinkled his brows and opening it read it at once in the waning light dear eustace wrote the missing mani have to go darrel who is stopping at the rectory recognised me and for reasons which need not here be set forth it is probable he may denounce me i think it best to go away but will let you know as soon as i can what i am doing i left a photograph of balkis lying about and after seeing it miss cork ran away i believe she knows something about the negress and is in league with the gang we know of having digested this letter jarman sat down to think over the matter he had always been afraid lest darrel should recognise frank and wondered that his friend had not the sense to keep out of the way of so dangerous an acquaintance but he could not conjecture any reason for darrels denunciation of the unhappy man however as darrel was staying at the rectory jarman decided to go over on the morrow and hear what he had to say but as regards miss cork hm thought jarman while getting a scratch meal together i wonder if there is any truth in franks belief she certainly seemed startled when she heard the name of balkis and pitched that yarn about her child being called so i dont believe she has a child of that nameor indeed a child at all however she seems to have taken fright on seeing the photograph i wonder where frank got it ah i remember starth had a photograph and probably it was passed on to mildred frank could get it from her but why should miss cork run away and where has she gone he could not answer this question without further information and only frank could give details but frank was gone also and jarman wondered whither the poor persecuted young fellow had fled he did not dare to make inquiries lest he should attract the attention of the police the only thing to be done was to remain passive until such time as frank chose to write from his new place of concealment then he might see him and learn details about the inexplicable flight of his housekeeper meantime it would be just as well to see mildred and learn if his surmise about the photograph was true after a hurried meal jarman walked to rose cottage the maid who answered the door was a fat redfaced creature and was the only domestic employed by the two ladies she stated that miss starth was lying down with a bad headachehad retired early to bed in factbut that mrs perth was still in the parlour jarman would have walked in but mrs perth herself appeared and seemed indisposed to admit him jarman put down this unwillingness to her prim manners as nine oclock at night was certainly not the time to pay a visit to two single ladies but on seeing her face in the moonlight he noticed that she looked disturbed however she appeared friendly enoughwhy should she not bealthough declining to let him in when the maid retired he had a few minutes conversation with her on the doorstep no said mrs perth in her decisive tones i have not seen mr oneil lately he called once after your departure mr jarman but since then has not favoured us with a visit do you know that he has gone away asked eustace gone away replied mrs perth what do you mean what i say said jarman rather chafed he has gone away and i thought that you might know where he is mrs perth drew herself up in a prim manner why should i know mr jarman she said stiffly your friends movements have no interest for me it seems to me that you should know best where he is i presume he gave you notice being your secretary he left a letter saying he was going i never expected him to leave so suddenly there appears to be a mystery about him oh not at all rejoined the big man quickly but he is an odd fellow and doubtless left in a freakish way i only came to ask as i thought he might have called before going he called only the once when mr darrel was here he and mr darrel went away together have you seen mr darrel since oh dear me yes he is stopping with mr arrow does he know that my friend has left i really do not know replied mrs perth with a fatigued air he made no remark ah thank you i shall not keep you any longer i suppose added eustace with some hesitation i suppose it is impossible for me to see miss starth certainly it is impossible she has retired to bed you can call tomorrow good evening thus dismissed there was nothing for it but for eustace to return to his house in spite of mrs perths calmness he saw that she was worried and had something on her mind he wondered if she really knew anything of frank but that was impossible unless darrel had told mildred that lancaster alias oneil was the murderer of her brother that would account for mrs perths stiffness as she would not be too well disposed towards jarman for having introduced a criminaland such a criminalto her and mildred however nothing could be learnt until he saw darrel on the morrow and if he has told said eustace over a final pipe why mildred will be angry with me that night jarman got little sleep it annoyed him that frank should be absent at so critical a moment he wanted the young man to open the sealed letter and had half a mind to open it himself but on consideration he did not think he was justified in taking such a course if darrel had told mildred eustace determined to explain the whole of his connection with the matter and to assure her again of his firm belief in franks innocence as soon as lancaster revealed his new hidingplace he would take him the sealed letter and from its contents might be gathered some clue to all these mysteries they seemed to increase every day and to grow darker the more he endeavoured to throw light on them the next morning eustace having had a bad night slept well into the middle of the day then he had a cold bath and having cooked his own breakfast sat down to it somewhere about twelve oclock he was still worried but ate well as he knew he had a hard day before him but just as he was pouring out his second cup of coffee he became aware that someone was looking at him through the window to his surprise he saw the arch and piquant face of fairy fan with a sudden start he rose and went to the door there she was in the most dainty of costumes looking amused at his astonishment you asked me to come so i have come she said stepping into the house without being asked i hope you dont mind my taking you by surprise in this way oh not at all said eustace mechanically and led the way to his sittingroom wondering what ill wind had blown her hither but i wish you had given me notice of your coming miss berryas she chose to be calledplumped into a seat and cast an eye over the untidy table you didnt want to be found at breakfast so late she said smiling i thought you were an early riser i had a bad night said eustace shortly fan selected a cigarette from a box near at hand and lighted it i dont wonder at that she said through a cloud of blue smoke if you will shelter criminals what can you expect jarman started uneasily what do you mean he demanded frowning why said she waving a daintily gloved hand it seems that frank lancasters been with you what a cunning fellow you are eustace i guess you gave uncle banjo and me the outside running i dont know why you want the inside no and nobody else does she replied smartly not even balkis hinted jarman and could have bitten out his tongue for making a remark so calculated to place her on her guard as it was she coloured and looked keenly at him i guess you know more about the matter than youll give away perhaps i do he replied determined not to let her know the extent of his knowledge but if you came here to see lancaster hes gone thats a lie said miss berry coolly search the house then retorted eustace serenely meeting her with her own weapons i give you full permission she looked at him again no she said after a close scrutiny i guess i believe you i am flattered not a bit you feel angry where is frank i dont know oh yes you do she rejoined persuasively and see here theres five hundred pounds to be earned so i believe said eustace coolly and your uncle is playing the part of a philanthropist you can put it that way if you like eustace come tell me where the boy is i wish him well i doubt it seeing that your relative offers this reward for his capture however i can reply with an honest heart that i dont know where he is fairy fan threw away her cigarette with an important air i wish you did said she i want to save him from being lynched why do you wish to save him after bringing him into this state i didnt she said fiercely yes you did for some reason best known to yourself you induced starth and lancaster to quarrel having been successful up to the point of putting a rope round franks neck you come to me to ask if i will help you to adjust it the woman clasped and unclasped her hands nervously and rose to pace the room believe me i come to save him she said earnestly hes in great danger and i alone can help him ah then you know who killed starth i donti dont i swear i dont she cried vehemently so far as i know it was frank my uncle believes in his guilt also i know it is to his interest to believe snapped jarman how much money is involved in this business miss berry she turned pale and looked down there is no money she said oh yes well say about a million your uncle doesnt offer this reward for nothing its a small sprat to catch a large mackerel fan threw herself down and burst into tears i wish i were dead or you wish frank were dead which asked jarman mercilessly no i dont oh do tell me where he is i can save him from being hanged iithink so where is he she stamped her foot imperiously eustace smiled as he saw she was trying all her arts to make him reveal what he was determined to conceal i tell you i dont know he said quietly now that you have learnt that i sheltered the man i dont mind admitting that he was here but he has gone away and has left no address what frightened him away from this hidingplace you had better ask darrel who told you where to find him darrel fan seemed genuinely surprised he never told me then who did asked eustace bluntly fan thought for a moment then looked up with a winning smile ill tell you that if youll answer me a question what is the question why have you placarded london from end to end with those posters chapter xvi what mildred knew eustace looked at her much surprised if you dont know of those things i dont he said do you mean to say you didnt get them out certainly i saw one and was very much surprised do you know what the scarlet bat means she asked perhaps i do he said enigmatically and the name tamaroo oh its a name is it said jarman thank you for the information mrs anchor dont call me by that name said fan frowning why not you were married to the man and the name tamaroo was the last word he said to me the woman changed colour what did he mean she asked softly you can explain that best answered eustace see here mrs anchor or miss berry or whatever you choose to call yourself i want to know what your game is there is no game she insisted yes there is else you would not have put starth and lancaster against one another nor would you come down to see me and ask questions theres some scheme in your mind and in the mind of your socalled uncle he is my uncle she flashed out tapping her foot bah do you think i believe that accomplice if you like fan started to her feet like a small fury you dare to insult me do you she said better take care you lowdown cad ah said eustace calmly now the mask is being dropped with an effort she controlled herself seeing she had gone too far its enough to make a woman angry she said panting to be talked to in that way i am perfectly honest i never called your honesty into question yes you did and ill never forgive you for having done so i know you are my enemy now i thought you were a fool so i was in san francisco but i have learnt sense since and i am your enemy mrs anchor and the enemy of that man berry youd better not threaten him indeed do you think i am afraid of him sneered eustace i also have been in the wild west and i can handle my weapon as neatly as berry didwhen he shot starth its a lieits a lie he did not dont lose your temper youll gain nothing by it i am on the side of frank lancaster and i intend to prove his innocence you cant said mrs anchor with a pale face he is guilty its your scheme to make him appear so retorted jarman but i know better and so do you who told you he was here thats my business she said doggedly and a very shady business it is do you wish to murder frank as you murdered your husband with a spasm of fury fan snatched up a knife and flung it at him it flew over his head dont do that again said he or ill forget that you are a woman the woman you loved she said again weeping eustace grew tired of thus running in a circle dont you think youd better try something new mrs anchor we have had cajoling tears violence temperim growing weary i also said fan drying her tears and speaking in a much more businesslike manner its not worth while losing ones temper not with me i assure you youre a brute she said violently possibly did you come to tell me that i came to see frank not you but as he is not hereand i dont think you are clever enough to deceive meplease send him my message i dont know where he is mrs anchor jarman used the name because he could see that it annoyed her but the message tell him that if he will promise to marry me i will save his neck but i must have the promise in writing ill convey the message if i can said eustace without making any comment on one condition what is that asked mrs anchor turning from the mirror before which she was adjusting her veil you must write a letter to miss starth deploring the death of her brother and stating that you loved him so much that you wished to marry him fan grew crimson and her eyes sparkled i shall not write such a tissue of lies she said with a stamp jarman laughed but not pleasantly you have become wonderfully scrupulous all of a sudden he sneered but you intended to marry either starth or denham denham she said contemptuously i wouldnt marry him if he asked me why do you want me to write such a letter for your own sake responded the big man coolly miss starth believes that you are concerned in the death of her brother such a letter will convince her that you were well disposed towards him bah she wont believe it she may or she may not however i want it written mrs anchor sat down and leaning her cheek on her hand stared musingly at the floor after a few minutes she looked up youre on some game or another she said calmly and for some reason you wish me to join in well i dont mind the letter shall be sent oh and dont you want to know what the game is not at all whatever you are doing cant concern me this letter will do no harm and as i wish the message taken to frank i am willing to buy it on those terms jarman looked at her distrustfully he wondered why she yielded so suddenly and knowing her tricky ways he felt sure that she had some card to play however for reasons of his own he wanted the letter and so long as he got it was not particular how it came into his possession it was useless to act honourably towards a pair of sharpers like fan and her socalled uncle having thus arranged matters the little woman held out her hand i have a carriage waiting to take me to mardon she said we understand one another i hope i think we do but i am in the dark regarding your schemes i can say the same thing about this letter i dont know why you want it written tell me who told you of lancasters whereabouts and ill explain no thanks she rejoined with a shrug writing such a letter wont hurt me in any way and telling you too much might as you please let me see you to the carriage she accepted his offer and together they walked across the fields to where a fly from mardon was waiting mrs anchor hopped into this as lightly as a bird and again held out her hand goodbye she smiled you wont forget to deliver my message i will if i can on condition yes i know the condition the letter shall be sent to miss starth when the fly drove away eustace stood in a brown study for a few minutes he wondered why mrs anchor had so readily accepted his assurance that frank was not in the house certainly he was not but jarman fancied that so suspicious a woman would have made sure yet she did not even avail herself of his offer to let her inspect the house i wonder what stake those two are playing for mused jarman walking down the road its that million i suppose but he could not be sure until he gained more explicit information jarman had conceived a plot with which the letter to mildred was concerned by it he hoped to learn the secrets of berry who certainly appeared to be the head of the whole business as to the scarlet bat the opening of the sealed letter might reveal what that meant but the letter could only be opened by frank and frank was nowhere to be found jarman decided to tell mildred the whole story and then to consult her about opening the letter in franks absence it seemed foolish to wait and to leave the man in such peril and he was in the greatest peril now that fan knew he had been hiding at wargrove eustace felt thankful that for obvious reasons she could not take the police into her councils else he might have got into trouble for compounding a felony while thus thinking a man had approached him softly and jarman was startled by a touch on his shoulder he wheeled round sharply to behold darrel the man looked sulky as usual and purred like a cat when he addressed jarman so your friend lancaster has gone away he said quietly yes replied eustace thinking it best to save time by admitting so obvious a fact you frightened him away ah then he left a letter behind him he did mr darrel in which he stated that you knew him and that you threatened to denounce him only if he interfered between me and mildred said darrel jarman flushed and his face grew angry what do you mean by speaking of miss starth in so familiar a fashion i speak as i like and being in love with miss starthsince you want me to be punctiliousi call her by the name i like best jarman could have struck him to the earth as he stood there like the manmountain of gulliver there was something insolent about darrel which inspired the meekest of men to kick him and eustace was by no means a moses for the moment eustace was inclined to take him up on the question of loving mildred but remembering that he was not officially engaged to the girl and that should he not discover the assassin of her brother he might never be her husband he thought it best to pass over the matter however he remarked on the conjunction of the girls name with franks lancaster was not likely to interfere between you he said oh yes he was said darrel in his slow heavy voice lancaster is in love with her jarman felt a jealous pang impossible not a bit of it lancaster saw her that night in the theatre and even then admired her more than i liked down here i saw them together and he loves her im in love myself and i know and im not certain added darrel viciously that she doesnt love him i tell you she cant cried jarman agitated oh then she knows lancaster killed her brother she knows nothing i only speak from my knowledge of her character she would not love a man she knew so little of as lancaster according to you she did not know him by that name but she is just the kind of romantic girl to fall in love with that irish secretary of yours he made up well for the part sneered darrel jarman straightened his shoulders i dont think it is good taste to discuss miss starth he said but i can safely assure you that she does not love the man you seem very sure darrel scanned eustace in his usual insolent way i believe you are in love yourself he said with a short laugh well i give you the same warning as i gave lancaster im not disposed to take any warning rejoined jarman hotly and if you denounce lancaster as having been here i shall deny it oh now that he has cut theres no necessity for me to say a word but dont you interfere see here darrel said jarman controlling his temper with an effort no man shall speak to me like this i forbid you to mention miss starths name to me again she will choose for herself i know she will she will choose me said darrel complacently theres always two to a bargain said eustace drily however as lancaster has gone there was no need for you to tell miss berry darrel looked up in genuine surprise i did not tell miss berry she was down here an hour ago and stated that i had told her shes a liar she did not say that you had told her but she knew that lancaster had been here and you were the only person who spotted him what fools the others must be said the genial darrel however thats neither here nor there i assure you on my honour that i kept lancasters secret he may or he may not have killed starth but so long as he leaves miss starth alone he is in no danger from me i hope you will understand that i understand said jarman coldly and now we will part on an understanding however said darrel striding after eustacethat you dont interfere with my affairs if you do ill he stopped and looking at eustace with an evil face walked on you are warned he said over his shoulder for a moment eustace was inclined to follow and dash his insolent words down his throat but such an act might have jeopardised the safety of frank jarman therefore was compelled to swallow his anger and greatly he disliked doing so but under the circumstances he could do nothing else all that day he wondered what amount of truth there was in the assertion of darrel that frank was in love with mildred eustace could not bring himself to believe that frank would act basely towards him and make love during his absence he knows that i adore mildred soliloquised eustace as he paced his rough lawn and to try to get her to himself would be a base thing to do i have helped him he certainly would not betray me i swear by frank nevertheless in spite of these brave words he caught himself frowning at the thought and finally made up his mind to see mildred and learn the worst he was aware that she liked him but that into their bargain no love had entered if she really loved frank and the young man had acted honourably why then but its impossibleimpossible groaned jarman clenching his hand he would not treat me in such a way troubled in this fashion he presented himself at rose cottage looking unlike his usual self mildred was in the garden watching the sunset and was walking towards the summerhouse when she heard him call her name turning with a cry of alarm she came swiftly towards him holding out both hands eustace im so glad you have come i was sorry that i could not see you last night why did you not come earlier i was busy he said evasively and looked into her eyes mildred why were you alarmed when i called you she faltered i thought it might be darrel she said faintly but he would not call you by your christian name mildred blazed up id like to see him dare she said but he has insolence enough for anything he persecutes me oh does he cried jarman angrily then ill made short work of him you see if i dont ill do nothingdo nothing she panted catching his hands he is a dangerous man he knows too much about what i dont understand she turned red and her hands dropped mr oneil she said in a low voice then covered her face he has gone away i dont know where he is said jarman but no no say nothing she dried her tears and drew him into a sheltered part of the lawn he is here she whispered i have concealed him and he has told me his story jarman looked at her astonished you know then that he is lancaster she nodded with a smile chapter xvii the sealed letter jarman was so astonished at mildreds communication that he dropped into a gardenseat which was fortunately close at hand it was wonderful enough to hear that lancaster was concealed in rose cottage but still more wonderful to hear that she knew who he was eustace would have thought it unlikely that she would have anything to do with the man suspected of being her brothers murderer yet she admitted the fact boldly and actually smiled he recalled the remarks of darrel and wondered if there was an understanding between her and lancaster how long have you known his real name he asked sternly since you went away replied mildred sitting beside him dont be angry eustace i agree with you that he is innocent and when he came to me for shelter what could i do even if he were guilty i could not give him up and she shuddered does mrs perth know yes i had to tell her but we have kept it secret from jane eustace nodded its just as well the girl might babble how was it lancaster dared to come here he did not know what to do or how to escape you see mr darrel jarman interrupted i know darrel recognised him he told me so today and he said other things for which i felt inclined to knock him down and i should have done so but that as you say he is too well aware of the existing state of things what did he say asked mildred an angry light in her eyes there is no need to repeat his insolence there certainly is not for i know quite well what he said he is determined to make me his wife and and he coupled your name with that of lancaster oh he is jealous of everyone said mildred tossing her head you dont believe that i hope believe what asked eustace wishing for details but like a woman having brought the matter to a point she changed the subject hurriedly nothing nothing she declared hurriedly i am engaged to you eustace if you find out who killed walter so i understand he replied sadly but there is no love on your side my dear i told you plainly what i thought you did and i should not have taken advantage of your position i think we had better stop she interrupted and in the moonlight he could see her bosom heave you had better not say too much let us leave the subject alone until we get out of these troubles eustace was quite willing to do this he could scarcely tax her with being in love with frank on the evidence of darrel but he was resolved to question lancaster at the first opportunity meantime seeing that mildred was disposed to grow angry he thought it best to leave the matter alone where is he was his question mildred looked round as though she thought the birds of the air might overhear he is in the summerhouse she said there is a small room at the back which i fitted up as a kind of studio for painting but is that safe mildred quite safe no one ever goes there but me the summerhouse as you can see is quite buried amongst the trees and i have hung some eastern stuffs round the walls to conceal the door into the studio besides she added with a little hesitation no one would ever think of looking for him in my house no that is all right assented jarman but why did he come for the very reason i have stated he was afraid lest mr darrel should send a message to the police so he gave the key of your house to old bowles and came in the afternoon as desmond oneil certainly then he told me his story at first i was horrified but remembering how you believed in his innocence i decided to help him as the secretary he then went for a long walk and came back at night i had the studio ready for him and he has been in it ever since let me see him said jarman rising one moment said mildred catching his hand you will find him different to what you expect his disguise has been taken off were you surprised at the change no she blushed the fact is eustace i saw him in the theatre on that night so i knew him again when he became himself jarman felt a jealous pang he began to think that mildred loved the boy seeing how she blushed when she spoke of him also her voice faltered and she seemed embarrassed at first eustace almost felt inclined to speak out and demand if she loved lancaster but remembering the position of the young man and being afraid of the wrath of mildred he held his tongue in silence they moved across the lawn and entered the summerhouse it was luminous with moonlight and eustace saw a faint sparkle of gold the threads of the eastern stuffs which draped the walls mildred gave a little cough and repeated it twice the signal she whispered with her finger on her lips and in spite of the gravity of the position she seemed quite to enjoy its mystery in many ways mildred starth was still a schoolgirl from the other side of the wall came a cough and this also was repeated twice mildred drew aside the drapery and revealed a door ill leave you now she murmured you can talk to him alone come in and see me afterwards and before eustace could say a word she was gone he saw her flit across the lawn in the moonlight then knocked softly at the door a key was turned the door opened and frank looked out who is it he whispered your friend jarman said that gentleman and stepped inside it was perfectly dark save where a slender moonbeam stole in through the high window frank gave a gasp of relief and gripped eustaces hand in the gloom they exchanged a hearty handshake and then frank pushed forward a chair as he had been long in the darkness he was better able to see than jarman im so glad you have come said frank drawing another chair close to that of his friend so that he could converse in a whisper i have been longing for you you got my letter yes and i am much astonished to find you here i thought it was the best thing i could do said lancaster after you left darrel i know all about it but why did he threaten you oh frank hesitated he could not tell jarman the reason and hardly knew what to say but jarman brought things to a point lancaster he said seizing the young mans hand i have been a good friend to you have youare youi mean do you treat me as a man of honour should treat another yes i swear i have said nothing ah you know what i speak of i do i can hardly make a mistake when you speak to me in such a tone eustace dont think so basely of me do you love mildred asked jarman sternly there was a moments silence heaven help me i do and you have no no franks voice broke out quickly and earnestly i have not said a word to her i have not even shown that i take any interest in her i knew she was engaged to you and that sealed my lips i would not have come here but that i was driven into a corner darrel knew me under my disguise i fancied he might put the police on my track if i had gone to london or anywhere in the country as oneil the police would have caught me from the description darrel could give and if i took off my disguise the description in the papers would enable them to recognise me eustace i swear that if a poor hunted wretch like myself had had any corner to hide in i should not have come here but you trust mesay you trust me yes i do trust you said jarman a little sadly i know you have been driven to take up this position but we will talk no more of the matter when you are free from trouble then we can talk but tell me how did mildred receive you she was horrified at first but afterwards when i confessed all she believed me to be innocent she told mrs perth who also thinks i am guiltless i am safe here even darrel cant find me in this place but if you like eustace i can disguise myself in another way and go abroad i dont want to remain here longer than i can help you must remain here said jarman decisively if you try to escape you may be captured fan knows of your disguise and berry asked frank in alarm i cant say that fan was down today but she did not tell me if she had revealed anything to berry who told her but i neednt ask it was darrel you are wrong both darrel and fairy fan deny that then who could have told i cant say but fan came down to see you to have me arrested i suppose said frank bitterly on the contrary she wished to make you a proposal of marriage frank sat still for a moment then in spite of his troubles laughed softly you or she must be crazy eustace then it is she her message which i promised to deliver on conditions was that if you would marry her she would save you then if you see her again you can refuse her offer i should not think of marrying her i have got over my infatuation there and have placed your heart elsewhere said jarman quietly we agreed not to speak of that said lancaster stiffly i am an honourable man and in my positionoh its ridiculous dont hit a man when he is down eustace im not so ungenerous i hope you are the best of good fellows said frank impetuously but my nerves are worn rather thin with all this worry what are the conditions on which you delivered the message ill tell you later i have a scheme in my head to counterplot fan and the man she calls her uncle dont you believe that he is her uncle asked frank no replied eustace decidedly i dont she met him in san francisco and he became her accomplice to get anchor out of the way i am sure that berryor as he was thensakers fired the shot that killed the man but in some way the two were done out of this fortune connected with denham and with you they brought the boy to england to plot against you and then intended when you were put out of the way to get the money from natty that poor lad doesnt know it but i believe his life is not safe you dont think they would murder him they murdered starth oh yes i am certain on that point if berry didnt fire the shot himself he got someone else to do it but the object was to throw the blame on you so that you might be hanged i cant think why it should be necessary however we may find out from the sealed letter ah frank started and spoke in a rather agitated tone i forgot that in my troubles have you got it yes its in my pocket ill show it to you immediately have you a candle here yes but i am afraid to use it the light might be seen from the road and if mrs baker saw it she would certainly make inquiries well wait for a bit ill show you the letter before i go and then i must talk to mildred and mrs perth but about berry i wonder if anyone knows details of his past life darrel does said lancaster promptly he saw him in los angeles hm i wonder if he would tell me anything he was most insolent to me today but in your interests i dont mind putting up with that if theres anything to be learnt jarman paused for a moment and then went on frank do you think there is negro blood in darrel its curious you should say that jarman jenny arrow saw that portrait of balkis and she thought it resembled darrel i havent seen that portrait miss cork took it away you said yes and frank described how he had obtained the photograph from mildred and for what purpose im sure miss cork knows balkis she mightshe might mused jarman well ill soon know her also for i am going to look her up at the docks for what purpose cant you guess that woman is mixed up in this thing her photograph was in starths possession and berry visits her now you tell me that there is a resemblance between her and darrel i shouldnt be at all surprised to find that this negress is some relative oh but thats absurd eustace darrel comes from africa jarman laughed he went out there in the first instance he talked of being in los angeles that is in mexico and mexico is in the same latitude as the west indies then you think he may come from the islands its not improbable where does balkis come from zanzibar according to starth who was a born liar said eustace cynically i shouldnt be surprised to find she came from the west indies also and remember frank that denham was born in zacatecasthats in mexico your father travelled in those parts yes but whats all this to do with me a great deal i fancy i am sure the money is connected with mexico with balkis with darrel and with denham fan and berry know about it and the scarlet bat i shouldnt be surprised to learn that it was a kind of sign connected with the affair i cant say in what way but well know soon what i cant make out said jarman nursing his chin is why london should be plastered with posters of the scarlet bat and tamaroo you dont mean to say yes i do and eustace told frank of the poster and how fan had denied having anything to do with it and im sure she spoke the truth he said decisively for she asked me if i had posted the bat of course she must guess that you have it tattooed on your arm and thought that i made use of it but for what purpose you and i are not supposed to know anything about the fortuneif there is one oh there is one sure enough and the berry lot think i know much more about it than i do and theres another negro mixed up in the matter besides balkis the lawyers i called on told me that one came to ask after you and jarman gave details well said frank more and more puzzled theres only one thing to be done we must open the sealed letter all right here you are and in the darkness jarman passed it along frank opened it but it was impossible to see therefore eustace lighted a match which was not likely to be seen from the road and held it while frank read the letter the paper had a scarlet bat drawn in one corner with red ink and the writing consisted of only a few words my son ran the writing when you are twentyfive send your address to tamaroo the general postoffice london to be called for then wait events and tamaroo is the name on the bills said eustace under his breath chapter xviii a queer visitor well i guess this is a surprise said natty and a very pleasant one rejoined miss arrow the two were standing on number nine platform of liverpool street station waiting for the wargrove train and the meeting was accidental natty did not look so well as usual as his face was somewhat haggard jenny noticed this and thought he had been sitting up all night with considerable coolness she made the remark which natty contradicted it isnt that said mr denham gloomily ive been square enough but ive been having trouble oh dear me cried miss arrow sympathetically not bad i hope sufficiently bad to make me leave for the states next week jenny looked rather dismayed she fancied herself in love with mr denham as by this time she had quite got over her romantic affection for the irish secretary im sorry she said pensively and you will regret leavingmildred she looked at him sharply ill regret leaving all my friends those at wargrove are the best ive struck in the old country i dont know that miss starths any great sorrow to me though she dont care a red cent for me her affections are otherwhere said jenny sentimentally thats so and i dont see much good my hovering round i should like to marry a real sweet english girl jenny blushed but she was not vain enough to take the compliment to herself yet she could have done so for denham was thinking of her when he paid it jenny was not pretty but she had the freshness of youth and a sweet frank face of her own which appealed to the man denham had been so accustomed to women of the world like miss berry that he longed for something fresh and unsophisticated he had been thinking a great deal about jenny lately and now that he saw mildred was a star far above his reach thought he might do worse than take the rectors daughter the transfer of affections from miss starth to jenny was a considerable effort of mental gymnastics but natty had achieved it by the time the train started he had laid in a large quantity of magazines and newspapers for the girl and took his seat in a firstclass carriage along with her there was an old gentleman in the compartment but they did not pay much attention to him nor did they read the magazines in each others conversation they found quite enough pleasure after discussing billy and the arrow family and the departure of natty for the states natty announced that he was going down to wargrove to see jarman i want to say goodbye said he and there are other things i have to do deliver a letter for one thing to mr jarman to miss starth and its from miss berry youve heard me speak of my friends i guess oh yesyour most intimate friends well drawled natty flushing they were but they aint now ive had a row berry hasnt been acting square by me and i dont cotton to his goingson nohow ill give them a wide berth for the future jenny observed a discreet silence as she did not want to ask questions about business which did not concern her natty was offended guess you dont care much for me said he with a shrug oh but i jenny was about to say that she did and only changed the sentence in time but i like you really im going to stop for a few days and we can talk of that said natty looking peculiarly at her i suppose jarman will put me up oh im sure he will said jenny mr jarman likes you hes rather troubled now on account of mr oneil leaving him whats he gone for i dont know i think he left without giving notice said jenny i dont know that he aint wise that young man said natty in a dry tone the billet didnt suit him he seemed very comfortable what folk seem aint often what they feel rejoined the american and again fixed jenny with his eyes now youd never think that in your company i feel different to what i say really jenny did not know where to look and was thankful that the old gentleman was in the carriage she felt that natty was in measurable distance of a proposal and the timidity of maidenhood seized upon her consequently she became voluble and drew denhams attention to the scenery to the pictures in the magazines and to the news of the day natty not accustomed to this innocence was delighted and thought jenny just charming he made up his mind to propose within the week being used to carry through business smartly when the train arrived at mardon jenny bundled herself into a governesscart drawn by a fat and elderly pony and driven by one of her brothers she offered natty a seat but he refused as he caught sight of eustace coming out of the station but ill call in and see you tomorrow or this evening said natty whereat jenny afraid of this barefaced wooingit was really quite improper said her heartordered the young arrow to drive on natty watched the elderly pony toiling up the hill then turned to greet jarman here you are said natty shaking hands ive just come down to put up with you for a day or two can you fix me jarman was not quite prepared to extend this hospitality he had a better opinion of natty than of his friends all the same the young man was in touch with the captain and being weak was under his influence consequently berry might be employing natty as a spy as the report of fairy fanif she made anycould not be entirely satisfactory to the little skipper had he been on the spot he would have made an exhaustive examination as to the whereabouts of the man he desired to hang nevertheless jarman fancied that he could control the weak nature of denham quite as easily as berry had done and since the young man had come down he saw no reason why he should not make use of him he could trust to mildreds cleverness to keep him away from the summerhouse therefore if natty came and went at his own sweet will berry would be quite convinced that lancaster had left the neighbourhood it was a bold game but the situation was so desperate that only boldness would allay suspicion of course i can put you up said jarman shall we drive no i guess not let us send on the baggage and walk across i have something important to say wondering what this could be jarman saw that nattys trunk was put on a fly and after directing the man to take it to the shanty walked on with his unexpected guest eustace had long since posted a letter written by frank according to the instruction of the sealed epistle and it had been sent to tamaroo at the general postoffice the man for tamaroo was a man according to fans halfconfession was directed to call at the shanty and see mr lancaster but needless to say it was jarmans intention to interview the visitor in place of frank thus if it was a plot in any waybut that was unlikely seeing that the sealed letter came from franks fatherthe young fellow would not run the risk of being arrested i suppose you know that my secretary has left me said eustace seeing that natty did not seem inclined to begin the conversation how should i know that asked denham sharply and looking oddly at jarman you came down with miss arrow and she knows consequently well she did tell me that mr oneil had made tracks interrupted natty calmly but she did not mention that he was lancaster eustace stopped and looked hard at his companion you recognised him then denham no i was soldcompletely sold though i knew lancasters looks well enough to spot him his disguise was very clever so i got sent up miss berry told me i thought as much replied eustace with a shrug she said she would say nothing about the matter and of course she did she told berry and i was in the room and then denham clenched his fist and looked angry they wanted me to play the spy he burst out but dont you think im down here for that purpose ive given those two the chuck why did they wish you to play the spy asked eustace quietly well you see i come into money when im twentyfive not from my father he was rich but spent nearly all he had he left me with enough to get along on without working anyhow but i was told by berry who is my guardian as you know that i might inherit a million he would not give me particulars saying he would engineer the job thats what brought me over here now it seems that to get this money lancaster has to be found that he may give evidence he has some papers which prove that i am entitled to the fortune and berry hang him asked me to hunt him down this statement was a very ingenious one on the part of the captain as it simply set forth that frank was wanted for a reasonable purpose jarman could not conjecture why natty should be angered i cant see that in searching for lancaster you are playing the spy denham looked surprised why you know that lancaster was with you miss berry came down having discovered it somehow did she tell you in what way asked eustace quickly no i guess she never says more than is needful but she saw you and heard that frank lancaster had skipped then berry said that he was certain you knew the whereabouts of the fellow and asked me to come down and try to get the truth from you thats what i call acting a spy well i am here and i came to tell you this i am much obliged to you denham i suppose it is in order to prove your right to this fortune that berry offered the reward he said as much replied the young man but i pointed out that if lancaster were to come forward he might be hanged and that no fellow could be expected to be such a fool upon my word said denham walking and talking very fast i believe for some reason that berry wants the poor chap lynched i think so too admitted jarman much to nattys surprise then you dont like berry no and i dont like miss berry i know too much about both its a pity denhamsince we are now confidentialthat you are with these people well i guess banjo berry was a friend of my fathers and i was handed over to him as a ward i never liked him particularly nor his niece either is she his niece i believe so my father lived at los angeles and the berrys were often at our house my father seemed thick with berry and to tell you the truth rather afraid of him he died a year or so ago and by his will i was handed over to berry on account of this fortune i was shunted here to look after it but if the getting of it includes the chance of a man being lynchedi pass i dont need to hang on to this gang as ive enough to marry on berry can go to blazes for me i shant recognise his guardianship any longer i dont see that you ever needed him as a guardian said eustace you appear to be well able to look after yourself so i am berry thinks im weak so i am and goodnatured so i am but theres a line i dont pass and hes skipped across it i dont have anything more to do with him and so i said has he any control over the money you possess i reckon not its all my own and i dont let him or anyone else interfere ill just cut back to the states i guess eustace thought for a moment tell me mr denham did berry or your father say anything about that scarlet bat on your arm no natty stopped short and stared you saw that when i was bathing i expect i was stolen by indians so my father told me and they tattooed the mark i was a kid then and dont remember anything about it and the queer thing is added denham that all london is placarded with the bat and with the word tamaroo do you know what that means i guess not but you do see here jarman youre up to some game eustace nodded on behalf of lancaster he said and on your behalf also you are in danger natty stared danger what do you mean ill tell you that later we must have a talk when we get in all right agreed the american with a keen glance im glad i dropped across you as i dont trust the berrys a cent now i always thought there was something queer about the fortune business but before i enter your house i have to deliver a letter to miss starth ah said eustace quickly from miss berry yes how the deuce did you know i know a great deal replied eustace drily and i hope to know more im glad you have been frank with me denham i may be able to help you a lot no dont ask questions now deliver your letter and when you come to me we can have a talk theres the road up to the cottage au revoir for an hour denham went away directly but he looked puzzled as he flung a parting glance at jarman that gentleman walked on wondering at the lucky chance which had caused denham to change towards berry and his fair niece he might learn much by dexterous questions and denham really seemed to have good principles when he had revolted so completely against his tyrant altogether things were shaping well and eustace chuckled at the door of his house he saw a figure and as he drew near he beheld a negro the man was small but wiry and of considerable age judging from his grey wool he was quietly dressed in a garb as black as his face and he grinned as eustace appeared you write dis he asked holding out franks letter and when jarman nodded grinned again i am tamaroo said the black man chapter xix a story of the past tamaroo repeated the negro showing a good set of teeth for so old a man i come about the letter eustace looked at him and remembered a certain negro who had been waiting for anchor at the time the miner was shot evidently anchor had been about to explain that the man was waiting when the bullet struck him tamaroo murmured eustace i might have guessed that so queer a name would be connected with something barbaric come in in a few minutes they were seated in the study jarman since the departure of miss cork had not sought out another housekeeper so he had no fear of eavesdroppers denham was likely to be engaged with mildred for at least an hour so the interview between himself and tamaroo would not be interrupted he observed that the negro was much above the ordinary class he had a certain dignity about him wore none of the barbaric colours in which his race delight and moreover spoke surprisingly good english occasionally he lisped in the true nigger fashion but on the whole his speech would not have disgraced a moderately educated white man as soon as he sat down tamaroo gravely mounted a pair of spectacles and took out a bundle of papers tied up with red tape one moment said eustace loading his pipe as he thought he could talk better while smoking was it you who pasted the town with the scarlet bat yes it was me sir tamaroo did not say sah as an ordinary negro would have done i wanted to know where you were and as you were hiding i could do nothing else to make you know that i wanted to see you hold on said jarman seeing the mistake how do you know i am frank lancaster you could not have written this letter if you were not sir said tamaroo decisively my old master gave a direction to the lady aunt who looked after you and it was to be given to you on on the twentyfifth of september its not the date yet no sir but i thought you might get the letter before the mark on your arm sir would draw your attention to the scarlet bat on the walls and you would ask for the letter but i say tamaroo why do you come along before the time there is danger sirgreat dangerand i want to save you not me you wish to save frank lancaster tamaroo looked up quickly and replaced the bundle of letters in his breastpocket and you sir i am the friend of mr lancaster you can show me the tamaroo was on his feet before eustace finished and in his right hand he held a revolver keep back he cried shrilly you have trapped me but i fightyes i fight jarman maintained his seat and smoked coolly theres no need for you to fight man he said soothingly should i know about the scarlet bat and that letter if i were not mr lancasters friend others know and they are not friends said the negro doubtfully but lowering the revolver captain banjo berry and his niece huh tamaroo grunted in true nigger fashion you know them rather replied jarman flinging himself back and i know much more about them than they like they got poor lancaster into this trouble tamaroo groaned i know it he said and if i had only come to england sooner it would not have happened i arrived just after the trouble and heard that my young master was accused you do not believe him guilty then tamaroo no sir certainly i do not captain berry came to england to try and get my young master hanged for what reason asked eustace wondering to find his suspicions verified i always thought he did but why tamaroo touched his breastpocket that is told here he said but i cannot speak save to my master but i am his friend i may as well tell you that after he got into trouble he came to me he stopped for a time then being in danger of discovery he fled you do not know where he is asked the negro disappointed eustace looked at him keenly well i do he admitted but he is in such danger that i dare not tell cant i see the papers tamaroo moved towards the door no sir he said sternly my old master told me to read them and to give them to mr lancaster alone oh tell me where he is i beg you sir eustace looked perplexed he had no reason on the face of it to doubt the good faith of the man and the sealed letter being answered in this way was a guarantee that tamaroo was the emissary of the elder lancaster but it behoved him to be cautious as he was surrounded on all sides by snares and pitfalls captain berry was not the man to stop short of any crime to gain his endwitness the death of starth and his pursuit of frank do you know why berry is pursuing lancaster he asked forgetting that the negro might see fit to keep his own counsel for the same reasons to get him hanged to said tamaroo quietly you said that before but the reason in his turn tamaroo replied you said that before sir it is in the papers which i carry and they will explain the whole business they will they contain the whole story of the scarlet bat and of the indian treasure ah interpolated eustace with grim satisfaction i knew there was a treasure how much tamaroo a million nearly that but you can see from the will the will have you the will of mr lancaster tamaroo nodded i have the will and is mr lancaster the elder dead yes sir said the negro with emotion he died a year ago and i could not see him die alas he added much moved why not were you away tamaroo again shook his head and looked mournful then sinking his voice to a whisper he said my master was a leper eustace jumped up with an ejaculation of disgust and pity for how long was he a leper he asked thinking of the money from the time he sent my young master to the lady aunt it was for that reason he parted with him i remained but my master would not let me attend to him lest i also should take the diseaseand i had this to do he again touched his breastpocket so it was you who sent the money from frisco it was i sir my master told me to send it till i could give up the fortune to my young master and you have come to do that yes sir but only to him will i tell the story and give the papers jarman reflected the old man was evidently most trustworthy seeing he wished to fulfill his mission with the utmost exactitude he could safely be told of franks hidingplace tonight i shall lead you to mr lancaster said jarman quietly thank heavenoh thank heaven cried tamaroo and the tears rolled down his black face it has been a care to me this trust i wish to give it to my young master and be at rest oh thats all right replied eustace patting the old man on the back and well be able to baffle this conspiracy yes cried tamaroo wiping his eyes we will save my master by the way asked jarman suddenly do you know a young fellow called natty denham tamaroo nodded i do sir he is the son of my masters partner what jarman looked puzzled partner in what again the negro became obstinate it is in the papers he said that means ill learn nothing until frank does said jarman goodhumouredly you are a faithful messenger tamaroo has young denham seen you no sir i do not think he knows of my name unless captain berry oh hes told him as little as he could but i say does berry know of the contents of those papers yes sir he learnt them from here the negro hesitated eustace laughed and nodded you neednt worry he said i know of that mrs anchor who is now called miss berry learnt about the fortune from her husband tamaroo smiled grimly and then with an ejaculation smote his hands together looking in a startled way at eustace i know you now sir you were said to have killed mr anchor in san francisco yes but i suspect that berry killed him and you were the negro who was waiting at his house for him i did not wait at the house said tamaroo quietly mr anchor was a friend of my master and had some of the papers connected with the fortune of the scarlet bat when he was going after his wife he told me to come and get them then he thought he would give them to you and i waited while he visited you but i grew weary and followed i saw you speaking to mr anchor and heard the shot who fired it captain berry he was then called sakers i know but the knife wound tamaroo looked oddly at eustace i know nothing of that sir he said but we can talk again of this i will tell you all i know in the presence of mr frank and now there was a sound of laughing outside mildred suddenly appeared at the window and tapped on the glass to be let in she usually did this when impatient tamaroo saw her face and started jarman went to the door and admitted her she was with denham i have come to ask you a question said mildred entering the room oh she started back who is this this said eustace waving his hand is tamaroo what cried denham the name on the bills yes put in tamaroo quietly and thishe bowed to mildredis miss starth how do you know me asked mildred puzzled by the recognition it was i who gave you the paper at the inquest said the negro she uttered an exclamation then you know that frank is innocent yes said tamaroo with a hanging head but i cannot prove it dont you think lancaster killed starth asked natty eagerly no sir he replied looking strangely at the young man but who killed him i cannot say captain berry suggested eustace tamaroo shook his head it was not captain berry after this he refused to say any more and sat down seemingly quite worn out jarman who wished him to be prepared for the interview with frank insisted that he should lie down so the negro went to the bedroom formerly occupied by the irish secretary he locked the door when he entered apparently fearful for the safety of his papers eustace smiled approvingly every action of tamaroos showed how devoted he was to frank lancaster he returned to the room where mildred still waited with the american what is your question he asked it doesnt matter just now she replied with a glance at denham later i can talk of it this arrival of tamaroo has driven all else out of my head but do you know anything of the man i know all that frank could tell me she replied my dear eustace frank has told me all of your doings since he came to you you dont mind my calling him frank do you she said pleadingly as she saw him frown he is in such difficulties and i am so sorry jarman looked at her a little sadly seeing that she was slipping away from him no he replied quietly i dont mind have you told mr denham anything mildred uttered an exclamation she had quite forgotten the presence of the american and dreaded lest she had betrayed frank but natty came forward with a smile you need not be afraid i guess he said nodding im square and on your side i thought you were friendly to to the berrys not much ive chucked them they have been making use of me and have been trying to get lancaster hanged and are trying interrupted eustace quickly its all right mildred so sure am i of denham that i intend to trust him you need have no fear said denham colouring with pleasure im straight all through dont you trust me miss starth mildred looked at him with her innocent eyes and he met her gaze without dropping his own yes i trust you she said thoroughly in that case said eustace rubbing his hands mr denham can be present when tamaroo explains to frank explains what the whole business of the conspiracy it concerns frank and also you denham tamaroo says that your father was the partner of the late mr lancaster ive heard him mention lancasters name said natty slowly but tamaroo never came along he lay low as your countrymen say but it will all be explained tonightin this room mildred uttered an exclamation do you think that is wise yes no one is likely to come here what about captain berry asked the girl doubtfully he least of all said denham he doesnt know where i am and if by chance he does turn up ill keep him going till we can smuggle back lancaster to his hole so it was agreed although mildred was still anxious it seemed risky to her to take frank from his safe hidingplace and expose him to a chance of capture however she implicitly trusted in jarman and went back to tell frank of the arrival of the negro how is it you speak english so well eustace asked tamaroo i was educated at a negro university replied the man i am better educated than many a man of your colour sir but later on i will tell you my story tonight i must relate what i know of his father to mr lancaster and so it came about leaving natty and tamaroo together eustace repaired to the summerhouse about nine oclock and found frank waiting for him in a state of subdued excitement mildred had told him everything and he needed no explanation the night was particularly dark so the two men left the garden arm in arm mildred was walking on the lawn and watched them go and mrs perth in the house kept jane employed lest she might learn too much in a few minutes frank was in the shanty and shaking hands with tamaroo the old man was much affected at the sight of his masters son you are not at all like your father sir he said but like your dear mother heaven bless her you knew my mother she died in my arms said tamaroo quietly and then took out his bundle of papers denham frank and eustace waited anxiously to hear how the old negro would begin tamaroo untied the bundle and selected a long officiallooking paper the will he said by this mr frank you inherit close on a million if you are not hanged hanged uttered all three in sheer astonishment hanged repeated tamaroo before the age of twentyfive chapter xx a strange will tamaroo smiled at the amazement expressed on the faces of his audience although they had every excuse to look astonished do you mean to say that such a condition is in the will asked frank tamaroo nodded impressively it is set forth here he said this is a copy of the will the original is in the office of hiram co lawyers in san francisco are those the agents of white saon asked eustace yes sir i paid the monthly money through them i was afraid to bring the original will with me as i thought captain berry might kill me to get possession of it but he has only a copy and how did he get the copy asked natty quickly that is part of the story said the negro adjusting his spectacles it is all written out here but it will be best for me to tell it in my own way and then mr frank you can read the papers afterwards when you have time frank looked grim i have plenty of time he said the whole twentyfour hours of the day but tell the story in your own way the negro nodded and seemed pleased that he was allowed to do what he liked the four men were seated at the end of the room furthest from the window outside it was a particularly dark night and rain was falling at times the wind shook the house which was old the blinds of the big square window at the end where jarmans desk stood were pulled down but the curtains had not been drawn occasionally a flare of bluish lightning would show against the blinds and more clearly where they did not quite cover the window what with the drench of the rain the howling of the wind and the rolling of distant thunder the noise at times drowned the negros voice therefore the three who listened were obliged to bend their heads in order to hear clearly the lamp was drawn close to tamaroos elbow so that he could refer at his ease to the papers but this he rarely did as he seemed to know what they contained by heart he began his narrative by asking questions do you remember your father mr denham he asked oh i guess i do replied natty nodding he didnt die so very long ago we hung out in los angeles and berry was an old friend of the governors quite so nodded tamaroo and he was the ruin of your father he induced him to drink more than was good natty who had not quite got over the contempt of the american for the black race would have replied in rather a fiery manner but that tamaroo gave him no time dont be angry sir he said all that i say is means to an end well i believe berry did make my father drink admitted denham reluctantly he was always hovering round but so was anchor for the matter of that he drank also and was fairy fan anywhere in the galley asked eustace yes said tamaroo who seemed to know the lady by that name she is the niece of berry oh said frank then she really is the niece oh certainly the daughter of his sister and a very wicked woman you dont need to add that last put in eustace i know how she treated poor anchor but go on with the story i must begin at the beginning then said tamaroo and cleared his throat i need not be very particular as to time he said as the dates are all in the papers here ill just tell you the story as shortly as possible and then you can read it at leisure for yourselves thats all right said frank go on i am impatient i am a very old man continued tamaroo you mightnt believe it but i am over eighty in my youth i was a slave on a plantation near new orleans i was wickedly treated by a brutal master and mr lancaster seeing me being flogged one day bought me out of pity i was not very young then but i was strong and mr lancaster found that i could work for him i did heaven bless him said tamaroo with emotion he was a good friend to me he set me free and he sent me to school where i learnt to talk as i do afterwards when old i went to a negro college and learnt still more but when mr lancaster bought me i was very ignorant he was a handsome young man then and fond of roving he took me with him to the californian diggings and we had a wild time it was there that we first met captain berry what is his real name asked eustace i dont know he had so many but he was originally a sailor i think his true name was berry as he used that oftener than the others and always when he was well off when in difficulties he called himself by other names such as sakers at san francisco murmured eustace ah that was because he took to the sea again and lost a schooner in the south seas but when my master met him he was called banjo berry because he played so well on that instrument the name took his fancy and he kept it and anything else he could lay his hands on said denham ive heard him twang the banjo and he can scrape a bit berry and my master got on very well and were always together i did not like him myself and warned mr lancaster against him but my master would always have his own way then mr denham came my father said natty looking interested yes sir he was a gay young man then also and he took a liking to my master berry was friendly with both the three set to work to make money at the diggings but illluck pursued them at last my master grew disgusted and thought of returning to england but before he went he fancied he would like to travel about mexico for a time he took me with him but left berry and mr denham behind at the diggings we went into the wilds of mexico and had many adventuresoh very manyand were in much danger but we came through all and i saved my masters life twice heaven bless you said frank shaking the negros hand the old man nodded with a proud look i loved my master he had saved me from slavery and what else could i do but save him for two years we travelled in the wilds then we met with an indian he had been deserted by his tribe and was dying my master always kind nursed him for a long time but he grew weak and at last he died what sort of indian was he asked nattya redskin no we were not so far north as that he said he was an aztec aha murmured eustace now we are coming to the treasure tamaroo nodded you are clever mr jarman yes this indian told my master when dying that he knew of a treasure hidden under the sign of the scarlet bat kind of totem said jarman tamaroo looked puzzled i do not know what that is he said simply but the scarlet bat was a sign set by the great king montezuma on a rock under which he concealed part of his treasure the indianhe was a caciqueenraged by the desertion of those who should have saved his life told the secret to my master and how did the cacique know the secret had been handed down from his fathers denham nodded ive heard of that sort of thing before he said some indians know where the treasures of montezuma are hidden but the greater part of the hoard remains undiscovered they will not reveal its whereabouts to a white man true assented tamaroo they hate white men but my master was so kind that he won the gratitude of the cacique when the man was dying he told and gave a chart then we buried him and went to look for the treasure asked frank no sir it was a wild country where there were many indians we should have been killed had we gone alone my master returned to the diggings and offered to share the treasure with berry and with mr denham if they would come with him to find it did they agree asked natty eagerly of course they did or all this trouble wouldnt have come about put in eustace decisively you are not altogether right mr jarman said the negro quietly only mr denham would go berry was making money at the diggings and preferred the bird in the hand to the two in the bush but he came with us for a little way mr lancaster knowing he was a good shot and a fearless man wanted him greatly to come and promised him a share but he refused and turned back we went on without him and you found the treasure yes we had hard work though it was quite a year before we came across the rock marked with the scarlet bat also we had to fight our way through a hostile country and several of our men died at last we reached the rock and found the treasure with the greatest difficulty we transported it to civilisation i need not tell you all the hardships we underwent or how we got the treasure safely landed but we did i had a share and then mr denham and mr lancaster divided the rest between them so thats how my father made his money muttered natty he spent it on a large scale he did sir said the negro gravely he spent all he had with the exception of that portion he saved for you he didnt save much why didnt he leave me more tamaroo nodded impressively he was afraid of berry natty stared and looked angry my father was afraid of nothing he was afraid of berry insisted tamaroo and mr lancaster was also afraid this time frank protested i cant believe that it is true enough you see gentlemen both mr denham and mr lancaster married when they got the money you two gentlemenhe looked at frank and nattywere born on the same day that is strange said natty and frank laughed it pleased both my master and mr denham for they were such good friends so that you should both be certain of inheriting the treasure they had you both tattooed with the scarlet bat oh was that it said natty thinking of his story of the indians mine is on the left arm and yours lancaster on the right go on tamaroo the reason of the tattooing continued the negro was that my master and mr denham thought that berry would kidnap you both but what was berrys game asked natty to get the money he had bad luck at the diggings and when he returned to san francisco he found that the treasure had been discovered he claimed a share which claim was refused i should jolly well think so said jarman emphatically considering berry did nothing towards getting it what cheek so my master and mr denham thought said the negro with a smile they refused the claim and then berry threatened to kidnap you two gentlemen he thought he would then be able to force those who possessed the treasure to part with some of it the tattooing was done so that if the kidnapping took place both of you would be recognised but berry never made the attempt he waited for a better opportunity yes tamaroo nodded mr denham went to live at los angeles and spent a lot of money his wife died after a time and he looked after you sirthis to nattyso that you might not be kidnapped at length berry turned up after some years and made friends didnt my father mistrust him at first he did but afterwards being shaken by drink i think he grew afraid of berry he shared a portion of the money with him that is he gave him free houseroom and occasional sums berry was not satisfied but when he found that mr denham was spending the money he never attempted to kill him knowing that what remained would not pay him to commit such a crime he then thought of my master who had saved his share did my father live in san francisco yes mr lancaster after the death of your mother he lived like a recluse and invested all his money it is well invested said tamaroo proudly i helped him you will receive about forty thousand a year now if im ever in a position to enjoy it muttered frank startled by this good fortune well did berry see my father he did mr lancaster was then beginning to suffer from leprosy but the disease had not made much progress when it began he sent you to the lady aunt mr frank i was then two years of age i remember go on berry came to your father and threatened to follow you to england and kill you mr lancaster grew afraid and made this will ah put in eustace now we come to the interesting part why did he make such an extraordinary will and place frank in such danger it was the best he could do to save him from berrys machinations mr jarman said the negro quietly being a leper he could not do much as his disease was gaining on him and he thought he would be sent away to some settlement by the authorities that afterwards happened but at the time i speak of he was still in frisco my poor father murmured frank and what about anchor mr lancaster met him afterwards but about the will my master knew that berry was a fascinating man with a strong influence he thought that if he left the money to you berry might gain an influence over you since you were so young and get you to leave the money to him then he would murder you to become possessed of it berry would never have fascinated me declared frank i am not so weakminded as that you were young then mr frank and berry could have done much with you as a boy he influenced mr denham here he certainly did assented natty and im no slouch either but berry in spite of his looks and rascality is fascinating i was quite taken in by him but i see through him now wellthe will as i said went on tamaroo mr lancaster did not know how to make the money safe from berry therefore he made his will leaving the money to you mr frank and afterwards to denhams son thats to me said natty i see now this money is the fortune i was to inherit yes my master did not know that berry had such an influence over your father nor did i or a different will would have been made but the money was to go to you provided that mr frank was hanged before he reached the age of twentyfive if mr frank died a natural death or was murdered the money was to go to a charity anchor was made the trustee of this will but i dont see where the sense of the hanging comes in well mr jarman said the negro turning to eustace who had spoken its this way my master thought that unless he put in that clause berry might get rid of mr frank by violence but if he murdered him the money would have gone to the charity quite so assented tamaroo quietly and even if mr frank died a natural death that would have happened mr lancaster knew that berry was mixed up with people of our race who knew something of poisons aha said jarman balkis yes balkis sir though i dont know how you came to hear of her ill tell you later go on tamaroo paused to collect his thoughts and continued so you see that the only way in which berry could prevent the money going to the charityin which case it would be lost to him altogetherwas by getting mr frank hanged my master fancied that even if berry did not murder mr frank openly he might get some drug from balkis which would kill mr frank without revealing that poison had been used and that could have been done said tamaroo impressively ah i see now cried eustace berry by means of this poison could have made franks death appear natural yes sir in which case the money would have gone to the charity mr lancaster knew that being brought up by the lady aunt his son would not commit a crime so it was not likely that berry would succeed in getting him hanged before the age of twentyfive i see said frank grimly but he has made a good shot at it i was to be hanged for the murder of starth and then natty here was to get the money yes said tamaroo and afterwards mr denham was to be put out of the way and berry and his niece were to benefit very clever muttered natty but im not quite such a fool and mr lancaster is dead he is sir his disease got worse after he made his will and he went to a leper settlement where he died some time ago as soon as i heard of his death i brought home these papers only to learn that mr frank was in danger of being hanged to find him i plastered london with those posters then i there was a smash of glass and the blind of the middle window bulged out berry sprang into the room with a revolver i arrest you he called out to frank for the murder of starth i arrest you jarman purposely overturned the lamp and in the ensuing darkness confusion ensued when it was relighted tamaroo and frank had disappeared chapter xxi an unexpected meeting the next morning darrel who was still at the rectory paid a visit to mildred had she been within doors she would have refused to see him as she was much distressed in her mind frank had not returned from the shanty nor had eustace appeared to explain the reason mildred was haunted by visions of the young man being captured and since she firmly believed in his innocence felt very anxious after a sleepless night she came out before breakfast to take the air in the garden and so found herself face to face with darrel in the most unexpected way he entered the grounds with an air of possession which was intensely irritating to mildred in her then state of mind and she was not prepared to receive him warmly you come at an awkward hour mr darrel she said coldly and i am not able to see you i thought you might refuse he replied sulkily but i cannot deny myself the pleasure of being the first to bring you the good news you will be glad to hear that the murderer of your brother walter has been caught mildred nearly fainted but saved herself by a strong effort are you speaking of mr lancaster she asked of who else replied darrel with a triumphant smile he is the guilty person last night berry of whom you have heard came down and found him in jarmans house i believe there was a fight but in the end the man was caught you must be pleased i am not pleased mr lancaster is innocent of course he would tell you that in his character of oneil said the man scornfully but its a lie i believe he is guilty perhaps you denounced him to captain berry no i told him that if he left you alone i would hold my tongue the girl turned on him angrily and what right have you to say such a thing about me she demanded vehemently i am not engaged to you i never shall be oh yes you will he replied coming closer and looking into her white face with angry eyes you will be my wife now that this villain is out of the way never and mr lancaster is not a villain he is he killed your brother you cannot love the murderer of your brother who told you that i loved mr lancaster my own heart bah do you think i can be deceived did i not see the looks which passed between you mildred looked on him with ineffable contempt you mean low pitiful coward she said while he winced at the ringing scorn in her voice you come here to insult me because i will not marry you now hear me i do love frank aha low cry of rage escaped himyou call him frank i do for i love him he has said nothing to me and i do not even know if he returns my feeling yes you do said darrel striking his stick passionately on the ground and glaring on her fiercely you two understand one another very well i believe that you knew where he was concealed after he left jarman ahhe read her faceyou did know thats my business leave this place at once darrel stood his ground doggedly i refuse to go i refuse to give you up he declared with a growl like a wild beast disturbed at mealtime your lover has been arrested he will hang and you will be my wife ill bring your pride down then never never never frank can prove his innocence and i will die sooner than be your wife you betrayed him you pitiful coward i did not miss berry learnt that he was here through you she flashed out no on my soul he protested i said nothing i dont know how she learnt it but she did make the discovery and told berry he came down here last night and watched jarmans cottage he saw lancaster enter and waited outside the window after a time he smashed the glass with his gloved hands and sprang into the room with a revolver jarman overturned the lamp and then and then said a new voicethat of jarman who had stolen upon the two unobservedthen frank escaped in the darkness with tamaroo darrel turned on the newcomer fiercely but mildred gave a cry of joy frank has not been taken then she cried clapping her hands this manshe looked scornfully at darrelsays he was captured what do you mean by that demanded eustace who looked pale and ill and was evidently in a sullen mood because im sure he has been taken by this time i saw berry last night ah cried mildred you came to help yes i did i wanted lancaster removed from my path berry came to the rectory to ask for my assistance but he knew already where to find the man i went with him to the cottage and you lurked outside not being man enough to enter said jarman with a sneer i turned berry out pretty sharp being an american he has yet to learn that an englishmans house is his castle and you have to learn mr jarman that you have been compounding a felony in sheltering this criminal frank is not a criminal cried mildred with a stamp ah you defend your brothers murderer sneered darrel savagely dont talk rubbish darrel interposed jarman you know well enough that lancaster is innocent he is not he certainly escaped last night but berry is on his track lancaster may disguise himself but tamaroo will be spotted in a mighty short time they cant escape why did you tell me that frank was arrested asked mildred i thought you would be pleased he said sulkily no you thought it would wound my heart you coward go away she stamped her foot i hate the sight of you mildred said eustace quietly though he felt a pang at seeing how she defended frank let me attend to this gentleman i shant move till he goes said she obstinately you had better go said eustace suggestively to the rhodesian and leave the field to you he answered with a taunting laugh how many more lovers have you miss starth mildred gave a cry of shame and her face crimsoned with a shout eustace dashed forward and before darrel knew what he was about he swung him up in his mighty arms and pitched him clean over the gate into the roadway where he sprawled like a huge toad mildred caught jarman by the hand panting oh you are a mana man she said darrel picked himself up but did not show fight his face was more like that of a negro than ever and eustace believed he was a halfcaste seeing how the racial type came out you bully growled the man fiercely but keeping well in the roadway ill be even with you i can guess where lancaster is hiding now and ill hunt him downill hunt him down he shall hang and you jarman shall go to prison for having assisted him as for youhe turned fiercely on the girl who stood beside eustace shaking and whiteyou shall be my wife ill break your spirit illill he could speak no more for sheer rage and his hands trembled with excitement finally he gave a roar like a wounded lion and dashed away mildred wrung her hands in dismay he will hunt down frankhe will hunt down frank nonsense said eustace roughly helping her to a seat its all bluff on his part he cant know where frank has fled to so long as the boy is with tamaroo i am sure he will be safe did they say where they were going asked mildred no there was no time berry in a most wonderful way smashed in the window i expect he used his coat to avoid being cut by the glass before we knew where we were he was in the middle of the room and covering frank with his derringer the only thing that occurred to me was to overturn the lamp which i did then i made for berry but found him already struggling with natty i managed to light a candle and discovered that tamaroo had disappeared with frank what did berry do he accused me of sheltering a criminal i would not let him leave the room so that the two fugitives could get a start then i turned him out i expect he joined darrel although i never knew that darrel was outside and they went away but if mr darrel was outside he must have seen the direction in which frank went i doubt it the night was so dark and stormy but even if he did he could do nothing berry afraid of the law as i thought he would be did not bring a policeman with him nor did he have a warrant frank can escape by halfadozen stations round about they are all within walking distance depend upon it tamaroo will take him to some safe place and then we shall hear i trust the negro but about the willthe there is no time to talk about that now said eustace brusquely there is much to be done if berry is to be thwarted hell hunt frank down with all his heart and soul and now darrel out of sheer hatred will join in i want to save frank he paused and looked directly at mildred i wish to save him for she put out her hands no say nothing now afterwards we will talkwe canoh believe meiishall keep my bargain your bargain was not that i should save frank but discover the assassin of your brother said eustace gloomily but to do the one i must do the other frank shall be saved and the man who killed walter shall be caught and thenhe paused again with a shiverand thenwe will talk as you say but i want to say say nothing mildred child he said as she rose all i wish is to see you happy i have made one mistake do not let me make another no dont speak im only a man after all and i am not equal toto he passed his hand across his forehead then started briskly but this is not business he broke off and held out his hand give me the letter amazed by his sudden transition from sentiment to business mildred did not quite comprehend the letter she stammered yes the letter written by miss berry to you saying that she loved your brother and wished to marry him denham gave it to you yes yes but how did you i got her to write it said jarman quickly she wanted me to deliver a message to frank for her and i agreed to do it on conditions they were that she should write such a letter i wondered that she should said mildred searching in the pocket of her dress i came to talk to you about it last night that was the question you wished to ask yes but the arrival of tamaroo put it out of my head did she love my brother no nor did she intend to marry him then why did she write a lie because she would write anything to secure her own ends said jarman taking the letter this will not hurt her in any way and as i asked her to write it she did i am only beating her with her own weapons what do you intend to do with the letter asked the girl eustace put it away and smiled faintly i am going to show it to a black lady called balkis i heard something about her from frank but why dont ask me questions my dear said eustace impatiently for he felt that he could not talk about the negress without exposing the opium smoking of the dead brother there is no time i go to london in an hour first i look in at that house in sand lane where walter lived yes frank told me that when he called to see your brother on the day of the murder one of the windows was open tilly the servant in her evidence said that the windows were all bolted and barred i am going to ask why she told the lie i suspect that she knows that someone got into the house else she would not have given false evidence and that someone is the murderer oh i hope you will be successful cried mildred clasping her hands and afterwards i go to the docks to see balkis ill tell you all about it when i return keep up your spirits mildred said jarman holding out his hand ill save frank yet she bent down and before he could stop her kissed his hand oh how noble you arehow noble then she ran into the house to prevent further betrayal of emotion jarman turned away sadly no hope for me he thought she loves the boy and he her the two young things have been loyal to me and have not come to an understanding shall i be less noble well well well he passed his hand across his face with a sigh we shall see at the mardon railway station jarman saw darrel getting into the train he gave a scowl as his eyes fell on his enemy but made no remark thinking that the rhodesian was losing no time and wondering if he really knew where the hunted man was to be found eustace slipped into a thirdclass smoker he dismissed the big man from his thoughts as the only chance of saving frank lay in getting evidence to prove his innocence and jarman hoped to get a portion of such evidence from the servant tilly samuels on arriving at liverpool street he took the underground train to south kensington and soon found himself in sand lane at the door of the house formerly occupied by starth he saw two women one was tilly who was weeping and the othermiss cork chapter xxii miss cork explains the housekeeper looked lean and shadowy as usual she was still dressed in grey and wore her hair screwed into the same doorknob that jarman knew so well but her face wore a smile and she was staring at tilly with passionate affection when she heard jarmans foot on the pavement she turned round with the look of a tigress ready to defend her cubs but at the sight of her old master she changed colour and made as if to run away but eustace caught her by the elbow and prevented her departure tilly who wore the blue dress and the picturehat looked amazed and indignant ere sir she said shrilly jes leave my mother be dye see your mother said eustace recalling miss corks mention of a stolen child jus so snapped tilly making warlike demonstration with the yellow umbrella ill call the policeman round the corner an hes a friend o mine its bad enough for that old betts to keep m box without m mother being hit and she again began to weep hush child said miss cork sharply and removing her arm from the grasp of eustace i must speak with this gentleman i had hoped never to see you again mr jarmanwith a curtseyas i have behaved ungrateful but if you will put temptation in poor folks way you must take the consequence but what temptation are you speaking of thats a long story said miss cork we cant talk here and mrs betts who employed my child has turned her out of the house without m box snivelled tilly wiping her eyes with a pair of cotton lavender gloves alts presents is in it too at that moment looking very small and very fierce and very like that celebrated mrs raddle who persecuted bob sawyer the mistress of the discharged servant appeared at the door dont stop the road up before my house she cried shaking a mittened fist not a box or a character will you get till you give up your wages for giving me only three days notice thats the way she goes on sir sobbed tilly as if m mother didnt want to take me away and make a real lady of me wait a moment said jarman who knew the landlady having once or twice visited starth at these rooms i can arrange this now mrs betts he said striding to the door what is the matter oh mr jarman im that ashamed really so unpleasant what must you think simpered mrs betts becoming suave i think that i want to have a talk with this young lady and her mother said eustace grimly and ill be glad if youll let us have a room for halfanhour lady mother gurgled mrs betts well im sure and whats the world coming to id like to know when gentlemen oh allow me to know my own business best interrupted jarman impatiently tillys mother was my housekeeper that alters the case said mrs betts blandly a room is at your service sir but i dont give box or character until ill pay you tillys wages and you can give both tilly set up a shrill cry of triumph over mrs betts and would have darted into the house but that she was withheld by miss cork we must speak to mr jarman first said the exhousekeeper and i must have the moneyfifteen shillingsbefore the box eustace nodded i am in a hurry mrs betts he said walking into the passage let me have a room and halfanhour with these two quite satisfied though rather perplexed the landlady showed her visitor into a small room on the ground floor it was badly furnished and worse lighted but at least it was a place where eustace felt he could talk privately to miss cork tilly and her mother entered and jarman closed the door i shouldnt tork loud said the small servant pointing to the keyhole her ears allays there a shrill voice through the keyhole replied that this was untrue and bestowed several unflattering epithets on tilly afterwards the retreating footsteps of mrs betts were heard and tilly giggled over her success in detecting the old lady but eustace was too worried to take any interest in this comedy he stationed tilly near the door that she might give notice if mrs betts returned and then addressed himself to his old housekeeper well miss cork and what have you to say i beg your pardon i am not miss cork as i have found my child i can take my real name which is selina burlmrs burl i now go out charing and never will i be parted from my child again you need not be so far as i am concerned but now explain why did you leave me without notice i saw a picture of the black woman who stole my child you mean balkis yes i mean the woman who keeps an opium shop at the docks did she steal your child asked eustace wondering years ago sighed mrs burl while tilly looked on intelligently why should she steal your child ah thats a long story ill tell it to you if you like sir im ready to hear it answered eustace wondering at the coincidence which had brought his former housekeeper into contact with balkis burl drank began the lady abruptly he was a housepainter and earned wages of the highest when not at the bottle he turned me out into the street one night with tilly mrs burl pointed to her newlyfound offspring who giggled we lived near the docks by reason of the cheap rents i had nowhere to go and was found by that black woman who called herself balkis how long ago did this happen never you mind replied mrs burl drawing her shawl closely round her ill tell what i can and that which i dont tell dont matter balkis as she called herself said she wanted a servant and took me in she gave no wages but a comfortable home wetilly and mestopped with her for some time then i left why did you leave a comfortable place asked jarman mrs burl pursed up her lips and shook her head it werent respectable she said nodding no though in one way it were i havent a word to say against balkis who always kept herself like a lady though she was the colour of the teakettle but you see mr jarman she kept an opium shop and a gambling den ah did she what did the police say now you come to the reason of my leaving sir the police knew nothing about the gambling i dont think they minded the opium smoking such people came there mrs burl shuddered chinamen and lascars and low sailors and sometimes gentlemen who were fond of the pipe but all that was almost public as you might say the gamblinghere mrs burl lowered her voiceit took place in the secret rooms what do you mean by the secret rooms what i do say mr jarman replied mrs burl with several nods and an air of mystery the opium shop was near the river and respectable to look at outside being painted and kept clean but the roomswhich i cleanedwere almost under the river and furnished like buckingham palace balkis used to boast that if the police ever found out her rooms they would never leave them alive did she mean to murder them ah thats just what i dont know shes a terrible woman and has all kinds of ideasvery wicked ideas though i must say that she is respectable for the most part all she wanted was to make money and she made it quicker out of the gambling rooms than in any other way the piles of gold and notes ive seen there sir you wouldnt believe and the chinamen played an evil game called fantan i know it said eustace who had been in canton then you know a wicked thing mr jarman begging your pardon but i had a quarrel with balkis as she would not give me money to dress tilly and i threatened to leave balkis said that i could go and then like a fool knowing the terrible woman she was i said id tell the police about the secret rooms and the gambling that was indeed foolish mrs burl ah it was sir and soon i found it balkis when i was asleep took tillywho was then a childfrom my side and hid her away in effect she kidnapped her yes mr jarman she did and when i woke fair distracted she said i would never see my child again until she made her money out of the gambling when she shut them up and returned to america ah said eustace she came from america she did mr jarman from a west indian island but when she went i was to have tilly again i implored her to give me my child but she only laughed she declared if i said a word about the gambling rooms that i would never see tilly again then she turned me out and i went searching for tilly for many a long month till i was taken up for vagrancy and you found me why didnt you tell me this before asked eustace i could have told the police and have recovered your child thats just why i held my tongue said mrs burl quickly if the police had been informed i would never have got tilly again when i was with you i several times went to ask balkis about tilly and she assured me that she was well i was brought up in a wurkhus put in tilly and then mrs betts took me so ive bin ere since though the situation aint worth much i see said eustace well mrs burl and how did you recover tilly mrs burl moved uneasily now im coming to my ingratitude sir i was afraid when i saw the picture of balkis which mr lancaster left hullao cried eustace with sudden suspicion how did you know my secretary was lancaster and what do you know of him i know all that i read in the papers said mrs burl with hanging head and when i went sometimes to see balkis i heard captain berry talk of how he wished to get mr lancaster captain berry you know the whole gang ah that i do sir and will give you any information i can now that i have my tilly safe balkis wanted to catch mr lancaster also because he had killed mr starth of whom she thought much she was in love with him well sir you might go so far as that she loved him and thought mr lancaster guilty so when i found out that you were hiding mr wait said eustace how did you learn that i listened and then i knew murmured mrs burl i see said eustace sternly and you betrayed the poor wretch mrs burl began to weep i am ashamed of myself you may well be said jarman bitterly i can guess what you did having told balkis that you could inform her and berry where the man they wanted was to be found you promised to denounce him if balkis gave you tilly yes faltered mrs burl i told her and she said that tilly was with mrs betts so i came here and tilly gave notice and now we are going away but i am ashamed i dont want any apologies said jarman coldly it is worse than useless to hear them from so ungrateful a woman as you are come to the facts balkis told berry yes sir whimpered the woman and she told miss berry who also came to the opium shopbut not to smoke i will say thats enough said jarman cutting her short in disgust i know now how berry and his niece came to find lancaster you have got your child as the price of your treachery so there is no more to be said but the least you can do is to give me the address of balkis oh ill do that said mrs burl sobbing i aint afraid of her now i have my tilly but dont go into them secret rooms sir for youll never leave them alive i should be sorry to see any trouble come upon you mr jarman that comes well from you retorted eustace ironically however here is a piece of paper and a pencil write down the address of balkis while i talk to your daughter mrs burl obeyed with sighs and sobs but seemed glad to be let off so easily tilly looked up alertly wotever ave you to say to me she asked with wonder expressed on her wizened face this said eustace sharply at the inquest you said that all the windows and doors were bolted you know that one of the front windows was open tilly began to whimper in her turn i was afraid of mrs betts she cried shes such a ard woman and would ave given me beans if shed found as id gone out leaving the winder ajar then the window was open yes sir the rightand winder but the blind was down that wouldnt keep out anyone have you any idea who got in and murdered mr starth why sirtillys eyes opened widelydidnt that yelleraired no he didnt and you know he didnt selp me sir i never you know more than you said at the inquest said eustace tilly interpolated her mother in severe tones having written the address tell all its the least we can do to this kind gentleman after the way weve treated him you neednt blame tilly said eustace drily you are in fault not she come nowto tillydo you suspect anyone no said tilly defiantly i dont eustace thought for a moment then he took out a sovereign and tossed it to mrs burl go and get the box he said and call a cab ill speak with tilly alone mrs burl accustomed to obey eustace went out at once with a final recommendation to tilly to tell all now then said jarman when alone with the small servant did you pick up anything yes said tilly in a frightened voice and fished in the pocket of her blue dress this and this one was in the kitchen the ribbon and tother was on the sittingroom floor the object found on the sittingroom floor was the invitation sent by starth to lancaster asking him to call probably starth for the furtherance of the plot had taken it out of franks pocket when he lay insensible intending to destroy it but had forgotten to do so it must have lain unnoticed on the floor till picked up by tilly and you found this before the police came yes sir i should have told em but i was that scared as i didnt you did very wrong said eustace severely the coroner insisted that the deceased did not ask lancaster to see him and this is the proof that he did what about the ribbon i found it in the kitchen said tilly in a subdued voice it is a tarting ribbon and i thought it pretty have you worn it no sir and i aint told anyone of it ill take charge of these said eustace putting the articles into his pocket say nothing about them now did you find the window as you left it when you returned no whimpered tilly when i went in to lock it for the night it wos close shut and locked did mrs betts do that no she werent in the room observe said eustace how foolish you have been not to state this the person who killed starth must have entered by the window and have locked it when within he afterwards left by the door she couldnt have got in through the winder what do you mean well sir said tilly with hesitation that tarting ribbon wos worn by a woman as it aint a necktie eustace was also of this opinion after some reflection and wondered if starth could have been killed by a woman he asked tilly several other questions but could learn nothing new from her then having taken possession of the addressthat written by his former housekeeperhe left the house the last he saw of mrs burl she and tilly were struggling with mrs betts for the possession of a very small green trunk and the waiting cabman was applauding the fight evidently some new trouble in connection with the three days notice was taking place however eustace had more serious things to think of and washed his hands completely of mrs burl after her ungrateful behaviour he lost no time in taking the underground to the city and thence departed for the docks after a dull journey he repaired to the address mentioned in the paper it was a certain number in a narrow lane which led down to the waters edge on the righthand side of this eustace found a respectablelooking house painted a spotless white and with green shutters it would not have disgraced a new suburb the doorstep was also white and the brass knocker polished to a painful brilliancy amidst all the other frowsy houses that of balkis looked fresh and clean and genteel the door was opened by a lean chinaman dressed in blue he made no remark but conducted eustace into a room furnished in the chinese manner jarman was left alone for a few minutes then a huge negress entered the room and he recognised her as balkis from the picture it was not her looks that made him start but her garb she was dressed in a brilliant tartan gown and the ribbon picked up in the sand lane house by tilly was of the same pattern chapter xxiii balkis for a moment or two eustace and the negress eyed one another he was admiring her shapely form and stately bearing although black she was comely and in spite of the character given to her by miss cork alias mrs burl looked a goodnatured creature in the main although jarman granted that she could be furious when aroused on the evidence of the tartan ribbon he wondered if she had been lurking in mrs bettss kitchen on that fatal day and whether she had killed the man she professed to love on her side balkis wasas the americans put itsizing up her visitor her customers were for the most part lascars malays chinamen and sailors but occasionally a gentleman from the west end would come to her respectable house to smoke a sly pipe of opium some even came to gamble and balkis was wondering if this welllooking man was a smoker or a gambler she waited for him to speak being shrewd and not caring to venture an opinion until she knew precisely what his business was do you know an old man called tamaroo asked eustace suddenly balkis looked at him serenely i never heard of him she said jarman noticed that she spoke almost as well as tamaroo himself and wondered that within so short a space of time he should come into contact with two educated members of the african race evidently she was on her guard so eustace tried another shot i was directed to this house by mrs burl he said this time balkis showed emotion and to speak truly became rather ferocious shes a bad woman an ungrateful woman i saved her and her child from starving and she she threatened to betray you finished jarman serenely balkis stared and looked still more unpleasant there is nothing wrong that she could say if you belong to the police youve wasted your time i am quite respectable even to keeping those secret gamblingrooms what she glared at him like a tigress burl told you that did she and after my telling her where to find tilly after taking away tilly from her for years said jarman calmly you know a great deal of what does not concern you said balkis placing her hands on her hips and if youve come to threaten i am quite able to defend myself theres no gambling here and no secret rooms if you want a clean mat and a pipe you can have it i have never been in trouble with the law yet eustace produced the piece of ribbon do you know where i found this he asked dangling it between finger and thumb you bought it i suppose she said quietly eustace shook his head observe it is of the same pattern as your dressas the ribbon you wear round your neck whats that to do with me simply this it belongs to you and was lost in a house in sand lane kensington where a balkis made a step towards him and her big eyes rolled savagely why are you talking like this she asked hoarsely if you know tamaroo he will tell you tell me yourself mister theres no reason why i should not i have come here for certain information and i dont go away till i get it information about what she demanded unpleasantly about certain people whom you know captain berry his niece tamaroo and lancaster lancasterthe wretch who murdered my walter cried balkis with a tragic air see here mister i have men belowforeign men who carry knives at a word from me theyd cut your tongue out at the risk of having a hole drilled through them said eustace balkis seemed disconcerted as she apparently did not expect that he would be armed who are youyour name eustace jarman to his surprise balkis made a clutch at his hand and shook it warmly why didnt you say so before where do you live in essexat wargrove who had you for housekeeper miss cork who now is mrs burl balkis clapped her huge hands youre the right man i expected you would come and see me you expected me yes tamaroo told me you would come sooner or later and then i heard of you in frisco mrs anchor eh said balkis archly oh so you dont come from zanzibar who said i did walter starth told lancaster the face of the negress grew sad yes i told walter that forfor reasons with which you have nothing to do well what do you come to me for mr jarman to see if you are the friend or the enemy of berry i am neither the one nor the other she said frankly i knew him in san francisco and in jamaica he is a sailor and found me out through following my walter why did he follow him i cant tell you that yet she said suspiciously walter came here to smoke he was fond of a pipe he met captain berry up west and berry followed him here then we recognised one another and good old banjo often came here to smoke a pipe but why do you ask these questions eustace reflected she appeared to be frank and certainly did not side with berry to any great extent he thought it best to trust her for even if she made use of the information he gave her it would not benefit her in any way you loved walter starth asked eustace the big negress who had been standing dropped into a chair with all my soul she said vehemently ah you think because i am black that i have no feelings but i did love him he was going to marry meyes i am rich and i could have bought him you certainly gave him your photograph said jarman but if you come from america how did you write those arabic words i did not it was a malay who wrote them for me i wanted walter to think that i came from zanzibar i did not want him to know anything about san francisco why not i shant tell you i have my own secrets again i ask why you question me in this way because i am a friend of lancasters and i want to prove his innocence he is not innocent cried balkis with a lowering brow he killed my walter tamaroo says he did not and i have not made up my mind to harm him yet harm whotamaroo no the man lancaster i can get rid of him in my own way i see you have something to do with obi balkis shuddered and her face turned grey hush say not that dread name she said looking round fearfully why do you a white man talk of obi you are not of usyou know nothing of the fetish no but i have travelled in the west indies you know how to prepare the poisons that are used in connection with obiagain the negress shudderedso you propose to get rid of lancaster by giving him poison well that is better than being hanged but how are you going to get lancaster here he has disappeared i know how to get him when i want said balkis sulkily tamaroo is his friend and tamaroo also loves the fetish not to such an extent as to make lancaster over to you for you to practise your devilish arts on him said eustace indignantly or do you intend to put him into your secret rooms and get rid of him as you would rid yourself of the police did they raid the place burl again said the woman with a snarl and showing a magnificent set of white teeth she told you a lot if i get her here again she will have the chance of seeing how i can rid myself of those i do not like she paused then said abruptly there are no rooms that means you dont trust me yet said jarman feeling in his pocket he determined as a last resource to make use of the letter written by fairy fan for this moment had he procured it did starth love you he asked looking at her yes he was going to marry me but he was killed and i shall avenge his death if lancaster killed him lancaster shall die jarman spoke plainly do you know miss berry well she also loved starth and he promised to marry her balkis gave a yell like that of an enraged lioness it is not truenot true she said in guttural tones a lie a lie a lie she danced and stamped as she reiterated the word he loved me and me only he said so he was to marry me he was to marry miss berry here is the proof and eustace handed her the letter which she snatched from him eagerly to arouse the jealousy of balkis had he got this letter written and had put it to a use which fairy fan never expected or she certainly would not have written it eustace guessed that a semicivilised creature like balkis would be insanely jealous and that if she found the man she loved adored another woman would make short work of that woman had balkis been on the side of the berrys jarman hoped to detach her from their interests by means of this letter but balkis apparently cared neither one way nor the other still to make her talk more freely it was worth while trying the experiment the ruse was successful for the great black creature after reading the letter went fairly mad she shall dieshe shall die was her cry and again she stamped crushing up the letter in her strong fingers if fairy fan now came within reach of those fingers eustace thought she would have short shrift but he was not sorry the crimes of mrs anchor needed some such punishment suddenly balkis thrust the letter into her pocket and seizing jarmans hand kissed it savagely you are my friend i swear by you i will do what you want she said hoarsely then tell me who killed starth i cannotunless it was lancaster tamaroo says no but then he is the friend of lancaster how did you meet tamaroo i knew him in san francisco he also is obiworshipper he knew i was here in london and when he came he visited me i told him all i knew about captain berry did tamaroo come after starth died no a week before he died eustace thought tamaroo said that he arrived after the death and in that way explained his inability to find frank but it seemed that he was really in town beforehand did tamaroo know starth no said balkis she paused and looked questioningly you heard of the scarlet bat she asked yes tamaroo told me all about it ah balkis drew a long breath me also he told and how berry wished for the money he learnt that berry came here and asked questions i told him all when he heard that berry knew my walter he said he would go to walter to hear more of him i told him the house and sent that ribbon with tamaroo so that walter might know he came from me oh then tamaroo was in the house when the murder was committed balkis looked queerly at him tamaroo did not kill my walter she said if he had i should have killed him and although jarman urged her to say more she declined to do so then he thought of the likeness remarked upon by jenny between mr darrel and balkis do you know a man called darrel i do he comes from jamaica why should i tell you a lie he is a cousin of mine i thought so said jarman drawing a deep breath yes he has our blood in him he comes here at times but he never calls me cousin he thinks himself white but he has our blood well balkis you know now how miss berry has treated you i shall kill her said balkis gnashing her splendid teeth and i know how to kill her painfully jarman shuddered so ferociously did she make this speech he thought he would not like to offend this creature and you will help me to save lancaster he said eagerlyto save him and baffle the berrys i do not know she said sullenly and heaved herself up from the chair if he is innocent he shall not die if not he shall die come where will you take me asked eustace following her to the door but feeling in his hip pocket that his revolver was loose to my secret rooms said balkis looking back with a grin ah then mrs burl is right you have secret rooms balkis nodded and led him down a long passage and i can kill in them she said in a matteroffact tone but not you you are my friend she grinned again i shall let you see that woman die if you like jarman shuddered again at the venomous tone and in spite of his courage felt a trifle nervous however he had his revolver and if it came to the worst resolved to fight now that he had launched himself into the adventure he was resolved to carry it through he had promised mildred to save frank and this was the only way to do it balkis could tell the truth and he wished her to do so the negress led him to a trap door and they descended to find themselves in a long stone passage at the end of it was an iron door which she opened eustace was conscious of a blaze of light and in the glare sawof all peopletamaroo and frank lancaster chapter xxiv tamaroo speaks you did not expect to find me here said frank after he had shaken hands warmly with his friend the very last place in which i should have looked for you how did you come he glanced inquiringly at tamaroo i brought him replied the old negro when you overturned the lamp i drew mr frank away in the darkness we went to the nearest railway station and came to town then did we seek this shelter the captain will never think to find us here what of him he is furious and quite at a loss to find you but eustace glanced at balkis where she stood with folded arms staring at frank with no very pleasant expression there is nothing to fear she said guessing jarmans meaning as yet i am not sure if this man killed my walter i did not interposed frank i told you so before and i also assured you of his innocence said tamaroo uneasily balkis still continued to glare as i say i am not sure she declared obstinately if you did not kill my walter you will come to no harm here you can stay until i send you out of the place to foreign parts but if you killed himshe looked savagethere will be no escape for you now you know and with this not very reassuring speech she passed through the door again shutting it with a clang eustace heard a key turn in the lock and recalled the warning of mrs burl are we safe here he asked tamaroo who appeared quite easy in his mind i was told that these rooms were dangerous dangerous echoed the negro looking round why should they be dangerous jarman repeated the warning of mrs burl and the boast of balkis but tamaroo merely laughed there is no danger he said decisively i am quite sure that balkis will do nothing to harm us she does not seem to be very well disposed towards frank because she will insist that i killed starth said frank no doubt berry has been poisoning her mind however berry will not look for me here darrel might hinted eustace uneasily nonsense how can he find this place oh he knows it my belief that he had the negro blood in his veins is true he is a relative of balkis and sometimes comes here but he is not proud of the relationship but even if he does know this place hell never think that i am here eustace looked doubtful i had to pitch him out of the garden of rose cottage he said he was impertinent to mildred to mildred repeated frank with an angry flush yes responded jarman keeping his eyes away from franks face he saidwell never mind what he said i punished him for his insolence and he went away vowing that he would hunt you down tamaroo laughed he will never come here he said he must know that balkis is on the side of the berrys and will believe that this is the last place i would bring my master to the very danger of the refuge makes its safety i am not sure that balkis is on the side of captain berry now was the reply of eustace she certainly will not help him if only because she hates fairy fan and eustace related how he had made use of the letter miss berry had written tamaroo nodded approvingly that is a good plan he said if she thinks the white woman loved starth she will not help her plots balkis was madly in love with mr starth she says he would have married her said jarman frank laughed i dont believe that starth was nice in his ideas of female beauty and would not marry a black woman moreover he was desperately in love with fan balkis knows that and hates fan accordingly said eustace grimly but starth might have married balkis for her money she is certainly rich put in tamaroo meditatively already she has made up her mind to return to america she goes next week and what will you do with frank then take him abroad i have arranged it all with balkis she knows many sailors and can get some captain to give mr frank and myself a passagesay to spain there we will wait till there is a chance of learning who killed starth jarman looked attentively at the negro you do not know who is the guilty person he asked meaningly no tamaroo looked surprised why should i well said eustace quietly i went to sand lane to examine tilly the servant she said that the righthand window of the house was open i remember that i told you so said frank yes and on your report i questioned tilly she admitted that she told a lie at the inquest the window was open when she left the house on her returnhere eustace looked again at tamarooit was locked which proves that the assassin entered by the window and after committing the murder locked it so that no one should get into the house and discover the crime then he left by the door why do you look at tamaroo when you say that asked frank because tilly found a scrap of tartan ribbon on the kitchen floor similar to that worn by balkis i brought it with me and balkis acknowledged that it was a piece she gave to tamaroo when he decided to see starth frank wheeled round and looked anxiously at the negro did you see starth he demanded i thought you did not arrive in london till after the murder and for that reason you could not find me tamaroo considered for a few minutes i did say that he admitted because i thought it wise for the moment to conceal that i had been in starths house i thought you might mistrust me i should never do that replied lancaster patting the old man on the back but why did you visit starth i should like to know that also said eustace who was not so easily convinced of the negros innocence the man gave him a reproachful glance i acted for the best mr jarman you can trust me i think i can answered eustace cautiously and yetwhy did you visit starth to explain that i must remind you of the murder of anchor in san francisco it was sakers who shot him i was glad of it eustace looked as surprised as frank i thought anchor was the executor of my father said the latter he was and he intended to betray his trust he was so madly in love with his wife that he could not give her up she threatened to leave him and go with her uncle if he did not let her share in the money of mr lancaster anchor had the paperssome of them but i had others which he wanted so that he could dispose of the money he intended to join his wife in chicago and with sakers to arrange for the robbery i do not know how he intended to manage it but i do know added tamaroo emphatically that it was his intention to return to his house where i was waiting for him to get the papers from me and to leave me dead behind him eustace could scarcely believe this if you heard how the man spoke to me i know it was to throw dust in your eyes you would report that anchor was at enmity with sakers and mrs anchor and thus no one would suspect him of the robbery when he spoke to you mr jarman he had the papers on him sakersor rather berryknew this he intended to kill anchor and to rob the body of the papers however he chose the wrong moment as you were talking to the man you chased sakers and he could not search the body i did so ah you were on the spot you said something about it i learntin a way that it is not necessary to explainthat the man intended to betray his trust mrs anchor gave the information was she at the house yes and i was waiting there for the return of anchor i left the house and went to your rooms mr jarman where mrs anchor said her husband had gone i saw the shot fired and saw also that sakers fled pursued by you when the street was quiet i came to see the body and got the papers from the breastpocket but what about the chinaman lo keong who stabbed him it was not a chinaman said tamaroo quietly i stabbed him you jarman was beginning to see the connection between the san francisco crime and the sand lane murder yes i said tamaroo perfectly calm and collected while frank shivered anchor was a traitor he was betraying a sacred trust when i took the papers he opened his eyes i saw that he was still alive so i stabbed him jarman jumped up and even frank recoiled from the negro you had no right to kill the man said eustace hoarsely i did not the shot was a fatal one i simply stabbed him to make sure you need not rebuke me mr jarman i did it then and i would do it again did you do it again asked frank remembering the death of starth you are thinking of sand lane yes sir it was i who stabbed starth eustace shuddered was he alive no he was quite dead but i stabbed him in order to frighten mr berry when he saw that the man had died from wounds similar to those anchor had died from i fancied he would be afraid and abandon his scheme to get the money did berry know that you stabbed anchor no nor does he know that i stabbed starth but seeing that there was a shot wound and a knife wound in the two cases he must have gathered that someone else was mixed up in the matter such a knowledge would make him careful it didnt however said frank the young man did not like the way in which tamaroo had behaved for although he had not murdered either anchor or starth still he had mutilated them but then in spite of his veneer of education tamaroo was a negro pure and simple with the savage instincts of the african race to rebuke him would be as futile as punishing a dog for barking tamaroo had only obeyed his nature and eustace on his side shrewdly suspected that balkisalso an africanwould act in the like barbaric fashion did she think it necessary the race instinct held good in spite of the fact that both these black people were educated tell me exactly what occurred in the house said eustace and also explain why you went to see starth when i came to england i stopped here for a time said tamaroo as i knew balkis in san francisco and knew that she would not betray me to berry why not considering that is a secret of obi said the old man with a savage look i was here in these rooms which are not generally known to the outside world starth and berry came here and i knew them but when they were here i always kept out of their way from listening i became aware that there was a plot against you mr frank to have you hanged starth and berry were the movers also miss berry starth was to receive his share on condition that he inveigled you to his house and there you were to be saddled with the guilt of murder but starth did not expect to be killed himself oh no but berry intended that he should be the victim that was why miss berry made trouble and created rows between starth and you mr frank berry at the theatre on the previous night brought about that quarrel so that you might be accused then the next day starth wrote the letter asking you to visit him how starth fancied that the crime was to be brought about i dont know he drugged you and then waited for the arrival of berry to carry on the rest of the plot how did you come to know all this i gathered it at various times and thought out the rest said tamaroo nodding of course some of it is my own fancy theory grunted eustace admitting however that the negro had pieced things together very cleverly well you went to sand lane yes as i thought that this trouble was coming i pretended to balkis that i wished to see starth and she gave me the tartan ribbon she wore as a sign that i could be trusted in what way asked frank tamaroo shook his head i cant tell you that there was something in starths life which balkis knew and which gave her a hold over him he was always afraid of people of my colour unless i had taken the tartan ribbon he would not have spoken did he speak i never saw him replied the negro simply i did not get to the house till nearly seven the window was open and as i saw no one about and could get no answer when i rang i climbed in i then locked the window so that no one should enter in that way to interrupt between starth and myself there was no chance of that i dont know mr jarman i had entered that way and seeing what a plot was in progress others might have come in i then went down the stairs to see the servant as balkis had mentioned her balkis knew tilly murmured eustace and then there was no one there i went up the stairs and found starth dead he lay in the middle of the room and you mr frank were unconscious on the sofadrugged as i saw why did you not give the alarm asked lancaster angrily i could not sir i was a stranger and a man of colour also i had entered by the window had i given the alarm i should have been arrested and perhaps hanged you can see my difficulty yes admitted frank i see it was an awkward position i thought it best to go away and say nothing i knew that starth had been shot so as to inculpate you and that you would be arrested had that happened i should have come forward as you escaped i waited hoping to trap berry in the dark i wished to find you and to tell you what i knew that was why i posted the scarlet bat over london i knew that it was tattooed on your arm and that if you became aware of the posters you would out of curiosity inquire for the sealed letter thats exactly what happened said eustace but you say that starth was waiting for berry after he drugged frank perhaps berry came and shot starth with franks pistol and then departed no said tamaroo decisively i cant think that berry wanted to enjoy the money and wouldnt have risked the murder then i cant say who shot the man if not berry said jarman however on what you say well try and bluff berry and before you berry said jarman however on what you say well try and bluff berry and before you left you stabbed the body yes i did rejoined tamaroo defiantly the man was dead and i thought to frighten berry there was much at stake i then left the house but i dont think anyone saw me going as it was growing dark that is all i know what else is to be found out must be discovered by you mr jarman ill do my best said eustace but who am i to follow providence answered that question there was the sound of the door opening balkis entered and after her came captain berry his niece and darrel the rhodesian fulfilling his threat had hunted frank down and was face to face with his prey chapter xxv nemesis fairy fan cast a scornful glance round the room it did not deserve such disdain as it was magnificently furnished although the display of colour was rather barbaric the walls were lined with tall narrow mirrors framed in gold and with painted panels let in between the hangings were of crimson plush embroidered with gold and the blue carpet was profusely sprinkled with yellow flowers there were red velvet divans against the walls many gilt chairs with spindlelegs and numerous cardtables with greencloth tops at the further end of the room a doorlikewise sheathed in ironled into an inner and smaller apartment similarly furnished and everywhere glittered electric lights in opaque globes apparently balkis had spared no cost to make her subterranean gamblingrooms as gorgeous as possible when she saw miss berry sneer at thein her opinionmatchless magnificence of the place her black eyes sparkled with fury but the men had more important things to think about than the furnishing of the room with which they were well acquainted berry surveyed frank with glee and rubbed his hands he looked harder and more evil than ever and openly gloated over his victim i guess youre fixed this trip young man said he cheerfully frank turned a disdainful back on the little scoundrel and addressed himself to darrel who glared at him with sulky triumph you betrayed me i suppose he said with contempt i knew that tamaroo would bring you here replied darrel coolly and i have brought berry to have you arrested that is out of the question put in jarman decidedly why so demanded berry with a snarl because i know too much about you and your niece here if this case comes into court ill have captain banjo berry alias sakers arrested for the murder of anchor in san francisco i did not murder him i can testify to that said fan who was listening eagerly he was with me in chicago at the time you were not in chicago cried tamaroo you came back to your own house and told me that your husband had gone to see mr jarman i followed him and i saw captain berry kill anchor the little skipper clenched his hands its a lie wholl believe the words of a black man i am not black said eustace coolly and i can swear that you fired the shot your niece made out that her husband was killed by an old miner whom he had cheated that is untrue you shot him as you hoped to get the papers dealing with the scarlet bat treasure from him he intended to give them in any case said mrs anchor i know that said tamaroo and he asked me to come to the house so that he might get the rest of the documents from me but i guessed his trick and i followed him i took the papers from his body and i knifed him you cried fan and berry together yes he was a traitor and he died you killed him berry but i put the finishing stroke and i also stabbed starth ah cried berry in triumph you murdered him frank darted forward and placed himself before the little man if that is so he said i must be innocent you are not snarled berry you shot starth and this black nigger finished him off starth was dead when i put the knife into his heart said tamaroo you were afraid when you found that he was killed as anchor had been killed in san francisco you gave me a bad quarter of an hour i admit said berry but i guess lancaster will swing and youll get gaol tamaroo nothing of the sort said jarman coolly you cant do what you like berry ill see to that see to yourself said berry wrathfully see to your own life if i give the word neither you nor lancaster will leave this place alive i can depend upon balkis yes said balkis you can depend upon me her eyes were fixed on fairy fan with a vindictive expression and her words bore a different meaning to what berry gave them he quite believed that balkis was on his side and went on in triumph there are men in the pay of balkis who would knife you as soon as i chose take care jarman i am not to be trifled with i mean to get that money forty thousand ayear put tamaroo and fans eyes sparkled so much as that she said clasping her hands yes said frank i dont suppose ill spend half of it you cried the captain with a howl of derision you wont spend it you hang and the money goes to denham supposing it does said eustace suddenlysuppose your clever plot comes to a successful conclusion how are you going to get the money from denham hell do anything i wish him to do oh no he wont you disgusted him by asking that he should play the spy on lancaster he came down to me and in conjunction with tamaroo i have opened his eyes to your rascality denham is on the side of lancaster and your plot to coerce him has failed fan laughed derisively i can twist him round my finger oh no he is in love with miss arrow the daughter of the rector of wargrove he will have nothing further to do with you mrs anchor berrys face was changing colour he recognised that he had made a mistake in letting natty get beyond his influence and did not know what to do for the moment if he had lancaster hanged natty would get the moneythat was always intendedbut now natty was on the side of the enemy he and fan would never enjoy the forty thousand ayear perhaps it would be better to make some bargain with lancaster darrel guessed that the little skipper thought of hedging and hastily interposed lets get this over he said here is lancaster whom we know is guilty of murder balkis had better conduct us to the upper part of the house since she does not wish the police to come here then lancaster can be arrested if the police came here said balkis before anyone could speak not one of them would leave again these rooms are known to none but those who have gambled here and when i go to america next week no trace of them will remain how do you intend to destroy them asked berry derisively the black woman looked at fan with an evil eye and smiled slowly you may learn that before we part she said frank was growing weary of all this hesitation and of these vague threats he resolved upon a bold stroke in order to bring berry to his knees im sick of this holeandcorner business he cried let us do what darrel suggests i shall submit to arrest frank said jarman hurriedly and tamaroo also protested i intend to give myself up said lancaster determinedly had i not been a moral coward i should have done so in the first instance i am perfectly innocent of this crime and i shall stand my trial but this proposition as frank anticipated was not at all to the taste of berry he was about to object when his niece stopped him with an engaging smile she came forward and took franks hand listen to me my dear she said sweetly you were always my favourite and i have loved you always promise to marry me and you shall go free to enjoy the money along with you i suppose along with me she answered still smiling it is not hard no but its impossible i guess said berry grimly i aint going to let you and fan skip with the dollars after all my trouble and im not going to let lancaster escape chimed in darrel i want to see him hanged he shall never be hanged said tamaroo much agitated eustace who had his eye on the savage face of balkis suddenly addressed miss berry you say you love lancaster i do i have always loved him that is untrue you only want to marry him because you cant get the money in any other way there is a chance i see of you three thieves falling out he looked scornfully on berry fan and darrel in that case an honest man such as lancaster is may come by his own you talk nonsense said fan doggedly i love frank pardon me you loved starth fan objected loudly while the eyes of balkis flashed i never did eustace i hated him you loved starth repeated jarman mercilessly i have it in your own handwriting without a word balkis darted forward and held out the letter the other woman laughed that is a trick of mr jarmans she said it is not a trick hissed the negress look you i loved walter with all my heart and soul he would have married me yes you may laughshe glared like a brave lioness on berry and darrelbut he would have married me i loved him and this white woman stole his love fairy fan changed colour at the sight of this rage on the part of balkis and even the captain looked uneasy he was well aware that balkis had it in her power to make things unpleasant for him and was quite willing to save his own skin by deserting his niece fan still kept her courage and denied the letter i wrote that with a purpose it is not true i swear it though you swore a hundred oaths i should not believe you said balkis stamping you loved my walter you took him from me i will punish you i willi will she shook her fist in a paroxysm of rage and dashed into the inner room fan stared at eustace this is your work she said looking pale jarman nodded i got the letter for this purpose you will not pacify that savage jealousy easily miss berry slipped her arm within that of her uncle i am quite safe she said coolly no harm can come to me wait a moment said berry removing his arm you left me in the lurch fan when you married anchor im going to make my own bed this time and lie on it what do you mean she asked quickly this said the little scoundrel coolly nattys given us the goby so there aint much chance of getting the money through him theres less chance of getting it through me said frank quickly if thats your meaning berry i intend to give myself up dont be a fool said darrel quickly and looking uneasy ive been a fool long enough ill give myself up eustace nodded thats the best thing to do he declared for he had been observant of the berry face stand your trial frank i have got evidence that will stand you in good stead but see here cried berry looking more and more dismayed if you can be proved innocent ah you admit that i am innocent said frank quickly to all here but it depends upon yourself if i prove it in open court what will you give me wait a moment frank interposed jarman preventing the young man from replying do you mean to say berry that you can prove the innocence of lancaster no he cant said darrel its impossible not if i get five thousand ayear for life said berry coolly then i must have half of it put in fairy fan at this moment balkis called them into the inner room in an imperious voice at first they were unwilling to go then they decided to obey seeing that the negress might prove dangerous she was seated at the head of a table under a kind of canopy you say that lancaster is innocent she asked berry i do he replied if i get five thousand ayear and a mighty small sum that is considering the cards i hold but what about me said fan looking disagreeable oh you shall be rewarded said balkis blandly i dont believe you loved walter after all no i love frank here but since he will not marry me let him give me the same sum as he gives my uncle that means i have to pay ten thousand ayear said frank out of forty thousand its cheap at the price i refuse to allow this said darrel loudly balkis you are my relation stand by me ah you remember i am of your blood when you want me said the negress bitterly well i shall do what you wish then i wish this said darrel strong in this support do not let any of these people leave this place alive till i get what i want lancaster must be hanged i must marry mildred starth and i must have twenty thousand ayear given to me very modest you are murmured jarman while tamaroo glancing at balkis smiled slightly what about us asked berry and fan i will see that you have money also said darrel i am master of the situation now and you intend to hang me cried frank his blood up then not one of you will get a penny denham shall have the money if i die or the charity put in eustace frank has only to commit suicide which is better than being hanged and the money goes to the charity i think youd better make terms berry i intend to leave me alone darrel lancaster will you give me and fan ten thousand ayear between us if i prove your innocence yes i will do that ill make an agreement if you like oh i can trust you you can do nothing till you have the proof i have the confession of the person who killed starth it is locked up in my strongbox at my rooms the key is on my watchchain when we leave here you will come to my lawyers and we can arrange with tamaroo here about getting a document drawn up when all is tight and right you will get the paper that proves your innocence and whose guilt asked frank i can tell you said eustace quickly i have suspected the man for some time darrel you shot starth i did not said the big man hoarsely yes you did said berry relentlessly i can chuck you now since i am right myself i found you in the room with the dead body i let myself in with my latchkey i could have denounced you but having my own game to play i let you off on your signing a confession you did so in the room at sand lane its a lieits a lie said darrel turning grey it is true i believe said eustace quickly tamaroo says that berry was coming to the house i was said berry you may as well know all i wanted lancaster hanged to let natty have the money we know all that said frank go on tell us something new i will tell you began the captain when darrel dashing forward caught him by the throat the two rolled over on the floor while fan shrieked and jumped on a divan to be out of the way balkis rose to her feet and waved the other three men out of the room go go jarman and frank however did not move but tamaroo who seemed to understand balkis caught their hands and dragged them out the negress came after them rapidly and slammed the door to as she did so there was a shriek from miss berry tamaroo still dragged the men towards the outer door come up come up he cried there is dangerdanger eustace was brave enough but he felt a qualm at this mysterious danger of which he knew nothing come frank let us get the police quick and he darted along the passage and up through the trapdoor tamaroo followed and lancaster and still they could hear the men fighting within and the shrieks of fairy fan balkis at the door of the inner room taunted the three you white woman loved my walter and took his love you shall die you my cousin killed my walter you shall die you captain berry brought about the death of my walter you shall die from within rose a wail and then came the curses of darrel and berry who felt that they had been trapped balkis heard them beating at the door and laughing loudly mocked them then she pulled a lever which was hidden behind the hangings there was a roar a long wail and then came sobbing with a delighted smile the negress listened then she glided from the apartment when the police arrived they found the respectable house empty the negress had vanished the trapdoor was open and down here jarman led them hoping to save the wretched three but it was too late as the police and frank and eustace darted towards the inner door to open it tamaroo rushed between and spread out his hands it is too late he said pointing to the lever she has let in the water the river fills that room and those three are drowned it was so terrible to think of this doom befalling the wicked trio that frank sat down and fairly sobbed nemesis said jarman chapter xxvi a wedding present in the summerhouse where frank lancaster when an outlaw had sought refuge sat mildred and eustace frank had stood his trial but the proceedings were merely formal as the confession of darrel which captain berry had obtained proved his innocence beyond doubt the girl should have looked much more delighted than she did now that the man she loved was cleared of suspicion but she seemed nervous and apprehensive and her face was pale eustace had come down from london to tell her that frank was free and to intimate that he would be down in the afternoon after an interview with white saon relative to the will are you not pleased mildred asked eustace looking at her gravely very pleased she replied with an effort it is the best of news to think that frank is free and will be recompensed for all he has undergone he has youth health strength and forty thousand ayear said jarman looking away so he ought to be happy i hope soi hope so said mildred casting down her eyes and it is owing to you that he has been cleared of this terrible charge i am glad to have been the agent i always believed in his innocence but circumstances had more to do with the affair than i i simply took advantage of my luck mildred shook her head you have had more to do with the matter than you will admit eustace but tell me exactly what has taken place you have been too busy to explain clearly there was so much to do in connection with the trial said jarman and i think you know the greater part of the facts never mind i wish to hear them again eustace nodded gravely and began without preamble as you know berry and his niece came to england knowing the will of the late mr lancaster which they procured through anchor he intended to play traitor and in some way arranged to get the money by ridding himself of tamaroo but berry wanted anchor out of the way so that he might get the papers and fortune to himself he shot anchor as i told you then i chased him and it was tamaroo who got the papers and who stabbed the man said mildred shudderingyou told me that was a savage thing to do admitted eustace but in spite of his education tamaroo is a savage at heart and in any case anchor could not have lived after berrys shot well when nattys father died berry contrived to be appointed his guardian he exercised a great influence over him and it was his intention to give natty the fortune by having frank hanged and was natty to marry miss berry mrs anchor you mean i dont know perhaps but i dont think she cared for the lad he when in possession of his fortune would no doubt have been induced to sign a will in favour of fan and her uncle and then he would have been got rid of it was with some such plan that the two came to england they made the acquaintance of frank by fan writing and asking him to compose her some songs was it a trap asked mildred a decided trap i dont know how they intended at first to bring about his being accused of a crime but chance threw starth in berrys way and then they saw what to do your brother hated lancaster and was always quarrelling with him it was not franks fault berry made as much trouble as he could and fan by flirting with your brother and then with frank made matters worse the affair culminated in the quarrel in the piccadilly theatre in which frank used rash words then the next day walter wrote asking frank to call mildred clasped her hands and looked up nervously was that a trap also do you think yes said eustace decidedly your brother was in the scheme to get the money he knew that lancaster would have to be hanged so that it might come into denhams possession and then into berrys i expect they promised him a share but did they intend to give it to him no they did not your brother was their dupe berry arranged that starth should get frank down to his place and drug him then when he was insensible a crime was to be committed and frank was to bear the blame horrible horrible said mildred hiding her face and to think walter should behave so but who was to be killed your brother said eustace walter did not know who the victim was to be and after drugging frank waited for berry the rest of the scheme was to be carried on as i believe by berry killing your brother and then by frank being accused but walter never thought that he would be the victim walter really drugged frank certainly he put opium in his tea when frank was insensible he searched him for the letter asking him to call as he wanted that evidence out of the way but for what reason why to make it clear that frank had called on him voluntarily had the letter been shown it might have pointed to the trap well in searching for the letterwhich was thrown on the floor and found by tillywalter discovered franks revolver which he placed on the table it was the merest chance that frank carried it and of course it was a card quite in the hands of the plotters walter waited for berry but berry was late now i will tell you of darrels confession where was it found in berrys strongbox the police took the key from his dead body and searched his lodgings they found the confession which exonerated frank entirely tell me the exact words i cant give them very exact but the meaning was something like this darrel loved you and wanted to marry you walter at first approved of the match but afterwards he intended to marry you to natty and so brought him down i should never have married him said mildred in a low voice walter no doubt thought he could force you but darrel got wind of this through balkis who was his cousin he came to remonstrate with walter darrel was half a savage also with his african blood and your brother and he came to high words then darrel confessed that walter insulted him so that he snatched up franks revolver from the table and shot walter through the head he says in his confession that he didnt intend to kill him do you think that is true asked mildred i cant say darrel was a most violent man and his love for you amounted to a frenzy however he shot walter but before he could get out of the house berry entered how could he enter if the door was closed he had a latchkey which he had procured from walter i daresay he intended to kill waltereither shoot him or stab himand then go away leaving frank to bear the blame he went to franks chambers to prove an alibi but when he found darrel in the room he saw that the deed was done to make himself safe he made darrel sign a confession and kept it in his strongbox then the two agreed that frank should bear the blame now you can see mildred why darrel was unwilling to denounce frank when he recognised him here he feared to be implicated in the case but his rage got the better of him and he took berry and fan to the secret rooms of balkis what has become of balkis she has disappeared no one knows where i expect she had made all arrangements and has departed for the states its just as well as she is wanted for the murder of those three why did she murder them i thought she was friendly with them she was in a way but she was madly in love with your brother and was under the impression that he would marry her he might have done so for balkis is rich however if he got lancasters money he intended to marry fairy fan when by means of that letter i proved that fan had been making love to starth balkis was furious then when she found that darrel had killed her lover she determined on his death had frank killed walter would balkis have i am sure she would interrupted eustace quickly she was a most furious woman and would have stuck at nothing and she didnt she resolved also on the death of berry because he had caused all the trouble and had really brought about the death of your brother by his machinations so she closed them in the room and let the river in the three poor wretches were drowned like rats in a trap before i could get back with the police mildred shuddered with horror had she designed all this no to do her justice i dont think she did the trap was arranged for the police should they have made a raid on the gamblingrooms it seems that the inner room was only divided from the river by a thick wall there was a tunnel through this closed at the lower end by an iron slide which was worked by a lever from the outer room balkis shut the three in and darrel was fighting with the captain then when she got rid of usi went to fetch the police remember as i suspected foul playshe must have worked the lever and admitted the water great heavens said eustace covering his face i can imagine the feelings of those poor wretches when they saw the water pouring into the room bad as they were their punishment has been terrible were they all three dead yes the police shut the slide again by means of the lever and the water was drained the bodies were found and by this time they have been buried balkis disappeared yes she must have made preparations for flight in any case she intended to leave for america a week after the crime was committed her money was all invested abroad and she no doubt got on board some boat that sailed immediately for spain or the continent she had many friends amongst the sailors who patronised her opium shop and gamblingrooms and had no difficulty in getting away then frank was arrested i wrote to you he gave himself up by my advice i related everything to inspector herny he searched for the key of the strongbox and found it on berrys watchchain then we found the box in the bloomsbury lodgings and obtained the confession frank made his statement in court and then the confession was read he has been discharged without a stain on his character and now he is with tamaroo seeing white saon about the will i dont like tamaroo after his stabbing my brother and that poor anchor said mildred looking pale eustace shrugged his shoulders tamaroo is half a savage but you will not see much of him frank has arranged to pay him an income and he is going back to america next

forget me mildred sank into a chair as eustace hurried away at the gate he looked back and waved his hand but she never looked up with a sigh jarman went to his own house there he packed a few things and departed leaving old bowles in charge of the shanty mildred buried her face in her hands and wept she loved frank never till this moment did she realise how much she loved him and she knew that he loved her as devotedly but she must keep her promise to eustace he had borne the heat and burden of the day he had worked nobly and she could not break his heart by refusing to give him his reward but she knew not how she would be able to bear being his wife when she so dearly loved frank i should have spoken out she moaned i should have told the truth he would not have insisted on my fulfilling a rash promise yethe is so good so noble no i must keep my word frank himself would insist on that and frank i shall see him again to say farewell oh frankfrankmy darling and she wept afresh from these sad thoughts she was aroused by the coming of mrs perth full of news my dear said the old lady i have just come from the rectory would you believe it mr denham is to marry jenny arrow its all settled they marry in a month and go to the states i am very glad said mildred drying her eyes well i am toobut such indecent haste however its none of our business my dearthe old lady sat down and patted

of it and mildred ran into the house mrs perth shook her head sadly and slowly followed she thought mildred was wrong it will not be a happy marriage said mrs perth that afternoon frank arrived at the shanty he looked sad and not at all like a man whose character had been cleared and who had come into a fortune of forty thousand ayear he was alone as he intended only to stop the night and to return the next day to london on his way to kingsbridge only at jarmans urgent request had he come down to see mildred as he felt that he could not trust himself in her presence at first he thought he would send the letter with which he had been entrusted by eustace then he decided not to be a coward but to deliver it himself he therefore braced his nerves for a final interview and walked over to rose cottage mildred was in the drawingroom and saw him at once the lovers looked at one another and each strove to be calm there was no need of explanation as they understood without a word frank gave mildred the letter she laid it aside will you not read it asked frank after you are gone said mildred in as steady a tone as she could command no you must read it now eustace wants a reply he told me why is he so cruel muttered mildred opening the letter languidly frank watched her as she read and sighed to think that she would be the wife of another however he wished to be true to the friend who had done so much for him and in his heart resolved to give jarman half his money when the wedding took place mildred flushed as she read the letter and her eyes sparkled on finishing she handed it to frank without a word striving to repress her agitation rather astonished at this emotion frank read it also then he too flushed and well he might the letter was from eustace and stated that he saw how mildred and frank loved one another he wished them both to be happy and released mildred from her promise marry frank my dear he wrote for i see i was wrong to ask for such a promise i am old and you are young marry frank i send him to you as a wedding present and i am sure you will not want a better bless you both i am going to america for a time but when i return perhaps there will be a corner near the fire for your sincere friend eustace the letter read frank and mildred looked at one another they could find no words to speak of this wonderful selfsacrifice on the part of eustace mildred burst out crying but the next moment she was in the arms of frank and he kissed away her tears he gave me liberty he gave me life he gave me fortune and now said frank softly he gives me you god bless him sobbed mildred amen to that echoed frank and they kissed again the end edinburgh colston and company limited printers
