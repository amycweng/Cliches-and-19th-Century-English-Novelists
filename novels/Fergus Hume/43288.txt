table he cast a look around according to custom to see that all was as orderly as he could wish the neatest and most methodical of men he was positively old maidish in his love of regularity and tidiness his valet dormerwith him for over fifteen yearshad been trained by such long service into the particular ways of his master and was almost as exacting as tait himself in the matter of domestic details no woman was permitted to penetrate into those chambers in earls street st james but had one been able to do so she could have found no fault with them either on the score of taste or of cleanliness the shell of this hermit crab was eloquent of the idiosyncrasies of its tenant the main characteristic of the breakfast room was one of severe simplicity the carpet of green drappled brown the curtains to match and the furniture of oak polished and dark on the white cloth of the table an appetizing breakfast was set out in silver and china and a vase of flowers showed that the little gentleman was not unmindful of the requirements of an artistic temperament even the times carefully cut and warmed was neatly folded by the silver ringed napkin and dormer standing stiff and lean by his masters chair was calmly satisfied that no fault could be found with his work for the past fifteen years save on occasions of foreign travel the same etiquette had been observed the same actions performed for like the laws of the medes and persians the habits of tait were fixed and determined he was a pleasant creature of thirtyfour years small in stature cleanshaven and brownlocked his plump little body was clothed in a wellbrushed smoking suit of marooncolored cloth his neat feet encased in slippers of red morocco and he scanned the room through a goldmounted pince nez neat and firm as he was women did not care for him in the least and he returned the compliment by heartily disliking the female sex yet with men he was a great favorite and the members of his club liked to hear the sententious speeches of this little man delivered with point and deliberation in the smoking room from eleven till midnight when the clock struck twelve he invariably went to bed and no persuasion or temptation could induce him to break this excellent rule dormer a tall thin man of kent who adored his precise master was equally as misogynistic as tait and silent on all occasions save when spoken to then he replied in dry monosyllables and stood bolt upright during such replies in a military fashion which he had picked up many years before in the army tait humored his oddities on account of his fidelity knowing that this ugly roughhewn specimen of humanity was as true as steel and entirely devoted to his interests nowadays it is unusual to meet with such equal appreciation between master and servant i think dormer said tait while the man ministered to his wants that you might call at mudies this morning and get me a copy of the new novel a whim of fate by john parver i heard last night that it contained a description of thorston very good sir replied dormer noting the name in his pocketbook and take a seat for me at the curtain theater in the fifth row of the stalls not too near the side anything else sir i think not said his master taking a morsel of toast i am going down to richmond by the twelve oclock train to luncheon with mr freak lay out the serge suit dormer saluted in a military fashion and disappeared leaving tait to skim the paper and finish his breakfast methodical as ever the little man first read the leading articles thence passed to the city news perused the general information and wound up with a glance at the advertisements in such order he ever proceeded and never by any chance thought of beginning with the advertisements and working back to the leading article habit was everything with spenser tait as usual his days programme was carefully sketched out and he knew what he was about to do with every moment of his time from noon till midnight but his plans on this special day were upset at the outset for scarcely had he lighted his morning pipe than the door was thrown open and a visitor was announced mr larcher said dormer stiffly and ushered in a tall young man with a bright face and a breezy manner hullo little tait cried the newcomer hastily striding across the room here i am again come from wandering up and down the earth sir like a certain person whom i need not mention dear me said tait welcoming his guest with prim kindliness it is claude larcher i am very glad to see you my dear fellow and rather surprised for i assure you i thought you were at the antipodes i have just returned from that quarter of the globe yes landed at the docks yesterday from one of the shawsaville line had a capital passage from new zealand sea like a millpond from wellington heads to the lizard have you had breakfast larcher asked tait touching the bell a trifle a trifle i could eat another what have you bacon and eggs watercress coffee and the best of bread and butter egad spenser you had the same victuals two years ago when i last called here i am a creature of habit claude replied tait sententiously and when dormer made his appearance gave grave directions for fresh coffee and another dish of eggs and bacon larcher drew in his chair and with his elbows on the table eyed the little man with friendly eyes they were old schoolfellows and fast friends though a greater contrast than that which existed between them can scarcely be imagined tait a prim chilly misogynist larcher a hotblooded impetuous lover of women the one a stayathome and a slave to habit the other a roaming engineer careless and impulsive yet by some vein of sympathy the pair so unlike in looks and temperament were exceedingly friendly and always glad to meet when circumstance threw them together such friendship based on no logical grounds was a standing contradiction to the rule that like draws to like it was scarcely to be expected that a wellfavored mortal like larcher should share his friends distaste for the female sex far from disliking them he sought them on all possible occasions oftentimes to his own disadvantage and was generally involved in some scrape connected with a petticoat tait who was the older of the two by five years vainly exhorted and warned his friend against such follies but as yet his arguments had come to naught at the age of thirty larcher was still as inflammable and answered all taits expostulations with a laugh of scorn it was easy to dower this hero with all the perfections physical or mental which lie within the scope of imagination but the truth must be told at whatever cost claude was no greek god no prodigy of learning neither an apollo for looks nor an admirable crichton for knowledge he was simply a welllooking young man cleanlimbed clearskinned healthy athletic and dauntless such as can be found by the dozen in england thews and sinews he had but was no samson or hercules yet his strong frame and easy grace won the heart of many a woman while with his own sex he passed for a true comrade and a friend worth having he was an engineer and built bridges and railways in divers quarters of the globe pioneering civilization as it were in the most barbarous regions for the past ten years he had roamed all over the world and his adventures begotten by a daring and reckless spirit were already sufficient to fill a volume master of at least half a dozen tongues he could find his way from the tropics to the pole and was equally at home on the prairie as in piccadilly indeed he preferred the former for civilization was little to his taste and he was infinitely more at ease in pekin than london north and south america africa china india he knew them all and on this occasion had returned from a prolonged sojourn in the antipodes where he had been building bridges across rapid new zealand rivers well my friend said he addressing himself to a second meal with a hearty appetite i need not ask how you are the same prim finnicking little mortal as ever i see five years have made no difference in you spenser youve not married i suppose not i returned tait with stormy disgust you know my views on the subject of matrimony you might go away for one hundred years and would return to find me still a bachelor but you claude oh im still in the market i wasnt rich enough for the new zealand belles eh you have five hundred a year independent of your earnings as an engineer what is the use of setting up house on a thousand a year all told retorted claude coolly but the fact is despite my inflammability which you are pleased to reproach i have not yet seen the woman i care to make mrs larcher perhaps it is just as well for the woman answered tait dryly i dont think you are cut out for a domestic life i have had no experience of it so i cant say said larcher a shade passing over his face you must not forget that i was left an orphan at five years of age tait if it had not been for old hilliston the lawyer who looked after me and my small fortune i dont know what would have become of me all things considering i think i have turned out fairly decent i have worked hard at my profession i have not spent my substance in riotous living and have seen much more of life than most young men all of which is selfpraise and that we know being no recommendation give me another cup of coffee tait laughed and obeyed what are you going to do now he demanded after a pause stay in town or make another dash for the wilds ill be here for a few months till something turns up said larcher carelessly i did very well out of that maori land business and bought some land there with the proceeds i suppose ill go and look up mr hilliston see all the theaters worry you and hunt for a wife i shant assist you in the last retorted tait testily however as you are here you must stay with me for the day what are your immediate plans oh i wish to call at the club and see if there are any letters then i am at your disposal unless you have a prior engagement i have a luncheon at richmond but ill put that off it is not very important and a wire will arrange matters finish your breakfast while i dress go you effete dandy of an exhausted civilization i saw you looking at my rigout and i dare say it is very bad it has been packed away for the last five years however you can take me to your tailor and ill get a fresh outfit you wont walk down bond street with me unless i assume a tall hat patent leathers and a frock coat oh by the way would you like to go to the curtain theater tonight asked tait vouchsafing no reply to this speech they are playing a good piece and i sent for a seat for myself you selfish little man just send for two while youre about it with pleasure replied tait who permitted larcher more freedom of speech than he did any other of his friends i wont be more than ten minutes dressing very good ill smoke a pipe during your absence and see with what further fribbles you have adorned your rooms then well go to the club and afterward to the tailors i dont suppose my letters will detain me long in this larcher was wrong for his letters detained him longer than he expected this opened the way to a new course of life of which at that moment he knew nothing laughing and jesting in his friends rooms heartwhole and untrammeled he little knew what fortune had in store for him on that fateful morning it is just as well that the future is hidden from men else they would hardly go forward with so light a step to face juries hitherto larchers life had been all sunshine but now darknesses were rising above the horizon and these letters to which he so lightly alluded were the first warnings of the coming storm chapter ii a mysterious communication the athenian club was the most uptodate thing of its kind in london although it had been established over eight years it was as new as on the day of its creation and not only kept abreast of the times but in many instances went ahead of them the athenians of old time were always crying out for something new and their prototypes of london following in their footsteps formed a body of men who were ever on the lookout for novelty hence the name of this club which adopted for its motto the classic cry give us something new and acted well up to the saying the athenian club was the pioneer of everything it would take a long time to recount the vagaries for which this coterie had been responsible if one more daring spirit than the rest invented a new thing or reinstated on old one his fellows followed like a flock of intelligent sheep and wore the subject threadbare till some more startling theory initiated a new movement the opinion of the club took its color from the prevailing fad of the hour and indeed many of the aforesaid fads were invented in its smoke room it should have been called the ephemeral club from the rapidity with which its fanciers rose to popularity and vanished into obscurity after all such incessant novelty is rather fatiguing london is the most exhausting city in the world in which to live from all quarters of the globe news is pouring in every street is crowded with life and movement the latest ideas of civilization here ripen to completion it is impossible to escape from the contagion of novelty it is in the air information salutes one at every turn it pours from the mouths of men it thrusts itself before the eye in countless daily and weekly newspapers it clicks from every telegraph wire until the brain is wearied with the flood of ephemeral knowledge all this plethora of intellectual life was concentrated in the narrow confines of the athenian club house no wonder its members complained of news what is the prevailing passion with the athenian at present asked larcher as he stepped briskly along piccadilly beside tait the new literature what is that upon my word i can hardly tell you replied tait after some cogitation it is a kind of impressionist school i fancy those who profess to lead it insist upon works having no plot and no action or no dramatic situations their idea of a work is for a man and womanboth vaguely denominated he and sheto talk to one another through a few hundred pages good lord how they do talk and all about their own feelings their own woes their own troubles their own infernal egotisms the motto of the new literature should be talk talk talk for it consists of nothing else why not adopt hamlets recitation suggested larcher laughingly words words words oh the new literature wants nothing from the past not even a quotation said tait tartly womanthe new womanis greatly to the fore in this latest fancy she writes about neurotic members of her own sex and calls men bad names every other page the subjects mostly discussed in the modern novel by the modern woman are the regeneration of the world by woman the failure of the male to bridle his appetites and the beginning of the millennium which will come when women get their own way havent they got their own way now i should think so i dont know what further freedom they want we live in a world of petticoats nowadays women pervade everything like microbes and they are such worrying creatures pursued tait plaintively they dont take things calmly like men do but talk and rage and go into hysterics every other minute if this sort of thing goes on i shall retire with dormer to an uninhabited island it is easily seen that you are not a friend to the new movement said larcher with a smile but here we are wait in the smoke room like a good fellow while i see after my correspondence you will find me in the writing room replied tait i have lost my morning pipe and do not intend to smoke any more till after luncheon i dont believe youre a man tait but a clockwork figure wound up to act in the same manner at the same moment and you are such a horribly vulgar piece of mechanism tait laughed gratified by this tribute to his methodical habits so leaving larcher to see after his letters he vanished into the writing room here he wrote an apologetic telegram to his friend freak and sent it off so that it might reach that gentleman before he started for richmond then he scribbled a few notes on various trifling matters of business which called for immediate attention and having thus disposed of his cares ensconced himself in a comfortable armchair to wait for claude in a few minutes larcher made his appearance with a puzzled expression on his face and two open letters in his hand taking a seat close to that of tait he at once began to explain that the news contained in the letters was the cause of the expression aforesaid my other letters are nothing to speak of said he when seated but these two fairly puzzle me number one is from mr hilliston asking me to call the other is from a margaret bezel with a similar request now i know mr hilliston as guardian lawyer and banker but who is margaret bezel tait shook his wise little head wellinformed as he was in several matters he had never heard of margaret bezel she lives at hampstead i see continued claude referring to the letter clarence cottage hunt lane that is somewhere in the vicinity of jack straws castle i wonder who she is and why she wants to see me you have never heard of her asked tait dubiously he was never quite satisfied with larchers connections with the weaker sex certainly not replied the other with some heat if i had i would assuredly remember so odd a name bezel bezel something to do with a ring isnt it it might have something to do with a wedding ring said tait with a grim smile the lady may have matrimonial designs on you bah she may be a washerwoman for all you know or a wife or a widow or heaven only knows what but that is not the queerest part of the affair for mr hillistonbut here read the ladys letter first the gentlemans next and tell me what you think of them upon my word i can make neither top nor tail of the business the first letter april dear sir will you be so kind as to call and see me at clarence cottage hunt lane hampstead as i have an important communication to make to you regarding your parents yours truly margaret bezel the second letter lincolns inn fields june dear claude call and see me here as soon as you arrive in town and should you receive a communication from one margaret bezel bring it with you on no account see the lady before you have an interview with me this matter is more important than you know of and will be duly explained by me when you call yours sincerely francis hilliston tait read these two letters carefully pinched his chin reflectively and looked at claude in a rather anxious manner well sir said the latter impatiently what is your opinion taits opinion was given in one word and that not of the nicest meaning blackmail blackmail repeated larcher taken aback as well he might be what do you mean i may be wrong said tait apologetically but this is the only conclusion to which i can come i read the matter this way margaret bezel knows something about your parents and wishes to reveal it to you possibly on condition that you pay her a sum of money hilliston evidently knows that such is her intention and wishes to put you on your guard hence he asks you to see him before you accept the invitation of the lady hm this is feasible enough but what possible communication can this woman be likely to make to me which would involve blackmail my parents both died when i was four years of age she cant have any evil to say of them after twentyfive years you must question hilliston as to that replied tait shrugging his shoulders i think you ought to see him this afternoon he knows you are in town i suppose i wrote from wellington to tell him that i was returning in the kailargatin said claude glancing at the letter he must have been informed by the paper of her arrival yesterday for this note is dated the same day today is the eleventh but surely hilliston knew you would call as soon as you arrived he might be certain that i would do so within the week at all events answered larcher reflectively that is what makes his letter the more puzzling the matter must be very urgent when he demands an immediate interview i am certain he wishes to forestall this lady said tait picking up the letter of margaret bezel she at all events knows nothing of your movements for the note is dated the th of april when you were in new zealand humph it is very odd tait it is extremely odd and too important to be neglected call on mr hilliston this afternoon and send him a wire now to make an appointment i hope i am not going to have a bad quarter of an hour observed claude as he wrote out the telegram the mystery of the matter ruffled his usual serenity i sincerely trust you are not replied the other touching the bell for the waiter but i must say i do not like the look of those two epistles the telegram was duly dispatched and after a few more conjectures as to the motive of the communications larcher went upstairs to luncheon with his friend halfway through the meal he was struck with an idea margaret bezel must be old tait how do you know if she knows anything of my parents she must have been their friend or servant and as they died twentyfive years ago she can be no chicken true enough but dont go out and meet your troubles halfway claude it will be time enough to worry should hilliston give you bad news by the way i suppose youll stay with him tonight no doubt he has bought a new house in kensington gore and wishes me to have a look at it i shall be glad to see his wife again dear old lady she has been a second mother to me and he like a father and i like a brother interposed tait laughing as a lonely orphan you have to depend upon public charity for your relatives but talking about new houses you must see mine what are you a householder a householder not a landed proprietor said tait with pride i have purchased an old manor house and a few acres at thorston about eight miles from eastbourne you must come down and see it i have just had it furnished and put in order a week or so there will do you good and give me much pleasure i shall be delighted to come said larcher hastily that is if there is no troublesome business to detain me in london well you will know shortly after all hilliston may give you good news instead of bad bah you dont believe that tait i dont indeed but i am trying to comfort you after the fashion of jobs friends retorted claude promptly well you may be right for i do not like the look of things myself however i must take bad fortune along with good hitherto all has gone well with me and i sincerely trust this letter from margaret bezel is not a forerunner of trouble should it be so you will always have at least one friend to stand by you thank you tait replied larcher grasping the outstretched hand should the time come for testing your friendship i shall have no hesitation in putting it to the proof and the time is coming added he tapping the pocket which held the letter of that i am certain what about our theater tonight demanded tait dubiously it all depends on my interview with hilliston tait said nothing at the moment and shortly afterward they parted larcher to seek his guardian in lincolns inn fields tait to return to his chambers humph said the latter thoughtfully there will be no theater for us tonight i dont like the look of things at all the deuce take margaret bezel chapter iii the revelation of francis hilliston once upon a time popular imagination pictured a lawyer as a cadaverous creature arrayed in rusty black with bulging bluebag and dry forensic lore on his tongue so was the child of themis represented in endless adelphia farces and his moral nature as conceived by the ingenious playwright was even less inviting than his exterior he was a scamp a rogue a compiler of interminable bills an exactor of the last shilling a legal shylock hardfisted and avaricious to a great extent this type is a thing of the past for your latterday lawyer is an alert welldressed personage social and amiable still he is looked on with awe as a dispenser of justicevery often of injusticeand not all the fine raiment in the world can rob him of his ancient reputation when he was a dread being to the dwellers of grub street who mostly had the task of limning his portrait and so impartial revenge pictured him as above all of which preamble leads up to the fact that francis hilliston was a lawyer of the new school despite his sixty and more years in appearance he was not unlike a farmer and indeed owned a few arable acres in kent where he played the role of a modern cincinnatus there he affected rough clothing and an interest in agricultural subjects but in town in his lincolns inn fields office he was solemnly arrayed in a frock coat with other garments to match and conveyed into his twinkling eyes an expression of dignified learning he was a different man in london to what he was in kent and was a kind of dr jekyll and mr hyde for moral transformations on this special occasion frockcoated legality was uppermost yet he unbent for a moment or so when receiving claude larcher for childless himself the young man was to him a very absalom and he loved him with an affection truly paternal no one can have the conduct of a child up to the age of twentyat which period claude made his debut in the engineering world without feeling a tugging at the heart strings had larcher been indeed his son and he a father in place of a guardian he could have scarcely received the young man more warmly or have welcomed him with more heartfelt affection but the first outburst over and claude duly greeted and seated in a convenient chair mr hilliston recurred to his legal stiffness and with no smile on his lips sat eyeing his visitor he had an awkward conversation before him and was mentally wondering as to the best way of breaking the ice claude spared him the trouble by at once plunging headlong into the subject of margaret bezel and her mysterious letter here you are sir said he handing it to his guardian i have brought the letter of this woman with me as you wished and i have also abstained from seeing her in accordance with your desire humph muttered hilliston skimming the letter with a legal eye i thought she would write do you know her sir oh yes said the other dryly i know her but he added after a thoughtful pause i have not set eyes on her for at least fiveandtwenty years twentyfive years repeated claude thoughtful in his turn it was about that time i came into your house hilliston looked up sharply as though conceiving that the remark was made with intention but satisfied that it was not from the absent expression in larchers face he resumed his perusal of the letter and commented thereon what do you think of this communication claude i dont know what to think replied the young man promptly i confess i am curious to know why this woman wishes to see me who is she a widow lady with a small income does she know anything of my family why do you ask that demanded hilliston sharply and as it seemed to claude a trifle uneasily well as i am a stranger to her she cannot wish to see me on any personal matter sir and as you mention that you have not seen her for fiveandtwenty years about which time my parents died i naturally thought that i had some object in asking you not to see her well yes you are a man of experience now claude said hilliston with apparent irrelevance and have been all over the world consequently you know that life is full oftrouble i believe so but hitherto no trouble has come my way you might expect that it would come sooner or later claude it has come now indeed said larcher in a joking tone am i about to lose my small income of five hundred a year no that is safe enough answered hilliston abruptly rising to his feet the trouble of which i speak will not affect your material welfare indeed if you are a hardened man of the world as you might be it need affect you very little in any case you are not responsible for the sins of a former generation and as you hardly remember your parents cannot have any sympathy with their worries i certainly remember very little of my parents sir said larcher moved by the significance of this speech yet i have a faint memory of two faces one a dark handsome face with kind eyes the other a beautiful fair countenance your father and mother claude yes so much i remember of them but what have they to do with margaret bezelor mrs bezel as i suppose she is called why does she want to see me to tell you a story which i prefer to relate myself about whom about your parents but they are dead yes said hilliston they are dead he walked about the room opened a box and took out a roll of papers yellow with age these were neatly tied up with red tape and inscribed the larcher affair placing them on the table before him hilliston resumed his seat and looked steadfastly at his ward claude vaguely aware that some unpleasant communication was about to be made to him sat silently waiting the words of ill omen and his naturally fresh color faded to a dull white with apprehension i have always loved you like a son claude said hilliston solemnly ever since you came to my house a tiny boy of five it has been my aim to educate you well to advance your interests to make you happy and above all added the lawyer lowering his voice to keep the contents of these papers secret from you claude said nothing though hilliston paused to enable him to speak but sat waiting further explanation i thought the past was dead and buried resumed his guardian in a low voice so far as i can see it is foolish to rake up old scandalsold crimes crimes said claude rising involuntarily to his feet crimes repeated hilliston sadly the time has come when you must know the truth about your parents the woman who wrote this letter has been silent for fiveandtwenty years now for some reason with which i am unacquainted she is determined to see you and reveal all a few months ago she called here to tell me so i implored her to keep silent pointing out that no good could come of acquainting you with bygone evils but she refused to listen to me and left this office with the full intention of finding you out and making her revelation but i have been in new zealand she did not know that nor did i tell her said hilliston grimly in fact i refused to give her your address but she is not the woman to be easily beaten as i well know i guessed she would find out the name of your club and write to you there therefore i sent that letter to you so as to counterplot the creature i expected that you would find a letter from her at your club on your arrival i was right here is the letter she has succeeded so far but i have managed to checkmate her by obtaining the first interview with you should you call on herand after reading these papers i have little doubt but that you will do soshe will be able to tell you nothing new i cannot crush the viper but at least i can draw its fangs you speak hardly of this woman sir i have reason to said hilliston quietly but for this woman your father would still be alive what do you mean i mean that your father george larcher was murdered murdered yes murdered at horriston in kent in the year stunned by this information which he was far from expecting claude sank down in his chair with a look of horror on his face while hilliston spoke rapidly i have kept this secret all these years because i did not want your young life to be shadowed by the knowledge of your fathers fate but now mrs bezel intends to tell you the truth and will give you a garbled version of the same making herself out a martyr i must be beforehand with her and i wish you to take those papers and read the account of the case which ended in the acquittal of your mother my mother acquitted do you mean i mean that mrs larcher was accused of the murder of her husband and was tried and acquitted great heavens but she is now dead i say no more said hilliston evading a direct reply you will know the truth when you read these papers larcher mechanically took the packet held out to him and placed it in his pocket then he rose to go a thousand questions were on the tip of his tongue but he dare not ask one it would be better he thought to learn the truth from the papers in place of hearing it from the lips of francis hilliston who might for all he knew give as garbled a version of the affair as mrs bezel hilliston guessed his thoughts and approved of the unspoken decision i think you are right he said with deliberation it is best that you should learn the truth in that way when you have read those papers come and see me about them one moment sir who killed my father i cannot say your mother was suspected and proved innocent a friend of your father was also suspected and and proved innocent no he was never arrestedhe was never tried he vanished on the night of the murder and has not been heard of since now i can tell you no more go and read the papers claude larcher took up his hat and hurried toward the door in a mechanical manner there he paused does mrs bezel know the truth hilliston arranging the papers on the table looked up with a face which had unexpectedly grown gray and old yes he said quickly i think mrs bezel knows the truth chapter iv what occurred at horriston after that fatal interview claude went neither to the house at kensington gore nor to the chambers of his friend tait with the papers given to him by hilliston in his pocket he repaired to a quiet hotel in jermyn street where he was wellknown and there secured a bedroom for the night a wire speedily brought his luggage from the railway station and thus being settled for the moment he proceeded to acquaint himself with the tragedy of his parents lives it was some time before he could make up his mind to read the papers and dreading the disagreeable relation he put off the perusal till such time as he retired to bed a note dispatched to the club intimated to tait that the second seat at the curtain theater would be unoccupied and then claude tried to rid himself of distracting thoughts by a rapid walk in the park so do men dally with the inevitable and vainly attempt to stay the march of fate dinner was a mere farce with the young man for he could neither eat nor drink and afterward he dawdled about the smoke room putting off the reading of the papers as long as he could a superstitious feeling of coming evil withheld him from immediately learning the truth and it was not until the clock struck ten that he summoned up sufficient courage to repair to his bedroom with the papers spread out on a small table he sat down at halfpast ten reading by the light of a single candle a second and a third were needed before he arose from his chair and the gray dawn was glimmering through the window blinds as he laid down the last sheet then his face was as gray as the light spreading over street and house for he knew that his dead father had been foully murdered and that his dead mother had been morally if not legally guilty of the crime the tragedya strange mixture of the sordid and the romantictook place at horriston in kent in the year and the following are the main facts as exhibited by the provincial press in the year george larcher and his wife came to settle at horriston attracted thereto by the romantic beauty of the scenery and the cheerful society of that rising wateringplace since that time horriston after a feeble struggle for supremacy has succumbed to powerful rivals and is once more a sleepy little provincial town unknown to invalid or doctor but when mr and mrs larcher settled there it was a popular resort for visitors from all quarters of the three kingdoms and the young couple were extremely liked by the gay society which filled the town for five years they lived there but during the sixth occurred the tragedy which slew the husband and placed the wife in the dock the antecedents of the pair were irreproachable in every respect he was a fairly rich man of thirtyfive who holding a commission in the army had met with his wifethen miss barkerat cheltenham she was a beautiful girl fond of dress and gayety the belle of her native town and the greatest flirt of the country side handsome george larcher in all the bravery of martial trappings came like the young prince of the fairy tale and carried off the beauty from all rivals she knowing him to be rich seeing him to be handsome and aware that he was wellconnected accepted his hand and so they were married to the great discomfiture of many sighing swains there was love on his side at least but whether julia barker returned that passion in any great degree it is hard to say the provincial reporter hinted that a prior attachment had engaged her heart and though she married larcher for his money and looks and position yet she only truly loved one manone mark jeringham who afterward figured in the tragedy at horriston to all outward appearance captain and mrs larcher were a pattern couple and popular with military and civil society then in obedience to the wish of his wife george larcher sold out and within a few months of their marriage they came to live at horriston here they took a house known as the laurels which was perched on a cliff of moderate height overlooking the river sarway and proceeded to entertain the gay society of the neighborhood one son was born to them a year after they took up their abode at the laurels and he was five years of age when the tragedy took place which caused the death of his parent claude had no difficulty in recognizing himself as the orphan so pathetically alluded to by the flowery provincial reporter the household of george larcher consisted of six servants among whom two were particularly interesting the one was the captains valet denis bantry an irish soldier in the same regiment as his master who had been bought out by larcher when he took leave of military glory attached to the captain by many acts of kindness denis was absolutely devoted to him and was no unimportant personage in the new home the other servant was mona bantry the sister of denis a handsome brighteyed lass from county kerry who acted as maid to mrs larcher the remaining servants call for no special mention but this irish couple must be particularly noted as having been mixed up with the tragedy for some months all went well at the laurels and it seemed as though the larchers were devoted to one another but this was only outwardly for the character of julia developed rapidly after marriage into that of a vain frivolous woman eager of admiration extravagant as regards dress and neglectful of the infant son larcher a thoroughly domesticated man greatly resented the attitude taken up by his wife and the resentment led to frequent quarrels he was annoyed by her frivolity and continuous absence from home while she began to dislike her grave husband who would have made heras she expressed ita mere domestic drudge but the pair managed to hoodwink the world as to their real feelings to one another and it was only when the trial of mrs larcher came on that the truth was revealed in all kent there was no more unhappy home than that at the laurels to make matters worse mark jeringham paid a visit to horriston and having known mrs larcher from childhood naturally enough became a frequent visitor he was everywhere at the heels of the former belle of cheltenham who encouraged him in his attentions larcher remonstrated with his wife on her folly but she saucily refused to alter her line of conduct but for the scandal of the thing larcher would have forbidden jeringham the house and to mark his disapprobation gave him the cold shoulder on every occasion nevertheless this inconvenient person persisted in thrusting himself between husband and wife to the anger of the former and the delight of the latter the introduction of this third element only made matters worse the house was divided into camps for mona supported her mistress in her frivolity and indeed seemed herself to have an admiration for handsome mark jeringham who was very generous in money matters denis in whose eyes his master was perfect hated the interloper as much as larcher and loudly protested against the attention of mona and his mistress another friend who supported larcher was francis hilliston then a gay young lawyer of thirtyfive who often paid a visit to horriston he also frequented the laurels but was much disliked by mrs larcher who greatly resented his loyal friendship for her husband things were in this position on the d of june when events occurred which resulted in the murder of captain larcher the disappearance of jeringham and the arrest of mrs larcher on a charge of murder a masked ball in fancy dress was to be given at the town hall on that night and hither mrs larcher was going as mary queen of scots accompanied by jeringham in the character of darnley george larcher refused to be present and went up to london on the night in question leaving his faithful friend hilliston to look after his matrimonial interests at the ball before he left a terrible scene took place between himself and his wife in which he forbade her to go to the dance but she defied him and said she would go without his permission whereupon larcher left the house and went up to london swearing that he would never return until his wife asked his pardon and renounced the friendship of jeringham now here began the mystery which no one was able to fathom mrs larcher went to the ball with jeringham and having as she said to hilliston who was also at the ball enjoyed herself greatly returned home at three in the morning the next day she was ill in bed although she had left the town hall in perfect health and mark jeringham had disappeared larcher was not seen in the neighborhood for five days and presumably was still in london so during his absence mrs larcher kept her bed then his body considerably disfigured was found at the mouth of the river sarway some four miles down curious to state it was clothed in a fancy dress similar to that worn by jeringham on the night of the ball on the discovery of the body public curiosity was greatly excited and a thousand rumors flew from mouth to mouth that a crime had been committed no one doubted for a moment as an examination proved that george larcher had been stabbed to the heart by some slender sharp instrument the matter passed into the hands of the police and they paid a visit to the laurels for the purpose of seeing what light mrs larcher could throw on the matter at this awful period of her frivolous life francis hilliston stood her friend and it was he who interviewed the officers of the law when they called mrs larcher was still in bed and under the doctors orders refused to rise therefrom or to receive her visitors she protested to hilliston who in his turn reported her sayings to the police that she knew nothing about the matter she had not seen her husband since he left her on the d of june and no one was more astonished or horrorstruck than she at the news of his death according to her story she had left the ball at three oclock and had driven to the laurels with jeringham he had parted from her at the door of the house and had walked back to horriston his reason for not entering and for not using the carriage to return was that he did not wish to give color to the scandal as to the relations which existed between them which mrs larcher vowed and protested were purely platonic furthermore she asserted that her illness was caused by a discovery which she had made on the night of the ball that mona bantry was about to become a mother and to all appearance she believed that the father of the coming child was none other than her husband far from thinking that he had been murdered she had been waiting for his return in order to upbraid him for his profligacy and to demand a divorce mona bantry had disappeared immediately after the discovery of her ruin and mrs larcher professed that she did not know where she was this story which was feasible enough satisfied the police authorities for the moment and they retired only to return three days later with a warrant for the arrest of mrs larcher in the interval a dagger had been found in the grounds of the laurels on the banks of the river and as it was stained with blood and exactly fitted the wound it was concluded that with this weapon the crime had been committed inquiry resulted in the information being obtained that mrs larcher in her character of mary queen of scots had worn this dagger on the night of the ball hence it was evident so said the police that she had killed her husband the theory of the police was that captain larcher had returned from london on the night of the ball and had witnessed the parting of his wife and jeringham at the door filled with jealous rage he had upbraided his wife in the sitting room the window of which looked out on the cliff overhanging the river in a moment of fury she had doubtless snatched the dagger from her girdle and stabbed him to the heart then terrified at what she had done had thrown the body out of the window trusting that the stream would carry it away and so conceal her crime this the river had done for the body had been discovered four miles down where it had been carried by the current as to the dagger being in the grounds in place of the room the police never at a loss for a theory suggested that mrs larcher had stolen out of the house and had thrown the dagger over the bank where it was subsequently discovered mrs larcher asserted her innocence and reiterated her statement that she had not seen her husband since the day of the ball he had not returned on that night as the servants could testify the only domestics who had not retired to bed when she returned at three oclock were mona and denis of these the first had gone away to hide her shame and all inquiries and advertisements failed to find her but at the trial denismuch broken down at the ruin of his sisterswore that captain larcher had not returned from london on that evening and that mrs larcher had gone straight to the sitting room where she first made the discovery of monas iniquity and then had afterward retired to bed mrs larcher asserted that the dagger had been lost by her at the ball and she knew not into whose hands it had fallen the trial which took place at canterbury was a nine days wonder and opinions were divided as to the guilt of the erring wife one party held that she had committed the crime in the manner stated by the police while the others asserted that jeringham was the criminal and had disappeared in order to escape the consequences of his guilt doubtless said they he had been met by larcher after leaving the house and had killed him during a quarrel the use of the dagger was accounted for by these wiseacres by a belief that mrs larcher had given it to jeringham as a love token when she parted from him at the door of the laurels the evidence of denis that he had been with or near mrs larcher till she retired to bed and that the captain had not set foot in the house on that evening turned the tide of evidence in favor of the unfortunate woman she was acquitted of the crime and went to london but there diedas appeared from the newspapersa few weeks afterward killed by anxiety and shame the child claude was taken charge of by mr hilliston who had been a good friend to mrs larcher during her troubles and so the matter faded from the public mind what became of jeringham no one ever knew his victimas some supposed larcher to bewas duly buried in the horriston cemetery but all the efforts of the police failed to find the man who was morally if not legally guilty of the crime denis also was lost in the london crowd and all those who had been present at the tragedy at the laurels were scattered far and wide new matters attracted the attention of the fickle public and the larcher affair was forgotten in due course the mystery was never solved who was guilty of the crime that question was never answered some accused mrs larcher despite her acquittal and death others insisted that jeringham was the criminal but no one could be certain of the truth hilliston seeing that mr and mrs larcher were dead that mona denis and jeringham had disappeared wisely kept the matter secret from claude deeming that it would be folly to disturb the mind of the lad with an insoluble riddle of so terrible a nature so for fiveandtwenty years the matter had remained in abeyance now it seemed as though it were about to be reopened by mrs bezel and who asked claude of himself as he finished this history in the gray dawn of the morning who is mrs bezel to say the least he had a right to ask himself this question for it was curious that the name of mrs bezel was not even mentioned in connection with that undiscovered crime of fiveandtwenty years before chapter v a strange coincidence in spite of taits methodical habits circumstances beyond his control often occurred to upset them on the previous day the unexpected arrival of claude had altered his plans for the day and after his return from the theater on the same evening he hadcontrary to his rulepassed the night in reading the invaluable dormer had procured a whim of fate from mudies and tait found it lying on the table in company with biscuits and wine excited by the performance he did not feel inclined to retire at his usual hour of midnight and while sipping his wine picked up the first volume to while away the time till he should feel sleepy alas this novel about which everyone in london was talking proved anything but soporific and for the whole of that night tait sat in his comfortable chair devouring the three volumes the tale was one of mystery and until he learned the solution tait conventional and incurious as he was could not tear himself from the fascination of the printed page when the riddle was read when the criminal was hunted down when the bad were punished and the good rewarded the dawn was already breaking in the east in his jermyn street hotel claude larcher was rising stiff and tired from the perusal of a tragedy in real life in his earls street chambers spenser tait was closing the third volume of john parvers work each had passed a wakeful night each had been fascinated by the account of a crime the one real the other fictional so does fate whose designs no one can presume to explain duplicate our lives for the gaining of her own ends rather disgusted by his departure from the conventional and heartily blaming the too ingenious john parver for having caused such departure tait tumbled hastily into bed in order to snatch a few hours sleep dormer ignorant of his masters vigil woke him remorselessly at his usual hour with the unexpected intelligence that mr larcher was waiting to see him in the sitting room from the telegram of the previous night and this early visit tait rightly concluded that his friend was in trouble so without waiting to take his bath he hurriedly slipped on a dressing gown and appeared sleepy and disheveled in the sitting room larcher who looked likewise dissipated arose to his feet as the little man entered and they eyed one another in astonishment for the appearance of each was totally at variance with his usual looks well said tait interrogatively i see youve been making a night of it i might say the same of you replied larcher grimly a more dissipated looking wretch i never saw have you fallen into bad habits at your age that depends on what you call bad habits claude i have not been round the town if that is what you mean but seduced by the novel of a too ingenious author i have sat up all night devouring his three volumes such a thing has not occurred with me since i unfortunately tried to read myself to sleep with jane eyre charlotte bronte and john parver are both answerable for my white nights but you continued tait surveying his friend in a quizzical manner am i to understand that you are to understand that my night has been a duplicate of your own interrupted larcher curtly what have you been reading a whim of fate no my friend i have not while you were devouring fiction i have been making myself acquainted with a tragedy in real life larcher thereupon savagely threw on the breakfast table a roll of papers and looked defiantly at his friend tone and expression failed to elicit surprise oh said tait reflectively then hilliston gave you bad news after all i guessed he had from your refusal to accompany me to the theater last night you guessed rightly he gave me such news as i never expected to hear you will find it amply set forth in those papers which i have been reading all night dear me i trust it is nothing serious has mrs bezel i dont know anything about mrs bezel said larcher loudly so far as she is concerned i am as much in the dark as ever but my parents what of them interrupted tait uttering the first thought which came into his mind are they alive after all no they are dead sure enough muttered claude gloomily in that case what can mr hilliston or mrs bezel have to say about them demanded the other looking puzzled no scandal about queen elizabeth i hope confound it man dont be so flippant ive had bad news i tell you my fatherhere larcher gulped down his emotion with some difficultymy father was murdered murdered repeated tait looking aghast as well he might yes and my mother was accused of having murdered him there you have it it was some little time before tait could face the skeleton so unexpectedly produced from the larcher cupboard hitherto his acquaintance with crime had been mainly derived from fiction after the style of john parver or from the columns of the press but now he was brought face to face with a tragedy indirectly connected with his dearest friend and naturally enough did not like the situation nevertheless like the wise little man he was he made no comment on the truth so suddenly blurted out but pushed his friend into a comfortable chair and proposed breakfast breakfast cried claude clutching his hair i could not eat a morsel have you no feelings you little monster to propose breakfast to me after hearing such hideous news why dont you give me sympathy and try and help me instead of sitting at your confounded rasher of bacon like a graven image ill do all in my power later on said tait quietly but you are upset by this news and no wonder try and eat a little then you can tell me all about it and ill give you the best advice in my power thus adjured claude drew in his chair and managed to eat a morsel of toast and drink a cup of coffee after which he lighted his pipe and smoked furiously while tait anxious that his friend should regain his selfcontrol made a lengthened meal and talked of divers matters breakfast over he also filled his favorite pipe and drawing a chair close to that of larchers waited for an explanation well claude said he after a pause during which the other showed no disposition to speak tell me your trouble i have told you grumbled larcher angrily if you want to know any more about it read those papers it would take too long and as it happens i am already tired with reading tell me about the affair as shortly as possible and then we can go through the papers together you say your father was murdered who committed the crime no one knows the criminal is still at large after fiveandtwenty years he is likely to remain so no cried larcher vehemently striking the table ill hunt him down and find him out and put a rope round his neck so help me god you say your mother was accused of the crime said tait ignoring this outburst yes but she was acquitted on the evidence of my fathers valet shortly afterward she died in london i dont wonder at it said poor claude distractedly the shame the disgrace if she survived she was bitterly punished i should like to see the man who would dare to asperse her memory no one will do so said tait soothingly control yourself my dear fellow and we will look into this matter together i have just been reading about a crime but i did not think i would be so soon concerned in dealing with one you will help me tait you will stand by me my dear friend can you ask i am completely at your service and together we will do all in our power to discover the murderer of your father and clear the memory of your mother it is clear she was acquitted by the jury dont you dare to i dont dare to say anything interrupted tait impatiently do be reasonable my good fellow so long as i am ignorant i can say nothing tell me the particulars and we may arrive at some conclusion now then give me a precis of the case dominated by the superior calm of his friend claude related the larcher affair as succinctly as possible the details of the case had impressed themselves too strongly on his brain for him to hesitate in the narration and keeping his emotions well in hand he managed to give a fairly minute account of the tragedy which had taken place at horriston in the year the effect on tait was surprising a look of blank astonishment overspread his face as larcher proceeded with his story and when it was finished he looked anxiously at his friend apart from the details of the case he was deeply interested in the matter from another point of view larcher waited to hear what his friend thought of the case but instead of commenting thereon tait both acted and spoke in an apparently irrelevant manner without a word he heard claude to the end then rose from his seat and walking to the other end of the room returned with three volumes bound in red cloth this book is called a whim of fate said he placing the volumes at larchers elbow have you read it confound it what do you mean burst out claude with justifiable wrath i tell you of a serious matter which nearly concerns myself and you prattle about the last fashionable novel wait a minute said tait laying a detaining hand on his friends coat sleeve there is more method in my madness than you give me credit for what do you mean the story you tell me is most extraordinary but the information i am about to impart to you is more extraordinary still you say this crime at horriston was committed fiveandtwenty years ago yes you can see by the date of those newspapers it has very likely faded out of all memories of course i dont suppose anyone is now alive who gives it a thought well said tait it is certainly curious what is curious explain yourself the story you tell me now was known to me last night larcher looked at his friend in unconcealed surprise and promptly contradicted what seemed to be a foolish assertion that is impossible tait i heard it only last night myself nevertheless i read it last night read it last night repeated larcher skeptically in this book said tait laying his hand on the novel what do you mean demanded the other impatiently i mean that john parver the author of this book has utilized the events which took place at horriston in for the purpose of writing a work of fiction the story you tell me is told in these pages and your family tragedy is the talk of literary london chapter vi truth is stranger than fiction this astonishing statement was received by claude with a disbelieving smile and so convinced was he of its untruth that he affected anger at what he really believed to be the flippancy of taits conduct it is no doubt very amusing for you to ridicule my story said he with cold dignity but it is hardly the act of a friend some matters are too serious to form the subject of a jest and this i am not jesting interrupted tait eagerly i assure you that the tragedy which concerned your parents forms the subjectmatter of this novel you can read the book yourself and so be convinced that i am speaking the truth the names and places are no doubt fictional but the whole story is narrated plainly enough larcher turned over the three volumes with a puzzled expression that a story with which he had only become acquainted within the last twentyfour hours should be printed in a book and that the book itself should be brought so speedily under his notice seemed to him quite inexplicable the strangeness of the occurrence paralyzed his will and contrary to his usual selfdependence he looked to tait for guidance what do you think of it he asked irresolutely ah that requires some consideration my friend but before we go into the matter let us understand our position toward each other you believe this story of your fathers death certainly mr hilliston would not tell me an untruth and moreover this bundle of extracts from provincial newspapers confirms his statement i truly believe that my father george larcher was murdered at horriston in byand there you have mei know not by whom my own opinion is that jeringham is one moment claude let us settle all preliminaries are you resolved to take up this matter i am i must clear the memory of my mother and avenge the death of my father would it not be better to let sleeping dogs lie suggested tait with some hesitation i do not think so replied claude quietly i am not a sentimental man as you know and my nature is of too practical a kind to busy itself with weaving ropes of sand yet in this instance i feel that it is my duty to hunt down and punish the coward who killed my father when i find him and punish him this ghost of will be laid aside otherwise it will continue to haunt and torture me all my life but your business i shall lay aside my business till this matter is settled to my satisfaction as you know i have a private income and am not compelled to work for my daily bread moreover the last four years have brought me in plenty of money so that i can afford to indulge my fancy and my fancy added claude in a grim tone is to dedicate the rest of my life to discovering the truth do you not approve of my decision yes and no said tait evasively i think your hunt for an undescribed criminal whose crime dates back twentyfive years is rather a waste of time all clews must have disappeared it seems hopeless for you to think of solving the mystery and if you do continued the little man earnestly if you do what possible pleasure can you derive from such a solution your father is a mere name to you so filial love can have nothing to do with the matter moreover the criminal may be deadhe may be you have a thousand and one objections said larcher impatiently none of which have any weight with me i am in the hands of fate a factor has entered into my life which has changed my future knowing what i now know i cannot rest until i learn the truth do you know the story of mozart he added abruptly i know several stories of mozart but this special one i may not know it is told either of mozart or mendelssohn i forget which pursued larcher half to himself when mozartlet us say mozartwas ill in bed one of his friends struck a discord on the piano which required what is technically known as a resolution for its completion the omission so tortured the sensitive ear of the musician that when his friend departed he rose from his bed and completed the discord in accordance with musical theory till that was done he could not rest and the point of your parable can you not see this incomplete case of murder is my discord i must complete it by discovering the criminal and so round off the case or submit to be tortured by its hinted mystery all my life it is not filial love it is not sentiment it is not even curiosity it is simply a desire to complete a matter hitherto left undone till i know the sequel to the horriston tragedy i shall feel in a state of suspenseand suspense added claude emphatically is torture to men of my temperament your reason is a trifle whimsical said tait smiling at the application of this musical theory to the present instance but i can understand your feelings indeed i feel the same way myself you why not in reading a whim of fate i could not go to rest without knowing the end and i feel a like curiosity toward this tragedy of real life i shall not be content till i learn the truth my feelings are precisely the same as your own therefore pursued tait with emphasis i propose to assist you in your search we will discuss the matter calmly and see what is best to be done in spite of the lapse of fiveandtwenty years who knows but what we may lay hands on the murderer of your father who is no doubt now living in fancied security unless he is dead who is making the objections now said tait smiling well claude will you accept me as your brother detective in this matter willingly and i thank you for this proof of your friendship i am afraid there is an element of selfishness mixed up in my offer said tait shrugging his shoulders it is not every day that one can find an interesting case like this to dissect excitement is the joy of life and i rather think we will be able to extract a great deal from this investigation come we now understand one another larcher grasped the hand held out to him and gratefully accepted the aid thus offered from that moment the two dedicated themselves to hunt down the criminal at whose hands george larcher had met his death it was as strange a compact as had ever been made halting nemesis who had rested all these years once more resumed her stealthy progress and before her ran these two young men as ministers of her longdelayed revenge this junction of unforeseen circumstances savored of the dramatic the first thing to be done said tait when the compact was thus concluded is to read both cases both cases repeated claude curiously yes you remember how browning gives half a dozen aspects of the same case in his ring and the book in a minor degree we benefit in the same manner there said tait pointing to the roll of newspapers is the case from the real point of view and here in these three volumes we will find the same case as considered in a fictional fashion by the novelist by reading both we may come to some conclusion whence to start in our talk last night you read the newspapers i the novel today we will reverse the process i will view the affair as set forth by the provincial press and you will devour the three volumes of john parver as i did last night and afterward eh who can say replied tait shrugging his shoulders several sojourns in paris had left their trace in gallic gestures and possibly in gallic flippancy we must know what foundation we have before we build claude nodded he was of the same way of thinking himself and commented on his friends speech after his own fashion yes said he a trifle vindictively we must build our gallows stanch and strong you can proceed with your toilet and afterward we will read novels and newspapers as you suggest the result of our reading must appear in our actions i rather think he added slowly that the result will be a visit to mr hilliston without doubt he was an eyewitness and it is always preferable to obtain evidence first hand then said claude reflectively there is mrs bezel quite so the enterprising lady who started the whole thing was she also an eyewitness i cant say her name does not appear in the newspapers humph muttered tait scratching his chin nor in those three volumes can i find a character likely to develop into mrs bezel of hampstead i wonder who she can be said claude curiously or what she can have to do with the case that we must find out depend upon it there is more in this case than in newspapers or novel we must find out all about mrs bezel and said tait with emphasis we must learn all that is to be learned concerning john parver who is john parver who was the man in the iron mask replied tait in a bantering tone i cannot say but whomsoever he may be he knows all about this case there is that possibility certainly assented the other smoothly but i think it hardly likely a man of today would not readily come across the account of a tragedy occurring in a little known town twentyfive years ago do you know he added after a pause that it occurs to me that the publication of this book containing an account of the case may have been the cause which incited mrs bezel to write the letter i thought so myself mrs bezel may think that john parver is a nom de plume assumed by claude larcher or another alternative mrs bezel may be john parver herself it is the fashion nowadays for women to write under the names of men there was a few minutes silence during which each man was intent on his own thoughts tait whose brain turned quicker than that of larcher was the first to break the silence well said he moving briskly toward his bedroom door before we can say or do anything we must learn the facts of the case as he vanished into his room claude laid his hand on the first of the three volumes chapter vii let sleeping dogs lie on the journey of life we sometimes come to a dead stop obstacles arise which bar our further progress and circumstances impossible to do away with confront us on all sides we cannot go back for in life there is no retrogression we cannot proceed owing to blocked paths and so stand hopeless and powerless waiting for the word or action of fate she unseen but almighty deity alone can remove the hindrance which prevents our progress and until she speaks or acts we can do nothing but wait it is on such occasions that we feel how truly we are the puppets of some unknown power francis hilliston had arrived at some such stoppage hitherto his keen brain his strong will his capability for decisive action had carried him onward from past to present through present to future when obstacles had arisen they had been easily swept away and with his own life in his hands he was perfectly satisfied of his power to mold it to his liking possibly fate who is a somewhat jealous deity felt angered at the egotistic selfreliance of the man for without warning she brought him to a dead stop then grimly waited to see how his boasted cunning would outwit her as she probably foresaw the man did nothing but await her decision it was the only thing he could do for fiveandtwenty years the horriston tragedy had been unmentioned unthought of hilliston deemed that it was relegated to the category of unknown crimes and having in mind his friendship for the parents and his love for the son was not unwilling that it should be so he did not wish claude to know of the matter he was not desirous that he should come in contact with mrs bezel and hitherto had managed so well that neither contingency had eventuated congratulating himself on his dexterity he remained lulled in fancied security when fate observant of his complacency sent a bolt from the blue and brought him up short now hilliston forced by circumstances to tell the truth to larcher did not know what to do he could only wait for the fiat of the higher power grimly satisfied that she had brought home his fault and had shown him his moral weakness fate made the next move and sent larcher and his friend to lincolns inn fields to again set hilliston on his former journey the paralysis of will which had seized the elder man did not extend to the younger for claude arrived full of anxiety to begin the search for the undiscovered criminal the first result of his compact with tait was this visit to the lawyer claude larcher spenser tait muttered hilliston glancing at the cards brought in by his clerk i thought as much the matter is out of my hands now show the gentlemen in he added sharply the clerk departed and hilliston walked quickly to the window where he stood biting his nails all geniality had vanished from his face he looked older than his years and an unaccustomed frown wrinkled his expansive forehead a crisis had come which he knew not how to meet so after the fashion of men when they feel thus helpless he left the decision in the hands of fate which was precisely what fate wanted goodmorning claude goodmorning mr tait said hilliston welcoming the young men with artificial enthusiasm i expected to see you today surely you did not expect to see me said tait in a silky tone as he placed his hat on the table indeed i did where damon is phintias is sure to be that claudes perusal of those papers would result in your accompanying him to this office i felt sure i was right here you are mr hilliston affected a cheerfulness he was far from feeling with increasing age a distaste had come for violent excitements and with one of claudes temperament he knew that the chances were that the ensuing quarter of an hour would be somewhat stirring contrary to his expectations however larcher was eager but calm and hilliston assuring himself that the calmness was genuine began to hope that the interview would pass off better than he expected still none of us like to reopen a disagreeable chapter of the book of life and this mr hilliston against his will and inclination was about to do well sir said claude when they were all seated and the hush of expectancy was in the air i have read those papers yes said mr hilliston interrogatively and what do you think of the matter i think it is a very black case you are quite right claude it is a very black case indeed i did all in my power to bring the criminal to justice but without success who is the criminal asked larcher with a keen glance at his guardian hilliston shuffled his feet uneasily by no means relishing the directness of the question that is a difficult question to answer he said slowly in fact an impossible one my suspicions point to jeringham from this point tait made a third in the conversation that is because jeringham disappeared on the night of the murder he said leisurely yes i think that circumstance alone is very suspicious he was never found again never we advertised in all the papers we employed detectives inquired privately but all to no result the last person who saw jeringham was mrs larcher he parted from her at the door of the laurels and vanished into the night it still hides him what do you conclude from that sir asked claude after a pause i can only conclude one thing replied hilliston with great deliberation that your father suspicious of jeringham returned on that night from london and saw the parting the result is not difficult to foresee it is my own opinion that there were words between the men possibly a struggle and that the matter ended in the murder of your father by jeringham hence the discovery of the body thrown into the river hence the flight of the murderer was this the generally received opinion at the time yes i can safely say that it was believed jeringham was guilty and had fled to escape the consequences of his crime in that case how was it that mrs larcher was arrested asked tait skeptically you cannot have read the case carefully to ask me that replied hilliston sharply she was arrested on the evidence of the dagger without doubt the crime was committed with the dagger and as she had worn it the inference was drawn that she was the guilty person but she was acquitted and left the courtas the saying iswithout a stain on her character nevertheless she died mr hilliston shame killed her said the lawyer sadly she was a foolish woman in many waysyour pardon claude for so speakingbut she was not the woman to commit so foul a crime indeed i believe she was fondly attached to her husband till jeringham came between them ah interposed tait composedly that is john parvers view john parver repeated hilliston with wellbred surprise i do not know that name in connection with the case nor do we know the name of mrs bezel said claude quickly hilliston started and looked at claude as though he would read his very soul the inscrutability of the young mans countenance baffled him and he turned off the remark with a dry laugh with mrs bezel we will deal hereafter he said shortly but who is this john parver he is the author of a book called a whim of fate a novel yes a novel which embodies the whole of this case that is strange said hilliston quietly but no doubt the author has come across the details in some old provincial journal and made use of them the larcher affair caused a great deal of talk at the time but it is certainly remarkable that a novelist should have made use of it for fictional purposes after the lapse of so many years i must read the book just note the name of it here mr tait if you please tait did so and hilliston continued is my character in the book i think so under the name of michael dene i trust the author has been flattering to me by the way who does he say committed the crime michael dene hilliston went gray on the instant as though a sudden blow had been struck at his heart two pairs of keen eyes were fixed on his face with some surprise and uneasy at the scrutiny he strove to recover his composure upon my word he said with quivering lips i am infinitely obliged to john parver for describing me as a murderer and what motive does he ascribe to me or rather to michael dene for the committal of the crime love for the wife said tait smiling eh that is rather the role of jeringham i should say replied hilliston the color coming back to lips and cheek i must read this novel and if possible discover the identity of the author oh we will do that claude cried the lawyer in astonishment i and tait we intend to follow out this case to the end it is useless fiveandtwenty years have elapsed nevertheless i am determined to hunt down the murderer of my father said claude decisively besides we have two eyewitnesses to the tragedy yourself and mrs bezel ah mrs bezel i forgot her certainly i will do all in my power to help you claude your father was my dearest friend and i shall only be too glad to avenge his fate but if i could not do it at the moment how can i hope to do so nowafter so long a period has elapsed leave that to us sir tait and i will attend to the active part of the business all we ask you to do is to give us such information as lies in your power i will do that with pleasure said hilliston who by this time was thoroughly master of himself what is it you wish to know we wish to know all about mrs bezel who is she what has she to do with the case why is not her name mentioned in these pages for answers to these questions you had better apply to the lady herself you have her address why not call on her i intend to do so tomorrow the old man rose from his seat and took a turn up and down the room then he paused beside claude and laid a trembling hand on the young mans shoulder i have been a good friend to you claude you have been my second fathermy real father said larcher gently i shall never forget your kindness i would return it if i could then do so by letting sleeping dogs lie what do you mean by that mr hilliston asked the other with a subtle change in his tone abandon this case do not call on mrs bezel you can do no good by reopening the affair it was a mystery years ago it is a mystery still it will remain a mystery till the end of time not if i can help it i am sorry to disoblige you sir but my mind is made up i am determined to find out the truth hilliston sighed passed his hand across his forehead and returned to his seat hopeless and baffled he was sufficiently acquainted with claudes character to know that he was not easily turned from his purpose and that his resolution to solve the mystery would be resolutely carried out yet he made one more attempt to bend the young man to his will if you are wise you will not call on mrs bezel why not sir it will give you great pain all my pain is past replied claude quickly i can suffer no more than i did when reading these papers i must call on mrs bezel i must know the truth and added he significantly i have your promise to assist me i will do all in my power answered hilliston wearily but you do not know what are you doing i am older and more experienced than you and i give you my best advice do not see mrs bezel and leave the larcher affair alone the result of this wellmeant advice was that claude called the next morning on mrs bezel chapter viii both sides of the question mans life has frequently been compared to a river in childhood it is a trickling thread in youth a stream in manhood a majestic river and finally in old age is swallowed up in the ocean of death a very pretty parable but somewhat stale it is time that life was indicated by a new metaphor let us therefore compare the life of man to the ocean itself like the ocean life has its calms and storms its sullen rages its caressing moments and like the oceanfor this is the main point of the illustrationit has its profound depths containing a hundred secrets unknown to the outer world francis hilliston was like the ocean all knew the surface few were acquainted with the depths below a man who leads a double life need never feel dull he may be nervous anxious fearful lest his secret should be discovered but the constant vigilance required to hide it preserves him from the curse of ennui he ever keeps the best side of his nature uppermost his smiles are for the world his brow is smoothed to lull suspicion but to continue the simile of the ocean in the depths lie many terrible things which never come to the surface things which he scarcely dare admit even to himself francis hilliston was one of these men everyone knew hilliston of lincolns inn fields or thought they did which is quite a different thing he was widely respected in the profession he was popular in society hand and glove with prominent and wealthy personages his house at kensington gore was richly furnished his wife was handsome and fashionable he gave splendid entertainments at which none was more jocund than the host himself he was outwardly all that was prosperous and popular in his professional capacity he was the repository of a thousand secrets but of all these none was more terrible than the one locked up in his own breast long years of training constant necessity had taught him how to control his emotions to turn his face into a mask of inscrutability yet he succeeded ill at times as witness his interview with the two young men not all his powers of selfrepression could keep his face from turning gray nor prevent the perspiration beading his brow nor steady his voice to wellbred indifference usually he succeeded in masking his emotion this time he had failed and worst of all he knew that he had failed it was not claude that he feared for the young man was not of a suspicious nature and even had he been so would certainly have scoffed at the idea of attributing any evil to the one who had been to him a father tait silent observant and cynical was the person to be dreaded accustomed by his profession to read faces hilliston had seen that the quiet little man was possessed of one of those inquisitive penetrative natures which suspect all men and from a look a gesture a pause can draw evidence to support any suspicion they may entertain certainly tait had no reason to distrust hilliston when he entered the room but during the interview he appeared dissatisfied with the lawyers manner that hilliston should attempt to dissuade claude from prosecuting a search for his fathers murderer seemed strange but that he should betray such marked agitation at the idea of such searching taking place was stranger still altogether tait left the office in a very dissatisfied state of mind hilliston had sufficient penetration to note this and when left alone was at his wits end how to baffle the unwarrantable curiosity of this intruder i dont mind claude he said pacing up and down the room he has not sufficient brain power to find out anything i do not want him to know but this tait is dangerous he is one of those dogged creatures who puts his nose to the scent and never leaves the trail till the prey is captured it is with him i have to deal not with claude his agitation almost mastered him and he hurriedly took a small bottle from a drawer in his desk dropping the contents of this into a glass of water he drank off the draught and in a short space of time regained his composure in some measure then he sat down to think and plot and plan how to baffle the vigilance of tait that infernal woman has done it all he muttered savagely she has lighted the fire let us see how she will put it out but she cannot put it out he added striking his forehead with his clenched fist it will blaze and burn i shall burn with it unless there was a strange smile on his lips as an idea entered his mind and he glanced quickly at his watch four oclock claude cant possibly call on margaret today so i have yet time to prepare her for his visit i must silence her at any cost she must hold her tongue or ruin us both great heavens to think that she should break out like this after fiveandtwenty years it is enough to drive me mad by this time he had put on his gloves and stretched his hand toward his hat which stood on a side table a glance in the glass showed him how old and gray he looked and the sight was so unexpected that he started in dismay bah i look as though i were going to fail he said to himself but i must not fail i dare not fail at sixty rich honored respected i am not going to fall from the pedestal i have reached i shall reassure claude i shall baffle tait i shall silence margaret the first move in the game is mine calm dignified easy he left his office and stepped into the brougham waiting at the door to judge by appearance one would have thought him the most respectable and upright man in london no one knew what lurked behind that benevolent expression his mask had fallen for the moment when tait was present now it was on again and he went forth to deceive the world yet he had an uneasy consciousness that one man at least guessed his real character never mind he thought as the footman closed the door of the brougham it will be strange if with my age and experience and reputation and money i cannot baffle him he did not go direct home as it was yet early and he had one or two things to do in connection with his new task first he drove to taits chambers and ascertained from the porter that the two young men were within never mind sending up my name i wont disturb them he said when the porter requested his card i only wished to speak to mr tait about a box at the theater if it is the lyceum you mean sir i have just got two stalls for mr tait ah i may see them there replied hilliston negligently and as he drove away reflected good they have not yet been to hampstead nor do they intend to go tonight mr tait has yet to learn the value of time driving through piccadilly he stopped at a bookshop and with some difficulty for the demand was large obtained a copy of a whim of fate he began to read it in the brougham and skimmed its pages so rapidly that by the time he reached kensington gore he had nearly finished the first volume he did not recognize himself in the character of michael dene and became more convinced than ever that the coincidence of the larcher affair forming the plot of a novel was due to the authors reading the case in some old provincial newspaper on every page it betrayed that to him the story was hearsay fortunately mrs hilliston was driving in the park so the lawyer shut himself up in his library and went on reading the story he did not see his wife till dinner which took place at eight oclock and then descended in his ordinary clothes looking ill and pale something he had read in the novel had startled him more than he cared to confesseven to himself you must excuse my dress louise he said on taking his seat but i have been so engrossed with a novel that i did not hear the dressing bell it has not had a pleasant effect on you replied his wife smiling you do not look at all well i am not well said hilliston who merely trifled with his food you must excuse me going with you to the lamberts tonight as i think i shall call in and see my doctor are you so bad as all that questioned mrs hilliston anxiously why not send for dr bland i prefer going to see him louise you will probably not be back till three in the morning so i will go to bed immediately on my return have no fear my dear it is only a trifling indisposition after these plain statements it was rather strange that hilliston in place of driving to dr blands who lived in hill street should direct the cab which he picked up by the park railings to drive to hampstead chapter ix mrs bezel one cannot always judge by appearances either as regards human beings or houses mr hilliston was one excellent illustration of this rule clarence cottage was another it was in a narrow and crooked lane trending downward to the right at the summit of fitzjohns avenue an unpretentious twostory building divided from the public thoroughfare by a wellcultivated garden therein grew thyme and lavender marigolds and pansies for the owner of the cottage loved those homely flowers and daily gazed at them from the bowwindow wherein her couch was placed mrs bezel never walked in her garden for the allsufficient reason that she was a helpless paralytic and had not used her limbs for over ten years still a moderately young woman of fortyfive she possessed the remains of great beauty ravaged by years of anxiety and mental trouble those passing along the lane usually saw her pale face at the window and pitied the sufferings written in every line sufferings which were apparent even to a casual glance noting the homely garden the meanlooking dwelling the anxious expression of the invalid they deemed her to be some poor sickly creature the scapegoat of nature and the world who had sought this secluded spot in order to hide her troubles this view was not entirely correct she was in illhealth it is true she dwelt in a small house certainly and the anxious expression was seldom absent from her face but she was in easy circumstances untroubled by pecuniary worries and the interior of the cottage was furnished with a magnificence more suggestive of park lane than of hampstead the outward aspect of the house like that of mr hilliston was a lie her sitting room resembled the boudoir of some mayfair beauty the curtains were of silk the carpet velvet pile the walls were adorned with costly pictures and every corner of the small apartment was filled with sumptuous furniture all that art could contribute all that affection could suggest were confined in the tiny space and had mrs bezel possessed the mines of golconda she could not have been more luxuriously lodged the house was a gem of its kind perfect and splendid mrs bezel took little interest in these material comforts her life was passed between a couch in the bowwindow a wellcushioned chair by the fire and a downy bed in the next room she had little appetite and did not enjoy her food mental anxiety prevented her interesting herself in the splendors around her and the only pleasure she took was her dreary journey in a bathchair when the weather permitted then as she inhaled the fresh breeze blowing across the heath she gazed with longing eyes at london almost hidden under its foggy veil far below and always returned with reluctance to the familiar splendors of her narrow dwelling fortune had given her much but by way of compensation had deprived her of the two things she most desiredof health and of love even on this warm june evening a fire burned in the grate for mrs bezel was a chilly creature who shrunk at the least breath of wind according to custom she had left the window couch at seven oclock and had taken her simple meal while seated in her large chair to the right of the fireplace after dinner she took up a novel which was placed on a small table at her elbow and tried to read but her attention was not fixed on the book and gradually it fell from her hands while she gazed idly at the fire what she saw therein heaven only knows we all have our moments of retrospection and can picture the past in the burning coals some even picture the future but there was none for this woman she was old weary diseased wornout and therefore saw in the fire only the shadows of past years faces looked out of the flaming valleys scenes arranged themselves in the red confusion but among them all there was always one face one scene which never vanished as did the others this special face this particular scene were fixed immovable cruel and insistent the chime of the clock striking halfpast nine roused her from her reverie and she again addressed herself to the novel with a sigh tortured by her own thoughts mrs bezel was not accustomed to retire before midnight and there were nearly three hours to be got through before that time her life was as dreary and weary and heartbreaking as that of mariana in the moated grange the tread of a firm footfall in the distance roused her attention and she looked expectantly toward the door which faced her chair the newcomer passed up the narrow garden path entered the house and after a pause in the hall presented himself in the sitting room mrs bezel knew who it was before the door opened for standing on the threshold was the man with the face she had lately pictured amid the burning coals francis hilliston and the woman who called herself mrs bezel looked steadily at one another but no sign of welcome passed between them he was the first to break the awkward silence how are you this evening margaret he asked advancing toward her better i hope there is more color in your cheeks more brightness in your eyes i am the same as ever she replied coldly while he drew a chair close to the fire and stretched out his hands to the blaze why have you come here at this hour to see you no doubt but with what purpose hilliston pinched his nether lip between finger and thumb frowning the while at the fire whatever had been there was now no love between this woman and himself but on no occasion had he noted so hostile a tone in her voice he was aware that a duel of words and brains was about to ensue and knowing his antagonist he took the button off his foil there was no need for fine speaking or veiled hints in this conversation it was advisable that all should be plain and straightforward for they knew each other too well to wear their masks when alone under these circumstances he spoke the truth i think you can guess my errand he said suavely it concerns the letter you wrote to claude larcher i thought as much and what more have you to say in connection with that affair i have merely to inform you that the man whom you desire to see is in london and will no doubt answer your kind invitation in person mrs bezel stretched out her hand and selected a letter from the little pile on her table if you will look at that she said coldly you will see that claude intends to call on me at three oclock tomorrow taking the letter in silence hilliston turned frightfully pale and the perspiration stood in large beads on his forehead he expected some such appointment to be made yet the evidence in his hand startled him all the same the promptitude of action spoke volumes to one of his acute perceptions to defend his good name would require all his skill and experience for he had to do with men of action who acted as quickly as they thought the duel would be more equal than he had thought are you still determined to tell all he said in a low tone crushing the paper up in his hand yes the monosyllable was uttered in so icy a manner that hilliston lost his temper completely before this woman there was no need for him to retain his smiling mask and in a frenzy of rage he hurried into rapid speech frantic and unconsidered ah you would ruin me he cried springing to his feet you would drag up those follies of and make london too hot to hold me have i not implored threatened beseeched commandeddone everything in my power to make you hold your peace miserable woman would you drag the man you love down to the man i loved you mean responded mrs bezel in nowise moved by this torrent of abuse pray do not be theatrical francis you know me well enough to be aware that when my mind is made up i am not easily moved a man of your brains she added scornfully should know that loss of temper is but the prelude to defeat recognizing the truth of this remark hilliston resumed his seat and subdued his anger only the look of hatred in his eyes betrayed his real feelings otherwise he was calm suave and selfcontrolled have you weighed the cost of your action he demanded quietly yes it means ruin to us both but the loss is yours not mine helpless and deserted life has no further charms for me but you mr hilliston doubtless feel differently margaret he said entreatingly why do you speak like this what harm have i done you that what harm she interrupted fiercely have you not ruined me have you not deserted me have you not robbed me of all that i loved my life has been one long agony and you are to blame for it all not a word she continued imperiously i shall speak i insist upon your knowing the truth go on he said sullenly i listen i loved you once francis i loved you to my own cost for your sake i lost everythingposition home respect and love and youwhat did you do hilliston looked round the room and shrugged his shoulders look and gesture were so eloquent that she commented on them at once do you think i valued this splendor i know well enough that you gave me all material comforts but i wanted more than this i wanted love you had it aye i had the passion such as you call love did it endure you know well that it did not so long as i was healthy and handsome and bright your attentions continued but when i was reduced to this state ten years ago what did you do left me to marry another woman it was not my fault he muttered uneasily my affairs were involved and as my wife had money i was forced to marry her and you did marry her and no doubt neglect her as you do me is mrs hilliston any happier in her splendid house at kensington gore than i in this miserable cottage i think not i waited and waited hoping your love would return it did not so i took my own courserevenge and so wrote to claude larcher yes listen to me i wrote the first letter on the impulse of the moment i had been reading a book called a whim of fate which contained i know i know i read it myself this evening then you know that someone else is possessed of your secret who is john parver i dont know i intend to find out meanwhile i am waiting to hear the conclusion of your story mrs bezel drew a long breath and continued the book which contained an account of the tragedy at horriston brought the fact so visibly before me that i wrote on the impulse telling you that i wished to see claude and reveal all you came and implored and threatened then my impulse became a fixed determination i saw how i could punish you for your neglect and so persisted in my scheme i wrote to claude and he is coming here tomorrow what do you intend to tell him so much of the death of his father as i know you must notyou dare not said hilliston with dry lips it means ruin to you not to me impossible he said curtly our relations are too close for one to fall without the other so you think rejoined mrs bezel coolly but i know how to protect myself and of one thing you may be assured i will say nothing against you all i intend to do is to tell him of his fathers death he knows it already what yes did you think i was not going to be beforehand with you sneered hilliston triumphantly i guessed your intention when you wrote me that letter and when claude arrived in town i saw him before he could call here i did not intend to tell him of the matter till your action forced me to do so he has read all the papers in connection with his fathers death and intends to hunt down the murderer now do you see what you have done apparently the brutal plainness of this speech strongly affected mrs bezel it seemed as though she had not comprehended till that moment what might be the result of her actions now an abyss opened at her feet and she felt a qualm of fear nevertheless i intend to go on now that i have begun she said gloomily i will answer any questions claude may ask me you will put him in possession of a clew it is not improbable but as i said life has no charms for me you dont think of my sufferings said hilliston bitterly rising to his feet did you think of mine during all these lonely years she retorted with a sneer i shall punish you as you punished me there is such a thing as justice in this world well i warn you that i shall protect myself that is your lookout but i will show you this mercy as i said before that nothing will be told by me of your connection with this affair as to myself i will act as i think best you will tell him who you are yes i will tell him my real name then i am lost surely not she rejoined scornfully francis hilliston is old enough in villainy and experience to protect himself against a mere boy it is not claude i fear but his friend spenser tait he is the dangerous person but enough of this added hilliston striking the table imperiously i forbid you to indulge in these follies you know i have a means whereby to compel your obedience it is your possession of that means that has turned me against you she retorted dauntlessly if you give me back my margaret not a word more let things remain as they are i have said what i intend to do hilliston ground his teeth he knew that nothing he could say or do would shake the determination of this woman he had already experienced her resolute will and not even the means of which he spoke would shake her immovability there was nothing more but to retire and protect himself as best he could at all events she promised to remain neutral so far as he was concerned that was something gained before leaving the house however he made one final effort to force her to his will i will not give you any more money i dont care francis this cottage and its contents are settled on me a sale of this furniture will produce sufficient money to last my life i cant live long now i will deny all your statements do so i will have you declared insane and shut up in an asylum mrs bezel laughed scornfully and pointed toward the door if that is all you have to say you had better go she said jeeringly you know well enough that you cannot harm me without jeopardizing your own position they looked at one another fiercely each trying to outstare the other hillistons eyes were the first to fall and he hastily turned toward the door so be it he said with his hand on the knob you want war you shall have it see claude tell him all i can defend myself on leaving the house a few minutes later he paused irresolutely by the gate and looked back if i could only find the paper he muttered she could do nothing as it is he made a gesture of despair and plunged into the darkness chapter x a few facts connected with the case when the two young men left lincolns inn fields after the momentous interview with hilliston they walked on in silence for some distance each busied with his own thoughts like most solitaries tait had a habit of speaking aloud and unmindful of the presence of claude he stopped short at the gate of the new law courts to give vent to his feelings it is decidedly suspicious he said in a low tone and quite inexplicable what are you talking about asked claude irritably whereupon tait became aware that he was not alone but nevertheless showed no disposition to balk the question i was thinking of mr hilliston he returned quietly i am not at all satisfied with his conduct he is hostile to us claude hostile impossible he is doing all in his power to help us so it appears answered tait dryly nevertheless i think that he intends to thwart us in our plansif he can now you are talking nonsense said claude as they resumed their walk why he first brought the case under my notice and why because he wanted to be beforehand with mrs bezel if he had not told she would have done so and naturally enough he wished to be first in the field but i cant think ill of him protested larcher he has been a second father to me no doubt there is such a thing as remorse remorse you are mad not at all i am suspicious we will discuss mr hilliston later on when i will give you my reasons for speaking thus meanwhile he has decided to play a game against us nonsense he has no motive pardon me i think he has but what it is i am unable to sayas yet however he will make two moves in the game within the next twentyfour hours indeed said claude ironically perhaps you can tell me what those two moves will be certainly answered tait serenely as to the first he will call at my rooms to find out if we have gone to see mrs bezel tonight and why at your rooms because he thinks you are staying with me and moreover knowing that we are acting together he knows your movements will coincide with mine ah and the second move he will write you a letter asking you to stay with him at kensington gore i dont see what there is suspicious about that said claude petulantly i know you dont but it is my belief that he is afraid of your investigations in this case and wishes to keep you under his eye but good heavens man he advised me to pursue the matter on the contrary he advised you to let sleeping dogs lie so he did cried claude with a sudden recollection of the interview but why what harm can my investigations do to him ah that is a difficult question to answer said tait reflectingly to my mind they will show that hilliston was not the friend of your father he pretended to be but according to those papers he acted like a friend throughout yes according to those papers larcher faced round suddenly struck by the significance of the remark he was a clever young man but could not see clearly before him and honest himself was far from suspecting dishonesty in others instead of agreeing with tait in his estimate of hilliston he vehemently defended the lawyer you must not speak like that tait he said angrily mr hilliston is an honest man and has been like a father to me i owe all to him perhaps you do retorted tait significantly however we need not quarrel over the matter i am content to wait and will bet you five pounds that the inquiry is made tonight and the letter is sent tomorrow larcher did not accept the bet thus confidently offered but walked on stiffly with his head in the air he was seriously annoyed with tait for daring to cast an imputation on the character of a man to whom he owed all never could he bring himself to believe that hilliston intended him evil and deemed that the lawyer despite his manifest reluctance would help him by all the means in his power to discover the assassin nevertheless tait proved to be in the right as the two young men passed down the stairs on their way to the theaterwhence tait insisted on taking claude with a view of distracting his mindthey were met by the porter beg pardon sir addressing himself to tait but a gentleman called some time ago and asked for you and mr larcher who was he why did you not show him up he would not give his name sir and did not wish to come up he only asked if you had a box for the theater and when i said you had stalls drove off ah can you describe his appearance not very tall sir clean shaven with white hair and a red face looked like a country gentleman sir thank you that will do replied tait quietly and left the house with claude for a few minutes he enjoyed his companions astonishment at this proof of hillistons doubledealing and it was not till they were in the cab that he spoke well he said smiling was i not right when i said that he would make the first move you are right so far muttered claude who looked ill at ease but i cannot bring myself to suspect my guardian you want another proof perhaps well we will wait for your invitation to kensington gore claude shook his head and seemed so indisposed to talk that tait judged it wise to humor his silence the young mans thoughts were anything but pleasant he had been accustomed to look up to hilliston as the model of an english gentleman honest honorable upright and noble if then this suspicion of taits should prove correctand the last act of hilliston certainly gave color to itwhere was he to find honest and honorable men if hilliston proved false then claude felt he could no longer trust the human race still he fought against the supposition and secretly hoped that the second prophecy of his friend would not be fulfilled alas for his hopes at eleven the next morning while they were discussing the situation a letter was delivered to claude by special messenger it proved to be from hilliston and contained a warm invitation for larcher to take up his abode at the kensington gore house as you may only be in london for a short period my dear claude wrote his guardian my wife and i must see as much of you as possible with a bitter smile claude tossed the letter across to tait you see i was right said the latter for the second time after skimming the note mr hilliston is playing a double game he wishes to keep you under his eye thinking that as you trust him you will keep him informed as to your doings so that being forewarned he may be forearmed do you really think he is my enemy tait i am really not prepared to say replied the little man with some hesitation his behavior of yesterday struck me as suspicious he seemed unnecessarily agitated and moreover urged you not to see mrs bezel perhaps he thinks she will tell you too much taking all these facts into consideration i cannot help thinking that hilliston is asking you to his house for some motive in connection with our search but he showed me the papers i know that but as i told you yesterday it was hobsons choice with him if he hadnt imparted the information mrs bezel would have done so of two evils he chose the least and by showing you the papers proved to all outward appearance that he was your firm friend should you bring any charge against him he will meet it by the very argument you have just made use of good heavens groaned claude in despair is everybody as treacherous as you think him to be a good number of people are replied tait suavely a long residence in london does not strengthen ones belief in human nature it is a city of wild beastsof wolves and foxeswho rend and betray for the gaining of their own ends if hilliston is what i believe him to be we must do our best to baffle him and so you must continue to be his friend how can i if he wishes to betray me ah you are so unsophisticated claude said the hardened man of the world you betray your feelings too plainly in this city it is worse than madness to wear your heart on your sleeve if you are convinced that hilliston bears you ill i am not convinced i cant believe any man would be so base ah bah that is a want of experience retorted tait raising his eyebrows ill pick you out a dozen of my decent friends who are as base or baser than i believe them to be respectability is all a question of concealment nowadays and it must be confessed that your guardian wears his mask very prettily but do you think he is never mind what i think interrupted tait impatiently hilliston may turn out to be an angel after all but his conduct of yesterday and this morning appears to be suspicious and in dealing with the matters we have in hand it is as well to be careful keep your faith in hilliston if it assists you to continue the friendship he must suspect nothing do you then wish me to accept this invitation no why go into the lions den write and thank him anddecline i have no excuse indeed then i will provide you with one you are engaged to stay with me at thorston for a month by the end of that time you will know sufficient of hilliston to decide for yourself as to the wisdom of accepting or declining his invitation but if we go to thorston we cannot prosecute our inquiries yes we can i tell you that book which contains the story of your fathers murder also contains a description of thorston i recognize every scene well well repeated tait sharply cant you see the author of that book must either live at thorston or have stayed a few months there else he could not have described the village so accurately we must make inquiries about him there and should we be fortunate enough to discover him we must extract his secret what secret upon my word claude you are either stupid or cunning why find out where he got his material from that may put us on the right track now write to hilliston and then go up to hampstead and find out what mrs bezel has to say wont you come too said claude going to the writing desk no i have my own business to attend to is it connected with our enterprise i should think so it is my intention to call on the firm who published a whim of fate and find out all i can concerning the author when you return from mrs bezel we will compare notes and on what information we obtain will depend our future movements chapter xi a startling discovery in one of his novels balzac makes the pertinent remark that it is impossible for man to understand the heart of woman seeing that her creator himself does not understand it these are not the precise words but the sentiment is the same and who indeed can understand a womans heart who can aver that he has a complete comprehension of her character very young men lay claim to such knowledge but as they grow older and the vanity of youth gives way to the modesty begotten by experience they no longer pretend to such omniscience and humbly admit their inability to solve the riddle of femininity had the sphinx proposed such an enigma to oedipus he would not have been able to guess it and so meeting the fate of other victims would have deprived thebes of a king and sophicles of a tragedy yet if we bear in mind that women work rather from impulse than from motive we may arrive at some knowledge of the organ in question if a woman is impulsive and most women are she acts directly on those impulses and so startles men by paradoxical actions as a rule the male intellect has logical reasons wherefrom it deduces motives upon which to act not so with women they obey the impulse of the moment reckless of the consequence to themselves or to anyone else consequently it is impossible to foretell how a woman will act in a given circumstance but it may be asserted that she will obey the latest thought in her mind even from this point of view the feminine mind is still a riddle but one which is more capable of explanation for example mrs bezel read a whim of fate and thus after fiveandtwenty years the horriston tragedy was freshly impressed on her brain seized with remorse terrified by the memory of the crime she acting on the impulse wrote to hilliston stating that she intended to see claude larcher and reveal all the dismay of the lawyer at this mad proposal and his steady opposition thereto turned what was originally a mere whim into a fixed idea she saw a way of punishing the man for the withdrawal of his love ten years before when she lost her beauty and became paralyzed delighted at learning that she had still some power to wound him she persisted in her project and so wrote the letter to larcher which he received the day after his arrival in london to baffle hilliston and prevent him from intercepting the letter she was obliged to use all her wits and so hit on the idea of learning the name of the young mans club how she managed to obtain it is best known to herself but hilliston never dreaming of this pertinacity was unable to thwart her schemes and beyond writing to claude telling him to call could do nothing had he guessed that she would address her invitation to the club he might have called and obtained it in the character of larchers guardian but knowing her helpless condition the thought that it might be there never entered his mind so the letter arrived was duly answered and claude was coming today at three oclock to hear what mrs bezel had to say the visit though due to her own action was a source of considerable anxiety for she was not at all certain of what she would say it was impossible to tell all without inculpating hilliston and this for reasons of her own mrs bezel was unwilling to do all her talk of the previous night had been so much rodomontade to frighten the man she hated but she was too well aware of her dependent position to think of doing him an injury her impulse had led her into deep water as she knew instinctively she was a woman who had lived every moment of her life but now stretched on a bed of sickness she missed her former triumphs and excitements this visit promised a great deal of amusement and the use of much diplomacy therefore she was unwilling to abandon her plans at the same time she determined to give the young man as little information as she possibly could it would not be through her agency that the mask would be torn from hillistons face she was resolved on that point yet the matter starting originally from an impulse had now gone too far for her to draw back claude had seen the papers and therefrom must have guessed that she desired to impart certain information with regard to the crime which had cost him a father mrs bezel therefore compromised the matter and settled in her own mind to tell him half the truth or at all events only sufficient to interest him without aiding him had she been a man and had taken this decision all would have gone well but being a woman she reckoned without her impulse and it betrayed her moreover she had a revelation to make which would effectively tie larchers hands should he learn too much but this she did not intend to make unless driven into a corner she was in that corner before the interview was finished though she little expected to get there hilliston clever as he was could not understand her present actions she did not understand them herself else she would not have ventured to receive claude larcher he duly arrived at three oclock and mrs bezel glanced approvingly at his stalwart figure and handsome face claude had one of those sympathetic yet manly natures to which women are instinctively drawn by the law of sex and mrs bezel proved no exception to this rule she was too thoroughly a woman not to relish masculine society and despite her perplexity was glad she had sent the invitation if only for the sake of talking to this splendid looking young man there was another reason which she revealed in a moment of impulse but that was later on meanwhile claude seated by her couch in the window was wondering who she was and why she had sought this interview he was certainly aware that she had some information to impart concerning the fate of his parents but as he had not seen her name in the papers containing the account of the case he was at a loss to fix her identity his doubts were soon set at rest mrs bezel was a more prominent actor in the horriston tragedy than he had any idea of you were doubtless astonished to get my letter said mrs bezel when the first greetings were over especially as you do not remember your parents and my name is also unknown to you were you a friend of my parents madam asked claude too anxious for information to reply directly to her remark yes ii knew them that is i lived at horriston stammered mrs bezel passing a handkerchief across her dry lips you lived at horriston at the time of the murder mrs bezel nodded she was not yet sufficiently selfcontrolled for speech in that case continued claude eagerly you must know all the details of the crime only those that were reported in the papers still you must be acquainted with those concerned in the tragedy with my father with jeringham denis bantry with mona his sister yes said mrs bezel calmly i knew them all have you any idea who committed the crime not the slightest but you must have some suspicions oh yes but they may be wrong i believe that mr jeringham had something to do with it oh said claude remembering hillistons opinion some believe him to be guilty i cannot say for certain replied mrs bezel shaking her head the flight of mr jeringham certainly showed that he had something to conceal what kind of a man was mr jeringham tall and fair amiable as a rule but liable to violent passions was he not in love with my mother before she married my father mrs bezel turned away her head and the color rose to her face the nervous movement of her hands plucking at her dress showed how profoundly she was moved by this question i believe so but shemrs larcher loved her husband then why was my father jealous of jeringham said claude who could not reconcile this statement with the evidence given at the trial how should i know cried mrs bezel turning on him with sudden passion if george larcher had not been so blinded by jealousy he would have seen that there was nothing between them your mother knew jeringham all his life they were like brother and sister it is true he wished to marry her but when he saw that her heart was given to your father he bowed to her decision he came to horriston as her friend not as her lover but he was constantly with her do you dare to speak thus of your mother sir ii cannot help doing so stammered claude startled by the anger in her voice god knows i wish to revere the memory of my mother but i cannot help seeing that she was morally responsible for the tragedy she was not she was not said mrs bezel vehemently how dare you speak thus your father neglected her he left her to the companionship of mark jeringham while he indulged in his predilection for literary work all day long he shut himself up in his study and let his wife sit alone and miserable was it any wonder then that she should turn to her old friend for consolation there was nothing between themnothing to which any pharisee could have taken exception but surely my father was sufficiently sensible to see all this he saw nothing or what he did see was distorted by his jealousy the police in their endeavors to fix the crime on your mother took the same view of the relations between her and jeringham oh i know what you read in those papers shown to you by mr hilliston so surprised was claude by this unexpected introduction of his guardians name that he could not suppress a start how do you know that mr hilliston showed me the papers mrs bezel saw that she had said too much but unable to go back on her words rapidly resolved to make that revelation which she had hitherto intended to keep as a last resource mr hilliston told me that he had done so do you know him yes said mrs bezel seizing her opportunity to lead up to the revelation i know him as the best and kindest of men i know him as one who has been a good friend to youorphan as you thought yourself orphan as i thought myself muttered claude turning pale is it not trueam i not an orphan no great heavens what is this you tell me my father your father is dead he was murdered as you know then my mother mrs bezel looked at the agonized face of the young man and covered her own with a quick indrawn breath she lives my mother she lives are you mad she died in london shortly after her acquittal so it was supposed but it was not true could you expect that unhappy woman to face the scorn and contempt of the world after having been accused of her husbands murder she did not die save to the world she fled from society and sought refuge herehere where she lies a helpless invalid mrs bezel i am not mrs bezel i am your mother god my mother chapter xii revelations it was only natural that a silence should ensue between these two so strangely brought together claude seated pale and anguished in his chair tried to collect his thoughts and stared wildly at his mother she with her face buried in the cushions sobbed bitterly after the way in which her son had spoken it was cruel that she should have been forced to make such a revelation at such a moment he condemned he reproached her conduct in the past and she again tasted the full bitterness of the cup which had been held to her lips twentyfive years before on his part claude did not know what to say he hardly knew what to think convinced by a perusal of the papers that his mother was morally guilty of his fathers death he was overwhelmed to find that she was still alive and capable for all he knew of offering a defense for her share in the tragedy after all he had no right to judge her until he heard what she had to say blood is thicker than water and she was his mother now he saw the reason why hilliston objected to his calling at hampstead why he advised him to let sleeping dogs lie after so long a period it was worse than useless to bring mother and son together their thoughts their aims their lives were entirely diverse and only pain could be caused by such a meeting claude silently acknowledged the wisdom of hillistons judgment but at the same time could hardly refrain from condemning him for having kept him so long in ignorance of the truth mrs bezelas we must still continue to call herwas astonished at this long silence but raised her head to cast a timid glance at claude his brow was gloomy his lips were firmly set and he looked anything but overjoyed at the revelation which she had made guessing his thoughts the unhappy woman made a gesture of despair and spoke in a low voice broken by sobs you too condemn me no mother he replied and mrs bezel winced as she heard him acknowledge the relationship i do not condemn you i have heard one side of the question i must now hear the otherfrom you what more can i tell you than what you already know she said drying her eyes i must know the reason why you let me think you dead all these years it was by my own wish and by the advice of mr hilliston claude bit his lip at the mention of this name and cast a hasty glance round the splendidly furnished room a frightful suspicion had entered his mind but she was his mother and he did not dare to give it utterance his mother guessed his thoughts and spared him the pain of speaking with a womanly disregard for the truth she promptly lied concerning the relationship which her son suspected to exist between his guardian and herself you need not look so black claude and think ill of me i am unfortunate but not guilty all that you see here is mine purchased by my own money your own money replied claude heaving a sigh of relief yes mr hilliston who has been a good friend to me saved sufficient out of my marriage settlement to enable me to furnish this cottage and live comfortably it is just as well added she bitterly else i might have died on the streets but why did you let hilliston bring me up to think i was an orphan i did not wish to shadow your life i did not wish you to change your name i had to change mine and retire from the world but that was part of my punishment still if it was impossible i tell you claude interrupted his mother impatiently when you grew up you would have asked questions and then i would have been forced to tell you all yet in spite of your precautions i do know all if you took all this trouble to hide the truth why reveal it to me now mrs bezel pointed to three books lying on an adjacent table claude quite understood what she meant i see he remarked before she could speak you think that the author of that book knows about my fathers murder i am certain he does but what he knows or how he knows i cannot say still i am certain of one thing that he tells the story from hearsay what makes you think that it would take too long to tell you my reasons it is sufficient to state that the fictitious case differs from the real case in several important particulars for instance she added with a derisive smile the guilty person is said to be michael dene and he is is drawn from mr hilliston how do you know that she asked with a startled air claude shrugged his shoulders i have eyes to read and brains to comprehend he said quietly there is no doubt in my mind that the lawyer of the fiction is meant for the lawyer of real life otherwise i think the writer drew on his imagination it was necessary for him to end his story by fixing on one of the characters as a criminal and owing to the exigencies of the plot as developed by himself he chose michael dene otherwise mr hilliston as the murderer but you dont think oh no i dont think mr hilliston is guilty i read the trial very carefully and moreover i do not see what motive he could have to commit the crime the motive of michael dene is love for the murdered mans wife in other words the author assumes that hilliston loved you said claude coolly but i have your assurance that such is not the case you speak to me like that cried mrs bezel angrily to your mother larchers expression did not change he turned a trifle paler and compressed his lips firmly otherwise he gave no outward sign of his emotion knowing so much of the case as he did he could not look on this woman in the light of a mother she had indirectly contributed to his fathers death she had deserted him for twentyfive years and now that she claimed his filial reverence he was unwilling to yield it to her perhaps he was unjust and harsh to think this but the natural tie between them was so weakened by time and ignorance that he could find no affection in his heart to bestow on her to him she was a strangernothing more let us understand each other he said coldly that you are my mother is no doubt true but i ask you if you have performed your maternal duties you obliterated yourself from my life you left me to be brought up by strangers in all ways you only consulted your own desires can you then expect me to yield you that filial obedience which every mother has a right to expect from her son if you enough sir said mrs bezel white with anger say no more i understand you only too well and now regret that i sought this interview which has resulted so ill i hoped that you would be glad to find your mother still alive that you would cherish her in her affliction i see i was wrong you are as cold and bitter as was your father my father yes do you think that all the wrong was on my side had i nothing to forgive him ah i see by your face that you know to what i allude it was your father and my husband who betrayed me for mona bantry you have no proof of that said claude in a low voice i have every proof the girl told me with her own lips i returned from that ball at three oclock in the morning and mr jeringham left me at the door i entered the house alone and proceeded to my sitting room there i found mona andmy husband ah he did return from london on that night yes he returned thinking i was out of the way in order to see his mistress in his presence she confessed her guilt i looked to him for denial and he hung his head then hardly knowing what i did overcome with rage i snatched the dagger which i wore as part of my costume and and killed him shrieked claude springing to his feet for heavens sake do not confess this to me why not i did no wrong i did not kill him i fainted before i could cross the room to where he stood when i recovered i was alone my husband and mona bantry had disappeared then i retired to bed and was ill for days i know no more of the case is this true asked claude anxiously why should it not be true do you think i would invent a story like that to asperse the memory of your father vilely as he treated me i loved him i do not know who killed him the dagger i wore disappeared with him it was found in the garden his body in the river four miles down but i declare to you solemnly that i am ignorant of whose hand struck the blow it might have been mona or jeringham or or hilliston you are wrong there replied his mother coolly or else your judgment has been perverted by that book mr hilliston was still at the ball when the tragedy occurred his evidence at the trial proved that dont say a word against him he has been a good friend to youand to me i do not deny that you cannot when i was arrested and tried for a crime which i never committed he stood by me when i left the court alone and friendless he stood by me i decided to feign death to escape the obloquy which attaches to every suspected criminal he found me this refuge and installed me here as mrs bezel he took charge of you and brought you up and looked after your money and mine dont you dare to speak against him exhausted by the fury with which she had spoken the unfortunate woman leaned back in her chair claude already regretting his harshness brought a glass of water which he placed to her lips after a few minutes she revived and feebly waved him away but he was not to be so easily dismissed i am sorry i spoke as i did mother he said tenderly arranging her pillows now that i have heard your story i see that you have suffered greatly it is not my right to reproach you no doubt you acted for the best therefore i do not say a word against you or mr hilliston but ask you to forgive me the tears were rolling down mrs bezels cheeks as he spoke thus and without uttering a word she put her hand in his in token of forgiveness claude pressed his lip to her faded cheek and thus reconciledas much as was possible under the circumstancesthey began to talk of the case what do you intend to do asked mrs bezel weakly find out who killed my father it is impossibleafter fiveandtwenty years i have told you all i know and you see i cannot help you i do not know whom to suspect you surely have some suspicion mother no i have no suspicions whomsoever killed your father took the dagger out of my sitting room perhaps mona i think not she had no reason to kill him he had wronged her and me cried mrs bezel vehemently do not talk any more of these things claude i know nothing more i can tell you nothing more then i must try and find john parver and learn how he became acquainted with the story that is why i sent for you why i revealed myself why i told you all i have suffered find john parver and tell me who he is what he is this claude promised to do and as his mother was worn out by the long conversation he shortly afterward took his leave as he descended fitzjohns avenue a thought flashed into his mind as to the identity of john parver i wonder if john parver is mark jeringham said claude the question was to be answered on that very evening chapter xiii on the track it was nearly six oclock when claude returned to earls street and tait already dressed for the evening was waiting his arrival with considerable impatience his usual imperturbability had given place to a selfsatisfied air as though he had succeeded in accomplishing a difficult undertaking he uttered a joyful exclamation when he saw claude enter but a look of apprehension passed over his face when he noted the altered appearance of his friend what is wrong he asked as claude threw himself into a chair with a sigh of fatigue do you bring bad news my dear fellow you are completely worn out here dormer a glass of sherry for mr larcher the servant who was putting the finishing touches to the dinnertable speedily obeyed this order and tait made his friend drink the wine without delay then he proceeded to question him regarding the reason of his pallor but with his usual caution first sent dormer out of the room only when they were alone did he venture to speak on the subject about which both were thinking well he demanded anxiously you saw mrs bezel yes i was with her for two hours ah said tait with great satisfaction she must have told you a good deal in that time she did she told me more than i expected did it concern your parents it did good then you no doubt heard her version of the crime yes these unsatisfactory replies which dropped so strangely from larchers lips at once puzzled and irritated the questioner you dont seem anxious to confide in me he said in a piqued tone i will tell you all i am anxious to tell you all replied larcher finding his tongue but i do not know how to begin oh i shall save you that trouble by asking you questions in the first place who is mrs bezel my mother tait bounded from his chair with an expression of incredulity this unexpected information so abruptly conveyed was too much for his selfcontrol your mother he stammered hardly thinking he had heard aright are you in earnest i cannot believe it according to the notice in the newspapers according to hilliston your mother died in london in she did not die her death was a feigned one to escape the notoriety gained by her trial at canterbury did mr hilliston know she was alive yes it was by his advice that she changed her name oh oh said tait with marked significance hilliston knew hilliston advised humph john parver may be right after all tait be silent you are speaking of my mother i beg your pardon my dear fellow but i really do not understand you will shortly i will tell you the story of my mothers troubles and hillistons kindness hillistons kindness repeated tait in a skeptical tone nevertheless he resumed his seat and signified his willingness to hear the narrative the wine had done claude good and restored his selfpossession so now master of himself he related all that had passed between himself and mrs bezel gifted with a retentive memory and no mean powers as a narrator he succeeded in giving tait a vivid impression of the conversation the little man with his head slightly on one side like a brighteyed sparrow listened attentively and not till the story was finished did he make an observation thereon to this capability of listening without interruption tait owed a great deal of his popularity truth is stranger than fiction after all said he when claude ended and the novel is less dramatic than the episode of real life john parver did not dare to insinuate that the supposed dead widow of the murdered man was alive humph this complicates matters more than ever at least it clears the character of hilliston yes assented tait doubtfully i suppose it does can you doubt it said larcher dissatisfied with this grudging consent you can now see why hilliston was agitated at our interview why he asked me not to see mrs bezel socalled why he called here the same evening to find out if i had gone and finally why he wished to prepare me before seeing her by telling of the tragedy oh i see all that said tait quietly nine men out of ten would consider hilliston a most disinterested person but i am the tenth man and am therefore skeptical of his motive but what motive can he have for that is just it interrupted tait vivaciously i cant see his motive but i will find it out some day well you can speak for yourself said claude frowning after what my mother has told me i believe hilliston to be an upright and honorable man you are quite right to do so on the evidence still if i were you i would not keep him informed of all our movements unlessdo you intend to go on with the matter he asked abruptly assuredly i am determined to find out who killed my father tait walked to the fireplace and took up his position on the hearthrug an idea had entered his mind which he did not intend to put into words nevertheless it was indirectly the reason for his next speech i think after all it would be best to take hillistons advice and let sleeping dogs lie he had not calculated the effect of these words on his hearer for claude also arose from his chair and looked at him with angry surprise i dont understand you he said coldly some hours back and you were more eager than i to pursue this unknown criminal now you wish to withdraw may i ask the reason of this sudden change it seems to be useless to hope to find the assassin replied tait shrugging his shoulders one cannot discover a needle in a haystack oh yes you canby patient research well even that would be easier than to hope to solve a mystery which has been impenetrable for fiveandtwenty years it has been impenetrable for that time because no one has tried to solve it this is not your real reason for wishing to end the case what is your reason speak i insist upon knowing the truth the other did not reply but thrust his hands deeper into his pockets and maintained a masterly silence irritated by this negative attitude claude placed his hands on the little mans shoulders and looked at him indignantly i know what your reason is tait he said rapidly it is not that you fear we may learn too little but that you expect we will learn too much yes replied tait simply that is the reason is it not an allsufficient one for you to pause no shouted claude savagely it is allsufficient for me to go on you think that i may discover that hilliston is the criminal or learn that my mother is accountable for the crime i tell you no such thing will happen hilliston was not near the laurels on the fatal morning my motheri have told you how she exonerated herself and the exoneration was substantiated by denis bantry both are innocent it may be so but who is guilty jeringham i believe that he discovered that my father had returned and perhaps knowing of this intrigue between him and mona bantry remained at the laurels unknown to my mother in order to assist her as a friend how did jeringham obtain possession of the dagger i cannot say we must find out but he did obtain possession of the dagger and during a quarrel with my father killed him with it he fled to avoid the consequences oh yes i swear that jeringham is guilty but i will hunt him down if i have to do it alone you will not do it alone said tait quietly i am with you still but you said i know what i said i think it is best to leave well alone but since you are set on learning the truth i will help you to the best of my ability only added tait explicitly should you discover the truth to be unpalatable do not blame me i wont blame you i am certain that you will find that i am right and that hilliston and my mother had nothing to do with the affair help me that is all i ask i will bear the consequences very good then we had better get to work said tait dryly just go and dress my dear fellow or youll keep dinner waiting why should i dress i am not going out tonight indeed you are we are due at mrs durhams at home at ten oclock i shant go i am in no mood for frivolity i would rather stay at home and think over the case it is only by hard work that we can hope to learn the truth very true at the same time it is necessary for you to go out tonight if only to meet with john parver the author of a whim of fate asked claude eagerly is he in town yes and he will be at mrs durhams tonight we must see him and find out where he obtained the materials for his novel do you think such information will lead to any result asked claude dubiously i dont think i am sure of it retorted tait impatiently now go and dress larcher departed without a word chapter xiv the upper bohemia the name bohemia is suggestive of unknown talent starving in garrets of obdurate landladies of bacchanalian nights and shabby dress murger first invested the name with this flavor and since his time the word has become polarized and indicates nothing but struggling humanity and unappreciated genius yet your true bohemian does not leave his country when he becomes rich and famous it is true that he descends from the garret to the first floor that he fares well and dresses decently but he still dwells in bohemia the reckless air of the hovels permeates the palaces of this elastic kingdom of fancy mrs durham was a bohemian and every thursday received her confreres in the drawing room of a very elegant mansion in chelsea she had written a novel i cling to thee with might and main and this having met with a moderate success she posed as a celebrity and set up her salon on the lines of lady blessington everyone who was anyone was received at her at homes and by this process she gathered together a queer set of people some were clever others were not some were respectable others decidedly disreputable but one and allto use an expression usually connected with crimehad done something novelists essayists painters poets and musicians were all to be found in her rooms and a more motley collection could be seen nowhere else in london someone dubbed the chelsea mansions the zoo and certainly animals of all kinds were to be found there from monkeys to peacocks it was considered rather the thing to be invited to the zoo so when brothers and sisters of the pen met one another there they usually said what are you here as though the place were heaven and the speaker justifiably surprised that anyone should be saved except himself or herself literary people love one another a degree less than christians hither came tait and claude in search of john parver that young man had made a great success with his novel and was consequently much sought after by lion hunters however tait had learned that he was to be present at mrs durhams on this special evening and hoped to engage him in conversation so as to learn where he had obtained the materials for his story when they arrived the rooms were quite full and mrs durham received them very graciously it was true that they were not famous still as tait was a society man and claude very handsome the lady of the house goodhumoredly pardoned all mental deficiencies tait knew her very well having met her at several houses but she addressed herself rather to claude than to his friend having a feminine appreciation of good looks my rooms are always crowded said she with that colossal egotism which distinguished her utterances you know they call me the new george eliot no doubt you deserve the name replied claude with mimic gravity oh i suppose so smirked the lady amiably you have read my novel of course it is now in its fourth edition and has been refused by smith and mudie i follow the french school of speaking my mind and a very nasty mind it must be thought larcher who had been informed about the book by tait he did not however give this thought utterance but endeavored to generalize the conversation you have many celebrities here tonight i presume my dear sir exclaimed mrs durham in capitals every individual in this company is famous yonder is mr padsop the great traveler who wrote mosques and mosquitoes he is talking to miss pexworth the writer of those scathing articles in the penny trumpet entitled man the brute she is a modern woman oh indeed said claude equably and looked at this latest production of the nineteenth century she is rather masculine in appearance it is her pride to be so mr larcher she is more masculine than man that is her brother who designs ladies dresses and decorates dinner tables ah he isnt masculine i suppose nature wanted to preserve the balance in the family the law of compensation eh oh you are severe tommy pexworth is a dear little creature and so fond of chiffons he knows more about womens dress than his sister so i should think replied claude dryly he took an instant and violent dislike to mr pexworth who was one of those feminine little creatures only distinguished from the other sex by wearing trousers a charming pair he added smiling i dont know which i admire the most the sister who is such a thorough gentlemen or the brother who is a perfect lady you are satirical smiled mrs durham enjoying this hit at her friends now you must take me down to have some refreshment really you must thus inspired claude elbowed the hostess through the crush and escorted her to a bare counter in the dining room whereon were displayed thin bread and butter very weak tea and fossil buns mrs durham evidently knew her own refreshments too well to partake of them for she had a mild brandy and soda produced from its hiding place by a confidential waiter she asked claude to join her but he refused on the plea that he never drank between meals but you are not a brainworker said mrs durham hurriedly finishing her brandy and soda lest her guests should see it and become discontented with the weak tea if i did not keep myself up i should die ah why here is mr hilliston hilliston said claude astonished at seeing his guardian in this house yes do you know him a dear creatureso clever he was my solicitor in a libel action against the penny trumpet for saying that i was an ungrammatical scribbler just fancy and they call me the new george eliot we lost our case im sorry to say judges are such brutes miss pexworth says they are ever since she failed to get damages for her breach of promise case here comes mr hilliston said larcher rather tired of this longtongued lady i know him very well he is my guardian how very delightful said mrs durham with the accent on the very oh mr hilliston she continued as the lawyer approached we were just talking about you i trust the absent were right for once replied hilliston with an artificial smile and a swift glance at claude i have just come to say goodby oh not yet surely not yet really babbled mrs durham with shallow enthusiasm then finding hilliston was resolved to go and catching sight of a newly arrived celebrity she hastened after the amiable fashion of her kind to speed the parting guest well if you must you must goodby goodby excuse me i see mr rawler a delightful manwrites plays you know the new shakspere yes and thus talking she melted away with a babble of words leaving hilliston and his ward alone they were mutually surprised to see one another claude because he knew his guardian did not affect bohemianism and hilliston because he thought that the young man had left town the meeting was hardly a pleasant one as hilliston dreaded lest mrs bezel should have said too much and so prejudiced claude against him i understood from your refusal of my invitation that you had gone to thorston with tait said he after a pause i am going tomorrow or the next day replied claude quickly but in any event i intended to call on you before i left town indeed said hilliston nervously you have something to tell me yes i have seen mrs bezel good you have seen mrs bezel and i have made a discovery oh has the lady informed you who committed the crime no but she told me her name margaret bezel murmured hilliston wondering what was coming not margaret bezel but julia larcher my mother sheshe told you that gasped hilliston his selfcontrol deserting him for the moment yes i know why she feigned death i know how you have protected her you have been a kind friend to me mr hilliston and to my mother i am doubly in your debt hilliston took the hand held out to him by claude and pressed it cordially the speech relieved him from all apprehension he now knew that mrs bezel had kept their secret and immediately took advantage of the restored confidence of claude his quick wit grasped the situation at once my dear fellow he said with much emotion i loved your poor father too much not to do what i could for his widow and son i hope you do not blame me for suppressing the truth no i suppose you acted for the best still i would rather you had informed me that my mother was still alive to what end it would only have made you miserable i did not want to reveal anything but your mother insisted that you should be made acquainted with the past and soi gave you the papers i am glad you did so and now what do you intend to do asked hilliston slowly you know as much as i do is there any clew to guide you in the discovery that your mother still lives no she can tell me nothing but i hope to find the clew here ah you intend to speak with john parver i do said claude rather surprised at this penetration do you know him i exchanged a few words with him replied hilliston carelessly i only came here tonight at the request of mrs durham who is a client of mine as i paid my respects to her she was talking to john parver and he was introduced to me as the latest lion so you still intend to pursue the matter added hilliston after a pause assuredly if only to clear my mother and restore her to the world i am afraid it is too late claude you know she is ill and cannot live long nevertheless i wish her to take her own name again she will not do so until the assassin of her husbandof my fatheris discovered so you see it is obligatory on me to find out the truth i trust you may be successful said hilliston sighing but my advice is still the same and it would be best for you to let the matter rest after fiveandtwenty years you can discover nothing i cannot help you your mother cannot help you so but john parver may interrupted larcher sharply i will see how he learned the details of the case before hilliston could make further objection tait joined them and not noticing the lawyer hastily took claude by the arm i have been looking for you everywhere said he come and be introduced to mr linton who is mr linton john parver he writes under that name ah mr hilliston i did not see you how do you do sir i am quite well mr tait and am just taking my departure replied hilliston easily i see you are both set on finding out the truth but you will learn nothing from john parver why not mr hilliston because he knows nothing goodnight claudegoodnight mr tait when hilliston disappeared tait looked at claude with a singular expression and scratched his chin you see said he quietly mr hilliston has been making inquiries on his own account you are incurably suspicious said claude impatiently hilliston is my friend yes he was your fathers friend also i believe what do you mean nothing nothing come and crossexamine frank linton alias john parver clearly tait was by no means so satisfied with hilliston as claude chapter xv a popular author bearing in mind that the character of hilliston had been rehabilitated by mrs bezel it was natural that claude should feel somewhat annoyed at the persistent mistrust manifested toward that gentleman by tait however he had no time to explain or expostulate at the present moment and moreover as he knew that the little man was assisting him in this difficult case out of pure friendship he did not deem it politic to comment on what was assuredly an unfounded prejudice tait was singular in his judgments stubborn in his opinions so claude unwilling to risk the loss of his coadjutor wisely held his peace his astute companion guessed these thoughts for in place of further remarking on the inexplicable presence of hilliston he turned the conversation toward the man they were about to see queer thing isnt it he said as they ascended the stairs linton is the son of the vicar of thorston ah that no doubt accounts for his intimate knowledge of the locality do you know him of course i doas frank linton but i had no idea that he was john parver why did he assume a nom de plume tait shrugged his shoulders paternal prejudice i believe he said carelessly mr linton does not approve of sensational novels and moreover wishes his son to be a lawyer not a literary man young frank is in a solicitors office in lincolns inn fields and he employed his evenings in writing a whim of fate he published it under the name of john parver so as to hoodwink his father but now that he has scored a success i have no doubt he will confess do you think we will learn anything from him we will learn all we wish to know as to where he obtained his material the young mans head is turned and by playing on his vanity we may find out the truth his vanity may lead him to conceal the fact that he took the plot from real life i dont think so i know the boy well and he is a great babbler no one is more astonished than i at learning that he is the celebrated john parver i didnt think he had the brains to produce so clever a book it is clever assented claude absently of course it is much cleverer than its author retorted tait dryly or rather i should say its supposed author for i verily believed jenny paynton helped him to write the book who is jenny paynton a very nice girl who lives at thorston she is twice as clever as this lad and they are both great on literary matters but ill tell you all about this later on for here is linton the celebrated author was a lighthaired lightcomplexioned young man of sixandtwenty with bowed shoulders a selfsatisfied smile and a pince nez which he used at times to emphasize his remarks he evidently possessed conceit sufficient to stock a dozen ordinary men and lisped out the newest ideas of the day as promulgated by his college for he was an oxford man although he was still in his salad days he had settled to his own satisfaction all the questions of life and therefore adopted a calm superiority which was peculiarly exasperating claude liberalminded but hotblooded had not been five minutes in his company before he was seized with a wild desire to throw him out of the window frank linton inspired that uncharitable feeling in many people for the moment mr linton was alone as his latest worshiper a rawboned female of the cabhorse species had just departed with a fat little painter in quest of refreshment therefore when he turned to greet claude he was quite prepared to assume that fatigued selfconscious air with which he thought fit to welcome new votaries linton this is mr larcher said tait abruptly claude you see before you the lion of the season it is very good of you to say so mr tait simpered the lion in no wise disclaiming the compliment i am pleased to make your acquaintance mr larcher and i yours mr linton or shall i say mr parver oh either name will answer said the author loftily though in town i am known as parver only and in thorston as linton interpolated tait smartly then your father does not yet know what a celebrated son he has not yet mr tait i intend to tell him next week i go down to thorston for that purpose ah my friend and i will no doubt meet you there we also seek rural felicity for a month but now that you have taken london by storm i suppose you intend to forsake the law for the profits of course i do replied linton quickly i never cared for the law and only went into it to please my father and now you go into literature to please miss paynton linton blushed at this home thrust and being readier with the pen than the tongue did not know what answer to make pitying his confusion and anxious to arrive at the main object of the interview claude interpolated a remark bearing thereon did you find it difficult to work out the plot of your novel mr linton he said with assumed carelessness oh not at all the construction of a plot is second nature with me i suppose you and miss paynton talked it over together said tait artfully well yes answered linton again falling into confusion i found her a good listener i presume it was all new to her i think so of course she gave me some hints evidently linton was determined to admit nothing so seeing that taits attack was thus repulsed claude brought up his reserve forces i saw in a paper the other day that your book was an impossible onethat nothing analogous to its story ever happened in real life several critics have said that replied linton growing angry and thereby losing his caution but they are wrong as i could prove did i choose to do so what said claude in feigned astonishment did you take the incident from real life the tale is founded on an incident from real life answered linton flushing that is miss paynton told me of a certain crime which was actually committed and on her hint i worked out the story oh miss paynton told you said tait smoothly and where did she see the account of this crime ah that i cannot tell you replied linton frankly she related the history of this crime and refused to let me know whence she obtained it i thought the idea a good one and so wrote the novel why dont you tell this to the world and so confound the critics i do i have told several people for instance i told a gentleman about it this very evening just because he made the same remark as mr larcher did tait drew a long breath and stole a look at claude that young man had changed color and gave utterance to the first idea that entered his mind was it mr hilliston who made the remark hilliston hilliston said linton thoughtfully yes i believe that was the man a tall old gentleman very freshcolored he was greatly interested in my literary work who could help being interested in so clever a book said claude in a meaning tone but mr hilliston is a lawyer and i suppose you do not like members of that profession now why should you say that demanded linton rather taken aback by this perspicacity well for one thing you admit a dislike for the law and for another you make michael dene the solicitor commit the crime in a whim of fate oh i only did that as he was the least likely person to be suspected said the author easily jennythat is miss payntonwanted me to make markham commit the crime markham is jeringham murmured tait under his breath who committed the crime in the actual case he added aloud no one knows answered linton shrugging his shoulders the case as related to me was a mystery i solved it after my own fashion in the third volume you trace the assassin by means of a breastpin belonging to michael dene said claude again in favor is that fact or fiction fiction miss paynton invented the idea she said that as the dagger inculpated the woman the breastpin found on the banks of the river would lead to the detection of the man and as i worked it out the idea was a good one ah murmured tait to himself i wonder if mr hilliston had anything to do with a breastpin by this time linton was growing rather restive under examination as he was by no means pleased at having to acknowledge his indebtedness to a womans wit seeing this tait abruptly closed the conversation so as to avoid waking the suspicions of linton a very interesting conversation he said heartily i like to get behind the scenes and see the working of a novelists brain we will say goodby now linton and i hope you will call at the manor house next week when we will all three be at thorston delighted im sure replied the author and thereupon melted into the crowd leaving claude and tait looking at one another well said the former after a pause we have not learned much on the contrary i think we have learned a great deal said tait raising his eyebrows we know that linton got the whole story from jenny paynton and that mr hilliston is in possession of the knowledge what use can it be to him he will try and frustrate us with miss paynton as he did mrs bezel with you do you still doubt him asked claude angrily yes replied tait coolly i still doubt him chapter xvi a false move the next day the two young men repaired to the club for the purpose of having luncheon and discussing their plans contrary to the wish of claude his friend did not deem it advisable to at once depart for thorston as he wished to remain in town for a few days on business connected with hilliston you see you are quite in the dark regarding that gentleman said tait as they lighted their cigarettes after dinner and before we commence operations at thorston it will be advisable to know that he is not counteracting our efforts in that case you had better go down to thorston and i will remain in town so as to keep an eye on hilliston i dont think that will be necessary replied tait reflectively it is more than probable that hilliston will visit thorston for what purpose cant you guess last night he learned from linton that jenny paynton supplied the material for that novel consequently he will see her and if possible find out where she heard the story yes i suppose he will said claude thoughtfully by the way who is miss paynton who now seems to be mixed up in the matter she is the daughter of an old recluse called ferdinand paynton a recluse humph thats strange why so you would not say so if you saw the old man he is an invalid and lives in his library a charming companion though i must say he is rather sad where does he live at thorston half a mile from the manor house not very rich i should think his cottage is small like his income and his daughter lives with him yes a pretty girl she is who inherits his literary tastes it is my impression that she wrote the most part of that novel from all i know of frank linton he is given more to poetry than to prose jenny has the brain not frank ho ho said claude smiling is it the skeptical misogynistic tait i hear speaking himself i admit that i do not care for women as a rule but there are exceptions to every rule and in this case jenny paynton is the exception is she in love with our author no but i rather think he is in love with her as you will be when you see her i what are you talking about tait i have more to do than to fall in love with country wenches however pretty jenny is not a country wench said tait with some displeasure she is a highly educated young woman worse and worse i hate highly educated bluestockings you wont hate jenny at all events especially as it is probable you will see a great deal of her no i shall keep away from her said claude doggedly thats impossible we must maneuver to get at the truth by asking her straight out she certainly will not gratify our curiosity we must plot and plan and take her unawares she is not a fool like linton remember what do you call a lion of the season by so opprobrious a name i do replied tait serenely because i dont believe he wrote the book well well never mind linton we have pumped him dry the next thing is to tackle the fair jenny how do you intend to set about it i cant say at present we must be guided by circumstances i will introduce you to the rector and to mr paynton there will be musical parties and lawn tennis fetes so in some way or another we may find out the truth does anyone else live with paynton his wife for instance no his wife died before he came to thorston where he has been for a long time an old servant called kerry lives with him man or woman man a queer old fellow rather morose hm a flattering description by the way he bears the same name as the ancient retainer in boucicaults play why shouldnt he it may be an assumed name tait threw a surprised glance at his friend and laughed quickly who is suspicious now said he smiling you blame me for suspecting hilliston yet here you are doubtful of people whom you have never seen before larcher could answer this home thrust a waiter entered with a letter for him which had just arrived from hilliston said claude recognizing the writing i wonder what he has to say its only another move in the game murmured tait then as claude after glancing at the letter uttered an ejaculation of surprise he added what is the matter hilliston is going down to eastbourne impossible cried tait holding out his hand for the letter he is surely not so clumsy as to show his hand so plainly he does though read the letter yourself my dear claude wrote hilliston mrs hilliston has decided to leave town for eastbourne this week so it is probable we will see you and mr tait down there if you can spare the time come to dinner at halfpast seven tonight and tell me how you are getting on with your case yours very sincerely francis hilliston well said claude as tait silently returned the letter what do you think i think that hilliston intends to look up jenny paynton i can see that replied claude impatiently but touching this invitation to dinner accept but i promised to see my mother tonight and tell her about john parver she will expect me as i have written i will take your apologies to her said tait quietly you yes listen to me claude continued the little man in a tone of suppressed excitement you will keep your belief in hilliston i tell you he is your enemy and wishes you to leave this case alone tonight he will make one last attempt to dissuade you if he succeeds he will not go to eastbourne if he fails you can depend on it he will try and see jenny before we do now to thwart his aims we will go down to thorston by an early train tomorrow morning but i must see my mother before i leave town no i will tell her all she wishes to know she might not like it this is not a case for likes or dislikes said tait grimly but a question of getting the better of hilliston you must dine with him tonight and find out if possible if it was his wife or himself who suggested this visit to eastbourne you need not tell him we go down tomorrow say you dont knowthat you await my decision try and learn all you can of his attitude and plans then we will discuss the matter when you return on my part continued tait significantly i may have some something to say about your mother you want to see her yes i am extremely anxious to see her perhaps you suspect her cried claude in a fiery tone bless the man what a temper he has said tait jocosely i dont suspect anyone except hilliston but i am quicker than you and i wish to learn precisely what your mother has to say a chance remark on her part may set us on the right path well i will be guided by you said claude in a few minutes you can go to hampstead and i will dine with hilliston but i dont like the task to sit at a mans table and scheme against him is not my idea of honor nor is it mine you are doing no such thing all i wish you to do is to observe hillistons attitude and hold your tongue there is nothing wrong in that i want to find out his motive for this behavior then why not see him yourself i will see him at thorston meantime it is necessary that i become acquainted with your mother now come and wire an acceptance to hilliston and write a letter to your mother for me to deliver claude obeyed he was quite content to accept the guidance of tait in this matter and began to think that his friend was right in suspecting hilliston else why did the lawyers plans so coincide with their own mind you dont tell hilliston too much said tait when the wire was despatched i shall tell him that we go to thorston shortly and that we saw john parver no dont tell him about john parver he will be certain to mention the subject first well and if he does oh you must use your brains replied tait ironically baffle his curiosity and above all make no mention of the breastpin episode related in the third volume why not because jenny paynton told linton of that she could not have obtained it from the newspapers as it is not related therein it is pure invention no i believe it to be a fact but who could have told it to miss paynton ah said tait in a low tone find me the person who told her that and ill find the man who murdered your father chapter xvii the husband at kensington gore to a woman who rules by right of beauty it is a terrible thing to see her empire slipping from her grasp by reason of gray hairs and wrinkles what desperate efforts does she make to protract her sway how she dyes and paints and powders and tight lacesall to no end for time is stronger than art and finally he writes his signmanual too deep to be effaced by cosmetics mrs hilliston was not yet beaten in the fight with the old enemy but she foresaw the future when she would be shamed and neglected close at hand perhaps it was this premonition of defeat that made her so unamiable sharp and bitter on the night when claude came to dine she liked claude and had stood in the place of a mother to him but he was a man and handsome so when she saw his surprised look at her changed appearance all the evil that was in her came to the surface yet she need not have felt so bitter a pang had she taken the trouble to glance at her image in the near mirror it reflected a tall stylish figure which in the dim light of the drawing room looked majestic and beautiful it was all very well to think that she appeared barely thirty in the twilight but she knew well that the daylight showed up her fortyseven years in the most merciless manner velvet robes diamond necklaces and such like aids to beauty would not make up for lack of youth and claudes illadvised start brought this home to her ten years before she had married hilliston in utter ignorance of the house at hampstead though she did not know it she was not unlike her rival there was the same majesty the same imperious beauty the same passionate nature but mrs bezel was worn and wasted by illness whereas mrs hilliston aided by art looked a rarely beautiful woman people said she had not done well to marry hilliston she was then a rich widow from america and wanted to take a position in society with her looks and her money she might have married a title but handsome hilliston crossed her path and though he was then fifty years of age she fell in love with him on the spot wearied of mrs bezel anxious to mend his failing fortunes hilliston accepted the homage thus offered he did not love her but kept that knowledge to himself so mrs derrick the wealthy widow secured the man she idolized she gave all wealth beauty love and received nothing in return during all their married life her love had undergone no abatement she loved her husband passionately and her one object in life was to please him at the time of the marriage she had rather resented the presence of claude in hillistons house but soon accepted him as an established fact the more so as he took up his profession shortly afterward and left her to reign alone over the heart of her husband when the young man called she was always kind to him she constantly looked after his welfare and playfully styled herself his mother claude was greatly attached to her and spoke of her in the highest terms but for the life of him he could not suppress that start though he knew it wounded her to the heart during his five years of absence she had aged greatly and art seemed rather to accentuate than conceal the truth you find me altered i am afraid said she bitterly age is robbing me of my looks by no means answered claude with a desire to please her at the worst you are only growing old gracefully small comfort in that sighed mrs hilliston i do not want to grow old at all however it is no use fighting the inevitable but i hope ill die before i become a hag you will never become one im not so sure of that im one of those large women who turn to bones and wrinkles in old age in my eyes you will always be beautiful louise said hilliston who entered at this moment you are an angel ever bright and fair you have not lost the art of saying pretty things francis replied his wife greatly gratified but there is the gong claude take your mother in to dinner the young man winced as she said this thinking of his real mother who lay sick and feeble at hampstead hilliston saw his change of countenance and bit his lip to prevent himself remarking thereon he guessed what claude was thinking about and thus his thoughts were turned in the same direction at the present moment the memories thus evoked were most unpleasant during dinner mrs hilliston recovered her spirits and talked freely enough no one was present save claude and her husband so they were a very pleasant party of three while in the full flow of conversation claude could not help thinking that tait was unjust to suspect the master of the house of underhand dealings for hilliston was full of smiles and geniality and did his best to entertain his guest could claude have looked below the surface he would have been considerably astonished at the inward aspect of the man yet a hint was given him of such want of concord for hilliston showed the cloven hoof before the meal ended so you are going to eastbourne said claude addressing himself to mrs hilliston i hope you will come over to thorston during your stay it is not unlikely replied the lady francis intends to make excursions all round the country only for your amusement my dear said hilliston hastily you know how dreary it is to pace daily up and down that parade i think eastbourne is dreary in any case it is solely on your account that i am going hilliston did not answer but stole a glance at claude to see what he thought the face of the young man was inscrutable though claude was mentally considering that tait was right and hillistons journey to eastbourne was undertaken to interview jenny paynton i dont like your english wateringplaces continued mrs hilliston idly they are so exasperatingly dull in america we can have a good time at newport but all your south coast is devoid of amusement trouville or dieppe are more enjoyable than eastbourne or folkestone the fault of the national character my dear louise we english take our pleasures sadly you know for the sole purpose of seeing what effect it would produce on the lawyer claude purposely introduced the name of the town where his father had met his death i wonder you dont try an inland wateringplace mrs hilliston he said calmly bath or tunbridge wells orhorriston hilliston looked up quickly and then busied himself with his food discomposed as he was his iron will enabled him to retain a quiet demeanor but the effect of the name on the wife was more pronounced than it was on the husband her color went and she laid down her knife and fork ah i dont know horriston she said faintly some inlandah how hot this room is open the window she added to the footman we want fresh air rather astonished at the effect thus produced claude would have spoken but that hilliston forestalled him the room is hot he said lightly but the fresh air will soon revive you louise i am glad we are going to eastbourne for you sadly need a change the season has been rather trying replied his wife resuming her dinner what were you saying about horriston claude nothing i only know it is a provincial town set in beautiful scenery i thought you might wish to try a change from the fashionable seaside place i might go there if it is pretty answered mrs hilliston who was now perfectly composed where is horriston in kent interposed hilliston quickly not very far from canterbury i have been there myself but as it is a rather dull neighborhood i would not advise you to try it despite her denial claude felt certain that mrs hilliston was acquainted with horriston for on the plea of indisposition she left the table before the dinner was ended as she passed through the door she playfully tipped claude on the shoulder with her fan dont forget to come and see us at eastbourne she said vivaciously and bring mr tait with you he is a great favorite of mine this claude promised to do and when she left the room returned to his seat with a rather puzzled expression on his face hilliston saw the look and endeavored to banish it by a hasty explanation you rather startled my wife by mentioning horriston he said in an annoyed tone i wish you had not done so as it is connected with the case she naturally feels an antipathy toward it what does mrs hilliston know about my fathers death asked claude in some surprise yes when we married she wanted to know why you lived in the house with me so i was forced to explain all the circumstances do you think that was necessary i do you know how suspicious women are replied hilliston lightly they will know the truth but you can trust to her discretion claude no one will hear of it from her at this moment a footman entered the room with a message from mrs hilliston my mistress wants to know if you have the third volume of a whim of fate sir said the servant no replied hilliston sharply tell your mistress that i took it to my office by mistake she will have it tomorrow claude thought this strange and when the footman retired hilliston made another explanation equally as unsatisfactory as the first i am so interested in that book that i could not leave it at home he said quickly and now that i have met the author i am doubly interested in it another proof of taits acumen hilliston was the first to introduce the subject of john parver chapter xviii a duel of words a longish pause ensued between the two men hilliston seemed to be in no hurry to continue the conversation and claude with his eyes fixed absently on his glass pondered over the facts that mrs hilliston had an aversion to horriston and that the lawyer had taken the third volume of the novel out of the house the two facts seemed to have some connection with each other but what the connection might be claude could not rightly conclude from his frequent talks with tait he knew that the third volume contained the episode of the scarfpin which was instrumental in bringing the fictitious murderer to justice the assassin in the novel was meant for hilliston and remembering this claude wondered whether there might not be some reason for his removal of the book mrs hilliston had quailed at the mention of horriston and the explanation given by her husband did not satisfy larcher what reason could she have for taking more than a passing interest in the tragic story why after ten years should she pale at the mention of the neighborhood claude asked himself these two questions but could find no satisfactory answer to either of them he was toying with his wineglass while thinking when a sudden thought made him grip the slender stem with spasmodic force was it possible that mrs hilliston could have been in the neighborhood fiveandtwenty years before that she could have heard some talk of that scarfpin which was not mentioned at the trial but which tait insisted was an actual fact and no figment of the novelists brain and finally could it be that hilliston had purposely removed the third volume of a whim of fate so that his wife should not have her memory refreshed by a relation of the incident it was very strange thus thinking claude glanced stealthily at his guardian who was musingly smoking his cigar and drinking his wine he looked calm and content and prosperous nevertheless claude was by no means so sure of his innocence as he had been hillistons confusion his hesitation his evasion instilled doubts into the young mans mind he determined to gain a knowledge of the truth by questions and mentally arranged these as follows first he would try and learn somewhat of the past of mrs hilliston for beyond the fact that she was an american he knew nothing of it second he would lead hilliston to talk of the scarfpin and see if the reference annoyed him and third he would endeavor to discover if the lawyer was averse to his wife reading the novel with his plans thus cut and dried he spoke abruptly to his guardian i am sorry mrs hillistons health is so bad it is not bad my dear fellow replied the lawyer lifting his head she is a very strong woman but of course the fatigue of a london season tells on the healthiest constitution that is why i wish her to go to eastbourne why not take her to horriston why should i she connects the place with the story of your father about whom i was forced to speak ten years ago and speaking personally i have no desire to return there and recall the horrors of the past you were greatly affected by my fathers death naturally he was my dearest friend i would have given anything to discover the assassin did mrs hilliston give you her opinion as to who was guilty no i told her as little as i could of so painful a subject she is not in possession of all the facts at that rate why let her read a whim of fate i dont wish her to read it answered hilliston quietly but i left the novel lying about and she read the first two volumes if i can help it she shall not finish the story why object to her reading the third volume because it would recall the past too vividly to her mind i hardly follow you there said claude with a keen look the fact to which you refer cannot exist for your wife to her the novel can only be a second telling of the story related by you when she wished to know who i was that is very true nevertheless it made so painful an impression on her excitable nature that i am unwilling that her memory should be refreshed take another glass of wine my boy hilliston evidently wished to turn the conversation but claude was too determined on learning the truth to deviate from his course slowly filling his glass with claret he pushed the jug toward hilliston and pursued his questioning the american nature is rather excitable isnt it by the way is mrs hilliston a pureblooded yankee yes said hilliston with suspicious promptitude she was a chicago belle and married a millionaire in the pork line called derrick he died soon after the marriage so she came to england and married me it was her first visit to england no doubt her first visit replied hilliston gravely all her former life was passed in new york boston and chicago but what odd questions you ask added the lawyer in a vexed tone surely you do not think that my wife was at horriston twentyfive years ago or that she knows aught of this crime save what i have told her of course i think nothing of the sort said larcher hastily and what is more he believed what he said it was impossible that mrs hilliston american born and bred who had only been in england twelve years should know anything of an obscure crime committed in a dull provincial town thirteen years before the date of her arrival hitherto his questionings had eventuated in little so he turned the conversation into another groove and tried to learn if hilliston knew anything of jenny paynton what do you think of john parver he seemed an intelligent young fellow is that his real name no his name is frank linton the son of the vicar of thorston what he belongs to the place whither you go with tait exclaimed hilliston with a startled air that is strange you may learn there whence he obtained the materials for his novel i know that he obtained them from miss paynton who is she a literary young lady who lives at thorston with her folks but i fancy linton mentioned that he had told you about her well he did and he didnt said hilliston in some confusion that is he admitted that the story was founded on fact but he did not tell me whence he obtained such facts i suppose it is your intention to question this young lady yes i want to know how she heard of the matter pooh read it in a provincial newspaper no doubt i think not replied claude with some point it is next to impossible that she should come across a paper containing an account of the trial people dont keep such grewsome matters by them unless they have an interest in doing so well this young lady cannot be one of those persons how old is she fourandtwenty ah said hilliston with a sigh of relief she was not born when your father was murdered you must see she can know nothing positive of the matter then how did she supply linton with the materials for this book i can only answer that question by reverting to my theory of the newspaper well even granting that it is so said larcher quickly she knows details of the case which are not set forth in the newspaper how do you know this asked hilliston biting his lip to control his feelings because in the third volume nonsense nonsense interrupted hilliston violently you seem to forget that the hard facts of the case have been twisted and turned by the novelists brain we do not know who slew your father but the novelist had to end his storyhe had to solve the mysteryand he has done so after his own fashion rising from his seat he paced hurriedly to and fro talking the while with an agitation strange in so hard and selfcontrolled a man for instance the character of michael dene is obviously taken from me it is not a bit like me of course either in speech or looks or dress all the novelist knew was that i had given evidence at the trial and that the dead man had been my dearest friend the circumstances suggested a striking dramatic situationthat the dear friend had committed the crime for the base love of the wife michael dene is guilty in the novelbut the man in real life myselfyou know all i know of the case i would give ten years of my life short as the span now is to find the man who killed george larcher this was strong speaking and carried conviction to the heart of claude the more so when hilliston further explained himself on the night of the murder i was at the ball three miles off i knew nothing of the matter till i was called upon to identify the corpse of your father it was hardly recognizable and the face was much disfigured but i recognized him by the color of his hair and the seal on his finger how was it that my father was dressed as darnley john parver explains that said hilliston sharply jeringhami forget his name in the novelwas dressed as darnley and i believe as is set forth in the book that george larcher assumed the dress so that under his mask your mother might mistake him for jeringham evidently she did so as he learned that she loved jeringham one moment interposed claude quickly my mother denies that jeringham was her lover your mother mrs bezel true i forgot for the moment that you knew she was alive no doubt she is right and jeringham was only her friend but in the novel he is her lover michael dene drawn from myself is her lover you see fact and fiction are so mixed up that there is no getting at the truth i shall get at the truth said claude quietly never after such a lapse of time you can discover nothing better let the dead past bury its dead i advised you before i advise you now you will only torture your life cumber it with a useless task george larcher is dead and buried and dust by this time no one knows who killed him no one ever shall know i am determined to learn the truth i hope you may but be advised leave this matter alone you do not know what misery you may be laying up for yourself why you have not even a clew to start from unless added hilliston with a sneer you follow the example of the novelist and elucidate the mystery by means of the scarfpin again tait was right hilliston had himself introduced the subject of the scarfpin claude immediately took advantage of the opening i suppose that episode is fiction of course it is no scarfpin was found in the garden nothing was found but the dagger you know that michael dene is supposed to drop that scarfpin on the spot well i am the living representative of michael dene and i assure you i never owned a garnet cross with a central diamond is that the description of the scarfpin yes do you not remember a small maltese cross of garnets with a diamond in the center the description sounds fictitious who ever saw such an ornament in real life but in detective novels the solution of the mystery turns on such gewgaws a scarfpin a stud a link a broochall these go to hang a manin novels this assertion that the episode of the scarfpin was fiction was in direct contradiction to that of tait who declared it to be true claude was torn by conflicting doubts but ultimately put the matter out of his thoughts miss paynton alone could give a correct opinion as to whether it had emanated from her fertile brain or was really a link in the actual case judging from the speech of hilliston and the silence of the newspaper reports claude believed that tait was wrong the lawyer and his guest did not go to the drawing room as mrs hilliston sent word that she was going to bed with a bad headache under the circumstances claude took his leave having as he thought extracted all necessary information from hilliston moreover he was anxious to get back to taits chambers and hear what the little man had to tell him about mrs bezel hilliston said goodby to him at the door i shall see you at eastbourne i suppose he said genially yes i will drive over and tell you what miss paynton says the door closed and hilliston with a frown on his face stood looking at the floor he was by no means satisfied with the result of the interview i wish i could stop him he muttered clenching his fist stop him at any price if he goes on he will learn the truth and if he learns the truthah he drew a long breath and went upstairs to his wife as he ascended the stairs it seemed to him as though he heard the halting step of nemesis following stealthily behind chapter xix tait brings news as quick as a fast hansom could take him claude drove to earls street and found tait impatiently waiting his arrival the little man had a look of triumph in his eyes which showed that his interview with mrs bezel had been to some purpose dormer had placed wine and biscuits on the table and made hungry by his long journey to hampstead tait was partaking of these modest refreshments when claude entered the room i thought you were never coming said he glancing at his watch past ten oclock you must have had an interesting conversation with hilliston to stay so long i have had a very interesting conversation and you oh i got back thirty minutes ago after being more than an hour with your mother was she disappointed at my nonappearance very much so but i explained that you had to dine with hilliston she did not seem to like that either absurd she thinks no end of hilliston and advised me to see as much of him as possible nevertheless the idea that you were dining with him did not please her i could only quiet her by telling all i know about mrs hilliston when tait made this remark claude was taking off his cloak but he paused in doing so to ask a question what possible interest can my mother have in mrs hilliston i dont know but she asked me who she was and where she came from insisted on a description of her looks and altogether pumped me dry on the subject i suppose she wished to know something of hillistons domestic felicity and as he has not enlightened her on the subject applied to me this explanation which was accepted implicitly by claude was by no means the truth with his usual sharpness tait had noted mrs bezel was profoundly jealous of the lawyers wife and from this and sundry other hints had drawn conclusions by no means flattering to the lady herself still as she was claudes mother he had too much good breeding and too much liking for his friend to state his beliefwhich was that the bond between mr hilliston and mrs bezel was not of so harmless a nature as they would have the world believe with this idea in his head tait began to look at the case from the point of view adopted by john parver might it not be true that hilliston was the secret lover of the wife and the murderer of the husband certainly the efforts he was making to stay claude in solving the mystery gave color to the idea if he were innocent of crime and illicit passion he would surely be anxious to hasten instead of retarding the discovery taits private opinion was that hilliston had the crime of murder on his soul but for obvious reasons not unconnected with mrs bezel he did not care to speak openly to larcher on the contrary while admitting a disbelief in the lawyer he feigned a doubt of his complicity in the matter which he was far from feeling under these circumstances he had advised claude to leave the matter alone for he dreaded the effect on his friends mind when he learned the truth whether hilliston proved innocent or not the unraveling of the mystery would necessarily result in the disclosure of the relations existing between him and mrs bezel tait shrank from pursuing investigations likely to lead to such a result but the determination of claude to avenge his fathers murder left him no option against his better judgment he was urged along the path of discovery but trusted when the time came to soften the blow of the inevitable result in silence he heard the story related by claude of the evening at hillistons and did not comment on the information thus given so speedily as larcher expected he thought it wiser to delay any remarks till he had told the young man of his interview with mrs bezel i need not go into details claude he said anxious not to say too much but will tell you as shortly as i can mrs bezelit is more convenient to speak of her so than to call her your motheris not pleased that you should try and solve this mystery i know that she thinks it is hopeless and is unwilling that i should waste my time to no purpose but she should have thought of that before inducing hilliston to show me the paper now it is too late and for my own satisfaction if not for hers i must go on with the matter did you relate our conversation with linton yes and she takes the same view of it as hilliston that miss paynton got the case from a bundle of old newspapers what do you think yourself i still hold to my opinion said tait quietly the affair was related to jenny by someone who lived in horriston at the time the murder took place else she would never have given linton that fact about the scarfpin which as we know is not mentioned in the report of the trial hilliston says that the episode is fiction mrs bezel says it is fact what was a scarfpin of garnets really found in the grounds of the laurels it was mrs bezel described the jewel to me and asserted that it was discovered near the bank of the stream does she know to whom it belonged no she had no recollection of having seen it before neither your father nor jeringham wore a scarfpin of that pattern it is curious that hilliston should insist that such a pin never existed it is very curious assented tait significantly especially as it was shown to him by denis bantry this one fact ought to convince you that hilliston is playing us false my doubts were confirmed by his manner tonight replied claude gloomily i dont know what his reason may be or how i can reconcile his present behavior with his kindness to my mother but he certainly seems anxious to thwart us if he can tait guessed what the reason was very well but was too wise to explain himself granted that a bond existed between mrs bezel and the lawyer and the whole thing became clear but mrs bezel was claudes mother so tait held his peace why wasnt the scarfpin produced at the trial asked claude seeing his friend made no answer only one man can answer that questiondenis bantry does my mother know where he is no she has not set eyes on him since she left horriston it is strange that he should have suppressed so important a piece of evidence said claude meditatively devoted as he was to my father i should have thought he would have done his best to bring the murderer to justice perhaps he did not know who the murderer was however there is no doubt that the scarfpin must have told him something about which he judged it wise to hold his tongue perhaps miss paynton can enlighten us on the subject then she must know denis bantry so i think said tait thoughtfully the episode of the scarfpin was only known to your mother to hilliston and to bantry jenny paynton does not know your mother who denied all knowledge of her she cannot be acquainted with hilliston or he certainly would not have let her make use of the affair for lintons book even if he had told her there only remains denis bantry now i know that jenny has lived all her life at thorston so if she saw this man anywhere it must have been there is there anyone in the neighborhood you think is he asked larcher greatly excited none that i can call to mind but then i dont know the neighborhood very well we must make a thorough exploration of it when we are down there certainly but it seems to me that the only one who can put us in the right track is the girl true enough i only hope she will be amenable to reason larcher poured himself out a glass of wine and drank it slowly then he lighted his pipe and returned to his chair with a new idea in his head i wonder why hilliston told that lie about the scarfpin tait ask me something easier i cannot say well learn nothing from him my dear fellow it is no use asking further questions of your guardian or of your mother we have found out all from them that we can nothing now remains but to see jenny paynton quite right and we go to thorston tomorrow by the ordinary train i have written for the dogcart to meet us by this time next week we may know a great dealwe may know the truth that is if hilliston doesnt thwart us he is going down to eastbourne remember i know but i intend to get what the americans call the inside running by seeing jenny tomorrow evening the whole case turns on her explanation of the scarfpin episode well said claude knocking the ashes out of his pipe we found linton through his book we found jenny through linton through her we may find denis bantry and through denis bantry we may find the man who killed your father finished tait triumphantly well i know what the name of the man will be what will it be jeringham tait shrugged his shoulders knowing what he did he was by no means certain on that point chapter xx a precis of the case a month ago had anyone prophesied that i spenser tait would be engaged in playing the part of an amateur detective i should have flatly contradicted his prognostication yet here i am doing my best to solve the mystery which hangs round the death of my friends father i cannot say that i object to the task for there is something tremendously exciting in this man hunt my friendship for claude is the principal factor which induces me to meddle with the business but a slight flavoring of selfishness is also present hitherto we had been fairly successful and have at least found a clew likely to lead to some certain result between mrs bezel hilliston and lintons book we have learned a good deal of the case and all our knowledge points to an interview with jenny paynton as the next step to be taken tomorrow we start for thorston for this purpose but before exploring the new field i judge it wise to set down all the facts which have come to our knowledge and to deduce therefrom if possible a logical reason for our future actions i have my suspicions but these are vague and intangible claude has his suspicions but these do not coincide with mine he believes jeringham to be guilty of the crime i think hilliston is likely to prove the assassin both of us may be wrong to take the case of mr hilliston his attitude is decidedly aggressive at the present moment and he is doing his best to dissuade claude from investigating the case why should he do so george larcher was his dearest friend and met with a cruel fate if there is any chance of his fate being avenged surely hilliston should be the first to prosecute the inquiries instead of doing so he hangs back and throws cold water on my efforts and on claudes he must have some reason for his actions is that reason to be found at clarence cottage in hampstead this question brings me to a delicate point my work is hampered by the fact that mrs bezel is claudes mother and i dare not express myself as i should wish i gather from the report of the trial that mrs larcher was a vain and silly coquette who threw away the love of a good man for the indulgence of her own selfish instincts guilty she may have been but not with jeringham if she had any lover it was francis hilliston after a visit to clarence cottage i believe the view taken of the case by the novelist to be the right one during my interview with mrs bezel i noted her every look and action when hillistons name occurred she flushed up and looked savage she was anxious to know all about the wife at kensington gore and in every way showed that she had more interest in the man than she cared to confess again she told me that her illness was of ten years duration hilliston has been married ten years what is more likely than that he should have wearied of the invalid and so deserted her for mrs derrick the rich widow mrs bezel is jealous of hilliston and of his wife her love has changed to hatred and i verily believe that she would harm him if she could already she has attempted to do so for it was only her threat to reveal all to claude that made hilliston produce that report of the larcher affair she has told me all she knows but i cannot help thinking that she is keeping back certain facts connected with the case there is a hesitancy and doubt in her speech which points to some secret if i could learn that secret it might establish the guilt of hilliston and yet i cannot believe that no woman however vain however frivolous would have lived with the man who murdered her husband who slew the father of her child mrs bezels secret may not directly inculpate hilliston but it may point toward him as the possible assassin but i cannot believe that she thinks him guilty their relations with one another forbids so horrible a supposition nevertheless hilliston is afraid of the truth coming to light he denies that the garnet scarfpin ever existed while mrs bezel said she saw it herself if the lawyer is not afraid why should he tell a deliberate lie it is his word against that of mrs bezel and as her statement is backed up by the description in the novel i believe she is telling the truth can it be possible that the scarfpin belonged to hilliston and was dropped by him in the garden of the laurels on the night of the struggle here hilliston proves an alibi he stated to claude that at the hour of three oclock when the crime was presumably committed he was at the ball in the horriston town hall if that can be proved he must perforce be innocent another supposition can mrs larcher be actually guilty of her husbands death and knowing this is hilliston anxious to stop claude in his investigations lest he should learn so terrible a truth i cannot believe this for mrs larcher or bezel set the ball rolling herself and were she guilty she certainly would not have run such risk then again jeringham fled on the night of the murder for what reason if hilliston killed larcher why should jeringham fly if mrs bezel killed her husband why should jeringham fly i see no reason in his flight and yet if he were guilty and hilliston knew him to be guilty why should he try and screen him at the present time altogether the case is so confusing that i do not know what to think or whom to suspect i wonder what has become of mona bantry and her child mrs bezel said she had not seen the girl or her brother for twentyfive years yet they must be somewhere circumstances point to jenny paynton having heard the story of the tragedy from denis for no one else could have revealed the episode of the scarfpin or have described the jewel if denis told her he must live at thorston and if he lives there his sister must be with him if this pair who were in the house on the night of the murder can be found the truth may come to light after searching thorston and finding out all i can from the bantryspresuming them to be thereit is my intention to go down to horriston and find out someone who remembers the case in spite of the lapse of time there must be some old people alive who danced at that ball in their hot youth they may be able to say if george larcher was there present in the character of darnley and at what time hilliston left the ball i may also hear what they think of jeringham and of the conduct of mrs bezel in making these investigations i shall not take claude as i shrewdly suspect the opinions of these oldsters regarding his mother are anything but flattering to that lady if i go to horriston i must go alone on reading over these notes i am hardly satisfied with them they do not seem to give me much basis on which to work i suspect this person and the other but i have very little evidence to back me up in such suspicions the only thing that seems clear to me is that hilliston has some object in thwarting our plans what the object is i must find out perhaps i shall do so at thorston where i am certain to meet both hilliston and his wife and that reminds me of what claude related about her emotion this evening it is certainly curious but the worst of dabbling in detective business is that one is apt to get oversuspicious in this case i think there is no ground for suspicion mrs hilliston is an american and came to england twelve years ago i know this for certain for i remember when she made her debut in society this being the case she cannot possibly have any connection with horriston and her emotion must have been merely the recollection of the story related by her husband when he told her of claude well it is past midnight and i had better end these unsatisfactory notes detective business is harder than i thought how am i to evolve order out of all this chaos i hardly know save to trust to luck and jenny paynton and so to bed as saith worthy samuel pepys chapter xxi thorston it is astonishing how closely one village resembles another in appearance the squaretowered church the one winding street the lowroofed inn and redtiled cottages isolated by narrow alleys corn lands and comfortable farms around and still further the mansions more or less stately of the county families go where you will in the southern countries all the villages are so constituted one description serves for all though on occasions the expanse of the channel introduces a new feature into the landscape thorston was of the same class but in its own opinion had more pretentions to grandeur than its neighbors before the conquest it had been a considerable saxon town and as its name indicates had flourished before the introduction of christianity into england there according to tradition a temple to thor the thunderer had stood on the hill now crowned with the church hence the name of thors town report said that edward the confessor had built the church but of his work little remained and the present building was due to the piety or fears of a norman baron who wished to expiate his sins after the fashion of those times by erecting a house to some interceding saint in the present instance this church was dedicated to st elfrida the holy daughter of athelstan who renounced her fathers court to found a nunnery by the winding river lax famous for salmon as is plainly hinted by its scandinavian appellation yet notwithstanding church and tradition thorston had never since been of much importance and it was now but an ordinary rural village quaint and sleepy from eastbourne the road winding dipping rising and curving like a white snake ran over hill through dale along plain till it ultimately formed the high street of thorston thence it ran again into the country but at this point it made its way between houses thatched and old and toward the center opened into a marketplace adorned by an antique cross the inn of st elfrida with an effigy of the saint for a sign stood on the right of this square fronting the battered cross directly opposite a narrow road led on to the village green at the end of which rose the low hill whereon the church of st elfrida stood amid its trees lower down by the lax could be seen the ruins of her nunnery and a well frequented by her was to be inspected in the near neighborhood here said the legend she fought with the devil who strove to carry away the tower of the church and being worsted as the demons always were by mother church he dropped the tower a few yards off the main building as a matter of fact the square tower is detached from the church but as has before been stated it was built by the normans long after elfrida was laid to rest but the legend took no account of dates nor did the natives of thorston who would have been highly offended had anyone denied the authenticity of their story in confirmation thereof they referred to the guide booka notable authority truly the whole neighborhood was full of st elfrida who must have been a busy saint in her day and numerous tourists came to view church and tower and holy well the village derived quite an income from her reputation and valued the saint accordingly amid ancient oaks stood the gray church with its detached tower around lichened tombstones leaned over one another and rank grass grew up to the verge of the low stone wall which ran like a battlement round the crest of the little hill a flight of rugged steps led up to the lychgate and here stood a pretty girl in converse with frank linton alias john parver it was a hot summers day and the golden light piercing through the foliage of the trees enveloped the girl in a glittering haze she was extremely pretty darkeyed darkhaired with a complexion of roses and lilies and as neat a figure as was ever seen envious people said that miss paynton pinched her waist but such was not the case for she was too careless of her appearance and too careful of her health to sacrifice the latter to the former as a matter of fact she appreciated brains more than beauty and much preferred to exercise the first in clever conversation than to be complimented on the second linton who had known her for many years skillfully combined the two modes of paying homage to his divinity that he received hard words in return was to be expected for jenny knew her power over the youth and liked to exercise it she was the least vain of mortals but could not hide from herself that she was clever and pretty and therefore entitled to indulge in coquetry you grow more beautiful every day jenny said linton who had lately arrived from town and was making up for lost time and you more stupid retorted miss paynton climbing up on the low wall where she sat and smiled at him from under her straw hat if you have come here to pay me compliments you can go away again i want you to talk sense not nonsense what shall i talk about as if there were any question of that said she in supreme disdain are you not famous now tell me of your success you know about it already i sent you all the papers a whim of fate is the book of the season oh just think of that now oh lucky lucky frank so young and so successful you ought to be happy i am happy because i now see a chance of making you my now you are talking nonsense cried jenny ruthlessly interrupting him i wont hear a word more you ridiculous boy you are my brother nothing more but dont talk about it frank be sensible come now you have not yet told me how your father received the news oh he is pleased of course said linton unwillingly changing the subject but he reserves his opinion till he has read the book if he doesnt like it hell very likely order me to stop writing im sure he wont said jenny promptly youll make more as an author than as a lawyer no doubt if you continue to supply me with such excellent plots i wish i had your invention jenny it was not invention you know that quite well i found an account of the trial in an old bundle of provincial newspapers i couldnt have made up such a story jenny asked linton with some apprehension has your father read the book no i asked him to do so but he refuses to read novels history is what he likeskings and dates and battles father wouldnt waste a minute over fiction i hope he wont be angry at your giving me the plot jenny miss paynton stared at him in surprise and burst into a merry laugh his objection seemed supremely ridiculous to her at that moment my dear boy why should he the account of an old murder case can have nothing to do with him i found the papers in the garret among a heap of old books i dont suppose he knows of their existence it was a real case wasnt it yes it took place at horriston in but of course the public need not know that well i told someone about it oh you are an idiot frank or else added jenny more graciously you are very honest i suppose you explained that the story was founded on fact yes who asked you about it three people an old gentleman and two young men what are their names asked jenny curiously i forget the third one was called tait i think but i dont remember the names of the other two it doesnt matter you know continued the novelist hastily lots of authors found their plots on episodes in real life oh its of no consequence said jenny idly i suppose they thought the plot was too clever for you to invent at all events the credit is due to you for solving the mystery ah but did i solve it properly do you think michael dene committed the crime no i dont rejoined jenny promptly i think jeringham did jeringham who is he i forgot said jenny with some dismay i did not tell you the real names of the people jeringham is the man you call markham in the book if you remember i wanted you to make him commit the crime if i had done so no one would have read the book protested the author his flight made it so patent that he was guilty and i had to put the crime on to someone like dene whom no reader would suspect do you think that markhamjeringham really committed the murder yes i do if he was innocent why did he fly was he ever found again asked linton with some curiosity never it is fiveandtwenty years ago since the murder was committed and it is a mystery to this day id like to read that newspaper report for myself said the author after a pause could you not let me see it jenny shook her head im afraid not she replied guiltily you see kerry found me with the papers one day and took them away he was very angry and said i had no business to look at them my stars cried linton in a startled tone what will he say when he finds out that you and i have made use of them he wont find out replied jenny jumping down off the wall kerry never reads novels and no one will tell him oh its quite safe frank quite safe im not so sure of that jenny my father will talk about my book to mr paynton and hell tell kerry well what if he does cried jenny skipping down the steps im sure i dont care if kerry does know who cares for a musty fusty old crime of fiveandtwenty years ago dont trouble about it frank ill take the blame linton walked on in silence beside her and they entered the market place on their way to the vicarage he was beginning to have some qualms about the matter kerry had a very bad temper and linton was by no means anxious to encounter him i wish we had left it alone he said gloomily pausing by the cross in the square nonsense dont be a moral coward said jenny pettishly ill take the blame on myself kerry cant kill me be at this point she was interrupted by a dogcart containing two young men which spun past rapidly the driver took off his hat to miss paynton with a smile oh said jenny composedly when the vehicle had vanished there is our new lord of the manor mr tait why those are the two fellows who questioned me about my story cried linton are they yes you mentioned the name of tait said jenny quietly but what does it matter what a fuss you make over nothing jenny said linton solemnly there is going to be trouble over that story miss paynton stared at him in surprise then pointed an accusing finger at him francis linton she said slowly you are a silly fool if ever i help you again in your writing i give you leave to marry me then she ran away and left him dumfounded in the market place but she was by no means so lighthearted as she appeared to be kerrys anger the questions of the two strangers made her feel uneasy and she thought it would have been better had she left the provincial newspapers in the garret but fate decided otherwise and jenny paynton though she knew it not was an unconscious instrument to revive interest in a forgotten case to solve a mystery of fiveandtwenty years and to bring an unknown criminal to justice life is a chess board we are the puppets and fate plays the game chapter xxii in the church thorston manor built in broad meadow land about a quarter of a mile from the village was now the property of spencer tait he had purchased it lately at a small price from old miss felcar the last representative of that ancient family she unable to maintain the house in its original splendor got quit of it altogether in this way and shortly afterward took up her quarters at eastbourne leaving the house of her ancestors in the possession of a stranger the house itself was of no great pretensions or age dating only from the second georgea square redbrick mansion only redeemed from actual ugliness by the mellow beauty of its hues the grounds themselves were better and the trees best of all an avenue curved nobly to the gate which gave on the highroad and to the right of this fronting the house was a delightful garden laid out in the dutch fashion there were yew trees cut into quaint shapes stiff and formal hedges running in straight lines and beds of oldfashioned flowers a fountain a summer house and a statue or two completed the furniture of this pleasant ground to which tait introduced his friend with unconcealed pride i paid for this he said looking round as they paced the broad walks by itself the house is a monstrosity only rendered endurable by its years but you must confess that the garden is worth the money it is certainly quaint replied larcher looking around with an absent air but i do not care for nature in buckram the formality of this place offends my eye ah my dear fellow you have been used to the wildness of new zealand woods of late you will find these grounds grow on you i shall leave you alone this afternoon to make the attempt indeed said larcher in some surprise at this cavalier treatment and what do you intend to do i am going to church to churchon a weekday oh i am not bent on devotion claude but miss paynton is the organist of the parish today is wednesday when she is accustomed to practice between three and five i propose to see her there why cant you guess to forestall her with hilliston that gentleman is at eastbourne and will probably come over today or tomorrow to ask jenny to hold her tongue as we cant afford to run such a risk i must get all i can out of her today can i come also no replied tait promptly it would be necessary for me to introduce you what of that does it matter it matters a great deal miss paynton has we believe obtained the plot of lintons novel from a report of the trial she will know the name of larcher and when she hears that you are called so she will probably take fright and hold her tongue but why should she think i have anything to do with the case your own name your guardians answered tait quietly both are mentioned in the report of the trial oh i assure you jenny is a clever girl and knows that two and two make four she will put this and that together with the result that nothing will be gained by the interview well well go alone said claude crossly though i envy you the chance she is a pretty girl from the glimpse i caught of her and as wise as she is pretty laughed tait i will need all my wits to deal with her now is it settled yes you go to your organist and ill potter about these green alleys and think myself an abbe of louis xivs time having come to this amicable understanding they went in to luncheon after which tait gave claude a sketch of the people in the neighborhood later on he sent him into the dutch garden with a cigar and a book then betook himself by a short cut through the park to the church of st elfrida shortly after four he entered by the main door and found himself in the aisle listening to the rolling notes of the organ there was no attempt at decoration in that church for the vicar was broad in his views and hating all ritualism from his soul took a pride in keeping the edifice bare and unadorned the heavy arches of gray stone the whitewashed walls with here and there a mural tablet the plain communion table under the single stainedglass window nothing could be less attractive only the deep hues of roof and pews the golden pipes of the organ and the noble lectern with its brazen eagle preserved the church from looking absolutely irreverent through the glazed windows of plain glass poured in the white light of day so that the interior lacked the reverent gloom most fitted to the building and the marks of time were shown up in what might be termed a cruel manner of old st elfridas had been rich in precious marbles in splendid altars and gorgeous windows manyhued and elaborate but the puritans had destroyed all these and reduced the place to its present bareness which the vicar took a pride in preserving it seemed a shame that so noble a monument of norman architecture should be so neglected the red curtains of the organ loft hid the player but tait knew that it was jenny by the touch and sat down in a pew to wait till she had finished her practising one piece followed the other and the stately music vibrated among the arches in great bursts of sound a march an anthem an offertory till tait almost fell asleep lulled by the drone of the pipes at length jenny brought her performance to an end and having dismissed the boy who attended to the bellows tripped down the aisle with a music book under her arm she looked as fresh and pink as a rose but quite out of place in that bare bleak building toward her tait advanced with a bow here i am you see miss paynton he said shaking her by the hand i heard your music and could not help coming in to listen i hope you do not mind my intrusion oh the lord of the manor can go anywhere said jenny demurely i am glad to see you again mr tait the second time today is it not yes i drove past you in the market place if i remember rightly wont you sit down miss paynton and give me all the news i am terribly ignorant of local gossip i assure you nothing loath the girl seated herself in a pew near the door and occupied herself in fixing her glove remembering the conversation with linton she was slightly uneasy at taits very direct request but thinking that it could not possibly have anything to do with the plot of lintons novel resigned herself to circumstances before the conversation ended she wished that she had refused to speak to tait at that moment but it was then too late news she repeated with a laugh do we ever have any news in this dreary place i should rather ask you for news mr tait who are fresh from london oh but no doubt our young author has already told you all that is worth hearing said tait deftly leading up to his point he has been quite the lion of the season yes he has been very fortunate replied jenny carefully she did not relish the sudden introduction of this forbidden subject and he owes it to you i believe to me good gracious mr tait what have i to do with franks success according to what he says everything what do you mean she said sitting up very straight with a deeper color than usual on her cheek why said tait looking directly at her and thereby adding to her confusion frank told me that you supplied the plot of a whim of fate and what if i did mr tait oh nothing only i must compliment you on yourshall we say selection or invention the former replied jenny with extraordinary quickness since frank makes no secret of it why should i the plot was told him by me and i found it set forth as a trial in a newspaper of hm in the canterbury observer i believe how do you know that is the name of the paper she asked in a nervous tone i learned it from the same source that supplied me with the history of the larcher affair what you also know the name of the case as you see frank does not know it i did not show him the papers i suppressed all names when i told the story she said incoherently but now youyou i know all yes you are right observed tait complacently i am better acquainted with the plot of a whim of fate than john parver himself jenny sat looking at him in a kind of wild amazement from the significance of his tone the extent of his knowledge she vaguely felt that something was wrong again the anger of kerry the conversation of linton came into her mind and she saw into what difficulty the chance telling of that ancient crime had led her tait noticed that she was perplexed and frightened so dexterously strove to set her more at ease by making a clean breast of it and enlisting her sympathy for claude you saw the friend who was with me in the cart miss paynton yes who is he claude larcher claude lawhat do you mean mr tait i am in the dark i do not understand have i done anything wrong inin in telling the case to linton finished tait smoothly by no means as a matter of fact you have done my friend a service he is called larcher who is he she asked again with an effort he is the son of george larcher who was murdered at horriston in chapter xxiii fact and fiction a silence ensued between them tait waiting to mark the effect of his revelation while jenny tried to grasp the idea that fiction had changed unexpectedly to fact to her the case had been more or less of a romance far removed and impossible as such she had told it to linton but now brought face to face with the fact that the murdered mans son was in the neighborhood she scarcely knew what to think certainly she was ignorant what to say the shock would have unstrung a more nervous woman but jenny paynton was not wanting in pluck and so braced herself up to do what was required of her yet it took her a little time to recover and seeing this tait afforded her the opportunity by talking broadly of the matter later on he intended to enter into details i do not wonder you are startled miss paynton he said easily this is a coincidence such as we rarely meet with in real life my friend was ignorant of his fathers fate but one evening papers were put into his hands which recounted the tragedy papers similar to those whence you obtained the story he came to tell me all but scarcely had he begun his relation when i became aware that i knew everything beforehand had you also seen the papers mr tait no but i had read a whim of fate there i found the larcher affair set forth in the guise of fiction astonished at this i sought out linton who i learned was the author hidden under the name of john parver and asked him whence he obtained his material he mentioned your name and so i have come to you why can you ask to find out all you know of the matter for what reason i think you can guess my reason replied tait quietly my friend claude larcher wishes to find out who killed his father after fiveandtwenty years impossible so i said at first now i am of a different opinion in a short space of time we have found out a great deal with your help we will discover more and so in the end the matter may be cleared up you want my help decidedly it is solely for that reason that larcher and i have come here it was a palefaced jenny who sat considering a reply to this remark she began to be aware that she had inadvertently set a ball rolling the progress of which she was powerless to stop that chance discovery in the garret had resuscitated an old scandal and brought her into contact with people of whose existence she had hitherto been ignorant as a matter of fact jenny was responsible for the revival of the larcher affair her narration of the plot had caused the writing of the novel and that in its turn had freshened the memory of mrs bezel with the result that claude had been told the truth now he had come to the source to learn more i dont see how i can help said jenny fencing with the inevitable if as you say mr larcher saw the canterbury observer he must know as much as i do about the matter very true replied tait promptly but there are many things in the novel which are not mentioned in the report of the case those things are fictitious you must go to frank for information about them was that scarfpin episode fictitious no replied jenny with some hesitation kerry told me that kerry our manservant he has been with my father ever since i can remember and is quite the autocrat of the household he found me with those papers one day after i told frank the story and took them away from me you have no idea how angry he was that i had read them yet he told you about the scarfpin oh that was because i asked him who had committed the crime said jenny quickly at first he would not talk about it but when i said that no doubt jeringham was guilty since he had fled kerry denied it and asserted that the crime was committed by the man who owned the garnet scarfpin did he say who owned it no he went away before i could ask him and will not let me speak of the matter in the book frank makes michael dene the owner of the pin ah and michael dene is francis hilliston in real life how do you know that asked the girl quickly with a nervous start my dear young lady i have read the report of the case and the novel it is easy to see who your fictitious personages are do you know mr hilliston a little he has visited my father once or twice but we have not seen him now for many years in fact i had almost forgotten his name till i saw it in the case humph in the novel michael dene the man meant for hilliston commits the crime was that your idea or lintons it was franks dene was the least likely person to be suspected and it was necessary to keep up the mystery to the end but i think he ought to have made markham commit the crime markham is jeringham is he not said tait thoughtfully with your permission miss paynton we will use the real names not the fictitious it will help us to understand the matter more clearly jenny stood up and tucked the music book under her arm the recollection of kerrys anger made her feel that she was unwise to talk so freely to a stranger about the matter hitherto tait had taken his own way now she was resolved to take hers i dont want to speak any more about it she said resolutely i am very sorry i told frank the story and meddled with those papers let me pass mr tait and drop the subject no dont do that cried tait rising in his turn and barring her way you must not fail me at the eleventh hour my friend is bent on learning the truth and surely you will not grudge him help remember it is the murderer of his father whom he desires to bring to justice i cant say any more i know no more mr tait do you know what i am about to do no said tait looking at her grave face in some wonder i am going home to tell my father and kerry what use i made of those papers if i have acted wrongly it is but right that they should know they will know shortly without your telling miss jenny ah you intend to speak of the matter yourself perhaps but in this case i allude to hilliston hilliston repeated jenny in surprise what has he to do with the matter a great deal i fancy more than you or i suspect he is now at eastbourne and i am certain he will come over here to see you tomorrow to see me why because he wants you to hold your tongue about these matters mr tait she cried with a sudden flush surely you are not biased by franks book you imply that mr hilliston is afraid of the truth i think he is in fact i am sure he is do you believe he committed that cowardly crime of twentyfive years ago asked jenny with scorn what is your own opinion was the counter question i believe that jeringham was the murderer yes captain larcher went in disguise to that ball and learned the truth from the lips of his own wife i believe she loved jeringham i believe he followed her home on that fatal night urging her to fly then captain larcher appeared on the scene and in the struggle that ensued he was killed jeringham fled and mrs larcher died that i am certain is the true history of this crime you then think that mrs larcher was privy to the murder oh i dont say that said the girl shrinking back it is impossible to say but i have no right to talk to you about these matters mr tait i have told you all i know let me pass please tait bowed and stood aside hat in hand she flitted down the aisle a slim girlish figure and had arrived at the door when his voice arrested her one moment miss paynton he said following her quickly what is it dont tell your father of this for twentyfour hours why because i want to prove to you that what i say is true hilliston will inform your father himself and ask you to be silent it is too late for that nowunfortunately why unfortunately you should be glad to have strengthened the hands of justice however we need not speak of that now will you promise to withhold your confession for the time i ask i promise nothing mr tait goodevening but miss paynton he said following her again you surely will not be so rash you can have no idea how important these matters are to my friend mr hilliston is certain to inform your father within the next twentyfour hours so surely you can give us that time to do what we can i beg of you jenny stopped irresolutely and looked at tait with a mixture of anger and doubt the matter had now grown so intricate that she did not know what to do what to say she had not known tait long enough to be guided by his advice or to rely on his judgment and her impulse was to tell her father and receive suggestions as to what was best to be done under the circumstances yet she also mistrusted hilliston as his connection with the horriston case seemed to her to be by no means as simple as had appeared at first sight she was suspicious of him and if he came over to thurston especially to ask her to be silent that would go a long way toward confirming her doubts and then after all no harm could be done within the twentyfour hours as afterward she could tell her father thus at once satisfying her conscience and her curiosity she made the compromise very well mr tait she said gravely i promise to be silent for twentyfour hours chapter xxiv a new suspicion spenser tait walked back to the manor house with the pleasing conviction that he had passed a very profitable hour he had warned jenny about the probable movements of hilliston and thus had put her on her guard against that astute individual once an idea enters a womans head it is impossible to get it out again and tait by half hinting a confirmation of jennys suspicions regarding the lawyer had made her uneasily conscious that hilliston was a man to be watched and reckoned with if hilliston fulfilled taits prophecy the little man believed that jenny would resent his interference penetrate his motives and thwart him if possible in spite of her denial that she thought him guilty tait could not but perceive that the reading of the case had not biased her in favor of the dead mans friend jenny believed that jeringham had committed the crime but if hilliston acted indiscreetly it would not take much to induce her to alter that opinion tait chuckled as he thought of these things for he had not only cut the ground from under hillistons feet by warning jenny of his possible arrival but had as he truly thought converted a passive spectator into an active enemy again he had learned that it was the old servant who had informed the girl concerning the scarfpin episode kerry said that the man who owned the scarfpin was guilty and kerry knew to whom the scarfpin belonged if he could only be induced to part with the information there might be some chance of solving the mystery but kerrysor rather denis bantryspast conduct and present attitude were so doubtful that it was difficult to know how he would act even though he were driven into a corner tait had little doubt in his own mind that kerry was the old servant of captain larcher for no one but he knew the truth about the scarfpin nevertheless he failed to understand why the man had changed his name and why he was staying at thorston as servant to a recluse like paynton only a personal interview with him could settle these vexed questions but tait was of two opinions whether kerry would be amenable to reason and confess his reasons for such concealment thus thinking and trying to come to some conclusion regarding the new aspect placed upon affairs by the conversation with jenny the little man arrived home and learning that claude was still in the garden he went there to report the result of his interview and discuss the situation larcher was leaning back in a comfortable garden chair with an open book on his knee but instead of reading he was staring with unseeing eyes into the fresh green of the tree above him on hearing taits brisk step he hastily lowered his head with a flush as though he had been caught doing something wrong and grew still more confused when he saw his friend looking at him with a queer expression of amusement she is a pretty girl said tait significantly and i dont wonder you are thinking of her thinking of who asked claude merrily at this reading of his thoughts are you a mind reader so far as you are concerned i am knowing how easily influenced you are by the sight of a pretty face i dont think i am far wrong in guessing that your thoughts were with jenny paynton well yes replied claude with a frank laugh i do not deny it the glimpse i caught of her as we drove past in the cart charmed me greatly i have rarely seen a more sympathetic and piquant face bah you say that of every woman you meet your geese are always swans jenny is at all events said larcher promptly and you cannot deny that but i admire her exceedinglythat is as a pretty woman you see i already call her jenny in my own mind but that is because you always talk of her by her christian name now jenny is my dear don juan said tait blandly dont you think we had better leave off these erotics and get to business you must not indulge in the ideal to the exclusion of the real oh not that business sighed larcher wearily i dont believe well do any good with it the mystery of my fathers death is likely to remain one to the end of time for all i can see every trace is obliterated by the snows of twentyfive years not entirely my friend for instance i have learned an important fact today from miss paynton yes we had a long conversation and she was considerably startled when she learned the object of your visit here was it wise of you to tell her why yes returned tait decidedly we can do nothing without her help and that she will refuse to give us unless she learns the reason of our inquiries what is her opinion of the matter the same as lintons i suppose by no means she thinks that jeringham killed your father but i am not altogether sure that she does not suspect hilliston after all she may come round to lintons opinion before long did you tell her that we suspected hilliston asked claude anxiously not directly but i permitted myself to hint as much however i only aided the seed of suspicion to sprout for it was already implanted in her mind you look astonished claude but recall to your recollection the report of that case and you will see that hilliston was far too much mixed up in the matter to be as ignorant as he pretended to be at the trial according to his evidence he had not left the ballroom and consequently could have known nothing of the tragedy which was then being enacted at the laurels yet he knows details which so far as i can see prove him to have been an eyewitness claude jumped to his feet and began restlessly pacing up and down the gravel walk he yet retained some belief in hilliston and was reluctant to think that one to whom he owed so much should be guilty of so foul a crime it was true that certain circumstances looked black against him but these were purely theoretical and by no means founded on absolute facts after due consideration claude inclined to the belief that tait was too easily satisfied of hillistons guilt and was willing to accept any stray facts likely to confirm his theory thus biased he could not possibly look on the matter in a fair and equable manner the wish was altogether too greatly father to the thought i dont think you give hilliston a fair show tait he said stepping before his friend if he winks an eye you look on it as a sign of his guilt my mother assured me solemnly that hilliston was at the ball when the tragedy occurred oh in that case i have nothing more to say said tait coldly still he added rather spitefully i should like to know why mr hilliston is so anxious to keep the matter quiet tait said claude hoarsely sitting down by his friend and seizing his arm do you know i have often asked myself that question and i have found a reply thereto the only reply of which i can think he paused and looked fearfully around then wiped the sweat off his white face with a nervous gesture tait eyed him in amazement and could not understand what had come over his usually selfpossessed friend but he had no time to speak for claude with an irrepressible shiver whispered in a low voice what if my mother should be guilty after all ah you may well look astonished but that is the hideous doubt which has haunted me for days my mother says she ran at my father with a dagger but fainted before she struck him what if she did not faint if she really killed him and hilliston knowing this is trying to screen her and trying to save me from knowing the truth but my dear fellow the trial never mind the trial we now know that denis swore falsely when he asserted that my father was not in the house on that night we know that he was in the house and that my mother found him with mona bantry her jealousy might have carried her to greater lengths than she intended to go denis saved her at the trial by telling a lie but we know the truth and i cannot rid myself of a doubt that she may be guilty if so in place of being an enemy hilliston is acting the part of a friend in placing obstacles in our way tait shook his head i do not believe mrs bezel is guilty he said quietly if she had been she would certainly not have written to you and thus forced hilliston to show you the papers banish the thought from your heart claude i am as certain as i sit here that your mother is innocent of the crime if i could only be certain and why should you not be exclaimed tait vigorously an eyewitness could tell you the truth where can i find an eyewitness cried claude with an impatient frown mona bantry and jeringham have both fled they are probably dead by this time my mother denies that she struck the blow and hilliston she says was at the ball when the murder took place who can tell me the truth denis bantry said tait quietly listen to me claude the episode of the garnet scarfpin which to my mind is the clew to the assassin is only known to your mother to hilliston and to denis bantry now hilliston denies that such a trinket exists your mother insists that it was found on the bank of the river after the murder the only person who can give the casting votewho can arbitrate so to speakis denis bantry and where is denis bantry lost or dead years ago nothing of the sort my friend denis bantry is alive and in this neighborhood yes jenny paynton admitted to me that the scarfpin episode was related to her by their old servant kerry therefore it naturally follows that kerry is denis bantry but why is he hiding here under another name said larcher after he had digested this piece of information with a due display of astonishment that i cannot say unless here tait hesitated before uttering his opinion unless denis bantry is the guilty person but that is impossible that is out of the question said claude decidedly he was devoted to my father as you know why should he turn and kill him without a cause ah said tait significantly what if he had a cause and a very good one to kill your father recall your mothers confession she returned at three oclock in the morning and found her husband alone with mona the sister of denis she accused mona of being her husbands mistress and the girl confessed her guilt which your father evidently could not deny now what is more probable than that denis attracted by the high voices should have followed your mother to the room there he would hear the truth probably while waiting at the door what follows with his impulsive irish temperament he dashes in hot to avenge the wrong done to his sister the dagger dropped by your mother is at his feet he picks it up and kills his master on the instant your mother in a faint on the floor knows nothing of what is going on and brother and sister remove the body to the river where they drop it in then mona is sent away by denis to hide her shame and evade awkward questions while he remains but why should he remain interrupted claude smartly would it not have been wiser for him to fly and so confess his guilt no he induces jeringham to fly with a threat of denouncing him as the murderer of larcher jeringham is in such a dilemma that seeing that all the evidence will be against him he takes to flight thereupon denis is able to save his mistress and himself by denying that larcher came to the house on that night of course this is all pure theory still it is as circumstantial as the rest of the evidence we have in hand but claude was by no means inclined to agree with this last remark there are flaws in your argument he said after a few moments reflection if denis intended to deny that my father was in the house on that night why should he induce jeringham to fly to make assurance doubly sure no doubt he intended first to put the blame on jeringham but finding that mrs larcher was likely to be accused he made things safe for her by denying that his master returned on that evening only four people knew of the return mona who fled mrs larcher who held her tongue to save her neck denis who swore falsely to serve his mistress and jeringham who thought he might be accused of the crime but why wouldnt he have denounced denis he was doubtless ignorant that denis was the criminal you forget that jeringham was in the garden and knew nothing of what was taking place in the sitting room denis rushed out and finding jeringham may have told him that mrs larcher had killed her husband on his account the man bewildered and shocked yet sees that he is complicated in the case through his love for mrs larcher he guesses that owing to the gossip of the place he may be accused of the crime and so does the wisest thing he could dothe only thing he could doand seeks refuge in flight then you think denis is guilty i cant say as you see i can make a strong case out against your mother against jeringham against denis yes i could even make a case against mona bantry but it is sole theory yet denis must have some reason for hiding here under the name of kerry and for keeping those papers found by jenny which contained a report of the case the case is strong against hilliston i admit but is stronger against your fathers own servant i dont think so said claude quietly if denis had killed my father he would not have told jenny about the scarfpin why not the scarfpin may have belonged to jeringhamto hilliston for his own safetynow that the case is recognized after so many years by a girls rash actiondenis would not hesitate to blame them to save himself taking it all round added tait with the air of one who has settled the question i think the conduct of denis is very suspicious and i would not be surprised if he turned out to be the guilty person but the acts of hilliston tait rubbed his head and looked vexed for he was unable to give a direct answer let us leave the matter alone for the present he said crossly i am getting bewildered with all this talk only one person can tell the truth and that is kerry alias denis bantry chapter xxv the recluse meanwhile jenny was proceeding homeward in a rather unhappy state of mind the conversation had left an unpleasant impression and she was by no means sure what it would lead to a hundred times did she wish that she had not meddled with the matter but it was now too late for regrets and she recognized that she must bear the burden of her wrongdoing though indeed she could see no reason to characterize her action by so harsh a name a bundle of old papers in a garret she thought walking quickly through the lane where was the harm in reading them and as they contained an interesting story i fail to see where i acted wrongly in telling it to frank the larcher affair can have nothing to do with papa even though kerry was so angry ill speak to kerry and ask him if i have done wrong according to her promise she was determined to say nothing to her father for at least twentyfour hours for she was curious to see if mr hilliston would call to speak of the matter if he did so then would be the time to exculpate herself but pending such visit she saw no reason why she should not consult with kerry he had expressed anger at her possession of the papers so he if anyone would be able to explain if she had been rash on kerrys answer would depend the explanation due to her father thus thinking she speedily arrived in a deep lane at the end of which she turned into a white gate set in a rugged stone wall nut trees bent over this wall dropping their fruit into the ruts of the road and on the opposite side rose a steep green bank topped by blackberry bushes this byway was little frequented and here quiet constantly reigned unbroken save by the voices of birds it was a great place for nightingales and many a summer evening did jenny stand under the bending boughs listening to the warblings of those night singers so birdhaunted was the spot that here if anywhere keats might have composed his famous ode indeed the road was known as nightingale lane for obvious reasons passing through the gate jenny saw before her the little garden odorous with homely cottage flowerssweetwilliams delicate pea blossom ruddy marigolds and somber bushes of rosemary a hawthorn hedge on the right divided the flowers from the kitchen garden while to the left grew gnarled apple and pear trees now white with bloom a sprawling peach tree clung to the guarding wall of the lane and beds of thyme and mignonette perfumed the still air in the center of this sweetness was built the humble cottage of ferdinand paynton a broad lowroofed building with whitewashed walls and quaint windows diamondpaned and snowy curtained pots of flowers were set within and under the eaves of the thatched roof twittered the darting swallows one often sees such peaceful homesteads in the heart of england breathing quiet and tranquillity rose cottage as it was called from the prevailing flower in the garden was worthy to be enshrined in a fairy tale here lived ferdinand paynton with his only daughter and two servants male and female the one was kerry a crabbed old irishman stanch as steel and devoted to his master the other a withered crone who was never seen without her bonnet yet who bore the reputation of being an excellent cook and an economical housekeeper as mr paynton was poor and spent more than he could afford on books maria was very necessary to him as she scraped and screwed with miserly care yet withal gave him good meals and kept the tiny house like a new pin kerry attended principally to the garden and the books looked after jenny whom he was always scolding and passed his leisure time in fishing in the lax hot or cold wet or fine summer or winter nothing varied in the routine of rose cottage mr paynton rose at nine took his breakfast and read his paper till ten then walked for an hour or so in the garden with jenny till luncheon he wrote after luncheon he slept and then wrote again till dinner time the evening in summer was spent in the garden in winter within doors before a roaring fire in the bookroom for more than twenty years life had gone on in this peaceful fashion and during that time jenny could not remember the occurrence of a single episode worth recording rose cottage might have been the palace of the sleeping beauty during the hundred years spell the inhabitant of this hermitage was a puzzle to the gossips of thorston for after the industrious inquiries of twenty years they were as wise as ever touching his antecedents then he had arrived with kerry and his daughter a child of five and staying at the inn of st elfrida had looked about for a small place in the neighborhood rose cottage then empty and much neglected appeared to be the most secluded spot procurable so mr paynton set it in order patched the roof cultivated the garden and took up his abode therein here he had lived ever since rarely leaving it seeing few people and accepting no invitations the man was a recluse and disliked his fellowcreatures so when thorston became aware of his peculiarities he was left alone to live as he chose it may be guessed that his peculiar habits made him unpopular the vicar was friendly to the misanthrope for in paynton he found a kindred soul in the matter of books and many a pleasant evening did they spend in discussing literary subjects the bookroom was the pleasantest apartment in the house cosy and warm and lined throughout with volumes in the deep window stood the desk and here ferdinand paynton sat and wrote all day save when he took his usual stroll in the garden jenny had also grown up in the bookroom and as her education had been conducted by her father she was remarkably intelligent for a country maiden and could talk excellently on literature old and new for the softer graces of womanhood she was indebted to the care of mrs linton who from the first had taken a great interest in the motherless girl into this room came jenny with her mind full of the recent conversation with tait she threw down her musicbook on the table and went to kiss her father he was seated in his armchair instead of at his desk as usual and looked rather sternly at her as she bent over him tall and whitehaired with a sad face and a slim figure the old man looked singularly interesting his appearance being enhanced by his peculiar garb a dressing gown and a black skullcap indeed he was more like a mediaeval magician than an aged gentleman of the nineteenth century he looked like a man with a history which was doubtless the reason thorston gossips were so anxious concerning his past in country towns curiosity is quite a disease in the hurry of her entrance jenny had not noticed that a stranger was present but on greeting her father with a fond kiss she turned to see an elderly gentleman looking at her intently mr paynton explained the presence of the stranger with less than his usual suavity but from the tone of his voice jenny guessed that he was angry with her as it afterward appeared he had good reason to be jenny this is my friend mr hilliston hilliston jenny could not suppress a start of surprise even of alarm the prophecy of tait had been fulfilled sooner than she had expected there was something uncanny in the speedy accomplishment of a prognostication in which at the time she had hardly believed hilliston mr hilliston she repeated with a gasp of surprise already this time it was hillistons turn to be surprised and his face darkened with suspicion what am i to understand by already miss paynton he said quickly why that ismr tait began jenny in excuse when her father cut her short he rose from his chair and exclaimed in a voice of alarm tait then you have seen him already yes father said the girl in some bewilderment at his tone where in the church half an hour ago did he question you he did and you replied i answered his questions said jenny quietly if you refer to the larcher affair i do refer to it groaned her father sinking back into his chair unhappy girl you know not what trouble you have caused hilliston said nothing but stood moodily considering what was best to be done he saw that tait had been too clever for him and had anticipated his arrival yet he had come as speedily as possible not a moment had he lost since his arrival in eastbourne to seek out jenny and ask her to be silent but it was too late he had missed his opportunity by a few minutes and it only remained for him to learn how much the girl had told his enemy no wonder he hated tait the fellow was too dangerous a foeman to be despised we may yet mend matters he said judiciously if miss jenny will repeat so much of the conversation as she remembers why should i repeat it said jenny objecting to this interference as tait guessed she would there was nothing wrong in the conversation with mr tait that i know of there was nothing wrong in your telling linton the story you found in the canterbury observer replied hilliston dryly yet it would have been as well had you not done so father cried jenny turning toward the old man with an appealing gesture have i done wrong yes child he answered with a sigh very wrong but you sinned in ignorance kerry told me you had found the bundle and read about the trial but i passed that over now it is different you repeated it to young linton and mr hilliston tells me that all london knows the story through his book i am very sorry said jenny after a pause but i really did not know that it was wrong of me to act as i have done a bundle of old newspapers in a garret surely i was justified in reading themin telling frank what i conceived would be a good plot for a story i dont blame you miss paynton said hilliston kindly but it so happens that your father did not want that affair again brought before the public after all you have had less to do with it than fate than fate interrupted paynton with a groan good heavens am i to be paynton said hilliston in a warning voice i forgot muttered the old man with a shiver no moreno more jenny tell us what you said to mr tait considerably astonished the girl repeated the conversation as closely as she could remember both hilliston and her father listened with the keenest interest and seemed relieved when she finished it is not so bad as i expected said the former with a nod all you have to do paynton is to warn kerry against gratifying the curiosity of these young men they will be certain to ask him questions kerry will baffle them have no fear of that said paynton harshly and jenny you are not to refer to this subject again with mr tait am i not to speak to him her father interrogated hilliston with a look received a nod and answered accordingly you can speak to mr tait if you choose and no doubt you will be introduced by the vicar to mr larcher i place no prohibition on your speaking to them but only warn you to avoid the subject of the larcher affair promise i promise i am sorry i ever had anything to do with it say no more about it my dear said hilliston patting her shoulder how could you be expected to know but now you have been warned do not speak more of it we do not wish the unjustifiable curiosity of these idle young men to be gratified if you assist them to learn that which had better be hidden you will ruin me cried paynton with a passionate gesture father ruin you yes it means ruin disgraceperhaps death ah he broke down with a cry and hilliston taking jenny by the hand led her to the door go away my dear your father is ill he said in a whisper and pushing her outside the door locked it forthwith jenny stood in the passage in an agony of fear and surprise ruin disgrace death what was the meaning of those terrible words chapter xxvi an old servant leaving the two men to talk over their dark secrets together jenny went into the garden her brow burned as with fever and her understanding was confused by the thoughts which filled her mind what was the meaning of her fathers words why had mr hilliston come over from eastbourne to request her silence and what was the connection between him and her sole surviving parent she paced up and down the gravel walk vainly asking herself these questions and racking her brain as to possible answers hitherto the sky of her young life had been pure and serene but now by her own actas though she had unconsciously wrought a malignant spella sudden storm had arisen which threatened to overturn the foundations of her small world in the very unexpectedness of these events lay their terror as tait shrewdly surmised jenny was by no means satisfied with the evidence of hilliston at the trial of mrs larcher so far as she could judge from the unsatisfactory report in the canterbury observer he had given his version of the affair glibly enough yet there seemed to be something behind which he was anxious to suppress definitely enough he stated that he had not been at the laurels on the fatal night that he had not seen captain larcher since he left for london that he had not noted whether mrs larcher wore that allimportant dagger when she left the ballroom but pressed by an evidently suspicious counsel he accounted so minutely for every moment of his time his evidence had about it such an air of frank falseness that even unsophisticated jenny saw that the man was acting a part she did not believe him guilty of the crime but she was certain in her own mind that he knew who had struck the fatal blow nay more jenny thought it not impossible that he had been at the laurels after three that morning in spite of his denial and had seen the tragedy take place taits hints confirming her own doubts led her to gravely doubt the purity of mr hillistons motives then and now but what most perplexed the girl was the reason why the lawyer called to see her father on the subject and requested her silence she knew nothing of the tragedy save through the papersthose old faded papers dated which she had found in the garret she was not born when the murder took place so hilliston could not possibly wish to close her mouth for her own sake it was on her fathers account that jenny feared what could he know of an obscure crime perpetrated in a country town so many years ago she could recall no mention of his name in the report of the trial yet his words led her to suspect that he was more closely connected with that tragic past than he chose to admit could it be that her father was a relative of jeringham and knowing that jeringham was still alive wished to stop all inquiries made as to his whereabouts lest he should be punished for his early sin this was the only feasible suggestion she could make and yet it failed to satisfy her too exacting mind again there was kerry kerry certainly had a personal interest in the case else he could scarcely have related the episode of the scarfpin moreover he had been very angry when he found her with the papers in her possession and putting these two things together it would seem as if he knew more than he chose to tell jenny thought for the gratification of her own curiosity she would ask kerry to explain these matters and so went to the kitchen in search of him maria was there cross and deaf as usual and intimated that kerry had been out some two hours on a message this sounded extraordinary to jenny who knew that the old servant rarely left the house but it argued that her father was anxious to have him out of the way during the visit of hilliston what did it all mean a horrible fear seized the girl lest she should have set some machinery in motion which would end in crushing her unhappy father unhappy he had always been and given to seclusion there must be some reason for this and jenny felt a vague alarm which she could neither express nor display dearly enough had she paid for meddling with that old bundle of papers again she returned to the garden and went outside into the lane in order to see if kerry was in sight in a few minutes he came shuffling round the corner and his withered face relaxed into a grin when he saw her standing by the gate she was the apple of his eye and though he scolded her often himself yet he never let anyone say a word against her to look askance at jenny was to lose kerrys favor and win his enmity forever ah there ye are me darling miss jenny he said with the familiarity of an old servant watching and waiting for poor old kerry sure it is a sunbeam you are in this dark lane kerry i want to speak to you the change in her tone struck him at once and he peered sharply into her fresh face with his bleared eyes a look of wonder stole into them at the sight of her white cheeks and he crossed himself before replying so as to avert any evil that might befall kerry always lived in a state of suspense waiting for a bolt from the blue jennys scared face almost assured him that it had fallen what is it alannah he asked pausing at the gate is anything wrong oh no nothing is wrong kerry what could be wrong said jenny nervously only papa has a visitor augh his riverence no not the vicar a strangeror at least almost a stranger she said half to herself it is many years since mr hilliston came here mr hilliston cried kerry with an ashen face the black curse on him and his what is he doing with the master i dont know kerry replied jenny rather astonished at the old mans vehemence he has been with father over two hours and i was sent away muttered kerry under his breath sorrow befall you black attorney that you are never did you cross a threshold without bringing grief to all hearts it was an evil day we saw you and an evil day when we see you again he uplifted his hands as though about to invoke a curse on hilliston then unexpectedly letting them fall he turned sharply on jenny how did he come miss by train from eastbourneno doubt he walked from the station ill drive him back exclaimed kerry in quite an amiable voice sure hell be weary on his legs why not ill borrow his riverences trap and the little mare with the white foreleg but kerry father might not like it get along with ye said kerry cheerfully sure his riverence has offered the trap a hundred times ill take it on myself to explain to the master keep mr hilliston here till he sees me arriving up this roada dirty one it is too bad cess to it he was hurrying off when jenny stopped him she saw that his borrowing of the vicars honey trap was a mere excuse to get hilliston to himself for half an hour and rendered more curious than ever by kerrys artful way of arranging matters she ran after him and pulled his sleeve kerry kerry has mr hilliston come over to see papa about the larcher affair how should i know retorted kerry relapsing into his crusty humor for shame miss jenny is it your business or mine it is mine said the girl with a resolute look on her face mr hilliston came over to ask me to be silent about what was contained in those papers you took from me how does he know of that miss because all london now knows the story of the larcher affair augh get away with ye sure its a fool youre making of old kerry said the servant in an incredulous and angry tone indeed i am doing no such thing i did not know there was any harm in reading those papers and i did so but i did more than that kerry i told the story of the tragedy to frank linton and he has written a book on the trial a book with the real names no the names are fictitious and the scene is laid in a different place but the whole story is told in the novel does the master know asked kerry muttering something between his teeth he does now mr hilliston saw the book in london and came over to tell him and to ask me to say no more about it whats that for anyhow demanded kerry who seemed to scent new danger because mr larcher is here kerry flung up his hands with a cry of astonishment mr larcher miss who are you telling about oh mr claude larcher said jenny rather alarmed for he had gripped her arm the son of the deceased man he is staying at the manor house with mr tait for a few minutes kerry stood looking at the ground in silence up to the present he had succeeded in preserving his calm but the last piece of news upset him altogether and he burst into violent speech augh its sorrow that is coming to this house and the black curse will be on the threshold cold will the hearth be soon and the old master will be driven out ohone and we and time will have sent him into the cold world whirra whirra jenny was so dumfounded by the unexpected eloquence of the old man that she could do nothing but stare at him he caught her eye and seeing that he had been indiscreet in so betraying himself he cut short his lamentations wiped his eyes and relapsed once more into the crusty faithful kerry whom she knew but he gave her a word of warning before he took his departure say nothing of this miss jenny he remarked sure its an old fool i am keep a silent tongue as the master and lawyer wishes you to do and then please the saints things will go the better but kerry before you go tell me what is mr hilliston to my father he is your fathers best friend miss said kerry with emphasis his best and his worst and with that enigmatic reply he hurried off down the lane in the direction of the vicarage leaving jenny in a state of bewilderment she could understand nothing and at that moment sorely needed some friend with whom she could consult kerry gave her no satisfaction and spoke so indefinitely that his conversation mystified in place of enlightening her it was no use to make a confidant of frank linton as notwithstanding his london reputation which she had greatly contributed to jenny did not consider him sufficiently steady to be told of the commotion raised by his novel in her immediate circle she could therefore discuss the matter with no one and so annoyed was she by the whole affair that she by no means could bring herself to go back to the house while hilliston was yet there he would be gone she trusted in another half hour or so and pending his departure she strolled along the lane in the hope of evading him but she only escaped scylla to fall into charybdis for as she turned the corner tait and claude met her almost face to face jenny would have given much to escape this awkward meeting and intimated her wish for solitude by passing the young men with a curt bow the sight of claude the memory of his fathers death coupled with the suspicions she entertained wrought her up to a pitch of excitement which she had great difficulty in concealing she was therefore greatly annoyed when tait took off his hat and placed himself directly in her path the little man thought it was too favorable an opportunity for introduction to be overlooked dont go away miss paynton he said smiling i wish to introduce you to my friend mr larcher claude this is miss paynton of whom you have heard me speak how do you do miss paynton said claude with a suave bow i hope you will pardon the irregularity of this introduction this remark made jenny laugh and set her more at ease she was not particular as to forms and ceremonies herself and the idea that a young man should apologize for such a trifle struck her as ridiculous moreover a glance assured her that mr larcher was by no means a formidable person he was decidedly goodlooking and had pleasant blue eyes with a kindly look so speech and glance broke the ice at once between them do you stay here long mr larcher she asked pointedly ignoring her previous conversation with tait as long as i may he replied smiling london does not invite me at this time of the year i prefer the fragrant country to the dusty town he is a true lover of the fields miss paynton broke in tait admiring her selfpossession and insisted that i should come out for a walk so that he might lose no time in steeping himself in the sweetness of nature quite idyllic isnt it quite said jenny lightly goodby at present mr larcher i am going to the vicarage and have not a moment to spare mr tait can i speak with you a minute tait obeyed with alacrity and claude was left to muse on the fresh charm of jenny and the sweetness of her voice her trim figure her exquisite neatness and springing gait made him admire her greatly and when she tripped away with a smiling nod he was so taken up in watching her that he failed to observe the grave face with which tait joined him as i thought said the latter when they resumed their walk what is up now oh nothing more than usual hilliston has called on paynton already he is there now you dont say so i did not think he would have been so smart however you have stolen a march on him do you intend to see him now to wait his coming out why no said tait after a moments deliberation rather let us go home again that hilliston may not see us i wish to wait and see what excuse he will make for not calling on you youll get a letter full of lies tomorrow claude chapter xxvii a glimpse of the past hilliston remained a considerable time with his friend and it was not until sunset that he left the house he had a satisfied look on his face as though the interview had answered his expectations and so lifted up in spirit did he appear that he stepped out into the lane as jauntily as though he were quite a young man it was over three miles to the railway station and he would be obliged to walk back but the prospect did not annoy him in the least on the contrary so great a load had been removed from his mind by the late conversation that he felt fit to walk twice the distance yet such unusual lightheartedness might have recalled to his mind the scotch superstition regarding its probable reason as he walked smartly to the end of the lane the sun had just dropped behind the hills leaving a trail of red glory behind him against the crimson background rose the gables and chimney of the manor house and the sight recalled to hilliston the fact that young larcher was staying in the mansion he paused doubtfully not certain whether to go in or pass on for in his many schemes the least slip might prove prejudicial to their accomplishment if i call in i can say my visit here was to do so he thought but it is too late and though claude might believe me the little man would certainly be suspicious besides they are sure to find out from jenny paynton that i have seen her father no i shant go in but tonight i will write a letter stating that paynton is a client whom i called to see about business i have made it all right there and it will take a cleverer man than tait to upset my plans this time his meditations were interrupted by the rattle of wheels and he turned to see kerry driving a dappled pony in a small chaise the old man distorted his withered face into a grotesque grin of welcome and jumped out with extraordinary alacrity when he came alongside hilliston augh augh sir said kerry touching his hat in military fashion its a sight for sore eyes to see ye miss jenny told me you had walked over from the station so i just borrowed the trap of his riverence the vicar to take you back that is very kind of you kerry replied hilliston in his most genial manner i am glad to accept your offer and escape the walk you drive and ill sit beside you kerry did as he was told and in a few minutes the trap containing the pair was rattling through the street at a good pace shortly they left the village behind and emerged into the open country the road wound to right and left past farmhouses under bending trees behind hedgerows and occasionally passed over a stone bridge spanning a trickling brook matted with cresses all this time neither of them had spoken as each was seemingly wrapped up in his own thoughts but as a matter of fact they were thinking of each other kerry wished to speak to hilliston but did not know how to begin while hilliston was in the same predicament regarding kerry it was the latter who finally began the conversation and he did so in a way which would have startled a less brave man than the lawyer at the moment they were crossing a rather broad stream with a swift current and kerry pulled up the pony midway between the parapets of stone which protected the sides of the rude bridge rather astonished at this stoppage for which he could assign no reason hilliston roused himself from his musings and looked inquiringly at kerry the mans eyes significant and angry were fixed on him in anything but a friendly manner do you know what im thinking sir he said coolly flicking the ponys back with the whip no kerry replied hilliston with equal coolness is it of anything important it might be to you sir replied kerry dryly i was just thinking whether it wouldnt be a good thing to send horse and trap and you and i into the water then there would be an end to your black heart and your black schemes that is very possible kerry said hilliston who knew his man but before going to extremities you had better make certain that you are acting for the best without me your master is ruined well talk it over sir answered kerry and with a smart flick of his whip sent the pony across the bridge when they were over and were trotting between hedgerows he resumed the conversation why have ye come here again sir he asked abruptly we were quit of you five years ago and now you come to harry the master once more i come for his own good kerry ah now dont be after calling me kerry theres no one here and it is denis bantry i am to you mr francis hilliston the lawyer winced at the satirical emphasis placed on the name but judged it wise to humor the old man kerry as he called himself now could be very obstinate and disagreeable when he chose so knowing his powers in this respect hilliston wisely conducted the conversation on as broad lines as was possible nevertheless he carried the war into the enemys camp by blaming kerry for not taking better care of the bundle of papers which through his negligence had fallen into the hands of jenny and how was i to know sir retorted kerry querulously the papers were safely put away in the garret and miss jenny had no call to go there well kerry you see what it has led to the account of the tragedy is all over london and what of that sir wasnt the account of it all over horriston twentyfive years ago no doubt said hilliston coolly but that is all over and done with it is useless to dwell on the past and its errors but now captain larchers son is bent on finding out the truth and why shouldnt he sir i dont think you need ask the question kerry replied the lawyer in so significant a tone that the old servant turned away his head it is not desirable that claude larcher should be enlightened we know what took place on that night if no one else does and for more reasons than one it is advisable that we should keep our knowledge to ourselves augh said kerry gruffly you dont want it known that you were in the garden on that night sir i do not answered hilliston with hasty emphasis i spoke falsely at the trial to save mrs larcher i rather think you did so yourself kerry for the masters sakefor the masters sake as for the mistress she brought all the trouble on our heads i lied sir and you lied but she wasnt worth it but is there to be trouble over it now mr hilliston no not if you baffle the inquiries of those young men at the manor house they will meet you and question you and get the truth out of you if they can whether they do or not all depends upon yourself you leave it to me sir said kerry confidently ill manage to send them away without being a bit the wiser and now mr hilliston that this is settled i would speak to you about my sister mona hilliston changed color but nevertheless retained sufficient composure to fix his eyes on the mans face with a sad smile what of her kerry he asked in a melancholy tone you know she is dead and gone augh augh but her grave sir you must tell me where it is for i have it in my mind to go and see it what would be the good of you doing that said hilliston disapprovingly because i was harsh with her sir if she did wrong she suffered for it and it was wicked of me to let her go as i did where is her grave sir in chiswick cemetery said hilliston as the chaise stopped at the railway station if you come up to london and call at my office i will tell you where to find it kerry was profuse in his thanks and touching his hat gratefully accepted the shilling which hilliston put into his hand but when the train containing hilliston started for eastbourne he threw away the money and shook his fist after the retreating carriages not a word did he say but the frown on his face grew deeper and deeper as he got into the trap again and drove slowly back to thorston evidently he trusted hilliston no more than did tait or jenny it was now quite dark for the daylight and afterglow had long since vanished from the western skies and the moon was not yet up only the stars were visible here and there in the cloudy sky and finding their light insufficient to drive by kerry got down and lighted the carriage lamp heaven only knows of what he was thinking as he drove along the dusky lanes the past unrolled itself before his eyes and what he saw there made him groan and heave deep sighs but there was no use in so indulging his memories and thinking of his master kerry braced himself up to see what could be done toward meeting the dangers which seemed to threaten on all sides when he delivered the trap again to the groom of the vicar he hit on an idea which he proceeded to carry out instead of going back at once to rose cottage he borrowed a piece of paper and a pencil from the groom and laboriously traced a few lines by the light of the stable lantern putting this missive in his pocket he went off in the direction of the manor house but leaving the public road he skirted the low stone wall which divided it from the adjacent fields kerry knew every inch of the ground and even in the darkness had no difficulty in guiding himself to his destination this was a vantage point at the end of the wall whence he could see into a sitting room of the house in a few minutes kerry was perched on this wall busily engaged in tying his letter to an ordinary sized stone almost immediately below him the mansion stretched in a kind of abrupt right angle in which was set two wide windows overlooking a bed of flowers these were open to the cool night air and the blinds had been drawn down so that kerry from his lofty hidingplace could see right into the room a tall brass lamp stood at one end and under this sat claude larcher smoking and thinking the glare of the lamp fell full on his freshcolored face and light hair so that kerry felt as though he were gazing at a phantom out of that dread past hes as like his father as two peas muttered kerry devouring the picture with his eyes a fine boy and an honest gentleman augh augh to think that i have nursed him on my knee when he was a bit of lad and now im here telling him to go away but its better that than the other a curse on those who brought him here and put sorrow into his heart thus muttering kerry threw the stone lightly through the window it fell heavily on the floor within a few feet of claude who sprang to his feet with an exclamation not waiting to see the result kerry hastily tumbled off the wall jumped the ditch and made off in the darkness by a circuitous route he regained rose cottage and entered into the kitchen worn out in body and mind he had done his duty so far as in him lay and mentally prayed that the result might tend to remove the threatened danger meanwhile claude had picked up the stone and ran to the window he could see nothing for kerry was already halfway across the fields he could not even guess whence the stone had been thrown all was silent and though he listened intently he could not hear the sound of retreating footsteps with some wonderment he untied the paper from the stone and smoothed it out it was badly written and badly spelled and ran as follows bewar of danger claude larcher tak a frinds advise and go quick away there was no signature and the young man was looking at it in growing perplexity when tait entered the room what did you shout out about he asked carelessly i heard you in the next room you would have shouted also replied larcher holding out the paper this was flung into the room tied round a stone you dont say so who threw it i cant say i rushed to the window at once but saw no sign of anyone what do you think of the hint therein contained tait read the anonymous communication pondered over it and finally delivered his opinion by uttering a name hilliston he said confidently hilliston nonsense said claude sharply why should he deal in underhand ways of this sort if he wanted me to go away he could have called and urged me to do so but thisi dont believe hilliston would condescend to such trickery when a man is in a fix he will descend to anything to get himself out of it replied tait placing the paper in his pocketbook ill keep this and perhaps before many days are over ill have an opportunity of proving to you that i speak truly who else wants you to go away besides hilliston kerrydenis bantry might i doubt whether kerry knows that you are here you must give matters time to develop themselves as the inmates of rose cottage cant know all about us within twentyfour hours what between your confessions to jenny and hillistons own knowledge i think theyll know a good deal in one way or another they can know as much as they like said tait quietly but we know more and if it comes to a tug of war i think you and i can win against hilliston and co but come outside and let us examine the top of the wall do you think the stone was thrown from there asked claude as they went out into the garden i fancy so from your description light this candle the night was so still that the flame of the candle hardly wavered tait gave it to claude to hold and easily climbed up the wall by thrusting the toes of his boots in among the loose stones he examined the top carefully and then getting the light tied it to a piece of string and lowered it on the other side in a few minutes he came down again with a satisfied look as i thought he said blowing out the candle someone has been on that wall and thrown the stone from there i saw the marks of feet on the other side the man who delivered the letter jumped the ditch and made off across the fields you dont think it is hilliston said claude doubtfully no but i think it is an emissary of hilliston perhaps denis bantry tait said larcher after a pause from hillistons visit to paynton from the way in which paynton persistently secludes himself from the world and from the knowledge we possess that the information for lintons book came out of that cottage i have come to a conclusion what is that i believe that ferdinand paynton is none other than mark jeringham who killed my father chapter xxviii preparing the ground aware that claude would hear sooner or later of his visit to paynton the lawyer wrote to forestall the information skillfully alleging a business engagement as his excuse for the visit i would have called on you he continued but that it was already late when i left my client mr paynton and i had to return to eastbourne in time for dinner however i hope to come over again shortly and then you must tell me how you are getting on with your case i am afraid you will learn nothing at thorston he knows better than that said tait to whom the letter was shown he is aware that we have cut the ground from under his feet so far as jenny is concerned moreover i am certain that he is the author of that anonymous letter of a few days since do you really think he came here to ask miss paynton to keep silence asked claude returning the letter to his pocket my dear fellow i am certain of it and he also wishes to show us that he knows paynton so as to warn us against asking questions in that quarter indeed i think it is useless to do so said larcher doubtfully you know we called yesterday and were refused admittance oh i spoke to mr linton about that replied tait easily it seems that such is invariably the case as this hermit will see no one why what can be his reason for such persistent seclusion i cant say unless your surmise is correct and he is jeringham i am sure he is said claude emphatically why was the bundle of newspapers containing an account of the murder found in his house what is denis bantry doing there if paynton is not jeringham the shoe is on the other foot remarked tait dryly what is denis bantry doing there if paynton is jeringham you forget claude that we suspect jeringham as the criminal if this were so or if paynton were jeringham i hardly think your fathers devoted servant would be at his beck and call unless added tait as an after thought denis bantry is also implicated as we imagine i cant understand it cried claude catching up his hat in place of growing clearer the matter seems to become more involved how do you intend to proceed it seems to me that we are at a dead stop by no means my dear fellow there is kerry alias denis bantry to be examined we must learn the truth from him he wont tell it particularly if our suspicions are correct perhaps not but i have provided against that failure you must appeal to him as the son of his old master while i am absent absent where are you going cant you guess to horriston of course in order to pick up what information i can there are sure to be people still alive who remember your father and mother who recollect the trial and are still acquainted with mr hilliston i expect to learn a good deal about that gentleman there and perhaps something about jeringham and his disappearance humph i doubt if you will be successful replied claude gloomily however there is no harm in trying where are we going now i told you before we set out to call on the vicar as we cant see jenny at her fathers house we must meet her in another persons she is like a daughter to mrs linton and is constantly at the vicarage and no doubt young linton loves her im sure he does have you any objection demanded tait slyly none none said claude hastily i have only met her for a few minutes you know but she is a remarkably pretty girl and from what you say seems to be clever too good by half for that idiot idiot john parver novelist the lion of the season an idiot you forget he wrote the book of the year so he says responded larcher dryly but for my part i believe jenny paynton has more to do with it than he i have no doubt she wrote it further conversation was put an end to for the time being by their arrival at the vicarage mr linton a stiff old gentleman with a severe face received them very kindly and unbent so far as in him lay he had been acquainted with tait for many years and it was during a visit to him that the little man had seen and purchased thorston manor knowing him to be wealthy and being well disposed toward him for his own sake mr linton was anxious to make the lord of the manor at home in his house vicars cannot afford to neglect opulent parishioners i hope mr tait that you will shortly take up your abode altogether at the manor said he pompously i am not in favor of an absentee landlord oh youll see a good deal of me mr linton i assure you i am too much in love with the beauties of the place to stay long away moreover i am not a roamer like my friend larcher here it is necessary with me said claude smiling i assure you sir i am not the wandering vagabond tait would make me out to be it is proper to see the world said the vicar with heavy playfulness and when you have made your fortune in far countries mr larcher you may settle down in this favored spot i could wish for nothing better mr linton but the time is yet far off for that my son is also fond of traveling continued mr linton now that he is making a good income he tells me that it is his intention to go to italy you are proud of your son mr linton said tait genially without doubt without doubt the book he wrote is clever although i do not care for sensational writing myself it pays the taste of the age is in the direction of sensationalism certainly certainly and i suppose it is only natural that francis should write some frivolity he was never a deep scholar what does astonish me added the vicar raising his eyebrows is that a student like mr paynton should desire to read the book tait and claude glanced at one another with the same thought in their minds respecting this information informed by hilliston of the use made by linton of the larcher affair paynton was anxious to see in what light the case had been placed this curiosity argued that the recluse had been one of the actors in the tragedy if so he could only be jeringham since captain larcher was dead and they knew both denis bantry and francis hilliston the vicar worthy man was quite ignorant of the effect produced by this announcement nor was he undeceived by the artful reply of tait naturally mr paynton wants to read the book said the latter diplomatically if i mistake not he has a great liking for frank indeed yes responded mr linton thankfully he taught francis latin along with jenny he would have made a scholar of him i am indeed sorry that my son failed to profit by his association with so brilliant a student he might have written a better book clearly the vicar was by no means impressed with the sensationalism of a whim of fate and would rather his son had written an honest pamphlet or a grave tragedy than have produced so meretricious a piece of threevolume frivolity however he had no time to talk further on this matter for as he ended his speech the subject of it entered the room with jenny and mrs linton the former started and flushed as she saw claude and remembered his romantic history and their former meeting my wife mr larcher you know mr tait of course my dear miss paynton mr larcher and my son i have already had the pleasure of meeting mr frank linton in town said claude holding out his hand the young author took it willingly enough and then the company resolved itself into two groups the vicar and his wife conversing with tait while claude seconded by frank made himself agreeable to jenny neither the lady nor the author were pleased with this arrangement as the former felt uneasy when she remembered her fathers position while the latter felt jealous of claudes superior good looks frank linton was of course ignorant that he was in the company of the son of the horriston victim he did not even know the names of the people or that of the place and had simply written the story on the meager information afforded by jenny he could not therefore understand the interest which those two displayed in one another and so grew jealous on seeing it it would be useless to report this conversation which in the main consisted of frivolities warned by her father jenny was on her guard and carefully avoided any allusion to the larcher affair on his part not knowing the reticence jenny had practised with regard to linton claude tried to lead the conversation into a grove likely to deal with the novel and case at one point he did this so clumsily that jenny spoke outright on the subject let us talk no more of that mr larcher she said quietly i told mr tait all i knew the other day i have to thank you began claude when she cut him short and turned the conversation into another channel the young man was disappointed in this but nevertheless fell in with her humor and when following taits example he arose to go he was quite charmed with this country girl i hope you will come soon again said the vicar hospitably as he shook hands we must have a party shortly our friends mr and mrs hilliston have promised to come and stay the night during next week another move and a foolish one thought tait but said aloud we will be charmed mr linton the more so as mr hilliston is my friends guardianor rather was jenny looked startled at this and her rich color faded when she said goodby to claude the mystery of the affair was beginning to worry her and she could by no means understand the relation of hilliston to larcher hilliston who was the guardian and friend hilliston who judging from the veto put on her speaking was inimical to claude untroubled by their conversation claude held but one idea when he left the house with tait im afraid i am in love said he looking at his friend what at first sight impossible shakspere did not think so or he would not have written romeo and juliet yes i believe i am in love jenny is as fresh and fair and pure and sweet as a mountain daisy you had better tell linton so said tait dryly whereat larcher laughed he was too confident in his own powers to be timorous of rivalry with the celebrated individual there is no need to tell him he said lightly the poor man was eaten up with jealousy when i spoke to miss paynton by the way did you see that she changed color when you mentioned that hilliston had been my guardian it was natural that she should hilliston is a suspicious person in her eyes and this discovery will perplex her still more regarding his relations with you jenny is a very clever young woman but i wonder if she is clever enough to put this and that together to arrive at what conclusion at the most logical conclusion that her father is jeringham whom she suspects of the crime chapter xxix kerry having as he considered prepared the ground by acquainting claude with the notabilities of the neighborhood tait next proceeded to secure an interview with kerry this was by no means an easy matter as either by accident or design kerry eluded all the young mens attempts to interview him hitherto he had been accustomed to fish daily in the lax but now doubtless by direction of his master he forsook his customary sport for some considerable time his absence speedily roused taits suspicions hilliston has succeeded well said he after one of these futile attempts to see the old servant he has put jeringham on his guard paynton you mean observed claude looking up from his plate they were at breakfast when this conversation took place i thought you had determined in your own mind that he was jeringham no said claude coloring a little i have come round to your opinion in the matter if paynton were jeringham i dont think denis bantry would be in his service ah remarked tait sarcastically is that the result of reflection or of love of love i dont understand you yes you do claude you are in love with jenny the last week has only deepened your first impressions i believe she likes you also and so i foresee a marriage which will rob me of my friend i am not so certain of that as you are said larcher after a pause miss paynton has given me no hint of her feelings and our acquaintance is yet young even if i did design to make her my wife i would have to gain her consent and that of her father judging from payntons present attitude that consent would most probably be refused tait did not immediately reply but stared out of the window with an absent look in his eyes the remark changed the current of his ideas i wonder who paynton can be he said at length with some hesitation that he is connected with the case i am certain from the way in which he has profited by the warning of hilliston like yourself i have my doubts regarding his identity with jeringham because of denis bantry who is he i must go to horriston tomorrow and find out and what am i to do in the meantime hunt out kerry and learn the truth said tait coolly i think after all it will be best for you to see him alone i am a stranger and he wont speak before me but to you the son of his old master he may open his heart once he does that you may learn the truth i doubt it well there is a chance whatever tie binds denis to paynton you must not forget that he is irish the irish are an impulsive and excitable race so it is just possible that his feelings may carry him away in your presence and he may tell you all we wish to know do you think he can solve the mystery yes he was in the house when jeringham came home with your mother he picked up the garnet pin and it may be can tell us to whom it belongs it may be the property of hilliston as is stated in the novel on the other hand it may belong to your father or to jeringham of one point i am sure the person who owned the pin killed your father kerry or rather denis bantry knows the owner and consequently the murderer if so why did he not denounce him there you puzzle me said tait rising to his feet that is one of the many mysteries of this case only denis can explain and he may do so to you i shall stay at home this morning and prepare for my journey to horriston but you had better take your fishing rod and go to your post the post alluded to was on the banks of the lax where for the past week the young men had patiently waited for the appearance of denis on this morning claude found himself alone for the first time and sat down with a disconsolate air for he had little hope that denis would make his appearance in this surmise he was wrong for scarcely had he been seated half an hour when the irishman came slowly along on the opposite bank of the river he was a little old man gray as a badger with stooped shoulders and a crosslooking face without vouchsafing a look in claudes direction he prepared his fishing tackle and began industriously to whip the stream hardly knowing how to break the ice larcher silently continued his sport and the two divided by the water stood like statues on opposite banks after a time denis who had been cunningly taking stock of claude and wondering why his letter had not produced the effect intended moved down to where the stream narrowed itself between large stones determined to invent some excuse for speaking larcher followed after a time and stepped out on to a bowlder apparently to throw his line into a likely looking pool being within reach he flung his line and the next moment it was entangled in that of kerrys im sorry quite an accident said claude noting the wrath on kerrys face let me disentangle it he jumped into the brown water and before kerry could make any objection was across on the other side gripping the lines without a word the irishman let him separate the two lines and then busied himself with fixing a fly nettled at this determined silence claude spoke i wish to speak with you he said tapping the other on the shoulder is it to me ye speak replied kerry with an admirable look of surprise and what has the like of you sir to say to me a great deal do you know who i am sure an i do sir the friend of mr tait you are no less but my name do you know it bad luck to this stream theres never a fish in it grumbled kerry with a convenient attack of deafness claude was in nowise angered that is very clever kerry he said but an how do you know my name is kerry are you surprised that i should know it i am that replied kerry sharply i never set eyes on you before oh yes you didtwentyfive years ago begorra thats a lie anyhow muttered kerry under his breath with an uneasy wriggle it is not a lie and you know it my man said larcher firmly it is no use your pretending ignorance i know who you are devil a doubt of it kerry you called me yes because you are known by that name here but at horriston claude stopped he saw the hands of the old man grip the rod so tight that the knuckles whitened the name had produced the effect he intended so almost without a pause he continued and aimed another blow at kerrys imperturbability at horriston he resumed you were known as denis bantry was i now said kerry prepared for the attack augh to think of it and where might horriston be sir you ought to know that denis your honor will be after giving me the name of a friend of yours quite right rejoined claude seizing the opportunity you werenay you area friend of mine i am the little lad you carried in your armsto whom you told stories and sang songs children forget a great deal but i have not forgotten you denis in dogged silence the old man turned his head away intently bent on his sport but suddenly he raised the cuff of his coat and wiped away a betraying tear seeing that he had touched the mans sympathy claude followed up his advantage you are not going to deny me denis are you he said entreatingly i am down here on an errand which you must guess if hilliston the curse of cromwell on him said kerry under his breath if hilliston told you to keep silent said claude affecting to take no notice of the interjection which confirmed his suspicions i the son of your dead master want you to speak i wish to find out who killed my father i wish to punish him for you know his name kerry turned furiously on the young man but it seemed to claude that his anger was feigned to hide a deeper emotion it is a dirty informer youd have me be he cried with a stamp of his foot to betray him whose bread i eat ill tell you nothing for its that much i know denis im not denis its kerry i am i know nothing of horriston or of you sir go away with ye young gentleman and dont be after disgracing an old servant to play the spy and cheat then still breathing fury he rushed away but paused some distance off to raise his hands to the sky with an appealing gesture the impulsive irish nature had broken through diplomatic reserve and fearful of saying too much kerry saved himself by flight claude guessed this and forebore to follow him i have broken the ice at all events he said to himself when returning to the manor to tell tait the next time i may be fortunate enough to force the truth out of him he knows it i am certain he hates hilliston and loves me i can easily guess with whom he sympathizes in spite of his master he is denis sure enough but who is paynton it was impossible to say chapter xxx mrs bezel again on returning home claude found that tait contrary to his expressed intention had gone out dormer who was packing a portmanteau for the horriston journey could not inform larcher when his master would be back but ventured an opinion that he would certainly return to luncheon meanwhile he handed to claude some letters which had just arrived and with these the young man managed to pass a fairly uncomfortable hour uncomfortable because one of the letters was from mrs bezel and proved of so puzzling a character that larcher was in a fever of impatience to discuss it with tait the little man returned to luncheon as was surmised by dormer and was met in the hall by claude with the open letter of mrs bezel in his hand my dear fellow why did you go out said larcher complainingly i have so much to tell you i have seen kerry and now here is a letter from mrs bezel what is she on the stage again said tait eagerly let me see the letter not yet replied claude putting it promptly behind his back you must first tell me why you left the house when you ought to be packing up for horriston tait shrugged his shoulders bowed to the inevitable and went into the dining room here he sat at the table and began to carve some cold beef thereby throwing claude into a rage you coldblooded little monster he cried tapping on the table will you satisfy my curiosity why should i said tait grinning you wont satisfy mine then read the letter retorted claude throwing it across the table to his surprise tait placed it on one side not yet he said resuming his carving we must have a talk first have some beef i dont want beef but information you shall have both said tait calmly do you prefer beer or claret beer replied larcher resignedly falling in with the tricksey humor of his friend tait was a man with whom it was impossible to quarrel dormer fill mr larchers glass put the claret jug beside me and leave the room we will wait on ourselves as stolid as a wooden image dormer obeyed these instructions and wheeled out of the room tait ate a few mouthfuls of beef drank a glass of claret and prepared to talk his first remark was a bombshell i have seen paynton said he slowly the deuce you have cried claude in surprise and how did you manage to take his castle by storm easily enough by the help of a lie and a little strategy i went out to see if you were at your post and caught sight of kerry crossing the fields as i knew jenny would be at the lintonsfor she goes there to see the old lady every morningi guessed that rose cottage would be undefended so back i ran to the house picked up a book which i had promised to lend the young lady and went to pay my visit how did you get inside the gate it is generally locked it wasnt on this occasion replied tait complacently i opened it and walked in to find old paynton strolling in the garden catching sight of me he turned back to reenter the house but luckily i was between him and the door so we met face to face what kind of a man is he to look at oh a finelooking old chap with white hair and beard a skullcap and a dressing gown quite the get up of a necromancer did he speak to you asked claude having considered this description he asked me politely what my business was whereupon i presented the book and mentioned that it was for his daughter he replied that she was at the lintons and would be back soon when he would give her the book himself then he asked me to excuse him and bowed me out of the gate but added tait with emphasis not before i had mentioned that mr claude larcher was staying with me did my name produce any effect rather paynton changed color and mumbled something unintelligible then he turned his back and walked quickly into the house leaving me to close the gate myself depend upon it he knows something claude but his name isnt mentioned in connection with the case of course not paynton is a feigned one and as i have said before there are no doubt actors in the tragedy of whom we know nothing there is one of that sort mentioned here said larcher picking up mrs bezels letter read that tait and see what you make of it it proved to be a short note hastily written and ran as follows my dear claude if you are still in doubt as to who murdered your father ask mr hilliston to tell you about louisa sinclair who lived at horriston twentyfive years ago she knows your affectionate mother margaret bezel louisa sinclair repeated tait slowly having mastered the contents of this letter no i never heard of her it is strange that hilliston has never mentioned her name no doubt he had good reasons for not doing so said claude bitterly you need not look so astonished tait i have long ago come round to your opinion of my old guardian his intimacy with paynton and the effect of his visit on kerry would convince menot to speak of that anonymous letter ah kerry refused to speak he would not say a word and moreover stated that he was not denis bantry that he had never heard of horriston in fact he acted his part excellently well till the last then he broke down and afraid of letting the cat out of the bag he ran away exactly what his master did said tait thoughtfully depend upon it claude we will learn the truth from one of those two if you think so why go to horriston because i want to learn the real name of paynton and moreover here is an additional reason i must find out louisa sinclair there is no mention of her in the case quite true and there is no mention of paynton but for all that he knows about it oh you may be sure there are circumstances to be discovered at horriston which never came to light at the trial my mother is anxious for the mystery to be cleared up so i see and i am glad of it said tait with an affectation of carelessness i thought she was too ill to take an interest in the matter am i to ask hilliston about this woman said claude looking up in some doubt no replied his friend after a few moments deliberation our success in this depends on keeping hilliston in the dark concerning our movements if we tell him too much he may thwart us as he has done already in this paynton business say nothing about louisa sinclair or about my visit to horriston tell him i have gone to town and let him figure out the reason for himself by the way when do you see him on friday evening both he and his wife are coming to dine and stop all night at the vicarage you may be sure hilliston will put me through a thorough crossexamination regarding your absence refer him to mr linton said tait coolly i am writing to that gentleman telling him i am unexpectedly called to town on particular business what that business is hilliston will be anxious to know i dont think hell enjoy his evening at all a guilty conscience mars all pleasure when do you leave by the train this afternoon ill write you about my discoveries as soon as i find out anything worth scribbling about youll find nothing said claude dolefully after fiveandtwenty years ill find out who louisa sinclair is and then astonish hilliston with the extent of my information regarding paynton i am not so certain that discovery rests between you and denis bantry ill do my best but i am doubtful replied claude and so the conversation terminated for the time being it left a lasting impression on the two who took part in it tait duly took his departure with dormer leaving claude in possession of the house as he leaned out of the window of the smoking carriage he said a last word to his friend dont tell hilliston about my going to horriston he said significantly but if you get a chance inform his wife of the fact why ill tell you that when i come back said tait as the train moved slowly off give her the information and observe the effect it will astonish you but tait counted without his host he was ignorant of mrs hillistons powers of selfcontrol chapter xxxi an evening at the vicarage the vicar of thorston was a severe man a trifle narrow in his views and imperious of temper but he was also fond of good cheer and hospitalityvirtues which cover a multitude of sins those who sat at his table were sure of a capital dinner and an excellent glass of wine for his cook and cellar were both undeniable report said that mr linton was afraid of his cook for that good lady had a hot temper and feared no man many were the battles between her and the vicar but being a perfect mistress of the culinary art she invariably came off victor she had her faults but she was a jewel of a cook and was valued accordingly on this special evening the vicar had assembled ten people including himself round his hospitable board mr and mrs hilliston were the principal guests and claude was also honored with special attention an old couple named densham garrulous and pleasant had likewise been invited and they with their daughter and jenny paynton completed the party to claude was assigned miss paynton while to frank linton was given the densham damsel an arrangement which was anything but pleasing to that jealous young man or indeed to miss densham who thought the famous author a grumpy creature he was too preoccupied to please her taste claude thought he had never seen mrs hilliston to such disadvantage she appeared ill at ease and was haggard and pale of face looking every year of her age even the rich dress and splendid jewels she wore failed to conceal the ravages of time and in the neighborhood of the fresh beauty of the two girls she seemed an old woman she felt this herself for claude noted that she threw an envious glance at the blooming faces of her rivals and surveyed her wan looks in the nearest glass with a sigh to her the party was purgatory nor did the lawyer appear to enjoy himself he was moody and fretful though every now and then he forced himself to be merry but his laugh was hollow and the careworn expression of his face belied his untimely mirth sometimes he stole a furtive look at claude and seemed to brood over the young mans changed manner for do what he could larcher deeming his old friend an enemy could not behave with his former cordiality he was illsuited for a diplomat the dinner passed off with moderate success frank was complimented on his book and the prosy couple had to be told the main points of the story this brief recital made at least three people uncomfortable for claude raised his eyes to encounter an angry glance from hilliston and a deprecating one from jenny they were relieved when the vicar who by no means approved of such attention being bestowed on a trashy novel even though his son was the author turned the conversation into another channel mr linton liked to lead the conversation at his own table i wish to speak to you particularly claude whispered mrs hilliston as he held the door open for the ladies to retire do not be long over your wine i will come as soon as i can he replied and returned to his seat wondering what she could have to say to him he was not left long in doubt for mr hilliston entered into conversation as soon as the glasses were filled and the cigars lighted this was the moment for which he had longed for the whole evening why isnt your friend tait here tonight he asked in a casual tone feigning a lightness he did not feel did not mr linton tell you replied claude prepared for this query he had to go to town on business on business murmured hilliston uneasily anything to do with this case you have taken up i cant say tait did not particularly state his errand the lawyer sipped his wine looked thoughtfully at the end of the cigar and pondered for a few minutes he wished to speak of claudes changed behavior toward himself yet did not know how to begin at length he bluntly blurted out a question straightforward and to the point this was undiplomatic but at times human nature is too strong for training we are not such good friends as of yore claude how is that i think you can guess the reason replied larcher not ill pleased to fight out the point for he hated being forced into doubtful civility it is this case which has come between us i do not think you are giving me what help you ought to mr hilliston i can give you no help said the lawyer drawing his heavy brows together you know as much as i do no doubt your meddlesome friend knows more it is not improbable but you can prove your honesty in the matter by doing me a favor my honesty sir has never been called into question yet said hilliston injudiciously losing his temper always a prelude to defeat and i have no call to defend myself to one to whom i have been a father still i am willing to grant you what you wish in reason very good then introduce me to mr paynton im afraid that is out of my power replied hilliston shaking his head you know the mans ways i think he is a hermit a misanthrope and does not care for company why do you wish to know him for various reasons answered larcher coloring with some embarrassment he was by no means willing to take mr hilliston into his confidence his old guardian looked at him shrewdly and remembering certain small circumstances connected with jenny guessed with the skill of an experienced character reader how the land lay at once he formed a resolution to further claudes interests in the matter hoping and not unjustly that should the lad be taken in the toils of love he might stop further investigation of the case an end which hilliston much desired to gain oh said he not unkindly sits the wind in that quarter well i will aid you in a few days i will try and induce mr paynton to see you and then perhaps you may succeed succeed in what demanded claude sharply hardly relishing this perspicuity why in this lovesuit of yours aye aye claude i can see what you aim at old as i am well she is a pretty girl clever and worthy i know of no woman who would make you a better wife you have my best wishes for your success and you will introduce me to her father ill try to but i wont promise confidently paynton is a strange creature and may refuse to see you by the way added hilliston as though struck with a sudden thought what was my wife saying to you at the door she was requesting me to speak to her in the drawing room there is nothing wrong i hope she does not look well oh nothing wrong nothing wrong replied hilliston easily rising to his feet as the vicar moved toward the door she is fond of you my dear boy and is anxious about the case anxious about the case thought larcher as he followed his host into the drawing room that is strange she can have no interest in it hm ill try the effect of taits destination on her he said i would be astonished at the result i am beginning to be so already perhaps jenny had overheard the whisper in the dining room and was sufficiently taken with larcher to be jealous of his attentions to mrs hilliston old though she deemed her for before he could cross over to where the lawyers wife was seated jenny beckoned to him with her imperious finger he could do nothing but obey despite the frown which darkened mrs hillistons face as she saw and with womanly instinct guessed the maneuver come and sit down here whispered jenny under cover of the music for miss densham was at the piano i have not seen you for several days that is not my fault said claude delighted at the interest thus displayed you stay so much indoors i have been looking for you everywhere have you indeed mr larcher said jenny with feigned surprise and why may i ask oh for no particular purpose unless indeed it was to ask you for further information concerning the novel hush not a word of that i cant speak of it to you i know who you are mr larcher but i am ignorant of the tragedy save what i told to frank and later on to mr tait but you can guess i can guess nothing interrupted the girl imperiously if you and i are to remain friends you must cease talking on that subject ill do anything to remain friends with you miss paynton was the significant reply then talk of anything save that terrible case oh how i wish i had left it alone im glad you did not said claude bluntly if it had not been for that book before he could finish the sentence jenny shot an indignant look at him and deliberately rising from her seat crossed the room to where frank linton was frowning and tugging at his mustache claude was vexed at his folly in thus drawing down her anger on him but accepted his beating like a man and passed over to where mrs hilliston waited with an expectant face she remarked on his tardy coming with some bitterness i see you prefer a younger face to mine she said drawing herself up time was when i had no rival to fear dear mrs hilliston i could not disobey a lady besidesbesides besides you are in love with her oh i can see that well she is a pretty girl so you intend to marry her it is early yet to talk of marriage i dont even know if she likes me mrs hilliston laughed and looked at him smilingly then you must be very ignorant of the way of women my dear she said meaningly a word in your ear claude that girl loves you in two weeks impossible ive known love to grow in two days replied mrs hilliston dryly oh yes she loves you and you love her so you can marry as soon as you choose first i must get mr payntons consent i should not think that would be difficult said the lady looking at his eager face you are young not illlooking not badly off and so i should not think mr paynton would desire anything better for his daughter so much for the first obstacle and the second i must solve the mystery of my fathers death mrs hillistons manner changed on the instant and from being gay she became severe and anxiouslooking indeed claude thought that she paled under her rouge but this might have been fancy it is about that i wish to speak to you she said hurriedly i want you to stop investigating this case you will learn nothing it would be of no use to anyone if you did solve the mystery stop troubling yourself with slander claude why he asked astonished at her earnest tone because your conduct vexes my husband he has been a father to you in the place of the one you lost so you ought to consider him a little pray leave that mystery unsolved if i would tait would not he is now even more eager than i to find out the truth horrid little man said the lady viciously where is he now the time had now come to try the effect of taits destination and fixing his eyes on mrs hilliston as she slowly fanned herself claude uttered the fatal words he is at horriston the fan stopped mrs hilliston paled but preserving her selfcontrol with a strong effort replied quietly at horriston and why to find out a person not mentioned in the case man or woman asked mrs hilliston in a low voice woman she said no more but turned away her head to reply to her husband who came up opportunely he also had heard the last few words of the conversation and ignoring the presence of claude husband and wife looked at one another with pale faces the shot had struck home and larcher saw that it had chapter xxxii the discoveries of spenser tait horriston might fitly be compared to jonahs gourd it sprang up in a night so to speak and withered in the space of a day in the earlier part of the victorian era a celebrated doctor recommended its mineral springs and invalids flocked to be cured at this new pool of bethesda whether the cures were not genuine or insufficiently rapid to please the sick folk it is hard to say but after fifteen or twenty years of prosperity the crowd of fashionable valetudinarians ceased to occupy the commodious lodging houses and hotels in horriston other places sprang up with greater attractions and more certain cures so the erstwhile fashionable town relapsed into its provincial dullness no one lived there but a few retired army men and no one came save a stray neurotic person in search of absolute quiet few failed to get that at horriston which was now as sleepy a place as could be found in all england even thorston was more in touch with the nineteenth century than this deserted town as tait drove through the streets on his way to the principal hotel he could not help noticing the dreary look of the chief thoroughfare many of the shops were closed some were unoccupied and those still open displayed wares grimy and flyblown the shopkeepers came to their doors in a dazed fashion to look at the new visitor in the single fly which plied between station and hotel thereby showing that the event was one of rare occurrence there were no vehicles in the street itself save a lumbering cart containing market produce and the doctors trap which stood at the doctors door a few people sauntered along the pavement in a listless fashion and the whole aspect of the place was one of decay and desertion but for the presence of shopkeepers and pedestrians few though they were tait could almost have imagined himself in some deserted mining township on the californian coast the principal hotel faced one side of a melancholy square and was called the royal victoria out of compliment to the reigning monarch it was a large barrack with staring windows and a flight of white steps leading up to a deserted hall no busy waiters no genial landlord or buxom barmaid not even the sound of cheerful voices cats slept on the steps and fowls clucked in the square while a melancholy waiter peering out of the window put the finishing touch to the lamentable dreariness of the scene the sign royal victoria should have been removed out of very shame and the word ichabod written up in its place the landlord was lacking in humor to let things remain as they were however tait being hungry and dusty and tired consoled himself with the reflection that it was at all events an hotel and speedily found himself the sole occupant of the dining room attended to by the melancholy waiter the viands provided were by no means bad and the wine was undeniably good and small wonder seeing it had been in the cellars for a quarter of a century for want of someone to drink it this fact was confided to tait by his sad ganymede we used to see a sight of company here said this elderly person when he appeared with the claret but bless you its like babylon the fallen now sir youre the first gentleman as i have seen here for a week shouldnt think it would pay to keep the hotel open it dont sir replied the waiter with conviction but master is well offmade his money in the days when horriston was horriston and keeps this place as a sort of hobby we have a club here in the evenings sir and that makes things a bit lively have you been here long asked tait noticing how gray and wrinkled was this despondent servitor over thirty years sir responded ganymede with a sigh as though the memory was too much for him man and boy ive been here thirty years im glad of that youre the man i want got a good memory pretty good sir not that theres much to remember and he sighed again hm have you any recollection of a murder which took place at the laurels twentyfive years ago that i have sir said the waiter with faint animation it was the talk of the country captain larcher wasnt it sir and his wife a sweetly pretty woman she was accused of the murder i think but she didnt do it no nor mr jeringham either though some people think he did cause he cleared out and small blame to him when they were after him like roaring lions do you remember jeringham i should think so sir why he stopped in this very hotel he did as kind and affable a gentleman as i ever met sir he kill captain larcher not he no more than did the wife poor thing now i have my own opinion said this wise person significantly but i didnt take to it for five years after the murder as you might say twenty years ago sir who do you think committed the crime then asked tait rather impressed by the mans manner the waiter looked around with the enjoyable air of a man about to impart a piece of startling information and bent across the table to communicate it to tait denis bantry was the man sir he said solemnly captain larchers valet nonsense what makes you think that i dont think it sir i know it if you dont believe me go to the laurels and ask the old gardener dick pental he saw it finished the waiter in a tragic whisper saw what the murder said tait with a startled look yes sir he saw the murder i heard it all from him i did i forget the exact story he told me but denis bantry should have been hanged sir oh there isnt the least doubt about it sir but if this dick pental saw the crime committed why didnt he come forward and tell about it well sir it was this way said ganymede dusting the table with his napkin dick aint all there not to be too delicate sir dicks mad he was always a softy from a boy not that hes old now sir fortyfive i believe and he was twenty years of age when he was in captain larchers service and is he at the laurels still why yes sir you see after the murder no one would take the house they thought it haunted maybe so dick was put in as caretaker he looked after it for twenty years and then it was taken by a gentleman who didnt care for murders or ghosts hes there now sir and so is dick who still looks after the garden but why didnt dick relate what he saw because of his softness sir said the waiter deliberately you see dick had been put into a lunatic asylum he had just before he came of age captain larchera kind gentleman sirtook him out and made him gardener at the laurels so when dick saw the murder done he was afraid to speak in case he should be locked up again no head you see sir so he held his tongue he did and only told me five years after the murder then it was too late for all those who were at the laurels on that night had disappeared you dont happen to know where denis bantry is sir do you for he ought to hang sir indeed he ought tait did not think it wise to take this bloodthirsty waiter into his confidence but rewarded him with half a sovereign for his information and retired to bed to think the matter over he was startled by this new discovery which seemed to indicate denis bantry alias kerry as the assassin and wondered if he had been wrong all through in suspecting hilliston yet if kerry had committed the crime tait saw no reason why hilliston should protect him as he was evidently doing assuming that the waiter had spoken correctly the only ground on which tait could explain hillistons conduct was that mrs larcher was implicated with the old servant in the murder if kerry were arrested he might confess sufficient to entangle mrs larcher and as hilliston loved the woman a fact of which tait was certain he would not like to run so great a risk to her liberty but this reasoning was upset by the remembrance that mrs larcher had already been tried and acquitted of the crime and as according to law she could not be tried twice on the same charge she was safe in any case tait was bewildered by his own thoughts the kaleidoscope had shifted again the combinations were different but the component parts were the same and argue as he might there seemed no solution of the mystery mrs larcher denis bantry his sister hilliston and mark jeringham who had killed the unfortunate husband tait could find no answer to this perplexing question in the morning he walked to the laurels which he had no difficulty in finding owing to the explicit directions of his friend the waiter it was a pretty lowroofed house on a slight rise near the river and built somewhat after the fashion of a bungalow the gardens sloped to the river bank on one side and on the other were sheltered from inland winds by a belt of sycamore trees in front a light iron railing divided them from the road which ran past the house on its way to the ferry the gardens were some three acres in extent very pretty and picturesque showing at every turn that whatever might be the mental state of dick pental he was thorough master of his business tait came into contact with him in a short space of time through the medium of the housekeeper this individual was a sour old maid who informed him with some acerbity that mr deemer the present occupant of the laurels was away from home and without his permission she could not show him the house perhaps she suspected taits errand for she looked suspiciously at him and resolutely refused to let him cross the threshold however as a concession she said he could inspect the grounds which were well worth seeing and called dick pental to show him round as tait had really no great desire to see the interior of the house where he would learn nothing likely to be of service and a great desire to speak alone with the mad gardener he thankfully accepted the offer and was then thrown into the company of the very man whom he most desired to see dick pental was a slender brighteyed man with a dreamylooking face alert in his movements and restless with his hands and feet he did not seem unintelligent but the germs of madness were plainly discernible and tait guessed that only his constant life in the open air kept him from returning to the asylum whence he had been taken by captain larcher with justifiable pride this queer creature showed tait over the grounds but never by word or deed did he hint at the story which he had told the waiter still hopeful tait led the conversation on that direction and finally succeeded in touching the spring in the mans brain which made him relate the whole matter the opportunity occurred when the two men were standing on a slight rise overlooking the river here tait made a remark concerning the view what a peaceful scene he said waving his stick toward the prospect corn lands farmhouses the squaretowered church and the ferry crossing the placid river i can imagine nothing more homely or so charged with pleasant memories here all is peace and quiet no trouble no danger no crimes dick thoughtfully rubbed the half crown given him by tait and looked dreamily at river and sky and opposite shore to his abnormally active brain the scene looked different to what it did to this stranger and he could not forbear alluding to the fact moreover the gentleman had given him money and dick was greedy so in the expectation of extracting another coin he hinted that he could tell a startling story about this very place aint you fond of murders sir he asked abruptly turning his bright eyes on tait no i dont think i am replied the other delighted to think he had succeeded in rousing the mans dormant intelligence why do you ask murder is an ugly word and can have nothing to do with so peaceful a scene as this thats all you know sir said dick eagerly why i could tell you of a murder as i seed myself in this very spot where we are nowor only a few yards from it sir tait glanced at his watch with an affectation of hurry and shook his head i am afraid i cant wait he said artfully i must return to horriston in a few minutes it wont take longer nor that to tell why ive told it in ten minutes i have its freezer to the blood a murder at night too added dick in an agony lest tait should go away with a lantern and a corpsejust like you read in novels hm observed tait skeptically not yet being sure of the man is it true true as gospel sir i wouldnt tell a lie i wouldnt ive been brought up methody you know sir and scorn a falsehood as a snare of the old un you make it worth dickys while sir and hell give you goose flesh oh that he will very good said tait throwing himself on the sward i dont mind hearing the legend of this place if it is as good as you say ill give you half a sovereign in gold asked dick with a grasping eagerness in bright gold see here is the half sovereign you tell the story and it is yours now then what is it all about dick pental sat down beside tait but at some distance away and chuckled as he rubbed his hands he had a chance of making twelveandsixpence that morning and was overjoyed at his good fortune resolved to begin with a startling remark he glanced down to see that they were alone and then brought it out i could hang a man i could he said cheerfully i could hang him till he was a deader chapter xxxiii the story of the mad gardener having made this startling announcement dick pental drew back to observe the effect on his hearer humoring the mans vanity tait expressed due surprise and requested him to narrate the circumstance to which he referred it is about twentyfive years ago it is said dick commencing his tale in a great hurry and i was the gardener here to captain larcher you dont know him sir it aint to be expected as you should he was a grown gentleman before you were and a kind un he was took me out of the asylum he did they said i was mad you know and put me into a strait waistcoat but i wasnt a bit wrong in my head sir not i captain larcher he saw that so he took me out and made me his gardener and aint i done a lot for the place just you look round and see your work is admirable dick it is that replied the man with naive vanity and you aint the first as has said that sir oh im fond of the garden i am flowers are much nicer company than human beings i think not so cross with dicky you know sir no doubt said tait seeing that the creature was following the wanderings of his poor wits but about this murder you i didnt know anything was wrong interrupted the gardener earnestly id have kept out of the way if id known that but i came here one night when i shouldnt have been here how was that hot rum and water confessed dick with great simplicity i drank ittoo much of it and it went to my head it isnt a strong head so i came here to sleep it clear again that was about twelve oclock as near as i can tell but lord bless you my head made no account of time when the hot rum and water was in it i woke up and i was frightened finding myself in the darki hate the dark dont you sirso i finished some rum that i had with me and went to sleep again then i woke up sudden i did and i saw it the murder being committed no not quite that but i saw a man lying on the ground just over there and he didnt move a bit another man was holding him in his arms and denis bantry was standing by with a lantern who was the other man it was a gentleman called mr jeringham oh yes my head was queer but i knew him by his clothes i did i was at the grand ball of the gentry you know it was there i got drunkand i saw mr jeringham there in black clothes with gold trimmings he had them on when he bent over captain larcher how did you know the man on the ground was captain larcher i didnt then confessed dick ingenuously but when i heard as they found him in the river i knew it was him i did i saw them drop him in denis bantry and mr jeringham exclaimed tait astonished at the minuteness of these details yes they talked together for a bit but my head was so queer that i couldnt make out what they said but they picked up captain larcher one at the head and the other at the heels and they dropped him insplash he went he did i was behind a tree and they couldnt see me ugh said the man with a shiver how i did feel afraid when he went splash into the cold water then i went away and held my tongue why did you do that it was your duty to have come forward and told the truth dick pental put on a cunning look and shook his head not me sir he said artfully theyd have said my head was queer and put me in an asylum again no no dicky was too clever for them he was but you say it was denis bantry who killed captain larcher said tait after a moments reflection how do you know that when you did not see the blow struck it might have been mr jeringham looking lovingly at the piece of gold which was now in his possession dick shook his head with great vigor it wasnt mr jeringham he protested he was a good kind gentleman he gave dicky half a crown the day before he was fond of captain larchers wife so he couldnt have killed captain larcher against this insane reasoning tait had nothing to urge as dicky was evidently convinced that denis bantry was guilty to the exclusion of jeringham had the former given him money instead of the latter he would doubtless have accused jeringham and sworn to the innocence of denis the mans brain was too weak to be depended upon but tait recognized that the report he gave of the occurrence of that fatal night was true and faithful in all respects dicky was not sufficiently imaginative to invent such a story satisfied from the importance of the knowledge he had gained that his time had not been wasted tait wished to be alone to think out the matter there was some difficulty in getting rid of dicky who was still greedily expectant of further tips but in the end he induced the man to return to his work and set out for horriston at a brisk walk he always thought better when exercising his limbs and before he reached the town he had arrived at several conclusions respecting the case as seen under the new light thrown on it by the gardener for one thing he concluded that paynton was jeringham the reason for denis being in his service had been explained by dick pental as the two men were bound together by a common bond of guilt tait was inclined to think that jeringham was innocent for if he had killed larcher there would have been no need for denis to have screened him on the other hand circumstantial evidence was so strong against jeringham that if denis had struck the blow he would be forced to acquiesce in the silence of the real criminalto become as it were an accessory to the crime denis could have sworn that jeringham was guilty and so placed him in danger of his life thus the two men had a hold on one another jeringham because circumstances were against him denis because he had killed larcher the motive for the crime was not difficult to discover after the story told by mrs bezel bantry had killed his master as the destroyer of his sisters honor under the names of paynton and kerry the two men were dwelling together at thorston in loathed companionship each afraid to let the other out of his sight tait could imagine no more terrible punishment than that enforced comradeship it reminded him of a similar situation in a novel of zolas where husband and wife were equally culpable equally afraid and filled with equal hatred the one toward the other still this conclusion supported as it was by facts did not explain the attitude of hilliston assuming the guilt of denis bantry the complicity of jeringham there appeared to be no reason why hilliston should protect them at thorston and throw obstacles in the way of the truths discovery tait was completely nonplussed and could think of no explanation and then he remembered mrs bezels letter and the mention of louisa sinclair hilliston according to mrs bezel knew this woman and she knew who had committed the crime but how could she know unless she had been concealed like dick pental in the garden on that night tait was quite certain that denis bantry was guilty but the hint of mrs bezel threatened to disturb this view and yet what better evidence was obtainable than that of an eyewitness still tait remembered that dicky confessed he had not seen the blow struck what if louisa sinclair had that was the question he asked himself under the circumstances it was necessary to find out who this woman was tait did not judge it wise to ask hilliston for the simple reason that the lawyer would not admit the truth there was no obvious reason why he should not but tait had sufficient experience of hillistons trickery and evasion in the past to know that his admissions were untrustworthy there only remained for him to search for louisa sinclair in horriston question her if she were alive or learn all that he could if she were dead and now occurred a coincidence which unwittingly put tait on the right track when within half a mile of horriston he met a clergyman swinging along at a good pace and in him recognized a former college companion the recognition and the delight were mutual my dear brandon this is indeed a surprise exclaimed tait holding out his hand i had no idea that you were in these parts i have only been vicar here for a year answered brandon cordially but what are you doing at horriston my friend oh i have come down partly on business and partly on pleasure then dismiss business for the moment and come to luncheon with me i am just going to my house where are you staying at the royal victoria a dismal place you must come frequently to see us while you stay here and we will do what we can to cheer you up mrs brandon will be delighted to see you oh so you are married for the last five years two children well i am glad to see you again do you stay here long a few days only replied tait carelessly but it entirely depends on my business anything important yes and no by the way you may be able to help me brandon do you know anyone in this parish called miss louisa sinclair the vicar reflected for a few moments and shook his head no i never heard the name she must have been here before my time have you any reason for wanting to see her naturally or i should not have asked said tait with faint sarcasm however i must make a confidant of you as i wish for your advice and assistance i shall be delighted to give both said his friend briskly but here we are at my house and there is my wife in the porch my dear this is an old college friend of mine spenser tait we must make him welcome for the days that have been mrs brandon a comfortable rosycheeked matron with two tiny brandons clinging to her skirts heartily welcomed tait and led the way to the dining room here an extra knife and fork were hastily produced for the guest and they all sat down to luncheon in the best of spirits for the moment tait banished all thought of the case from his mind and laid himself out to be agreeable to the vicars wife in this he succeeded as she subsequently pronounced him to be a singularly charming man while he pronounced her to be one of the most intelligent women it had been his fortune to meet after luncheon brandon conducted tait to his study and there over an excellent cigar the little man related the story of the larcher affair from the time that claude became possessed of the papers needless to say the clergyman was much astonished by the recital and agreed with tait that it was difficult to know which way to turn in the present dilemma he thought that denis was guilty and jeringham an accomplice by force of circumstances but doubted whether the existence of louisa sinclair might not altogether alter the complexion of the case of course the difficulty will be to find louisa sinclair he said thoughtfully fiveandtwenty years is a long time to go back to she may be dead so she may rejoined tait a trifle tartly on the other hand she may be alive i found that waiter and that gardener who were at horriston then both remember the case so it is probable that i shall find this woman or at least gain sufficient information to trace her whereabouts i cannot recall her name tait she has not been here in my time fortunately i can help you in this much that an old parishioner of mine is calling today and as she has lived here for the last forty years and more it is likely she will remember if such a person dwelt here who is this old lady my dear fellow you must not call her an old lady it is true she is over forty butwell she is always young and charming in her own eyes miss belinda pike is her name and i shouldnt like to come under the lash of her tongue is she such a tartar she ismy dear fellow you must not ask me to talk scandal about my parishioners moreover i see the lady in question is coming up the garden path once set her tongue going and you will learn all the history of horriston for the last hundred years i only want to go back twentyfive rejoined tait smiling and at that moment miss belinda pike was announced she was a tall bony female with a hook nose a false front and an artificial smile dressed in voluminous raiment she bore down on brandon like a frigate in full sail and proceeded to talk all the time she remained in the study she talked of herself of parish work of dorcas meetings of scandals new and old and so astonished tait by the extent of her petty information and the volubility of her tongue that he could only stare and wonder introduced to him she was graciously pleased to observe that she had heard of him and his inquiries the waiter you know mr tait she said smiling at his astonishment sugden is his name he told me all about you now why do you wish to learn all about that larcher crime for amusement merely replied tait rather scandalizing the vicar by this answer the waiter began to speak of it and i encouraged him later on i heard the story from a gardener from dicky pental interrupted miss pike vivaciously oh he can tell you nothinghe is mad mad or not he told me a great deal all false no doubt my dear mr tait continued the lady impressively only one person can tell you the truth of that case myself or louisa sinclair louisa sinclair what do you know about her nothing save her name replied tait but i want to know more can you give me the required information yes come and have afternoon tea with me today and ill tell you all oh yes said miss pike with a selfsatisfied nod i know who killed captain larcher jeringhamdenis the valethilliston no those three people are innocent i can swear to it i know it then who is guilty why said miss pike quietly mrs larchers maidmona bantry chapter xxxiv a letter from horriston my dear claude in my last letter i informed you of my various discoveries with regard to the case i deem myself singularly fortunate in finding those who could afford me the necessary information fiveandtwenty years is a wide gap of time and to tell the honest truth i scarcely expected to be successful in my mission death absence old age might have put an end to all who knew about the case but as you are already advised i unexpectedly met with three people who gave me three different versions of the murder from their various points of view first the waiter sugden who merely reflected the opinion of dick pental second the gardener himself with his firsthand story and third miss belinda pike whose ideas are quite at variance with the other two i mentioned to you that i had met miss pike at my friend brandons and that she had invited me to visit her the next day to hear her story of the case of course i went and found the lady an excellent character for my purpose she has a truly wonderful memory for the small beer of life she is a born gossip and is one of the most spiteful women it has ever been my fortune to meet her invitation was more to satisfy her own vanity and curiosity than because she wished to do me a service but if she is gratified in the one she is balked in the other with some difficultyfor she is a most persistent creaturei managed to evade her inquiries as to my reason for wishing to know about the larcher affair and extracted from her all information likely to be of service to us in discovering the truth what she told me leaves me more in the dark than ever and i shall doubtless return to thorston no whit nearer the truth than i was when i set out but before narrating her story as imparted to me in strict secrecy you must not be offended if certain reflections are cast by this busybody on your mother to get at the truth of this complication you must view it from a disinterested standpoint and throw aside all prejudice i do not for a moment believe that mrs larcher intended to willfully deceive her husband as is implied by miss pike but i must confess i think her conduct was highly reprehensible still i pass no judgment as it is not my place to do so and you must clearly understand that the remarks herein contained about her are those of miss pike you can guess from their tenor what a very spiteful old lady she is i promised to report my doings and hearings faithfully to you and i hereby keep my promise and at the cost of your losing your temper the cause of miss pikes malignity is jealousya passion which is as active now with her as it was twentyfive years ago then the fair belinda according to her own account was the belle of horriston and shared that enviable position with two rivalsthe one being your mother the other miss louisa sinclair i fancy i hear you exclaim at the mention of this name but mrs bezel is right such a person does exist she was a passably pretty girlaccording to miss pikeand rather popularagain miss pikebut cared for no one so much as mr francis hilliston then a handsome young lawyer of great promise and good family this is evidently the romance of hillistons life and accounts for his silence about louisa sinclair he did not wish to speak of one who had disappeared under somewhat discreditable circumstances yet who truly loved him whether he returned her love i cannot say suspend your judgment till you hear the story of this maiden lady of course it is quite different to that of dick pental and i think less easy to believe the gardener spoke of what he saw miss pike speaks of what she thinks judge for yourself which is right as i have said miss pike was a belle in her younger days she was also well off and could have made a good match unfortunately she was in love with hilliston i say unfortunately because he happened to be in love with mrs larcher i again apologize for putting the matter so plainly but miss pike insisted that it was so in those days hilliston must have been a handsome and fascinating man for louisa sinclair also loved himwith a like result he had no eyes for these two damsels but quietly devoted himself to mrs larcher i do not mean to say that he roused the suspicions of your father for his devotion was perfectly respectful the desire of the moth for the star i may sayfor hilliston knew well enough that he had no chances in that quarter for two reasons first mrs larcher was a married woman second she was in love with jeringham at the time of that notable dress ball matters stood thus miss belinda pike in love with hilliston miss louisa sinclair in love with hilliston hilliston in love with mrs larcher mrs larcher in love with jeringham can you imagine anything more complicated and to make confusion still worse miss pike solemnly asserted that jeringham was not in love with mrs larcher but with her maid mona bantry therefore all round each of these five people was in love with the wrong person it was a modern comedy of errors with a tragic ending miss pike went to the ball in the character of a flower girl and there was astonished to find two mary queen of scots and two darnleys during the night she learned that out of jealousy louisa sinclair had adopted the same fancy dress as your mother she was the second queen of scots and was attired precisely the same in all respects save that mrs larcher wore a small dagger and miss sinclair did not on making this discovery miss pike naturally thoughtas a jealous woman wouldthat the second darnley was hilliston she knew that the first was jeringham and did not trouble herself about him but maneuvered to get speech with the second to her astonishment she found outhow i cannot saythat it was captain larcher who was supposed to be in london he confessed that he was jealous of his wife and had returned in disguise to learn the truth miss pike was not clear whether he was suspicious of jeringham or of hilliston and she had no opportunity of learning the truth as larcher seeing his wife leave the ballroom followed her at once the next day miss pike was informed of the disappearance of jeringham and later on she learned of the death of captain larcher now you will ask whom she suspected a woman with so unhappy a temper would not be long in forming an opinion about a matter connected with a lady of whom she was jealous i allude to your mother miss pike had a theory and ever since declining to accept the evidence given at the trial has held firmly to it she suspected mona bantry to be guilty i give her reason in her own words of course it is only theory she said when i asked her pointblank who she thought was guilty but my suspicions point to mrs larchers maid to mona bantry i asked rather astonished yes she was in love with mr jeringham and he was at the ball dressed as darnley captain larcher wore the same dress as i told you he left the ballroom when he saw his wife go out with mr jeringham i fancy he followed them home and caught them as they parted in the garden of the laurels very likely he ordered mr jeringham off the premises and insisted on his wife going into the house mona who was sitting up for her mistress would open the door and seeing by the dress as she thought mr jeringham with mrs larcher i believe she lost her head and killed him killed him but how with the dagger worn by mrs larcher responded miss pike triumphantly she snatched it from the sheath as it hung at the girdle of mrs larcher and killed the poor manthinking he was her lover then finding out her mistake she fled but so did jeringham i said yes he also saw the murder and naturally enough thought he might be suspected i think he took mona away with him on the very night and they fled together as to the body denis the brother to save his sister and possibly his mistress from being suspected threw it into the river that is my theory mr tait and i believe it to be the true one i need not repeat more of our conversation as it was merely argument on both sides but you now know sufficient to see in what direction miss pikes suspicions are directed her story is quite at variance with that of your mother who plainly stated that she found mona in the sitting room with your father it is not strange that the two narrations should be contradictory for we must remember that mrs larcher spoke from facts while miss pike only speaks from hearsay again from the statement of dick pental it would appear that the murder took place in the garden your mother says it was committed in the sitting room so here is another contradiction but you must not forget that only one person has sworn to the identity of those he saw with the body miss pike can prove nothing from facts and only evolves accusations out of her own malignant nature your mother accuses no one alleging that she fainted in the sitting room therefore taking all facts into consideration i believe the gardeners story to be true and that denis bantry killed your father jeringham through force of circumstances being an accessory to the deed this view accounts for the identity of paynton with jeringham of kerry with denisand fully accounts for their living in seclusion at thorston this is my opinion do you think you can give a better regarding your mothers hint about louisa sinclair i confess i cannot understand it miss pike was perfectly frank about that person and stated that shortly after the murder she went to america and had not been heard of for years hilliston may know of her whereabouts but under the circumstances i do not think he is likely to speak at all events we are certain of two things that louisa sinclair did not marry hilliston that she had nothing to do with the tragedy at the laurels miss pike intends to show me a portrait of the lady on the occasion of my next visit a knowledge of her looks may lead to something but honestly speaking i do not see how she can possibly be implicated in the matter but i must bring this long letter to a close i have found out sufficient at horriston to justify our suspicions of the menage at rose cottage and when i return we must set our wits to work to see paynton and kerry they must be forced into plain speaking then we may solve the mystery of your fathers deathnot before expect me in two days and think over what i have written so that we may discuss the matter thoroughly when we come together and so no more at present from your friend spenser tait chapter xxxv the original of the portrait claude larcher was blessed with the best of tempers and strongly gifted with selfcontrol he found these virtues very necessary in his profession especially when in command of a body of men in the wilds there no trouble ruffled him no disappointment depressed his spirits he was always serene and amiable so that among his comrades his good temper had become proverbial had they seen him at this moment they would have found reason to alter their opinion the case wore out his patience he saw no end to the complications arising therefrom no sooner was one obstacle surmounted than another blocked up the path but for tait he would have taken hillistons advice long ago and let the matter lie but the little man was bent on solving this particularly tantalizing mystery and so urged his friend to persevere in what seemed to be futile attempts so far claude had held to his resolve but this last letter of taits with its budget of new complications threw him into a rage he vowed that he would throw up the matter as soon as tait returned his father was dead and there was an end of it after fiveandtwenty years nothing whatever could be discovered and above all there was jenny claude was too clearsighted to disguise from himself the fact that he was in love and now enlightened by mrs hilliston regarding the feelings of the young lady he was doubly anxious to make her his wife before he could do so he had to remove an obstacle in the shape of her father and that was no easy matter who mr paynton was he did not know whether he was implicated in the larcher affair he could not guess but of one thing he was certain that mr paynton resented his prosecution of the case while he continued to investigate the mystery the recluse would continue inimical and would therefore refuse to permit him to pay attentions to his daughter regarding linton and his love claude had no fears he had been assured by mrs hilliston that jenny liked him best and taking advantage of the hint he had thrown himself as frequently as possible into the society of his beloved did jenny go to the vicarage claude was there under the pretense of questioning the clergyman concerning the architecture of the church did she practice on the organ claude was always waiting at the door to carry her musicbook to rose cottage a walk in the morning he was in the vicinity a stroll in the evening and he appeared unexpectedly round the nearest corner in driving riding walking visiting this persistent young man was constantly to be found near miss jenny paynton all this meant infatuation availing himself of the opportunities thus afforded he learned her secret and betrayed his own without a word being said on either sidewith the shadow of the case between themthese two young people fell in love with one another when tait returned two days after his last letter he was confronted by claude with the intimation that he wished to stop further investigations tait who was devoured by an unappeasable curiosity to find out the truth resented this backsliding and told claude his opinion very plainly but for their long friendship they would have quarreled over the matter as it was tait argued out the question and induced claude to come round to his way of thinking but it was a hard task you are not going to turn back after putting your hand to the plow he said when claude first broached the subject of abandoning the case why not if the plow wont move returned the young man flippantly the plow will move returned tait vehemently you got my last letter i did but i dont see that it contains anything likely to elucidate the mystery your dick pental is a madman your miss pike an untrustworthy gossip that is your opinion not mine i have made a discovery since writing my last letter of which i have not yet had time to inform you what is it ill tell you later on meanwhile is it on account of this girl that you have decided to abandon the case partly and partly because i think we are wasting time our investigation can lead to no result we may find out who killed your father i doubt that replied larcher coolly you suspect hilliston you suspect jeringham you suspect mona bantry why in your last letter you hinted at the guilt of denis simply because a drunken lunatic told you a wild story yet so far as i can see you have not a morsel of evidence against any one of the four you are wrong said tait in an argumentative manner the misfortune is that there is too much evidence against them all i could furnish you with a case against each whichso far as circumstantial evidence is concernedwould convince you of their individual guilt theory tait theory well prove that soon my boy said tait with exasperating coolness if you back out of the case i at least am determined to see it through i suppose you are bent on marrying the young lady if shell have meyes humph theres another obstacle which you have overlooked the consent of her fatherour mysterious friend paynton i have not overlooked the obstacle i will obtain his consent from his own lips and how do you intend to see him through the agency of mr hilliston replied larcher calmly he has agreed to introduce me to paynton tomorrow here is his letter the little man fairly bounded from his chair and he took the letter from his friends hand with an air of bewilderment after mastering the contents he returned it with a satisfied nod i congratulate you claude he said with a goodhumored air though you failed with the man you may succeed with the matter but how in the name of olympian jove did you induce hilliston to do this why he saw that i was in love with jenny and for some inexplicable reason has agreed to forward my suit by introducing me to plead my cause with the father not so inexplicable as you think said tait sagaciously i see his idea he thinks you will be so occupied with lovemaking as to abandon the case i dont know that he isnt right oh i see you are bent on getting quit of the matter claude but and tait shook a reproving forefinger you will change your mind after this interview with our hermit friend why so you will learn something which will astonish you i only wish i could be present with you to see what occurs but if i make no reference to the case said larcher seriously tait waxed indignant on the instant and spoke his mind freely claude my friend i went into this matter solely on your account and you owe it to me to see it through if you find further investigation a bar to your marriage i will agree to let the matter drop but first added tait with emphasis you must make an effort to get the truth out of this man swear to him that you are resolved to push the matter to the end tell him that i have learned something new at horriston mention the name of louisa sinclair then see the result after hearing the story of dicky pental i am convinced that this man is jeringham i will do all you say replied claude after some hesitation but i am afraid that my pertinacity in this matter will prejudice my wooing if at the end of the interview you see that withdraw your intention to go on with the case then out of gratitude he may give you his daughter bluff him firstyield afterward in that way we may discover who paynton iswhat he has to do with the case and why he is connected with hilliston do you agree good give me your hand on that the two men shook hands though it was not without a secret qualm that claude thus sealed the compact after a pause he said and who is this louisa sinclair you make such a point of my mentioning to paynton ah that is my discovery said tait rubbing his hands when i interviewed mrs bezel i showed her a portrait of mrs hilliston whom curiously enough she had never seenno doubt hilliston has his reasons therefor she seemed startled but said nothing then she wrote to you about louisa sinclair but what has louisa sinclair to do with mrs hilliston cant you guess miss pike showed me a portrait of louisa sinclair taken twentyfive years ago i did not then wonder at mrs bezels start or that hilliston had refrained from letting her see the picture of his wife in a word louisa sinclair and mrs hilliston are one and the same woman ah cried claude with a sudden recollection it was for that she was so afraid of your going to horriston yes she thought i might learn too much this is the beginning of the end claude what do you think mrs hilliston knows anything of the case according to your mother she knows a good deal according to miss pike she is in possession of certain facts yes i think mrs hilliston can help us if she will but my dear tait said claude quietly mrs hilliston is an american ah louisa sinclair went to america and probably became a naturalized subject of the stars and stripes but objected larcher she was a widow when she married hilliston so i believe a mrs derrick no doubt she came by all her money through that first marriage oh i can put the puzzle easily together no wonder hilliston wanted the case dropped both on his own account and on that of his wife what do you mean tait do you suspect that say no more said tait rising i will tell you what i mean after you have seen paynton but then added he significantly i dont think you will need any explanation chapter xxxvi a strange thing happens the next morning claude received a second letter from hilliston stating that as his wife was ill he would be unable to come over to thorston but directing the young man to go to rose cottage at noon when mr paynton would be ready to receive him tait regretted that he had not been included in the invitation and carefully instructed claude how to act during the interview i believe paynton can settle the matter were his parting words so put love out of your head for the time being and do your best to extract the truth anxious to oblige one who took so much interest in his private affairs larcher promised to do what he could and shortly after eleven started for rose cottage as a matter of fact he need not have gone so soon but he did so in the hope of meeting with jenny well acquainted as he was with her movements his surmise proved correct for he met the young lady at the end of nightingale lane she blushed and expressed surprise at the meeting but such feigning is part of loves comedy i did not expect to see you here mr larcher she said after the first greetings had passed between them where are you going i am about to call on your father really said jenny with some perplexity and more doubt i am afraid you go on a useless errand my father sees no one he will see me replied claude quietly i come by appointment mr hilliston spoke to your father with the result that he has agreed to see me has your visit anything to do withwith that novel it has everything to do with it i wish to ask mr paynton some questions in connection with my fathers death but he knows nothingnothing cried jenny vehemently he can tell you nothing it is worse than useless for you to speak to him on the subject you will only make him ill but i have to speak to him on another subject said claude artfully jenny looked up inquiringly remarked the passion in his gaze and turned away her face with a blush much as she would have liked to she found it impossible to appear ignorant of his meaning it seems to me that i am the person to be first consulted she said with a pout jenny i hush here is kerry see my father first and then see me till then goodby she flitted rapidly away and turned the corner of the lane as kerry more crabbedlooking than ever came up to where claude was standing it was then that larcher saw that the old servant was suffering under some strong emotion his eyes were brighter than usual his lips quivered and he was so nervous that he could keep neither limbs nor body at rest rightly connecting this agitation with his visit claude wisely held his peace and waited to hear what kerry had to say youll be after seeing the master sir said kerry in breathless anxiety he is waiting for you sir in the garden i was just on my way there kerry and stopped to speak for a few minutes to miss jenny i am very glad that mr paynton has consented to see me and you may well be glad master claude master claude echoed the young man stopping short oh blazes twas a slip of the tongue sir cried kerry anxiously dont notice it sir sure its old i am and my mind wanders then you deny that you are denis bantry say nothing of that sir let the master speak his own mind to you youll know soon enough who i am and thats a fact anyhow i am convinced in my own mind that you are my fathers old servant said larcher as he resumed his walk but who your master is i am not so clear kerry shook his head and pursed up his lips as though determined to let no information escape him they walked along in silence and it was only when he unlocked the gate in the red brick wall that kerry again opened his mouth keep silent sir if you love me he said in a low tone dont agitate the master hell do the speaking and tell ye all ye wish to know begad and more too larcher nodded and passed into the garden the morning was warm and sunny and the colors of the flowers were dazzling in the warm glow against the white walls of the cottage with his hands clasped behind his back paynton paced meditatively up and down the path before the house but stopped as he caught sight of his visitor taking off his hat in tribute to the venerable looks of the old gentleman claude bowed and waited to be addressed for some moments paynton looked at him in silence with much emotion then controlling himself with some difficulty held out his hand i am glad to see you mrmr larcher suggested claude seeing his host at a loss for the name larcher gasped paynton with an effort yesyes my friend mr hilliston advised me of your coming let us enter the house we will have more privacy there as claude knew no one was about in that walled place but kerry and the deaf old housekeeper he wondered what further privacy was necessary but considering that paynton had doubtless good reason for his action he bowed silently and followed him within as requested in a few minutes they were in the bookroom paynton seated himself in such a position as to place his back to the strong light shining through the window and asked claude to be seated in a chair which lacked this advantage in this way paynton could observe every change in the face of his visitor while his own being in the shadow was more difficult to read larcher saw the maneuver but did not think it necessary to make any objection in his place tait would have acted differently i am greatly obliged that you have consented to see me said claude breaking the silence for i am informed that you live a very secluded life that is true i accord you this interview at the request of my friend mr hilliston but at the same time i may tell you that i have my own reasons for granting it i think i can guess your reasons mr paynton no doubt replied paynton touching a book on the table they are not unconnected with this novel you know of course that my daughterthat jenny supplied young linton with the material for his plot i do she found the report of my fathers murder in some old newspapers in this house did you not think it strange that i should be in possession of such a report naturally i did answered claude replying to this direct question with marked embarrassment and it is on that account that i ask you to help me do you think i can do so i am sure of it why asked paynton in an unsteady voice because you know about the matter you retained the report of the trial denis bantry is in your service under the name of kerry and how do you know that why in the third volume of that book there is an episode of a scarfpin which is not mentioned in the report of the trial but which was told to miss paynton by the man you call kerry now only two persons knew that a scarfpin was picked up in the grounds of the laurels after the murder one was hilliston the other denis bantry you must see mr paynton that i can only come to one conclusion i presume you got this information from hilliston said paynton in an altered voice mr hilliston spoke of it replied claude cautiously he did not intend to reveal that he had heard it from his mother or indeed to reveal the existence of mrs larcher until he was sure of his ground and positive of payntons identity accepting his diplomatic answer in the affirmative paynton nodded and went on with his questioning you spoke to kerry on the subject i did but as you may guess i failed naturally kerry is a faithful servant i owe more to him than i can ever repay but here we are talking about the murder added paynton irrelevantly when you wish to speak about jenny at least so hilliston informed me i do wish to speak of your daughter later on said claude with a flushed cheek but in the meantime i am anxious to come to an understanding about this crime why said paynton rather disconcerted at his failure to turn the conversation because i have sworn to avenge the death of my father that is what a good son should do said paynton thoughtfully but after twentyfive years the chances are small you wish to find the murdererso do i you yes i am more deeply interested in this matter than you suppose who do you think i am he asked i cannot say unless you are jeringham jeringham said paynton in a faltering tone no i am not jeringham poor soul do you think him guilty of the crime i do and i dont sometimes it seems so at others i fancy hilliston to be guilty hilliston guilty said paynton rising what do you mean oh it is only a theory said claude hastily but my friend tait who was at horriston a few days ago found out all kinds of things which implicated one person and another he found dont tell medont tell me said paynton hastily i cannot talk to you longer or else i shall be ill this interview has already tried me too much here he added unlocking a drawer in his desk take these papers you will find in them a full account of all i know of the matter you were then an eyewitness said claude joyfully slipping the roll of manuscript into his pocket he had been more successful than he had hoped to be paynton pressed his hands together and looked eagerly at claude i can bear it no longer he said impatiently laying his hands on the shoulders of the astonished young man boyboy can you not guess who i am no replied larcher rising to his feet in some wonder i do not know who you can be unless you are jeringham i am not jeringham he is dead dead aye murdered can you not seecan you not guess claude the man who was killed at horriston was not george larcher it was mark jeringham but youyou i am your father chapter xxxvii a voice from the grave it was close on two oclock and weary of waiting for claude the master of the manor house had seated himself at the luncheon table he was curious to know what had taken place between his friend and mr paynton as he judged from the length of time the interview had lasted that some important communication must have been made had claude discovered the identity of paynton with jeringham if so had jeringham confessed to the crime these questions so annoyed and perplexed tait that he could not swallow a mouthful of food throwing aside his napkin he rose from the table to see if larcher had returned as he pushed back his chair the door opened and claude with a roll of papers in his hand made his appearance tait turned to greet him with a smile but it disappeared from his face and the words died on his lips when he saw the white and haggard countenance of his friend good heavens man he cried hastening toward him what is the matter here sit down drink this glass of wine claude did as he was bidden then waved his hand in the direction of dormer who stolid as ever stood waiting orders you can go dormer said tait hastily then when the man leaving the room closed the door after him and they found themselves alone he continued is anything wrong claude did paynton tell not paynton said larcher finishing his wine and setting down the glass there is not such a person aha remarked tait rubbing his hands i thought the name was a feigned one and who is our friend mr paynton my father tait opened his mouth to utter an ejaculation shut it without doing so and looked dumfounded at his friend whatwhatwhat do you mean are you mad he stammered sitting down limply no i am not mad groaned claude though i have suffered enough to make me so i mean what i say it was jeringham who was murdered jeringham who was dressed as darnley on that night as was my father jeringham whose corpse was so unrecognizable by decomposition that it was thought to be that of george larcher my father is alive my father is hiding here as ferdinand paynton this is his story of the tragedy he placed the roll of paper in taits hands and poured himself out another glass of wine overcome with amazement the little man looked first at the paper then at his friend it was some minutes before he could collect his wits together and speak coherently what an extraordinary thing he said at length you thought both your parents dead but now it seems they are alive your mother at clarence cottage hampstead your father at rose cottage thorston did you tell your father that mrs larcher was still in existence he asked sharply i had no time to do so said claude with an effort my father placed those papers in my hand and then confessed who he was i wished to speak further to him but he pushed me out of the room saying read that confession and form your judgment before you accept me as your father i hardly knew what i was doing till i found myself in the lane outside then i came on here i still feel quite bewildered i dont wonder at it take another glass of wine did your dont ask any questions tait said claude rising impatiently read me the confession at once i cant do it myself wont you have some luncheon no every mouthful would choke me ill lie down on the sofa and you bring your chair close to me to read tait nodded and unrolled the papers while claude filling himself another glass of claret crossed over to the sofa and lay down thereon with the glass of wine on the carpet beside him with the untasted luncheon on the table he closed his eyes with a weary sigh and compelled himself to listen tait glanced sympathetically at him then without remark though he was burning to speak smoothed out the paper and began to read slowly the writing was clear and legible the matter interesting so there was no difficulty in deciphering the story of the tragedy as narrated by the man who for twentytwo years had been supposed to be the victim the confession socalled was in the form of a letter from father to son dear claude at length i have made up my mind to reveal myself to you and to set out at length the circumstances which placed me in this position i am led to do so by three things firstly your presence in this neighborhood with the avowed intention of avenging my death secondly the publication of the novel entitled a whim of fate which sets out the particulars of what happened at horriston in more or less perverted for fictional purposes thirdly the advice of francis hilliston an old and valued friend who points out that the only way to stop you in the investigation is to admit my identity and so do away with your motive viz the avenging of my death on reading this i leave it to yourself whether you will still consider me your father and visit me accordingly or whether you will look on me as a guilty man till you are acquainted with the truth so far as i am aware of it i swear that i will not approach you or open my mouth in your presence on this understanding i set forth the following facts as shortly as is consistent with clearness judge me as you please but i declare before god that i am innocent of jeringhams death and that i know not who killed him this for the prologue and now for the story you will understand that i wish to cast no aspersions on the memory of your mother but in the present case it is necessary that i should speak plainly your mother and i were ill suited to one another and lived unhappily together even when in the army i was addicted to literary pursuits and when i sent in my papers i devoted myself almost entirely to study your mother was gay and social being a beautiful woman she liked admiration and was never so happy as when out at balls at the theater or at garden parties she lived in a whirl of excitement and she quarreled bitterly with me because i preferred a quieter life i accompanied her sometimes but not often enough to please her and when we came to reside at the laurels after my leaving the army she frequently declared that she regretted having given up mark jeringham for me naturally enough i resented this plain speaking and we were estranged not even your birth could bridge over the abyss between us and while we lived at the laurels at horriston i believe we were as unhappy and illmatched a couple as existed in england it was the quick coupled with the dead and we both suffered accordingly the first cause of our unhappiness was as you see incompatibility of temper the second was the presence of jeringham who came to horriston ostensibly on a visit in reality to stay near my wife you can easily understand that i resented the presence of this young man he was remarkably like me in height figure and looks and my wife had a fancy for him before her marriage with me that she became my wife she laughingly avowed was because of my uniform so far as looks were concerned there was nothing to choose between jeringham and myself but the glitter of the military trappings so she declared turned the balance in my favor you may be sure i liked jeringham none the more after such a declaration of lukewarm affection from your mother and when he came to reside at horriston four years after our marriage i resented his continued presence about the house your mother was angry at my expostulations and the introduction of this second element of discord into the house estranged us more widely than ever it was a miserable and most unhappy time it was my friend hilliston who pointed out the real reason for jeringhams visits this latter was not in love with my wife but with her maid mona bantry as denis the brother of mona was an old servant of mine i did not care to speak to my wife on the matter but to keep the affair quiet and to save the girl from the anger of her brother i discouraged the visits of jeringham on all possible occasions we had a quarrel in public and as all the gossips of horriston knew that he had been fond of my wife before her marriage to me the quarrel was set down to jealousy on my part all the neighborhood knew there was bad blood between jeringham and myself and foolishly enough i admit i made use of several expressions calculated to show my hatred these heated speeches were afterward remembered and commented upon things were in this position when the fancy dress ball took place at horriston hearing that it was to be a masked ball i resolved to assume a similar dress to that of jeringham and learn from my wifes own lips if she still cared for me you may think i acted in an unworthy manner but as a matter of fact i was nearly out of my mind with anger and jealousy and hardly knew what i was doing my wife was going to the ball as mary queen of scots accompanied by jeringham as darnley this was sufficiently pointed to show in what direction her affections leaned and i took advantage of the opportunity feigning an excuse i ostensibly went to london but in reality remained at horriston where i obtained from the costumer a similar dress to that worn by jeringham thus masked and disguised i repaired to the ball there i was recognized by a miss belinda pike but she kindly consented to keep my secret you can guess what happened deceived by the dress my wife took me for jeringham and i learned sufficient to know that she loved him and hated me i did not reveal myself but went away mad with wrath my sole idea was to unmask jeringham and show my wife how unworthy he was of her love to this end i sought out hilliston and learning that my wife was shortly returning home hilliston and i went to the laurels together as i intended to make mona confess that jeringham was her lover i left hilliston outside in the garden to watch for the coming of my wife and entered the house to see mona she was waiting in the sitting room for her mistress and i then and there forced her to admit the truth she declared that jeringham was the father of her unborn child and implored me not to tell her brother fortunately i had directed denis to stay in the entrance hall so he did not hear his sisters confession and she was safe for the time being while i was talking with mona my wife entered she immediately accused me of having feigned a visit to london in order to stay at home with mona the girl slipped out of the room and my wife continued her ravings she said that jeringham had come home with her and was at that moment in the garden there she swore to join him i prevented her leaving the room and ultimately she fainted i ran out to call mona and found that she had left the house no doubt to join jeringham in the garden to tell him that the secret was known i also went into the garden to seek for jeringham to my horror i stumbled over a dead body and hastily ran back for a light to see whose it was denis came with the lantern and we found it was the corpse of jeringham he had been stabbed to the heart i would have given the alarm but that denis quickerwitted than i at the moment prevented me he pointed out that it was wellknown that i was on bad terms with jeringham that the unhappy man had been murdered in my garden that my hands were red with the blood and my clothes stained owing to handling the corpse and said that i would be accused of the murder i saw in a flash the peril in which i stood i dont know if denis suspected me of the crime as he was not present when i first found the body but he acted the part of a friend we threw the body into the river and i made my preparations for flight no one but hilliston and miss pike knew that i had returned from london on that night for my wife would keep silence as i thought for her own sake and mona had disappeared i left the house in charge of denis and without a word to my wife who had brought about this catastrophe i sought safety in flight it was cowardly if you like but i had no other resource i would have been accused of the murder had i stayed for the evidence was strong against me i fled and trusted to chance to hide the crime the rest you know my wife was accused and tried for my murder as jeringhams corpse was so disfigured that it was thought to be mine i have mentioned the strong resemblance between us and this helped the deception i was compelled to keep in hiding as jeringham but i declare had the case gone against my wife i should have come forward and told all as it was i went abroad aided by hilliston who acted as my friend all through he looked after my unhappy wife till she died in london he took charge of you and brought you up like a son he also secured me sufficient of my own property to live quietly so i came to thorston under the name of paynton and here i have lived ever since i thought to die in peace but you claude have reopened the case i tell you this to show you the futility of trying to find the real murderer i do not know who killed jeringham nor do i think you will ever find out if after reading this you still consider me your father come at once to a most unhappy man be just be lenient my son and forgive your unhappy father george larcher chapter xxxviii a new aspect of things tait folded over the last sheet of this long letter with a sigh although he was pleased for claudes sake that george larcher was still in the land of the living yet he was distinctly disappointed that no communication had been made likely to elucidate the mystery yet the result of this confession was an entire displacement of the point whence it was necessary to survey the case the motives which had caused the supposed death of larcher would not suffice to explain the death of jeringham the case had assumed a new aspect but nevertheless it was as complex and inexplicable as ever tait thought of all this with inconceivable rapidity but did not give utterance to his opinion in the presence of his friend the letter is wonderful so far was his sole remark but it is a great pity that it ends so abruptly i suppose your father will personally relate all other details claude when you see him again the young man assumed a sitting position and deliberately finished his wine before replying to this remark he looked anxious and disturbed and now that he had recovered from the overwhelming surprise at finding his father alive seemed less delighted than he should have been a miracle had been wrought in his behalf the dead had been restored to life but he was by no means gratified by the occurrence i dont know whether i shall see my father again he said shortly but my dear friend oh i know all you would say interrupted claude hastily with a frown but i am not prepared to admit your arguments my mother is alive my father is in existence yet for twentyfive years i have looked on them as dead can you then wonder that i feel awkward toward them both that i am by no means disposed to render them that filial affection which you must admit they but ill deserve the question is so delicate that i can only hold my peace said tait after a pause i admit what you say still they are your own flesh and blood i might answer you as hamlet did on a like occasion replied claude with a bitter smile but a quotation will not mend matters what i have to consider is the advisability of seeing my father again you must certainly see him again said the other promptly why in the first place he is your father whatever you may say and in the second you had better tell him personally that you abandon further investigation of the case after all your object is gone for though you might want to avenge the death of a parent the murder of a scamp like jeringham can matter nothing to you oh that i abandon the case goes without speaking said claude quickly and you i act in the same way the further we go into the case the more perplexing does it become it is beyond me only at the last day will the mystery be solved still added tait meditatively i must admit a curiosity yet exists on my part to know who struck the blow of course your fathers story corroborates dicky pentals but the gardener mistook him for jeringham by reason of the fancy dress does this letter suggest anything to you it narrows the field of inquiry that is all your mother your father and denis bantry must necessarily be innocent as they were in the house when the murder took place in the garden if they are innocent who is guilty we have a choice of two who were outside at the time you can choose between hilliston and mona bantry mona bantry kill her lover how do you make that out you forget your fathers account of the scene in the sitting room said tait significantly then mrs larcher asserted in the presence of mona that she had come with jeringham furthermore that he was in the garden mona also jealous acts as any other woman would have done in such a position she goes into the garden to demand an explanation there is a quarrel between her and jeringham and she kills him then flies not to hide her disgrace but to evade the consequences of her act that is a feasible theory i think claude shook his head i dont agree with you he said emphatically you forget that we have my mothers account of the matter to place against that of my fathers if you recollect she also admitted finding my father and mona in the sitting room she also admits fainting but there all resemblance between the accounts ceases my mother distinctly says that she threatened her husband with the dagger that it fell on the floor when she lost her senses when she recovered them the dagger was gone now continued claude slowly if you remember the crime was committed by means of the dagger for it was found red with blood in the grounds and then was taken possession of by the police if my mothers account is the true one mona bantry may certainly have picked up the dagger and have murdered jeringham as you suggest but if my fathers story is to be believed mona left the room before my mother fainted and consequently could not have gained possession of the dagger it follows as a natural consequence that she could not have committed the murder tait nodded several times during this explanation to show that he agreed with the points raised but when claude concluded he rubbed his chin in some perplexity here we come to a dead stop said he impatiently it was asserted by the police that the murder was committed with the dagger worn by your mother as part of the fancy dress yes if you remember it was on that evidence she was arrested well if she wore that dagger in the sitting room jeringham could not have been killed with it because the murder must have taken place while your father was trying to pacify your mother claude glanced at the letter again my father makes no mention of the dagger in this he said with a puzzled look no i should like to hear what he has to say on the subject the more so as i incline to his story rather than to your mothers for what reason in her conversation with you mrs bezelor rather your mothersaid that she had threatened your father with the dagger in the sitting room of the laurels yes well if you remember the evidence given by her to the police at the time of the arrest was that she had lost the dagger at the ball and knew not into whose hands it had fallen claude looked nonplussed and knew not what answer to make that his mother had made two different statements he was compelled to admit he further remembered that his father had made no statement whatsoever about the dagger yet on the possession of that dagger turned the whole of the case whoever picked it up whether at the ball or in the sitting room must have killed jeringham assuming his fathers account to be true and claude saw no reason to doubt its accuracy mona could not have committed the murder nor could mr or mrs larcher be guilty it therefore followed that his mother had spoken truly to the police and for some inexplicable reason falsely to him the dagger must have been lost at the ball and picked up bywhom i can make nothing of it he said after due consideration the only way to get at the truth is to tell my father that his wife still lives and bring them together out of their meeting good may come you will then call and see your father said tait encouragingly yes i must i see no way out of it he must be informed that my mother lives and i am the proper person to tell him so though it is strange added claude suddenly that hilliston never told him humph that gentleman seems to serve both sides said tait gruffly your mother speaks well of him your father thinks no end of him and both trust him yet for what i can see he has deceived both how why by keeping back the truth from each he has let your father think your mother dead and vice versa what do you make of that i tell you i can make nothing of the whole confusion said claude crossly i will see my father and abandon the case for i am sick of the affair it is maddening what a pity your lunatic did not wake up a few minutes earlier so as to see who struck the blow and thus have settled the matter but it is not that which troubles me no what else disturbs your mind jenny jenny echoed tait with feigned simplicity i am afraid i am dull i dont see you must be blind then retorted claude in an exasperated tone you know i love jenny well well i cant love her she is my half sister indeed said tait in nowise astonished at this announcement how do you make that out why isnt jenny the daughter of paynton and isnt he my father he is your father certainly but i assure you jenny is not his daughter she is no relation to him tait what do you mean cant you guess no out with it man dont keep me in suspense why drawled tait enjoying the situation jenny is the niece of denisin other words she is the child of mona bantry and jeringham chapter xxxix the garnet scarfpin that same evening claude called to see his father he decided to go alone but asked tait to repair to rose cottage within the hour so that the meeting with his newly found parent having taken place a consultation could be held by the three regarding the proceeding with or withdrawing of the case tait especially stipulated that this arrangement should be come to as he was desirous of seeing mr larcher senior in order to disabuse his mind of the straightforwardness of hilliston privately tait believed that the lawyer would yet be found guilty of the crime on no other grounds could he explain the attitude taken up by hilliston since the papers had been placed in claudes hands the evidence of miss pike and dick pental failed to alter his idea on this point tait himself was beginning to feel weary of the investigation at every turn it took he was baffled by some fresh obstacle and he was not illpleased to find that the matter was at an end so far as claude was concerned that young man had sworn to avenge the death of his father but now that his father proved to be still in existence the oath was null and void so that claude married to jenny he would be quite willing to leave the solution of the mystery surrounding the death of jeringham to tait but tait himself determined to have nothing further to do with so wearisome a problem he waited considerably beyond the hour before leaving for the cottage as he rightly considered the father and son would have much to say to one another moreover it was necessary to give larcher time to overcome his emotion on learning that his wife was still in existence tait was by no means sure that the old gentleman would be pleased with this revelation according to his own showing his relations with his wife had been none of the best and to renew those relations after twentyfive years could hardly fail to be most unpleasant during this time tait gave no thought to jenny or denis as to the former he was so satisfied that she was the daughter of jeringham by mona bantry that he did not think it worth while to give the matter the benefit of the doubt what he was curious to know was how paynton or rather captain larcher came to stand in the position of an adopted father information on this point was conveyed to him before he reached the cottage by denis himself the old servant walked briskly along the road looking quite rejuvenated he had heard the good news and it had transformed his life in place of a crabbed expression his face appeared wonderfully cheerful and he saluted tait with a grin of pleasure the other could not forbear commenting on his changed appearance so clearly apparent even in the waning light of evening why kerry you look ten years younger he said stopping short in his amazement with an afterthought of dick pentals accusation ah and i do that same sir said denis saluting in military fashion and you know why sir are they reconciled asked tait guessing what was in the mind of the old servant begad they are chattering together like two love birds and my old master looking on with pride why kerry i spoke of captain larcher augh did you now sir i spoke of master claude god bless him and miss jenny god bless her god bless them both cried kerry taking off his hat with a burst of affection and his honor along with them oh glory be to the saints for this blessed day but sure i am forgetting my service sir the master is waiting to see you this very minute i was just on my way said tait signing to kerry to go on we will walk there together by the way does miss jenny know she is not the daughter of your master she knew it all along sir ah and why should you look surprised at that mr tait is it because she is the niece of an old soldier like me no no kerry but as you are aware miss jenny knows the case from those newspapers she found and in that report jeringham i see what you mean sir said kerry touching his hat in a deprecating manner but sure she doesnt know all she believes herself to be the child of my sister monawho is dead rest her soul and of a mr kennedy weve invented a father for her sir twould never do for her to know she was the daughter of the poor man who was killed it is just as well kerry do you know who killed him tait asked this question with a keen glance at the man no sir how should i know i ran out with the light when the captain called but i dont know who struck him the cruel blow he was a bad man sir deceiving my sister and disgracing the bantry family but he is dead and she is dead so well let them rest and the heavens be their bed by this time they were at the garden door and striking his hand over these sad memories kerry led the visitor into the house and showed him into the bookroom here were assembled claude his father and jenny all looking supremely happy though the old gentleman appeared to be rather shaken he rose when tait entered and held out his hand i am glad to see you mr tait said he in an unsteady voice and i thank you for the way in which you have aided my son i feel that an apology is due to you for my behavior on your last visit dont mention it replied tait cordially shaking the extended hand under the circumstances you could not act otherwise well miss paynton am i to dont call me miss paynton now mr tait she said smiling there can be no need for further concealment i can take my own name that of miss kennedy said tait quickly do not look so surprised kerry told me all about it as i came along i am at once astonished and delighted i dont wonder at it said captain larcher patting claudes hand you see i have found a son and soon sir you will lose a daughter observed tait significantly oh no observed claude with a laugh when i marry jenny we will all live together as a happy family marriage has it come to that you are astonished i see mr tait said the old gentleman shaking his head i am myself it is too soontoo sudden they have only known each other a few weeks and it is impossible that a union on so short an acquaintance can prove happy we will have a long engagement said claude in order to prove if we truly love one another but i am not afraid of the result neither am i remarked jenny slipping her arm within that of her lover i am sure nothing will come between us but come claude and we will see my uncle for i notice that mr tait is anxious to speak to your father about that horrid case captain larcher nodded his approval of this so claude and jenny left the room to seek kerry and be wept over by the old servant left alone with his host tait took a chair by the table and they looked at one another in silence the captain was the first to break it there is no need for me to recapitulate the events of the day he said with a weary sigh as claude told me you read my letter and are in possession of all the facts you may believe mr tait that i feel considerably shaken my interview with claude has been rather trying he has behaved in the most affectionate manner well now your troubles are all at an end captain larcher and at an end sir he interrupted sharply no they will continue my innocence is not yet proved and i must still remain here under a feigned name unless you agree to help me certainly i agree is it your intention and claudes to go on with the case we have come to that decision but i wanted to consult you before finally making up my mind do you think we ought to proceed i certainly do said tait promptly it is true that the police think that you are the victim but if you want to assume your own name inquiries would certainly be made one is never safe in these criminal matters even after the lapse of years if you did declare yourself to be captain larcher then it would come out that jeringham is dead and you would have to clear yourself besides the evidence of dicky pental would implicate you seeing that he mistook you in that fancy dress for jeringham true enough replied larcher nodding and there is another reason i have just learned that my wife is still alive and is protected by hilliston at hampstead i sent claude out of the room so that i could ask you a plain question give me a plain answer and tell me what are the relations between them i dont care to answer that plainly said tait with some hesitation but i think you can guess does hilliston love my wife on the authority of miss belinda pike whom i saw at horriston i believe he does and for her sake he had deceived me all these years it seems so in fact captain larcher hilliston has been playing a double game he kept you and your wife apart by assuring each that the other was dead that conduct alone stamps him as a villain then again he threw all kinds of obstacles in the way while we were investigating this case what for my own opinion is that hilliston committed the murder captain larcher clenched his hand and thought for a few moments it might be so he muttered more to himself than to tait hilliston was in the garden if he loved my wifea fact which i never suspectedhe might have killed jeringham out of jealousy but the dagger how did he obtain that no doubt at the ball i assure you mr tait that my wife had not the dagger when in the sitting room she declares that she threatened you with it then she either forgets or speaks falsely she wore it at the ball when i spoke to her there but when she returned it was missing hilliston came with me knowing jeringham was with my wife he might have picked up the dagger with the fullest intention of committing the crime now that i know he loved my wife i am not prepared to say how he acted in the garden while i was in the house and the garnet scarfpin mentioned in the novel that belonged to hilliston said larcher quickly i gave it to him myself denis picked it up in the garden but i thought nothing of that as i was aware hilliston was in the grounds on that night but now i believeoh i am afraid to say what i believe i may be wrong there is one way of finding out the truth captain larcher come up to town this week and see your wife then we may learn all the old gentleman leaned his head on his hand in deep thought for a few minutes i will come he said at length at whatever cost i will force the guilty woman to own the truth chapter xl face to face the conversation between tait and captain larcher was not finished that evening as the old gentleman worn out by the excitement of the day early retired to bed however he declared that he would be shortly ready to journey to london and claude left the cottage with tait on the understanding that his father was to be called for next day before they parted for the night claude made a remark about hilliston i hope he wont get wind of this he said dubiously or he may get mrs bezeli cant call her motherout of the way have no fear replied tait calmly hillistons hands are too full at present what do you mean why said tait lighting his candle your father showed me a letter from hilliston apologizing for not coming over as his wife was lying dangerously ill at the connaught hotel at eastbourne he said something of that in his note to me what is the matter with mrs hilliston she has the smallpox the smallpox echoed claude in a tone of horror poor creature she is a dead woman i dont know so much about that she may recover she may recover from the disease said the young man gloomily but not from the blow to her vanity many a time has she told me that if she lost her looks she would kill herself you mark my words tait within the week we will hear of her death and with these prophetic words claude retired to his room tait had no time to think of this conversation being occupied with anticipation regarding the meeting of captain larcher and his wife but it so happened that claudes prognostications occurred to him when the truth of the horriston tragedy was discovered and that was not long afterward perhaps like the young men fate herself grew weary of an affair which had dragged on for twentyfive years at all events she brought matters to a conclusion with almost inconceivable rapidity the first step toward the end was the meeting of husband and wife which took place at clarence cottage hampstead during the afternoon of the next day in company with his son and tait the old gentleman drove to the railway station some three miles distant and took the up express when established comfortably in a firstclass smoking carriagefor captain larcher was fond of a pipehe resumed the conversation with tait which had been broken off on the previous night this time the subject was hilliston and his doings i have been thinking over your suspicions regarding hilliston he said addressing himself more directly to tait and i confess that it is difficult to reconcile some of his actions with your view that he is guilty claude as you know was ignorant of the horriston tragedy until enlightened by hilliston i know that my dear sir said tait quietly hilliston certainly placed the papers containing the account of the matter in claudes hands but he was forced to do so by the action of mrs bezeli beg pardon mrs larcher continue to call her mrs bezel if you please i prefer it so how did she force hilliston to confide in claude because she read the book a whim of fate and seeing the tragedy therein described she wrote asking claude to see her with the intention of telling him all as you may guess her story differs materially from that of hillistons so of two evils choosing the least he determined to forestall her and inform claude of the matter and he did so by means of the press said claude eagerly in place of telling me the story himself he allowed me to gather what information i could from the scanty report of the canterbury observer my dear father the genesis of the whole matter springs from the finding of those papers by jenny had she not read them and told linton the story he would not have written the book had he not done so mrs bezel would not have determined to tell me her version and but for her threat to do so hilliston would not have produced the papers humph the action was compulsory on the part of hilliston i think so sir said tait complacently therefore it is quite in keeping with his usual character the rat did not fight till it was driven into a corner it is not in the corner remarked captain larcher significantly but well drive it there and see if it will face our accusation but what about hillistons introduction of claude to me would it not have been to his interest to keep us apart oh said tait with some contempt for hillistons diplomacy that was another case of necessity he knew that claude and i were bent on discovering the truth so fearing that we should do so by further investigation he thought to stop the whole matter by bringing you face to face with your son i dont see how that would accomplish his aim hilliston hoped it would do so in two ways explained tait glibly first he hoped that you would give your consent to claude marrying jenny and so lead his mind away from the case and second he trusted that when claude found you alive he would no longer desire to pursue the investigation he was right so far said claude seriously if that was hillistons calculation he made one great mistake said captain larcher scornfully he did not think that i should wish to see my wife he must have been satisfied that claude would tell you she was alive that of course but he thought i would stay at thorston as ferdinand paynton and be afraid to admit my identity even to my wife i might have done so but for claude but i owe it to him to clear myself and this meeting with my wife will be the first step toward doing so between us we must solve the mystery it is none so far as i am concerned said tait grimly i am sure as i am sitting here that hilliston murdered jeringham the gardener was just too late to see him do the deed but his motive asked claude curiously his father and tait stole a glance at one another they neither of them wished to make any remarks about mrs larcher and hillistons passion preferring that claude should be ignorant of that episode still when he asked so direct a question it was difficult to avoid a direct answer but larcher gave him one which was sufficiently evasive to stop further inquiries we must try and find out his motive he said quietly depend upon it claude there is a good deal of underhand work in this of which we know nothing do you think mona committed the crime no i do not in no way could she have gained possession of the dagger with which it was committed my mother says she had a dagger in the sitting room that is a mistake said captain larcher using as delicate a word as he could think of she threatened me with the sheath of the dagger and no doubt being agitated at the time she thought it was the weapon itself but i noticed when she entered the room that the sheath was empty her story to the police at the time of the trial is more likely she lost it in the ballroom the question is who picked it up judging from the knowledge i now have of his character i believe it was hilliston who did so or jeringham said tait suddenly impossible how could jeringham have found it he was with mrs larcher all the evening and may have seen the dagger fall or again he may have taken it out of the sheath to examine it and have forgotten to return it it is not improbable that in such a case he might have recollected it when he was in the garden and offered it to mona to return to her mistress oh said claude with contempt and on that slight ground you suppose that mona killed him it is not beyond the bounds of probability nonsense said captain larcher angrily i dont believe it mona was a good girl foully deceived by jeringham she fled from the house to hide her disgrace thinking my wife would tell her brother hilliston afterward met her in london where she died in giving birth to jenny then it was hilliston who brought jenny to you yes because her uncle denis was in my service i adopted jenny but told her that she was the child of a mr kennedy and mona bantry she believed her father and mother were married so do not disturb that view of the case certainly not said tait emphatically it would be cruel to do so but here we are at victoria after seeing mrs bezel at hampstead we can resume our conversation if we do it will be from a different standpoint i fancy said larcher significantly as the train stopped taits brougham was waiting for them at the station and in this they drove up to hampstead leaving it in fitzjohns avenue they walked down hunt lane to clarence cottage mrs bezel occupied her usual seat in the window and caught sight of claude as he preceded his father and tait up the path a terrified expression crossed her face but she made no motion to forbid their entrance yet a sense of coming evil struck at her heart and it needed all her selfcontrol to prevent herself from fainting when they were shown into the room my dear mother said claude kissing her you must be prepared for unexpected news i beg of you to control yourself for he stopped short in astonishment mrs bezel was looking at captain larcher with a bewildered air and he gazed at her face with an expression of amazement she shrank back as he crossed the room with rapidity and bent over her mona bantry he cried is it possible that you still live chapter xli an explanation on hearing his fathers exclamation claude turned round with a look of supreme astonishment he could not understand the meaning of that sudden exclamation father you do not understand this is your wifemy mother is it indeed sneered captain larcher who had recovered from his momentary emotion nothing of the sort sir this woman is mona bantry who was my wifes maid are you sure cried tait who was beginning to be bewildered by these successive revelations sure sir as sure as i am of my own innocence as sure as i am george larcher this is the sister of denis bantry who denis the interruption came from mrs bezel she had sat dumfounded at the unexpected appearance of the man whom she had thought dead and she had said nothing while assertion and denial were going on but the mention of her brothers name stirred her dormant faculties and she sat up looking wildly around denis she cried in a terrified tone is denis here denis is down at thorston said captain larcher gruffly as you no doubt knew well enough i swear i did not francis told me denis was in america francis exclaimed claude forgetting to whom the name belonged francis hilliston ah said captain larcher with a disdainful look round i might have guessed as much off with the dead love on with the living you have amended the proverb i did not know mark was dead sir exclaimed mrs bezel passionately francis said that he had gone to america with denis i thought he had done so to escape the consequences of his crime but of his crime cried claude he was the victim poor soul not the murderer it was jeringham who was killed not my father your father said mrs bezel looking steadily at captain larcher yes it is my old master so you are alive and he is dead why did you kill him sir i did not kill him replied the captain quietly and as a counter question may i ask why you passed yourself off to claude as my wife mrs bezel burst into a wild laugh and clapped her hands together then she covered her face and commenced to weep but in a few moments the fit of hysteria passed away and she became cool and composed thrown off her balance for the time being she had now gathered her wits together and was ready to fight her folly and impulse had brought about this catastrophe and it was her duty to set it right againif she could but the upshot of the matter was extremely doubtful on his part captain larcher was relieved to find that mrs bezel proved to be mona bantry instead of his wife ever since the communication made by claude he had suffered agonies at the thought that his wife had been living all these years under the protection of his false friend now that fear was set at rest once and forever julia larcher had really died as hilliston had asserted and the woman in clarence cottage who had taken her name was the maid in place of the mistress out of all the trouble larcher extracted this morsel of comfort his honor was unstained meanwhile the three visitors sat waiting to hear what mrs bezel had to say she saw that they expected a confession and resolved to disappoint them leaning backward among her cushions she closed her eyes and played a waiting game it proved successful for in two minutes or thereabouts captain larcher broke out his temper was none of the best and recent events had not tended to improve it well madam he said sharply rapping his stick on the ground i am waiting to hear what you have to say i have nothing to say said mrs bezel quietly oh yes you have began tait as you set the ball but at this moment he was interrupted by larcher i beg your pardon mr tait but i will question this woman myself pray do not speak nor you claude till i have done both young men bowed their heads and acquiesced in silence after all the captain was the proper person to examine mona bantry he knew more of the case than anyone else and conversant as he was with the events of that fatal night he would know whether she spoke truly or falsely mrs bezel looked uneasy on hearing his resolution but only compressed her lips tighter as though resolved to let nothing escape her but he was a match for her in obstinacy now then said larcher turning to her relate your history from the moment you left me alone with my wife twentyfive years ago at the laurels it would not help you if i did im not so sure of that but i understand you are afraid of incriminating yourself i exclaimed mrs bezel indignantly what have i to do with the matter i know nothing of it i left the house then and there and only heard of the tragedy while i was concealed at horriston more than a week afterward why did you state to my son that mrs larcher threatened me with the dagger so she did said mrs bezel coolly i saw her hand raised i saw the dagger in it you saw the sheath of the dagger you mean retorted larcher it fell on the floor and was found there next day but the weapon with which the crime was committed was lost by my wife at the ball it may have been said the woman indifferently i dont know anything about it did not jeringham show it to you when you joined him in the garden i tell you i did not see him on that night when you found out my secret i was afraid that you and the mistress would betray it to my brother denis so i left the room and fled i thought jeringham would join me at horriston next day but then i heard of your supposed death and that he had fled until this hour i did not know that it was the other way round did not hilliston tell you he knew no captain larcher he did not said mrs bezel emphatically he said that jeringham had gone to america with my brother where did you go after leaving horriston i came to london and remained there till my baby was born and then i found that my money had come to an end and called at mr hillistons office to ask him to help me what right had you to expect help from him i had no right but that i knew he would assist me because of his love his love exclaimed larcher sharply did hilliston love you yes i refused to have anything to do with him on account of jeringham but he did love me oh yes i know you thought he was in love with your wife but such was not the case he loved me and me only larcher drew a long breath and looked puzzled he was relieved to find that he had not been mistaken in hilliston after all yet the assertion of mrs bezel only seemed to further complicate the case if hilliston did not love mrs larcher what possible motive could he have to kill jeringham the looks of claude and tait reflected his perplexity but dismissing this special point for the moment he pursued his examination how did hilliston receive you mrs bezel looked around with a bitter smile her meaning was clear from the contemptuous expression on her face can you not guess from what you see here she said quietly francis hilliston bought me he loved me well enough but not sufficiently to marry me he did not ruin me for i was already ruined i accepted his offer to come here and be his mistress what else could i do i was alone in london i was friendless i believed that my lover and my brother had fled to america i could not return to horriston lest i might be involved in the tragedy at the laurels i did what any other woman would have done and made the best of a bad business i accepted the love and protection of francis hilliston the protection still continues as you seethe love that is dead and done with i see you are thinking of louisa sinclair interposed tait quietly what do you know of louisa sinclair asked mrs bezel with a violent start everything thanks to you answered tait your letter put the clew into my head i went to horriston i saw a portrait of miss sinclair i know that she went to america after the tragedy and returned as mrs derrick rich and beautiful to marry hilliston ah you know that much yes louisa sinclair is my rival ten years ago she came back to england and wanted francis to marry her i fell illi became paralyzed he forgot me he forgot my love and she became his wife oh how i hate her i hate him it was on that account that i wrote to you claude to reveal all you then acted out of revenge yes i did said mrs bezel sullenly look at me a wreck look at her his wife rich and handsome and healthy not healthy poor soul said claude she is ill with the smallpox with the smallpox echoed mrs bezel joyfully im glad of it im glad of it her beauty will depart as mine has done then francis may come back to me you love him still asked captain larcher in wonderment too well to ruin him you want me to accuse him of the crime but i tell you he is innocent he knows nothing he was in the garden alone on that night none other but he he was not alone cried mrs bezel sharply louisa sinclair was with him yes she followed him from the ball because she was jealous of me in my flight i passed her at the gate she had a cloak over her dress but i saw that it was the costume of mary queen of scots and you knew her by that partly my mistress told me that miss sinclair had a similar costume to her own for she was very angry about it but i saw her face as i fled she may know who killed jeringham i do not hilliston does not now i have told you all go away and leave me i speak no more first tell us why you declared yourself to be my mother said claude sharply for safety i regretted that i had told you that i had forced hilliston into defending himself i was afraid lest you should learn too much and denounce me as the criminal so long as you thought i was your mother you would not dare to do so and therefore i told you i was mrs larcher one last word said captain larcher rising to his feet your child what became of it hilliston took it away said mrs bezel in a melancholy tone i was ill at the time and he overcame my scruples i dont know where my child is often and often have i wanted to see her again but francis has always refused oh where can she be i can tell you you cried mrs bezel starting up in amazement yes your daughter jenny was brought by hilliston to me i adopted her as my child and she is now at thorston with her uncle denisyour brother mrs bezel tried to speak but could not with a wild glance around she heaved a long sigh and fainted the joy of hearing that her child was alive proved too much for her enfeebled frame chapter xlii the tragedy of a womans vanity meantime hilliston unaware of that fatal meeting with mona bantry which threatened to demoralize his plans was devoting himself to his unfortunate wife she was very ill and not expected to recover so feeling that he would soon lose her the lawyer stayed constantly by her side and strove though unsuccessfully to ameliorate her cruel sufferings it was all the more credit to him that he did so as he had married her mainly for her money and was still in love with mrs bezel no doubt remorse had something to do with his present attitude the landlord of the connaught hotel had insisted upon mrs hilliston being removed when the first symptoms of disease showed themselves he declared that were it known that he had a smallpox patient in his house he would be ruined for the season so hilliston recognizing the truth of this assertion took steps to isolate his wife as was necessary from the nature of her illness assisted by the doctor who attended to all details relative to the municipal authorities he hired a small house on the outskirts of eastbourne and thither the wreck of what had once been a beautiful woman was removed one evening nurses were hired from london hilliston sent word to his partner that he would not return to business for some weeks and then began the slow martyrdom of the sickroom it was a fortnight since mrs hilliston had been seized with the disease and now it had taken so favorable a turn that the doctor held out great hopes that she would recover but the beauty of which she had been so proud was gone and with it went the hopes that she could still retain her husband by her side mrs hilliston knew well enough that it was only her persistence which had made hilliston marry her and now that she had lost her good looksthe one hold she had on his lukewarm affectionshe foresaw only too clearly that he would neglect her in the future moreover the womans vanity was so powerful that she could not accept calmly the possibility of surviving a scarred and maimed object to face looks of pity and of horror she felt that she would rather die and in fact resolved to do so meanwhile she tossed and turned and moaned and wept on her sick bed crying out against the stern fate which had dealt her such hard measure yet in her secret soul she admitted that the punishment was just hilliston was scarcely less unhappy than his wife while her illness was serious he had thought of nothing but how to save her but now that a chance of recovery offered a respite from his arduous attendance by the sick bed he had time to turn his thoughts toward the horriston tragedy he wondered that he had not heard from paynton relative to the interview with claude and fearful lest some untoward event had occurred to upset his plans he wrote to rose cottage asking for information today he had received a reply and on reading it saw his worst fears realized i know you now wrote captain larcher briefly i have seen claude i have seen mona henceforth i look upon you as an enemy and i intend to take immediate steps to clear my name at your expense there was no signature but hilliston was too well acquainted with his friends writing to have any doubt as to the genuineness of the letter the blow had fallen mona had betrayed him and he sat there helpless with the letter in his hand a spectacle of baffled scheming of unmasked villany to clear his name at my expense muttered hilliston to himself what does he mean by that he cannot have discoveredbut no that is impossible when they find out who picked up that dagger at the ball they may learn the truth but not till then i defy them all larcher will remain paynton till the end of his life mona ah i shall punish her when i return to town for her cruel treachery while he was thus thinking a nurse entered the room to intimate that mrs hilliston would like to see him the lawyer obeyed the summons at once placed larchers letter in his pocket smoothed his brow and entered the sickroom signing to the nurse to go away mrs hilliston waited till she was alone with her husband francis she said in a low voice stretching out her hand i wish to speak to youon that subject i think it would be wise if you refrained from doing so replied hilliston knowing to what she alluded we understand one another on that point you can do no good by bringing it up again why should you for claudes sake said mrs hilliston feverishly you owe him some reparation i owe him none louisa i have acted like a father to him and he has turned on me i helped larcher to hide himself when it was dangerous for him to become known and he tells me that i am his enemy have you heard from him i received a curt note of three lines intimating that he was about to assert his innocence and clear his name at my expense francis cried mrs hilliston in a tone of terror you are lost if all is known all will not be known replied hilliston patting her hand only two people know the truthyou and i we can keep our own counsel but that little man tait is at horriston what of that he will see belinda pike there you know how she hated me because i loved you she wanted to marry you herself if he meets miss pike she will speak against me what of that said hilliston soothingly you forget my dear that your life is different now no one can find louisa sinclair in louisa hilliston when you went to america you vanished and returned as mrs derrick the rich widow belinda pike can never learn that my dear you distress yourself suddenly we are perfectly safe but the garnet scarfpin questioned mrs hilliston feverishly i am secure on that point larcher knew that i was in the garden on that night and may have thought i dropped it he will not dare to accuse me of the crime if he did continued hilliston his brow growing black i could turn the tables on him in a manner he little expects there is more evidence against him than against me but if they learn that i was with you on that night they will never learn no one saw you there if they did what does it matter louisa sinclair is dead you need have no fear of being recognized ill answer for that it does not matter to me if i am known or not said mrs hilliston gloomily i have done with life my dear the doctor says you will recover i shall not recover said the sick woman with emphasis oh do not deceive yourself francis i shall never rise from this sick bed to be an object of horror and pity to you my dear you never loved me you only married me out of pity at horriston you refused to make me your wife and it was only when i returned from america a rich woman that you did so pity she said with a scornful laugh no not pity but necessity you would have been ruined but for my money i admit it louisa and i am deeply grateful to you for the way in which you have helped me i can never repay you for saving my name and credit you can francis get me my dressing case louisa you cannot i insist upon being obeyed she said imperiously get me my dressing case with great reluctance he brought it from a distant table and placed it on a chair by the bedside in obedience to her directions he opened it and took therefrom a sealed envelope in there she said as he held it in his hand is an account of all i saw on that fatal night you must send that letter to captain larcher when i am dead louisa do you wish to ruin me i wish to save you francis do not deceive yourself into a belief that the investigation is at an end claude may cease to meddle with the matter for he is in love with jenny and will probably marry her for by this time according to you he knows who she is but i am afraid of spenser tait he will hunt you down he will urge larcher to find out the truth if it comes to that send them my account of the matter it will ruin me he said again it will save you she repeated do not be foolish francis you can read it before sending it away but you i shall be dead i feel sure i shall not live promise me that if the worst comes you will send that letter i promise he said sorely against his will but it will not be sent you will live i dont think so francis i know better than the doctor now kiss me my husband and leave me to myself he did so in silence and took up the dressingcase whereupon she stopped him let it be she said quietly some of your letters are in it and i wish to read them kiss me again again he kissed her and reluctantly left the room so quiet and self contained was she that he had no inkling of her intention had he guessed her fatal resolve little as was the love he bore her he would surely have striven to turn her from her purpose but he guessed nothing and left her alone with the devil tempting her goodby my husband she murmured as the door closed and then burst into tears he had gone she would never see him again and she moaned over her lost beauty which failed to retain him by her side he was coldly polite he was affectionate out of pity but he had no love for her and she hungered for the want of it her life passed before her episode after episode till it stopped short at the spectacle of a closed door and herself lying alone and deserted in that sickroom she wept and prayed and then with a firm hand took out of her dressing case a small vial filled with a dark brown liquid twice she put it to her lips and twice she hesitated the third time she accomplished her purpose the thought of her lost beauty of her husbands neglect of her childless home and wretched future all these nerved her and she drank off the contents then quickly replaced the bottle in the dressing case when the nurse came in to see her patient mrs hilliston was lying back with a quiet smile on her pale lips she had found peace at last chapter xliii the last appearance of francis hilliston unaware of the tragedy which had taken place at eastbourne captain larcher was in london brooding over his wrongs and weaving schemes how to avenge himself on hilliston his eyes had been opened by tait with regard to the conduct of that gentleman and he now saw plainly that he had been hillistons dupe for all these years indeed he began to share taits opinion that the lawyer was guilty and was casting about in his own mind how to prove this when an announcement in the papers informed him of the death of mrs hilliston the smallpox killed her no doubt said tait when he had expressed his regrets no remarked claude who had been looking over the general news it was a case of suicide suicide exclaimed the hearers in one breath yes according to this paragraph it appears that in some way or another she became possessed of a bottle of laudanum while the nurse was absent the woman returned to find her patient dead poor mrs hilliston added claude folding up the paper with a sigh how sorry i am to hear this i wonder why she committed suicide said tait meditatively she looked too determined a woman to yield to such a weakness no doubt she found out that her husband was guilty of the crime said larcher grimly and so did not care to live longer with a murderer you are wrong father observed claude looking up it was the knowledge that she had lost her looks which killed her depend upon it she took the poison so as to avoid dragging out her days a scarred and miserable object how do you know that claude asked his father with a curious look on his face because not once but twice or thrice mrs hilliston told me she would kill herself rather than grow old and ugly the loss of beauty came with the smallpox and so she has carried out her resolve it will be a blow to hilliston i dont think so said captain larcher rather cynically from what i remember of louisa sinclair the love was all on her side no doubt he married her when she was mrs derrick purely for her money no no i quite believe the story of mona bantry she was and is the woman of his love now the wife is dead he can console himself with the mistress that reminds me observed claude suddenly what are we to do about jenny is she to be informed that her mother is yet alive captain larcher shook his head set your mind at rest on that point he said with a nod i told mrs bezel that jenny was about to become your wife that she thinks her parents are dead and i pointed out that it would be unwise to mar the happiness of the girl by letting her know the truth mrs bezel agrees with me and she has consented that things shall remain as they are does she not want to see jenny father of course she does it is only natural poor soul but she loves her child sufficiently to avoid casting a shadow on her life jenny will never know that jeringham was her father or that her mother is still alive she will marry you claude as miss kennedy and know no more of her connection with the matter than she does at present and denis denis has been told i wrote him two days ago and i have no doubt he will come up to town to see the last of his wretched sister the last of her can you doubt it mrs bezel has death written on her face another blow for hilliston said tait in a rather regretful tone villain as he knew the lawyer to be he could not help feeling sorry for his troubles fate had held her hand a long time but now she was dealing a full measure and pouring the vials of her wrath on the head of the sinner it will be a heavier blow than the last said larcher in a severe tone for there is no doubt hilliston truly loves mona i suppose denis will object to his going near her again it is impossible to say we must leave that to the man himself this conversation took place in taits rooms one morning some three weeks after the momentous interview with mrs bezel it had been captain larchers intention to return at once to thorston but he had been dissuaded from this by his son who thought a few weeks in town would do his father good there was no doubt on this point for captain larcher brisked up wonderfully in the exhilarating atmosphere of the west end but for the unexplained mystery of jeringhams death he would have been quite happy in the recovered society of his son and even while the future was still black enjoyed himself in no small degree it did claude good to see that his father was at length getting some pleasure out of life after his years of incessant trouble and wearing anxiety the next day denis looking older and grayer than ever came up to see his sister he saw his master for a few minutes and then went on to hampstead i have told denis how ill she is explained captain larcher as the man took his departure and he has promised to be as lenient as possible toward her wrongdoing by the way hilliston is in town hilliston yes he came up in the same train as denis and had the impudence to speak to him asked him where i was as he wanted to see me to see you father cried claude in astonishment what for i think i can guess interposed tait quietly hilliston has been stricken by his wifes death and wants to atone for his sins by confessing the truth i would not be surprised if he called here this afternoon captain larcher looked skeptical but said nothing and the matter dropped for the time being as it happened denis was still ignorant that his sister had been the mistress of the lawyer else there might have been trouble he had but a confused idea of hillistons connection with the case and beyond knowing that he was the owner of the garnet scarfpin could not conceive that he had been actually present in the garden when the murder was committed true it was that the scarfpin had been found on the spot where the corpse of jeringham had lain but assured by his master that hilliston was innocent as captain larcher had truly believed these many years denis never gave the matter a second thought now he would learn the truth from mrs bezel denis only came back in the afternoon looking much put out the ruin of his much loved sister by jeringham had been a great blow to him but the discovery that she was alive and had been living in sin with hilliston startled him considerably he could hardly reply to the questions of his master but ultimately related that they had parted friends mrs bezel had told him that the doctor assured her she could not live much longer and in the shadow of death denis had freely forgiven her all her sins and follies and indeed sir what else could i do said denis wiping the tears from his eyes when i saw the poor thing lying there like a corpse its a bitter time shes had of it these last ten years in that deathinlife state oh yes captain i forgave her freely poor soul and hilliston asked larcher inquiringly may his black soul burn cried denis with a scowl were i or he younger id leave my mark on him mona had a letter from him saying he was calling to see her this evening but that he had an appointment with you sir with me denis it is the first i have heard of it where is he at this moment as if in response to his question the door opened and tait appeared looking very disturbed mr hilliston is here captain larcher and wishes to speak with you claude had entered the room by another door and on hearing this stepped forward looking slightly pale he slipped his arm within that of his father as though to protect the elder man then they all waited to hear what captain larcher had to say the permission for the interview must come from the man who had been most deeply wronged he thought for a moment or so with a frown on his face then sank into a chair with a deep sigh denis stand behind me he said in a peremptory tone claude sit down yonder now mr tait we are ready to see our friend tait anticipated this permission and was already prepared for it without a word he threw open the door and hilliston dressed in deep mourning entered the room with a paper in his hand he looked pale and worn his fresh color was gone and as he spoke he kept his eyes persistently on the ground it could be easily seen that the man had received a shock from which he would not easily recover i have called to see you and deliver this he said in a low tone placing the paper he carried on the table i do not ask your forgiveness larcher for i do not consider i have done anything to justify your anger against me you could have saved me all these years of anguish by telling me the truth said larcher indignantly perhaps but it was not to my interest to tell you the truth i dont wonder at that said claude bitterly you were afraid of the law perhaps said hilliston again on the other hand i may not be so guilty as you think me you will find the truth in that paper he pointed toward the table and the eyes of all immediately turned in that direction while hilliston moved toward the door having fulfilled the promise i made to my dead wife i now take my leave he said quietly i will never see any of you again and some day you may learn that you have misjudged me goodby he opened the door but before he could pass through denis sprang forward my sister he said with an indignant look in his eyes i am about to repair the wrong i did her replied the lawyer gravely by tomorrow she will be my wife chapter xliv the truth hilliston came and went in the space of a few minutes none of those present made any attempt to stay his exit but as the door closed after him they looked at one another in silence thinking of hillistons last speech denis was the first to speak what does that mean sir he asked his master with an air of helpless bewilderment i think it can only mean one thing denis replied larcher rousing himself mr hilliston has at length awakened to the fact of his dastardly treatment of your sister and is about to make reparation for the past he intends to marry her but his wife only died a few days ago master i know that but mrs bezel will also die shortly and if hilliston desires to atone for the past he has no time to lose he can marry her at once but he will again be a widower within the month denis lifted a pair of shaking hands and slowly left the room followed by the sympathetic looks of the others he did not even pause to learn the contents of the sealed envelope left by mr hilliston great as was his curiosity to learn all that had taken place on that fatal night his love and grief for his sister were greater still bowed and gray and olderlooking than ever he departed but in his heart there was one comfortable thoughtmona would die an honest woman if mr hilliston was to be believed when the three found themselves alone captain larcher picked up the sealed letter with some reluctance strange he said balancing it in his hand for years i have been eager to know the truth now that i have only to open this envelope to learn it i feel half afraid nevertheless it will be as well to lose no time in making ourselves acquainted with the contents said tait eagerly for he was in a fever of impatience to know all it may be a confession by hilliston i think not it is directed to me in the handwriting of mrs hilliston to ferdinand paynton no to captain larcher hm said tait with a start how did mrs hilliston know you were captain larcher did she see you at thorston no but her husband doubtless informed her of my real name however we will learn all from this said larcher breaking the seal i believe this is a confession by mrs hilliston but what can she have to confess cried claude as his father smoothed out a closely written letter she can know nothing of the tragedy you forget said tait with a sudden recollection louisa sinclair she was at horriston and according to mona bantry was in the garden of the laurels on that night i would not be surprised if she saw the committal of the crime what do you think she is about to betray her husband oh said tait significantly we are by no means sure of hillistons guilt larcher found that the writing was too small for him to read comfortably so handed the letter to claude with a request that he should read it out aloud excusing himself on the plea of the illegibility of the writing claude passed it to tait who accepted the office with avidity the letter was without date or direction and began in an abrupt manner highly suggestive of the agitation under which it had been written tait mentally noted these points and began this confession is to be read after my death by captain george larcher and if he sees fit he has my free permission to make it public still i trust out of regret for the memory of an unhappy woman that he will not do so save in the arising of two contingencies first should he be still alive and accused of murdering mr jeringham second should my dear husband be accused of the crime in the event of the occurrence of either of these contingencies i authorize him to make these pages public to explain myself i must go back twentysix years when i was residing at horriston you captain larcher will remember me well as louisa sinclair for at that time i saw a great deal of yourself and your wife i saw too much of her for my eyes were sharp and but for a natural reluctance to disturb your domestic peace i could have enlightened you as to her conduct she was never worthy of a good man like you she was as bad as i afterward became and that is saying a great deal as you will see by reading on i loved francis hilliston your intimate friend belinda pike loved him also but there was no need for either of us to be jealous of the other for mr hilliston loved a third person none other than your wife no doubt you will be angry when you read this but your anger cannot alter facts yes your dearest friend loved your wife let him deny that if he can at this point there was a marginal note by hilliston i do deny it and but that i am not in a position to do so i would not let george larchers eyes rest on this confession my poor wife was insanely jealous of mrs larcher but i swear that she had no grounds to be so i admired mrs larcher as a friend nothing more and i loved mona bantry she is the only woman who has ever attracted me and notwithstanding my marriage now dissolved by death she attracts me still this note was hastily scribbled in pencil and after tait had read it without interruption from captain larcher he continued the confession i admit that i was jealous of his attentions to your wife continued mrs hilliston for though i did all in my power i could not win him to my side regarding the efforts of belinda pike i say nothing she tried to gain his love and she failed i was more successful in the end but not till the lapse of many years here i may say that i have gypsy blood in my veins which at times renders me insanely jealous and in such a state i am capable of all things a recollection of this may enlighten you as to my acting as i did in the garden of the laurels i knew that your wife loved jeringham and could have told you of it i am sorry i did not now as she would have been disgraced and then francis might have turned to me for consolation but i held my peace and paid the cost of doing so i am doing so now you also for if you had been forewarned you would never have had to conceal yourself under a feigned name on account of jeringhams death at the fancy dress ball held at the town hall matters came to a climax my gypsy blood made me mad on that night owing to the way in which i was neglected by francis hilliston with some difficulty i learned that your wife was to be dressed as mary queen of scots and with a view to making myself attractive in hillistons eyes i chose the same dress with the assistance of the dressmaker who worked for us both i obtained a dress similar in all respects to that of mrs larcher hoping that by doing so he would speak to me under the impression that i was your wife my stratagem was successful i was masked and dressed as she was he spoke to me thinking i was she and i learned then how he loved her at that moment i could have killed her i could have killed him here there was another note in hillistons handwriting again i say that the poor creature was mistaken i did speak to her under the impression that she was mrs larcher but i said nothing that she could construe into a declaration of love her jealousy rendered her mad and she distorted the idle words i spoke she took them up in the wrong sense my suspicions were confirmed later on continued the confession for i overheard them talking together yes francis hilliston and your wife were in a corner together talking of love i listened it was mean to do so but then i was in love and would have stooped to any degradation to have rescued him from her clutches they talked about a dagger which he had given her to complete her dress aha he did not think to complete my costume with such a gift mrs larcher took the dagger out of its sheath and together they examined it she blamed him for putting an inscription on it saying it would make her husband jealous francis laughed and said that you would never suspect him then mrs larcher slipped the dagger back in the sheath as she thought but in reality it slipped down among the folds of her dress and when she arose to go it fell on the ground they departed and i picked up the dagger at once i looked at the inscription and there it was on the gold handleto j l from f h i was so enraged that i could have broken the dagger i tried to but it was too strong for me therefore i thrust it into my waistband and went in search of hilliston to return it to him and reproach him for giving it to mrs larcher i saw him wrapped in his cloak go out with mrs larcher he was seeing her home and in a frenzy of jealous rage i resolved to follow margin note by hilliston it was not i who went home with mrs larcher but jeringham i was dressed that evening as a venetian senator and wore a long black cloak this jeringham borrowed from me to conceal his fancy dress when he left the town hall my wife thought it was me but she was mistaken i went home with george larcher as he knows the confession continues they left in mrs larchers carriage and i hastily wrapping a cloak round me followed in a fly when i got to the laurels they were talking together at the door and the carriage had driven round to the stables i sat back in my fly for the driver did not know who i was and watched i saw mrs larcher kiss hilliston and run inside then i went out of my mindi was possessed by a devil he came down the path and turned midway to look back at the house i had my hand on the daggerit tempted me and i sprang out on him he turned sharply round and had i not been blinded with rage i would have then recognized him but i hardly knew what i was doing and before he could utter a word i buried the dagger in his heart when he fell with a choking cry i knelt down beside him and withdrew the dagger then i heard a sound dropped the weapon and fled some little distance off i ran into the arms of francis hilliston i shrieked as though i had seen a ghost and told him i had killed a manthat i had intended to kill him he explained the mistake of the cloak and said i must have murdered jeringham then he saved my life no one had seen me come to the laurels no one had seen me in the garden so francis took me back to horriston and i returned to the ball without anyone having suspected my absence the next day the news of the disappearance of jeringham was all over the town afterward the body was discovered down the river and mistaken for that of mr larcher francis advised me for my own sake to hold my tongue i did so and shortly afterward i went on a visit to a sister of mine in america francis refused to marry me on account of my crime in america i married derrick the millionaire he died and i returned to london i found francis greatly in want of money and as i still loved him i married him no one but us two knew who really killed jeringham but for your sake captain larcher i acknowledge my guilt lest you should be found out and accused of the crime i could say much more but this is enough when you read this i will be dead and my last words i swear are true i and none other killed mark jeringham in mistake for francis hilliston note by hilliston it will be seen that my wife was actuated all through by jealousy but i swear she had no reason i loved mona not mrs larcher nor her i saved her life because she committed the crime for my sake i married her because i was on the verge of pecuniary ruin i have nothing more to add you can blame me if you like but i consider i have acted all through as i was forced by circumstances chapter xlv a few words by spenser tait when the case has been stated when the witnesses for and against have given their evidence when the counsel on both sides have delivered their speeches it is then customary for the judge to sum up the entire matter for the direction of the jury in this instance i am the judge and here is the larcher affair summed up for the understanding of the public it has fallen to my share to wind up the story so here i set down such results as happened from the confession of mrs hilliston the immediate result of her death was the marriage of the widower to mrs bezel which took place so to speak when the latter was on her deathbed she lingered out another two months and died in the arms of her husband at peace with all the world denis heartily forgave her and the only bitter drop in her cup was the absence of her child yet when captain larcher suggested that jenny should be told the truth and brought to say goodby to her mother mrs bezel with a selfdenial for which i hardly gave her credit refused to permit such a thing she thought that jenny would be happier if she was ignorant of the truth and moreover mrs bezel shrank from letting her child know how she had lived during these many years at all events jenny never learned the truth and mrs bezel died without seeing her daughter that she forgave hilliston for having deprived her of the child is i think a proof of her goodness of heart for there is no doubt that he acted selfishly and cruelly in doing so but enough of mrs bezel her faults and virtues she lies in hampstead cemetery under a plain stone of rosecolored granite inscribed to the memory of mona hilliston so she had her wish at last and died an honest woman captain larcher returned with kerry to the cottage in nightingale lane as he could not make up his mind to resume his own name or tear himself away from the bookworm life of twentyfive years no one knew the truth save claude jenny and myself for hilliston being absent from england does not count the vicar was also enlightened on the subject and expressed much astonishment at the strange series of events which had culminated in the death and confession of mrs hilliston unwilling to lose his old crony he heartily approved of larchers determination to resume his usual life and so the matter was settled captain larcher will remain mr ferdinand paynton to the end of his days and will still be a mystery to the gossips of thorston how great a one they can never guess but a notable change has taken place in his habits he is no longer a recluse a misanthrope when i am at the manor house he visits me there he is a constant guest at the vicarage and may be seen frequently fishing beside kerry on the banks of the lax following the example of his master denis bantry also renounced his name which he superstitiously regarded as one of illomen and called himself kerry for the rest of his life if he was grieved for his unhappy sister her life and her death he finds consolation in the society of mrs claude larcher who conducts herself toward him as a niece should do but the relationship is not known beyond the walls of rose cottage lest it might lead to inquiries and jenny is still known as the daughter of mr paynton that claude should call mr paynton father is of course only regarded as natural by the village has he not married jenny and does he not stand in the relation of a son to the old man thorston gossips think he is a most perfect soninlaw and never guess that any nearer relationship exists between them of course jenny and claude were married as speedily as possible and i do not know a happier couple mrs larcher has quite converted me with regard to the fair sex and plumes herself on her victory she has the audacity to say that she will yet succeed in getting me married but i think that is beyond her powers mr linton married them and they spent their honeymoon at the manor house which i lent them for the occasion indeed while at thorston they invariably live with me and i should be offended did they take up their quarters anywhere else not that they have any desire to do so for rose cottage is rather small and besides the manor is within easy distance of it so that jenny can see her fatheror rather her fatherinlawas often as she chooses claude still goes to different parts of the world to build bridges and construct railways sometimes his wife goes with him but she does not like to be so long away from thorston paynton is now an old man and cannot live long so mrs larcher wishes to be near him as much as possible besides the cares of the nursery take up her attention so i think that in a few months claude will settle down to business in london and make his home at thorston as he always intended to do there is a pleasant little place not far from the manor which i have been commissioned to buy for him so i really think that next year claude and jenny will take up their residence among us the only person who disapproved of the marriage was frank linton who accused jenny of jilting him this was utter nonsense as she never had any intention of becoming his wife however the author considers himself badly treated and has taken up his quarters in london where he writes books and poses in chelsea circles but i do not think he will ever write so excellent a book as a whim of fate perhaps because mrs claude larcher refuses to tell him any more plots she has a good reason for so doing as the troubles which arose out of her finding the murder papers in the garret of rose cottage have startled her in no small degree still as i tell her she must look on such troubles as a blessing in disguise for after all they led to her marriage and present happiness but mrs claude does not see the matter in so amiable a light finally hilliston it is hard to say what has become of that gentleman after the death of his second wife he withdrew from business and went abroad there i believe he is still and from what i hear of him at odd times he seems to have developed into a kind of wandering jew france italy austria germany russia he has seen all these places and is constantly traveling about no doubt trying to live down the past whether he will succeed in doing so it is hard to say after some consideration i have come to the conclusion that we have been rather hard on hilliston he did not love mrs larcher in spite of his wifes insane jealousy on the point and i believe he was sincerely attached to mona bantry the blot on his character is that he did not marry her when she first came to london and seeing that he was in love with her i profess my inability to explain why he did not do so perhaps it was on account of her low birth or the circumstances which connected her with jeringham but at all events he did not marry her till it was too late for the poor creatures happiness otherwise i do not see how he could have acted differently louisa sinclair was guilty of the murder but as she did it on his account and was wildly in love with him it was to his honor that he protected her as he did whether he would have told the truth had mrs larcher been convicted i do not know but as louisa sinclair did not leave for america till mrs larcher was released i think hilliston would have persuaded her to confess openly in the event of a conviction it is true that he married her for her money but i think he was touched by her devotion and gave her some love no doubt it was mrs hillistons remorse for condemning his father to lifelong seclusion that made her so kind to claude when he was a lad now it is easy to see why hilliston was reluctant that claude and i should investigate the case he was afraid lest the truth should be found out and his wife arrested i was wrong in my surmise hilliston was not afraid for himself but for the unhappy woman who had killed jeringham in mistake for him the whole mystery would have been solved years ago had dicky pental spoken out as he should have done but the fear of being shut up in an asylum closed his mouth and so the case was at a standstill for fiveandtwenty long years it was strange that jenny who set the ball rolling should have been the indirect means of avenging her fathers murderor rather of solving the mystery which concealed it had she not discovered those papers in the garret she would not have been able to give frank linton the plot of a whim of fate had that novel not been written and published mrs bezel would not have read it and thereby have been induced to write to claude had she not done so hilliston would not have told claude the truth thence we would not have taken up the investigation and solved the mystery it was jenny who was responsible for the whole after fiveandtwenty years the child of the murdered man unconsciously enlightened us as to the person who had slain him fate works in strange ways but i do not wish to figure further as a detective this one experience has been quite enough for me the thought the anguish the trouble is too worrying the next criminal case in the larcher family can look after itself i abandon the role of detective and thus put the last word to my only criminal case the end a selected
