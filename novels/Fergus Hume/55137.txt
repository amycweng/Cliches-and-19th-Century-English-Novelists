your cards are scented the mystery queen chapter i a strange visitor a penny for your thoughts dad cried lillian suppressing a schoolgirl desire to throw one of the nuts on her plate at her father and rouse him from his brown study sir charles moon looked up with a start and drew his bushy gray eyebrows together some people would give more than that to know them my dear what sort of people asked the young man who sat beside lillian industriously cracking nuts for her consumption dangerous people replied sir charles grimly very dangerous dan mrs bolstreath fat fair and fifty lillians paid companion and chaperon leaned back complacently she had enjoyed an excellent dinner she was beautifully dressed and shortly she would witness the newest musical comedy three very good reasons for her amiable expression all people are dangerous to millionaires she remarked pointing the compliment at her employer since all people enjoy life with wealth and wish to get the millionaires money honestly or dishonestly the people you mention have failed to get mine mrs bolstreath was the millionaires dry response of course i speak generally and not of any particular person sir charles i am aware of it he answered nodding and showed a tendency to relapse into his meditation but that his daughter raised her price for confession a sixpence for your thoughts dad a shillingten shillingsthen one pound you insatiable person my kingdom for an explicit statement murmured dan laying aside the crackers lillian my child you must not eat any more nuts or you will be having indigestion i believe dad has indigestion already some people will have it very badly before i am done with them said sir charles not echoing his daughters laughter then to prevent further questions being asked he addressed himself to the young man how are things going with you halliday when sir charles asked questions thus stiffly dan knew that he was not too well pleased and guessed the reason which had to do with lillian and with lillians friendly attitude towards a swain not overburdened with moneyto wit his very own selfwho replied diplomatically things are going up with me sir if you mean aeroplanes frivolous frivolous muttered the big man seriously as a welleducated young man who wants money you should aim at higher things he aims at the sun said lillian gaily how much higher do you expect him to aim dad aiming at the sun is he said moon heavily hm hell be like that classical chap who flew too high and came to smash do you mean icarus or phaeton sir charles asked mrs bolstreath who having been a governess prided herself upon exceptional knowledge i dont know which of the two perhaps one perhaps both but he flew in an aeroplane like dan here and came to grief oh lillian turned distinctly pale i hope dan you wont come to grief before the guest could reply sir charles reassured his daughter naught was never in danger he said still grim and unsmiling dont trouble lillian my dear dan wont come to grief in that way although he may in another lillian opened her blue eyes and stared while young halliday grew crimson and fiddled with the nutshells i dont know what you mean dad said the girl after a puzzled pause i think dan does rejoined her father rising and pushing back his chair slowly he looked at his watch seventhirty you have plenty of time to see your play which does not begin until nine he added walking towards the door mrs bolstreath i should like to speak with you but dad my dear lillian i have no time to wait there is an important appointment at nine oclock here and afterwards i must go to the house go and enjoy yourself but donthere his stern gray eyes rested on dans bent head in a significant waydont be foolish mrs bolstreath he beckoned and left the room oh sighed the chaperongovernesscompanion for she was all three a kind of modern cerebus guarding the millionaires child i thought it would come to this and she also looked significantly at halliday before she vanished to join her employer lillian stared at the closed door through which both her father and mrs bolstreath had passed and then looked at dan sitting somewhat disconsolately at the disordered dinnertable she was a delicately pretty girl of a fair fragile type not yet twenty years of age and resembled a shepherdess of dresden china in her dainty perfection with her pale golden hair and roseleaf complexion arrayed in a simple white silk frock with snowy pearls round her slender neck she looked like a wraith of faint mist at least dan fancifully thought so as he stole a glance at her frail beauty or perhaps she was more like a silverpoint drawing exquisitely fine but whatever image love might find to express her loveliness dan knew in his hot passion that she was the one girl in the world for him lillian halliday was a much better name for her than lillian moon dan himself was tall and slim dark and virile with a clearcut cleanshaven face suggestive of strength and activity his bronzed complexion showed an openair life while the eagle look in his dark eyes was that new vastdistance expression rapidly being acquired by those who devote themselves to aviation no one could deny dans good looks or clean life or daring nature and he was all that a girl could desire in the way of a fairy prince but fathers do not approve of fairy princes unless they come laden with jewels and gold to bring such to lillian was rather like taking coals to newcastle since her father was so wealthy but much desires more and sir charles wanted a rich soninlaw dan could not supply this particular adjective and thereforeas he would have put it in the newest slang of the newest professionwas out of the fly not that he intended to be in spite of sir charles since love can laugh at stern fathers as easily as at bolts and bars and all this time lillian stared at the door and then at dan and then at her plate putting two and two together but in spite of her feminine intuition she could not make four and turned to her loverfor that dan was and a declared lover toofor an explanation what does dad mean dan raised his handsome head and laughed as grimly as sir charles had done earlier he means that i shant be asked to dinner any more why you have done nothing no but i intend to do something whats that dan glanced at the closed door and seeing that there was no immediate chance of butler or footmen entering took her in his arms marry you he whispered between two kisses theres no intention about that pouted the girl we have settled that ever so long ago so your father suspects and for that reason he is warning mrs bolstreath warning the dragon said miss moon who used the term quite in an affectionate way why the dragon is on our side i daresay your father guesses as much for that reason ill stake my life that he is telling her at this moment she must never let us be together alone after this evening after all my dear i dont see why you should look at me in such a puzzled way you know well enough that sir charles wants you to marry curberry marry lord curberry cried lillian her pale skin coloring to a deep rose hue why i told dad i wouldnt do that did you tell dad that you loved me no theres no need to said the girl promptly dan coughed drily i quite agree with you he said rising theres no need to since every time i look at you i give myself away but you surely understand darling that as i havent a title and i havent money i cant have you hothouse grapes are for the rich and not for a poor devil like me you might find a prettier simile laughed lillian not at all discomposed although she now thoroughly understood the meaning of her fathers abrupt departure with mrs bolstreath then she rose and took dan by the lapels of his coat upon which he promptly linked her to himself by placing both arms round her waist dearest she said earnestly i shall marry you and you only we have been brought up more or less together and we have always loved one another dad was your guardian you have three hundred a year of your own and if we marry dad can give us plenty and i know all that interrupted halliday placing her arms round his neck and it is just because sir charles knows also that he will never consent to our marriage i knew what was in the wind weeks ago darling heart and every day i have been expecting what has occurred tonight for that reason i have come here as often as possible and have arranged for you and the dragon to go to the theatre tonight but believe me lillian it will be for the last time tomorrow i shall receive a note saying that i am to stay away from lord curberrys bride im not his bride and i never shall be stamped lillian and the tears came into her pretty eyes whereupon dan as a loyal lover wiped them away with his pockethandkerchief tenderly andand she faltered andand he mocked knowing her requirements which led him to console her with a long and lingering kiss oh he sighed and lillian nestling in his arms echoed the sigh the moment of perfect understanding and perfect love held them until the sudden opening of the door placed dan on one side of the table and lillian on the other it wont do my dears said the newcomer who was none other than mrs bolstreath flaming with wrath but not as the lovers found later at them i know quite well that dan hasnt wasted his time in this leaguedivided wooing we thought that one of the servants began the young man when mrs bolstreath interrupted well and am i not one of the servants sir charles has reminded me of the fact three times with the information that i am not worth my salt much less the good table he keeps oh bolly dear and lillian ran to the stout chaperon to embrace her with many kisses was dad nasty he wasnt agreeable assented mrs bolstreath fanning herself with her handkerchief for the interview had heated her you cant expect him to be my sweet when his daughter loves a pauper thank you murmured dan bowing but dont you think it is time we went to the theatre bolly dear you must not be so familiar young man said the chaperon broadly smiling at the dark handsome face sir charles wants lillian to marry then i shant lillian stamped again i hate lord curberry and you love dan dont be so familiar young woman said halliday in a joking way unless you are on our side that is if i were not on your side rejoined mrs bolstreath majestically i should be the very dragon lillian calls me after all dan you are poor poor but honest worse and worse honest people never grow rich and then you have such a dangerous profession taking people flying trips in those aeroplanes one never can be sure if you will be home to supper im sure lillian would not care to marry a husband who was uncertain about being home for supper ill marry dan said lillian and embraced dan who returned the embrace children children mrs bolstreath raised her hands in horror think of what you are doing the servants may be in at any moment come to the drawingroom and have coffee the motorcar is waiting and hush separate separate cried the chaperon someone is coming she spoke truly for the lovers had just time to fly asunder when sir charless secretary entered swiftly he was a lean tall haggardlooking young fellow of thirty with a pallid complexion and scanty light hair a thin moustache half concealed a weak mouth and he blinked his eyes in a nervous manner when he bowed to the ladies and excused his presence sir charles left his spectacles here he said in a soft and rather unsteady voice he sent me for them and he had glided to the other side of the table by this timeoh here they are the motorcar waits miss moon where is my father asked lillian irrelevantly tell me mr penn in the library miss moon said the secretary glibly but he cannot see any one just nownot even you miss moon why not he is waiting to interview an official from scotland yarda mr durwin on important business you see murmured dan to lillian in an undertone your father intends to lock me up for daring to love you miss moon took no notice what is the business she asked sharply indeed i dont know miss moon it is strictly private sir charles has related nothing to me and if you will excuse meif you dont mindthese spectacles are wanted and he babbled himself out of the room while mrs bolstreath turned on her charge you dont mean to say you foolish child that you were going to see your father about this she indicated halliday i dont care about being called a this said dan stiffly neither lady noticed the protest i want to make it clear to my father as soon as possible that i shall marry dan and no one else declared lillian pursing up her pretty mouth obstinately then take him at the right moment retorted mrs bolstreath crossly for the late interview had tried even her amiable temper just now he is seething with indignation that an aviator should dare to raise his eyes to you aviators generally look down said dan flippantly am i to be allowed to take you and lillian to the theatre this evening yes although sir charles mentioned that you would do better to spend your money on other things than mere frivolity oh said halliday with a shrug as to that this particular frivolity is costing me nothing i got the box from freddy laurance who is on that very uptodate newspaper the moment as a reporter i have dined at my future fatherinlaws expense and now i go in his motorcar without paying for the trip i dont see that my pleasures could cost me less even sir charles must be satisfied with such strict economy sir charles will be satisfied with nothing save a promise for you to go away and leave lillian alone said mrs bolstreath sadly he has no feeling of romance such as makes me foolish enough to encourage a pauper you called me that before said dan coolly well theres no getting over facts i am a pauper but i love lillian and i began lillian advancing only to be waved back and prevented from speaking further by mrs bolstreath dont make love before my very eyes she said crossly after all i am paid to keep you two apart andandwell theres no time for coffee so we had better finish the discussion in the car there is plenty of time between hampstead and the strand to allow of a long argument and remember dan mrs bolstreath turned at the door to shake her finger this is your last chance of uninterrupted conversation with lillian let us make honey while the flowers bloom whispered halliday poetically and stole a final and hasty kiss before he led the girl after the amiable dragon who had already left the room the lovers found her talking to a poorlydressed and rather stout female clothed in rusty mourning who looked the picture of decent but respectable poverty the entrance door stood open and the waiting motorcar could be seen at the steps while the footman stood near mrs bolstreath watching her chatting to the stranger and wearing an injured expression it seemed that the decent woman wished to see sir charles and the footman had refused her admission since his master was not to be disturbed the womanshe called herself mrs brown and was extremely tearfulhad therefore appealed to the dragon who was explaining that she could do nothing oh but i am sure you can get sir charles moon to see me my lady wailed mrs brown with a dingy handkerchief to her red eyes my son has been lost overboard off one of those steamers sir charles owns and i want to ask him to give me some money my son was my only support and now i am starving lillian knew that her father owned a number of tramp steamers which picked up cargoes all over the world and saw no reason why the woman should not have the interview since her son had been drowned while in moons service the hour was certainly awkward since sir charles had an appointment before he went down to the house but a starving woman and a sorrowful woman required some consideration so she stepped forward hastily and touched mrs browns rusty cloak i shall ask my father to see you she said quickly wait here and without consulting mrs bolstreath she went impulsively to her fathers study while mrs brown dabbed her eyes with her handkerchief and called down blessings on her young head dan believed the story of the lost son but doubted the tale of starvation as mrs brown looked too stout to have been without food for any length of time he looked hard at her face which was more wrinkled than a fat womans should be although such lines might be ascribed to grief she wept profusely and was so overcome with sorrow that she let down a ragged veil when she saw dans eager gaze the young gentleman she observed could not understand a mothers feelings or he would not make a show of her by inquisitorial glances the remark was somewhat irrelevant and the action of letting down the veil unnecessary but much might be pardoned to a woman so obviously afflicted dan was about to excuse his inquiring looks when lillian danced back with the joyful information that her father would see mrs brown for a few minutes if she went in at once and i have asked him to help you said the girl patting the tearful womans shoulder as she passed to the motorcar oh its past eight oclock dan well never be in time the musical comedy doesnt begin until nine halliday assured her and in a few minutes the three of them were comfortably seated in the luxurious car which whirled at breakneck speed towards the strand of course lillian and dan took every advantage of the opportunity seeing that mrs bolstreath was sympathetic enough to close her eyes to their philanderings they talked all the way to the curtain theatre they talked all through the musical comedy and talked all the way back to the house at hampstead mrs bolstreath knowing that the young couple would not have another opportunity for uninterrupted lovemaking and being entirely in favor of the match attended to the stage and left them to whisper unreproved she did not see why dan whom lillian had loved since the pair had played together as children should be set aside in favor of a dryasdust barrister even though he had lately come into a fortune and a title but of course said mrs bolstreath between the facts if you could only invent a perfect flyingmachine they would make you a duke or something and give you a large income then you could marry what are you talking about bolly darling asked lillian much puzzled as she could not be supposed to know what was going on inside her friends head about you and dan dear he has no money and i shall make heaps and heaps of money said dan sturdily aviation is full of paying possibilities and the nation that first obtains command of the air will rule the world im no fool youre a commoner snapped mrs bolstreath quickly and unless as i said you are made a duke for inventing a perfect aeroplane lord curberry is certainly a better match for lillian hes as dull as tombs said miss moon with her pretty nose in the air you cant expect to have everything my dear child i can expect to have dan retorted lillian decidedly whereat dan whispered sweet words and squeezed his darlings gloved hand well said mrs bolstreath as the curtain rose on the second act ill do my best to help you since i believe in young love and true love hush children people are looking attend to the stage dan and lillian did their best to follow her advice and sat demurely in their stalls side by side watching the heroine flirt in a duet with the hero both giving vent to their feelings in a lively musical number but they really took little interest in the happy bachelor as the piece was called in spite of the pretty girls and the charming music and the artistic dresses and the picturesque scenery they were together and that was all they cared about and although a dark cloud of parental opposition hovered over them they were not yet enveloped in its gloom and after all since mrs bolstreath was strongly prejudiced in their favor lillian hoped that she might induce sir charles to change his mind as regards lord curberry he loved his daughter dearly and would not like to see her unhappy as she certainly would be if compelled to marry any one but dan lillian said this to mrs bolstreath and to dan several times on the way home and they entirely agreed with her although i havent much influence with sir charles mrs bolstreath warned them and he is fond of having his own way he always does what i ask said lillian confidently why although he was so busy this evening he saw mrs brown when i pleaded for her he couldnt resist you whispered dan fondly no one could mrs bolstreath argued this point saying that lillian was sir charless daughter and fathers could not be expected to feel like lovers she also mentioned that she was jeopardizing her situation by advocating the match which was certainly a bad one from a financial point of view and would be turned out of doors as an old romantic fool the lovers assured her she was the most sensible of women and that if she was turned out of doors they would take her in to the cottage where they proposed to reside like two turtle doves then came laughter and kisses and the feeling that the world was not such a bad place after all it was a very merry trio that alighted at the door of moons great hampstead mansion then came a shock the worse for being wholly unexpected at the door the three were met by marcus penn who was moons secretary he looked leaner and more haggard than ever and his general attitude was that of the bearer of evil news dan and lillian and mrs bolstreath stared at him in amazement you may as well know the worst at once miss moon said penn his lips quivering with nervousness your father is dead he has been murdered chapter ii a complete mystery it was mrs bolstreath who carried lillian upstairs in her stout arms for when penn made his brusque announcement the girl fainted straight away which was very natural considering the horror of the information dan remained behind to tell the secretary that he was several kinds of fool since no one but a superfine ass would blurt out so terrible a story to a delicate girl not that penn had told his story for lillian had become unconscious the moment her bewildered brain grasped that the father she had left a few hours earlier in good health and spirits was now a corpse but he told it to dan and mentioned that mr durwin was in the library wherein the death had taken place mr durwin who is mr durwin asked dan trying to collect his senses which had been scattered by the dreadful news an official from scotland yard i told you so after dinner said penn in an injured tone he came to see sir charles by appointment at nine oclock and found him a corpse sir charles was alive when we left shortly after eight remarked dan sharply at a quarterpast eight to be precise what took place in the meantime obviously the violent death of sir charles faltered the secretary what evidence have you to show that he died by violence asked halliday mr durwin called in a doctor and he says that sir charles had been poisoned blurted out penn uneasily i believe that womanmrs brown she called herselfpoisoned him she left the house at a quarter to nine so the footman says for he let her out and it is impossible that a complete stranger should poison sir charles interrupted dan impatiently she would not have the chance she was alone with sir charles for thirty minutes more or less said penn tartly she had every chance and she took it but how could she induce sir charles to drink poison she didnt induce him to drink anything the doctor says that the scratch at the back of the dead mans neck here dan roughly pushed the secretary aside becoming impatient of the scrappy way in which he detailed what had happened let me go to the library for myself and see what has happened sir charles cant be dead its twelve oclock now retorted penn stepping aside and hes been dead quite three hours as the doctor will tell you before the man finished his sentence dan scarcely grasping the situation so rapidly had it evolved ran through the hall towards the back of the spacious house where the library was situated he dashed into the large and luxuriously furnished room and collided with a police officer who promptly took him by the shoulder there were three other men in the room who turned from the corpse at which they were looking when they heard the noise of hallidays abrupt entrance the foremost man and the one who spoke first was short and stout and arrayed in uniform with cold gray eyes and a hard mouth whats thiswhats this he demanded in a raucous voice who are you my name is halliday said dan hurriedly i am engaged to miss moon and we have just returned from the theatre to hearto hear he caught sight of moons body seated in the deskchair and drooping limply over the table oh it is true then he is dead good heavens who murdered him how do you know that sir charles has been murdered asked the officer sternly mr penn the secretary told me just now in the hall said dan shaking himself free of the policeman he blurted it out like a fool and miss moon has fainted mrs bolstreath has taken her upstairs but how did it come about who found the body and i found the body interrupted one of the other men who was tall and calmfaced with a bald head and a heavy irongray moustache perfectly clothed in fashionable eveningdress and somewhat imperious in his manner of speaking i had an appointment with sir charles at nine oclock and came here to find him as you now see himhe waved his hand toward the deskthe doctor will tell you how he died by poison said the third man who was dark young unobtrusive and retiring in manner you see this deep scratch on the back of the neck in that way the poison was administered i take it that sir charles was bending over his desk and the person who committed the crime scratched him with some very sharp instrument impregnated with poison mrs brown gasped dan staring at the heavy swollen body of his late guardian whom he had dined with in perfect health the three men glanced at one another as he said the name and even the policeman on guard at the door looked interested the individual in uniform spoke with his cold eyes on dans agitated face what do you know of mrs brown mr halliday he demanded abruptly dont you know that a woman of that name called here yes the secretary mr penn told us that miss moon induced her father to see a certain mrs brown who claimed that her son had been drowned while working on one of the steamers owned by sir charles you saw her also i believe i was in the hall when miss moon went to induce her father to see the poor woman that was about a quarterpast eight oclock and mrs brownas we have found from inquiryleft the house at a quarter to nine do you think she is guilty i cant say didnt the footman see the bodythat is if mrs brown committed the crimewhen he came to show her out sir charles would naturally ring his bell when the interview was over and the footman would come to conduct her to the door sir charles never rang his bell said the officer drily mrs brown passed through the entrance hall at a quarter to nine oclock and mentioned to the footmanquite unnecessarily i thinkthat sir charles had given her money he let her out of the house naturally the footman not hearing any bell did not enter this room norso far as any one else is concerneddid a single person only when mr durwin i came at nine oclock interrupted the baldheaded man imperiously to keep my appointment the footman told mr penn who took me to sir charles he knocked but there was no answer so he opened the door and we saw this he again waved his hands towards the body does mr penn know nothing asked halliday doubtfully no answered the other inspector tenson has questioned him carefully in my presence mr penn says that he brought sir charles his spectacles from the diningroom before you left for the theatre with the two ladies and then was sent to his own room by his employer to write the usual letters he remained there until nine oclock when he was called out to receive me and we know that mr penn speaks truly for the typewriting girl who was typing sir charless letters to mr penns dictation says that he did not leave the room all the time may i look at the body asked dan approaching the desk and on receiving an affirmative reply from durwin bent over the dead the corpse was much swollen the face indeed being greatly bloated while the deep scratch on the nape of the neck looked venomous and angry yet it was a slight wound to bring about so great a catastrophe and the poison must have been very deadly and swift deadly because apparently sir charles had no time to move before it did its work and swift because he could not even have called for assistance which he surely would have done had he been able to keep his senses dan mentioned this to the watchful doctor who nodded i cant say for certain he remarked cautiously but i fancy that snakepoison has been used that will be seen to when the postmortem is made and this fly halliday pointed to an insect which was just behind the left ear of the dead man fly echoed inspector tenson in surprise and hastily advancing to look a fly in november impossible yet it is a fly and dead if not he swept the neck of the corpse with his curved hand it would get away hm now i wonder what this means get me a magnifying glass there was not much difficulty in procuring one as such an article lay on the desk itself being used no doubt by sir charles to aid his failing sight when he examined important documents tenson inspected the fly and removed ittook it to a near electric light and examined it then he came back and examined the place behind the left ear whence he had removed it its been gummed on he declared in surprisea surprise which was also visible in the faces of the other men you can see the glistening spot on the skin and the flys legs are sticky he balanced the fly on his little finger as he spoke i am sure they are sticky although it is hard to say with such a small insect however he carefully put away the fly in a silver matchbox well have this examined under a more powerful glass you are all witnesses gentlemen that a fly was found near the wound which caused sir charles moons death and the scent what about the scent dan sniffed as he spoke and then bent his nose to the dead man it seems to come from his clothes scent echoed durwin sharply and sniffed yes i observed that scent but i did not take any notice of it nor did i said the doctor i noticed it also and i followed on the inspector and why should we take notice of it mr halliday many men use scent sir charles never did said dan emphatically he hated scents of all kinds even when women used them he certainly would never have used them himself ill swear to that then this scent assumes importance durwin sniffed again and held his aquiline nose high it is fainter now but i smelt it very strongly when i first came in and looked at the body a strange perfume it is the three men tried to realize the peculiar odor of the scent and became aware that it was rich and heavy and sickly and somewhat drowsy in its suggestion a kind of thing to render a man sleepy said dan musingly or insensible said inspector tenson hastily and put his nose to the dead mans chin and mouth he shook his head as he straightened himself i fancied from your observation mr halliday that the scent might have been used as a kind of chloroform but theres no smell about the face it comes from the clothes he sniffed again yes it certainly comes from the clothes did you smell this scent on mrs brown he demanded suddenly no i did not admitted halliday promptly otherwise i should certainly have noted it i have a keen sense of smell mrs bolstreath and lili mean miss moonmight have noticed it however at that moment as if in answer to her name the door opened suddenly and lillian brushed past the policeman in a headlong entrance into the library her fair hair was in disorder her face was bloodless and her eyes were staring and wild behind her came mrs bolstreath hurriedly evidently trying to restrain her but the girl would not be restrained and rushed forward scattering the small group round the dead to fling herself on the body oh father father she sobbed burying her face on the shoulder of her dearlyloved parent how awful it is oh my heart will break how shall i ever get over it father father father she wept and wailed so violently that the four men were touched by her great grief both mr durwin and inspector tenson had daughters of their own while the young doctor was engaged they could feel for her thoroughly and no one made any attempt to remove her from the body until mrs bolstreath stepped forward lillian darling lillian my child she said soothingly and tried to lead the poor girl away but lillian only clung closer to her beloved dead no no let me alone i cant leave him poor dear fatheroh i shall die dear said mrs bolstreath raising her firmly but kindly your father is not there but in heaven only the clay remains it is all i have and father was so good so kindoh who can have killed him in this cruel way she looked round with streaming eyes we think that a mrs brown began the inspector only to be answered by a loud cry from the distraught girl mrs brown then i have killed father i have killed him i persuaded him to see the woman because she was in trouble and she killed himoh the wretchthetheohoh what had i done to her that she should rob me of my dear kind father and she cried bitterly in her old friends tender arms had you ever seen mrs brown before asked durwin in his imperious voice although he lowered it in deference to her grief lillian winced at the harsh sound no no i never saw her before how could i have seen her before she said that her son had been drowned and that she was poor i asked father to help her and he told me he would its my fault that she saw my father and nowher voice leaped an octavehes dead ohoh my fathermy father and she tried to break from mrs bolstreaths arms to fling herself on the dead once more lillian darling dont cry said dan placing his hand on her shoulder you have not lost the dearest and best of fathers she sobbed violently your loss is my loss said halliday in a voice of pain but we must be brave both you and i he associated himself with her so as to calm her grief its not your fault that your dear father is dead i persuaded him to see mrs brown and shesheshe we cant say if this woman is guilty as yet said durwin hastily so do not blame yourself miss moon but did you smell any scent on this mrs brown lillian looked at him vacantly and shook her head then she burst once more into hard and painful sobbing trying again to embrace the dead man dont ask her any questions sir said halliday in a low voice to mr durwin you see she is not in a fit state to reply lillian he raised her up from her knees and gently but firmly detached her arms from the dead my darling your father is past all earthly aid we can do nothing but avenge him go with mrs bolstreath and lie down we must be firm firm firmand father dead wailed lillian oh what a wretch that mrs brown must be to kill him kill her danoh make her suffer my good kind father whowhoohshe flung herself on dans necktake me away take me away and her lover promptly carried her to the door mrs bolstreath who had been talking hurriedly to inspector tenson came after the pair and took the girl from dan she must lie down and have a sleepingdraught she said softly if the doctor will come the doctor was only too glad to come he was a young man beginning to practise medicine in the neighborhood and had been hurriedly summoned in default of an older physician the chance of gaining a new and wealthy patient was too good to lose so he quickly followed mrs bolstreath as she led the halfunconscious girl up the stairs dan closed the door and returned to the inspector and the official from scotland yard the former was speaking mrs bolstreath did not smell any perfume on mrs brown he was saying and ladies are very quick to notice such things miss moon also shook her head i dont think miss moon was in a state of mind to understand what you were saying mr inspector said halliday drily however i am quite sure from my own observation that mrs brown did not use the perfume i would have noticed it at once for i spotted it the moment i examined the body so did i said durwin once more but i thought sir charles might have used it you say he did not therefore the scent is a clue it does not lead to the indictment of mrs brown however sir said tenson thoughtfully since she had no perfume of that sort about her but she must have killed sir charles for she was the last person who saw him alive she may come forward and exonerate herself suggested dan after a pause or she may have left her address with sir charles i have glanced through the papers on the desk and can find no address was the inspectors reply yet if she gave it to him it would be there durwin meditated then looked up as she was the mother of the man in sir charless employment who was drowned he said in his harsh voice and now very official in his manner in the offices of the company who own the steamerssir charles was a director and chief shareholder i understand from his secretary mr pennwill be found the drowned mans address which will be that of his mother but i cant see what motive mrs brown had to murder sir charles remarked dan in a puzzled tone well learn the motive when we find mrs brown said tenson who had made a note of durwins suggestion many people think they have grievances against the rich and we know that the late sir charles was a millionaire he doubtless had enemiesdangerous enemies dangerous the word recalled to dan what moon had said at the dinnertable when lillian had playfully offered him a penny for his thoughts sir charles at dinner said something about dangerous people what did he say asked the inspector and again opened his notebook dan reported the conversation which was not very satisfactory as moon had only spoken generally tenson noted down the few remarks but did not appear to think them important durwin however was struck by what had been said sir charles asked me here to explain about a certain gang he believed was in existence he remarked whats that sir asked the inspector alertly did he tell you anything of course he didnt how could he when he was dead when i arrived retorted durwin with a frown he simply said that he wished to see me in my official capacity about some gang but gave me no details those were to be left until i called here he preferred to see me here instead of at my office for reasons which he declared he would state when we met in this room then you think that a gang mr inspector interrupted durwin stiffly i have told you all that was said by the deceased whether the gang is dangerous or what the members do or where they are i cannot say have you examined those windows he asked suddenly pointing to three frenchwindows at the side of the room yes said tenson promptly as soon as i entered the apartment i did so they are all locked and if they were not no one would enter there put in dan quickly outside is a walled garden and the wall is very high with broken bottles on top i suppose mr durwin you are thinking that some one may have come in to kill sir charles between the time of mrs browns departure and your coming yes assented the other sharply if the perfume is a clue mrs brown must be innocent penn as we know from the statement of the typewriter girl was in his room all the time and the servants have fully accounted for themselves we examined them allthe inspector and i did that iswhen you were at the theatre he waved his hand with a shrug who can say who is guilty well said tenson snapping the elastic band round his notebook and putting it into his pocket we have the evidence of the fly and of the perfume what do you think about the fly asked dan staring i dont know what to think it is an artificial fly exquisitely made and has been gummed on the dead mans neck behind the left ear the assassin must have placed it there since a man would scarcely do such a silly thing himself why it was placed there i cant say any more than i can guess why sir charles was murdered or who murdered him the affair is a complete mystery as you must admit before the inquest and after the inquest more people than the three men who had held the discussion in the presence of the dead admitted that the affair was a mystery in fact the evidence at the inquest only plunged the matter into deeper gloom tenson acting on durwins advice sought the office of the trampsteamer companythe universal carrier linein which the late sir charles was chief shareholder and director to learn without any difficulty the whereabouts of mrs brown the mother of the drowned man she proved to be an entirely different person to the woman who had given the name on the fatal night being lean instead of stout comparatively young instead of old and rather handsome in an elderly way in place of being wrinkled and worn with grief she declared that she had never been near moons house on the night of the murder or on any other night mrs bolstreath lillian the footman and dan all swore that she was not the mrs brown who had sought the interview with sir charles therefore it was argued by every one that mrs brown taking a false name and telling a false story must have come to see moon with the deliberate intention of murdering him search was made for her but she could not be found from the moment she passed out of the front door she had vanished and although a description was published of her appearance and a reward was offered for her apprehension no one came forward to claim it guilty or innocent she was invisible inspector tenson did not speak at the inquest of the gang about which sir charles had intended to converse with mr durwin as it did not seem to have any bearing on the case also as durwin suggested if it had any bearing it was best to keep the matter quiet until more evidence was forthcoming to show that such a gangwhatever its business wasexisted then the strange episode of the fly was suppressed for the same reason privately tenson informed dan that he would not be surprised to learn that there was a gang of murderers in existence whose signmanual was a fly real or artificial and instanced another gang which had been broken up some years previously who always impressed the figure of a purple fern on their victim but the whole idea said tenson was so vague that he thought it best to suppress the fact of the artificial fly on the dead mans neck if theres anything in it finished the inspector theres sure to be other murders committed and the fly placed on the victim well wait and see and if a second case occurs well be sure that such a gang exists and will collar the beasts best to say nothing mr halliday so he said nothing and dan said nothing and durwin who approved of the necessary secrecy held his tongue of course there was a lot of talk and many theories as to who had murdered the millionaire and why he had been murdered in so ingenious a manner the postmortem examination proved that moon had died of snakepoison administered through the scratch on the neck and the circumstantial evidence at the inquest went to show that he must have been taken unawares while bending over his desk some people thought that mrs brown was innocent because of the absence of the perfume others declared she must be guilty on account of her false name and false story and the fact that moon was found dead a quarter of an hour after she left the house no doubt the circumstantial evidence was very strong but it could not be said positively that the woman was guilty even though she did not appear to defend her character so the jury thought for they brought in the only possible verdict twelve good and lawful men could bring in wilful murder against some person or persons unknown and there the matter ended for sheer want of further evidence the affair was a mystery and a mystery it remained and will until the day of judgment said tenson finally chapter iii duty before pleasure the year ended sadly for lillian since she had lost her father her lover and her home gaining instead the doubtful companionship of a paternal uncle who stepped into the position of guardian the girl although she did not know it at the time was leaving a pleasant flowery lane to turn into a flinty high road arched by a dismal sky it is true that she still possessed mrs bolstreath to comfort her but the loss of dan could scarcely be compensated by the attentions of the chaperon not that halliday was altogether lost but he had been pushed out of her life by sir john moon who approved as little of this suitor as the late baronet had done you see my dear child he exclaimed to lillian immediately after the new year and when things were more restful as your guardian and uncle i have to see that you make a good match what is marriage without love queried miss moon scornfully love sir john shrugged his elegant shoulders and sneered love is all very well but a title is better i say nothing about money as you have any amount of that useful article now lord curberry i detest lord curberry and i shant marry lord curberry interrupted lillian frowning and her mind held a picture of the lean ascetic peer with the cruel grey eyes as a barrister curberry was no doubt admirable as a nobleman he filled his new position very well but she could not see him as a lover try as she might not that she did try for under no conditions and under no pressure did she intend to become his wife your father wished you to marry lord curberry hinted uncle john softly my father wished me to be happy cried lillian hotly and i cant be happy unless i marry dan that aviator man pooh he has nothing to give you he gives himself and that is all i want i see love in a cottage and lillian interrupted again theres no need for love in a cottage i have plenty of money you said as much yourself uncle john my dear said the new baronet gravely from what i saw of young halliday he is too proud a man to live on his wife and you would not respect him if he did i think better of you than that my child dan has his profession hm and a dangerous one at that besides he doesnt make much money he will though dan is a genius he has all kinds of ideas about flying machines and some day he will conquer the air meantime you will be growing old waiting for him not at all lillian assured him i shall be with him helping all i can you wont with my consent cried her uncle heatedly then i shall do without your consent i shant give up dan in that case sighed sir john rising to show that the interview was endedand certainly it had ended in a clash of willsthere is nothing for me to do but to make young halliday give you up hell never do that said miss moon pausing at the door with a fluttering heart for her uncle spoke very decidedly oh i think so replied moon with the air of a man sure of his ground he has i am sure some notion of honor it isnt honorable to give up a woman it isnt honorable to live on a woman the two antagonists glared at one another and a silence ensued neither would give way and neither would compromise in any way lillian wanted dan as her husband a post sir john did not intend the young man to fill but he saw plainly enough that harsh measures would drive lillian to desperation and he did not yet know sufficient of halliday to be sure that he would not grasp at a rich wife sir john believed that men were like himself and would do anythinghonorable or at a pinch dishonorableto secure a life of ease and comfort however as he swiftly reflected halliday was young and probably would be wax in the hands of a clever man such as moon considered himself to be it would be best to see him and control the boys mind by appealing to his decencyso sir john put it very good my dear he said when he reached this point matters are at a deadlock between us i suggest that you let me interview halliday i dont mind so long as i see him first pouted the girl mutinously sir john smiled drily so as to arm him for the fray very well i consent my dear you can arrange your campaign and then i can discuss the matter with this very undesirable suitor but you must give me your promise that you will not run away with him meanwhile lillian held herself very erect and replied stiffly of course i promise uncle john i am not ashamed of loving dan and i shall marry him in a proper manner but i shant marry lord curberry she ended and fairly ran away so as to prevent further objections oh my dear i think you will grinned sir john at the closed door and he sat down to pen a diplomatic letter to mr halliday as he wished to have the matter settled and done with these romantic young nuisances said the schemer crossly the new baronet was a slim wellpreserved dandy of sixty who looked no older than fortyfive owing to the means he took to keep himself fit he was the younger and only brother of moon and inherited the title since there was no nephew to take it he also inherited ten thousand a year for life on condition that he acted as lillians guardian it was no mean task for the girl had an income of coming in every twelve months there would be plenty of hardup flies gathering round this honeypot and sir john foresaw that it would not be an easy business to settle the young ladys matrimonial future especially as the said young lady was obstinate beyond belief sir john being a loafer by nature had never possessed sufficient money to indulge to the full in his luxurious tastes since his brother had not financed him as largely as he could have wished but now that he was safe for the rest of his life on an income which would enable him to enjoy the worlds goods sir john did not wish to be bothered it was his aim to get his niece married and settled as soon as possible so that she would be looked after by a husband under these circumstances and since lillian was anxious to marry dan it was strange that the baronet did not allow her to indulge her fancy he did not for two reasons one was that he really did not think halliday a good match and moreover knew of his late brothers opinion on the matter of the wooing the second reason had to do with the fact that he had borrowed a large sum of money from lord curberry and did not wish to pay it back again even though he could do so easily enough in his present flourishing circumstances curberry offered to forego the payment if sir john could persuade lillian to marry him and as moon wanted to be able to talk about the girl as a peeress and did not want to reduce his new income by frittering it away in paying back debts he was determined to bring about the very desirable marriage as he truly considered it to be curberry is sure to go in for politics thought the plotter and he has enough brains to become prime minister if he likes hes got a decent income too and a very old title with lillians money and beauty she should have a titled husband besides this was an afterthought curberry can make himself deuced disagreeable if he likes and perhaps it was this last idea which made sir john so anxious for the marriage to take place the late sir charles had been a big burly broadshouldered man with a powerful cleanshaven facethe kind of overbearing pushing personality which was bound to come up on top wherever men were congregated and sir charles had massively pushed his way from poverty to affluence from obscurity into notoriety if not fame now his honors and wealth were in the hands of two people infinitely weaker than he had been lillian was but a delicate girl solely bent upon marriage with an undesirable suitor while sir john had no desire to do anything with his new income and new title save to enjoy the goods which the gods had sent him so unexpectedly he was by no means a strong man being finical selfindulgent and quite feminine in his love for dress and luxury much smaller and slighter than his masterful brother he was perfectly arrayed on all occasions in purple and fine linen very selfpossessed very polite and invariably quiet in his manner he had several small talents and indulged in painting poetry and music producing specimens of each as weak and neatly finished as himself he also collected china and stamps old lace and jewels which he loved for their color and glitter such a man was too fantastical to earn the respect of lillian who adored the strength which showed itself in dan consequently she felt certain that she would be able to force him to consent to her desires but in this the girl inexperienced in worldly matters and in human nature reckoned without knowledge of sir johns obstinacy which was a singularly striking trait of the mans character like most weak people the new baronet loved to domineer and moreover when his ease was at stake he could be strong even to cruelty since fear begets that quality as much as it fosters cowardice moon had removed lillian and mrs bolstreath to his new house in mayfair because it was not wise that the girl should remain at hampstead where everything served to remind her of the good father she had lost therefore sir john wished for no trouble to take place under his roof as suchas he put itwould shatter his nerves the mere fact that lillian wished to marry young halliday and that curberry wished to marry her was a fruitful source of ills it stands to sir johns credit that he did not take the easiest method of getting rid of his niece by allowing her to become mrs halliday he had a conscience of some sort and wished to carry out his late brothers desire that lillian should become a peeress so far as the girls inclinations were concerned he cared little since he looked upon her as a child who required guidance and to guide her in the proper directionthat is towards the altar in curberrys companysir john put himself to considerable inconvenience and acted honestly with the very best intentions his egotismthe powerful egotism of a weak manprevented him from seeing that lillian was also a human being and had her right to freedom of choice it must be said that for a dilettante sir john acted with surprising promptitude he took the two women to his own house and let the mansion at hampstead to an australian millionaire who paid an excellent rent then he saw the lawyers and went into details concerning the property luckily sir charles had gradually withdrawn from business a few years before his death since he had more or less concentrated his mind on politics therefore the income was mostly well invested and with the exception of the line of steamers with which mrs browns son had been concerned there were few interests which required personal supervision sir john having power under the will sold the dead mans interest in the ships withdrew from several other speculations and having seen that the securities which meant fifty thousand a year to lillian and ten thousand a year to himself were all in good order he settled down to enjoy himself the lawyerson whom he kept an eyereceived the money and banked it and consulted with sir john regarding reinvestments they also by the new baronets direction offered a reward of for the discovery of the murderess so shortly after the new year everything was more or less settled and sir john found himself able to attend once more to his lace and jewels his music and poetry only lillians marriage remained to be arranged and after his conversation with the girl sir john appointed a day for dan to call that young gentleman who had been hovering round lost no time in obeying the summons which was worded amiably enough and presented himself in due time sir john received halliday with great affability offered him a chair and a cigarette and came to the point at once its about lillian i wish to see you mr halliday he remarked placing the tips of his fingers delicately together you can go up to the drawingroom afterwards and have tea with her and with mrs bolstreath but we must have a chat first to adjust the situation what situation asked dan wilfully dense oh i think you understand rejoined sir john drily well i love her was all that dan could find to say naturally lillian is a charming girl and you are a young man of discernment at least i hope so as i wish you to give lillian up dan rose and pitched his cigarette into the fire never he cried looking pale and determined and singularly virile and handsome how can you ask such a thing mr mooni mean sir john my new title doesnt come easily i see said the baronet smoothly oh i quite understand my poor brother died so unexpectedly that none of us have got used to the new order of things you least of all mr halliday why not dan asked that young gentleman leaning against the mantelpiece since he felt that he could talk better standing than sitting because as i say there is a new order of things i have known you all your life my dear boy as your parents placed you in my late brothers charge when you were only five years of age but i say mr halliday instead of dan as i wish you to understand that we are talking as business men and not as old friends you take away your friendship not at all mr halliday we shall be better friends than ever when we have had our talk and you have done the right thing probably i shall then call you dan as of yore you can call me what you please said dan obstinately and rather angrily for the fiddling methods of sir john annoyed him but i wont give up the dearest girl in the world her father wished her to marry lord curberry if her father had lived bless him retorted halliday vehemently he would have seen that lillian loves me and not curberry in which case he would not have withheld his consent oh i think he would said sir john amiably lillian is rich and my poor brother wished to obtain a title for her very natural mr halliday as you must see for yourself charles always aimed at high things he loved lillian and would not have seen her unhappy said dan bluffly i dont see that curberry would make her unhappy he is devoted to her but she does not love him argued halliday crossly and how can there be happiness when love is lacking come sir john you have as you said just now known me all my life i am honorable and cleanliving and wellborn while lillian loves me what objection have you to the match the same objection as my brother had mr halliday lillian is wealthy and you are poor i have only a few hundreds a year it is true but no buts if you please sir john flung up a delicate hand in protest you cant argue away facts if you marry lillian you will live on her dan bit his lip and clenched his hands to prevent his temper from showing itself too strongly if another man had said that to me sir john i should have knocked him down brute force is no argument rejoined moon unruffled consider mr halliday you have a few hundreds a year and lillian has fifty thousand coming in every twelve months being wealthy she can scarcely live on your income so to keep up the position to which she has been born she must live on her own husband and wife are one as we are assured by the church therefore if she lives on the fifty thousand per annum you must live on it also i wouldnt take a single penny cried dan hotly and boyishly oh i am not suggesting that you would said sir john easily but lillian cannot live in the cottage your few hundreds would run to and if she lives as she must being rich in a large house you must live there also and in a style which your income does not warrant you know what people will say under the circumstances either you must take lillian to live on your small income which is not fair to her or you must live on her large one which is not fair to you i speak to a man of honor remember these arguments are sophistical not at all you cant escape from facts then is this miserable money to stand between us asked dan in despair for he could not deny that there was great truth in what sir john said the baronet shrugged his shoulders it seems likely unless you can make a fortune equal to lillians why not aviation is yet in its infancy quite so and thus accidents are continually happening if you marry my niece it is probable that you will shortly leave her a widow no no in whatever way you look at the matter mr halliday the match is most undesirable be a mana man of honorand give lillian up to be miserable with lord curberry said dan fiercely never and he meant what he said as sir john saw very plainly this being the case the baronet used another argument to obtain what he wanted i have been young myself and i know how you feel he said quietly very good i suggest a compromise what is it muttered dan dropping into his chair again and looking very miserable as was natural seeing what he stood to lose my poor brother went on sir john smoothly and crossing his legs has been struck down when most enjoying life the person who murdered himpresumably the woman who called herself mrs brownhas not yet been discovered in spite of the efforts of the police backed by a substantial reward i propose mr halliday that you search for this person the period of searching be limited to one year if you find her and she is punished then you shall marry lillian if you fail then you must stand aside and allow her to marry lord curberry you forget said dan not jumping at the chance as sir john expected if i do bring the woman to justice your arguments regarding my living on lillian remain in full force oh as to that mr halliday when the time comes i can find arguments equally strong on the other side to use one now if you revenge my brothers death no one will deny but what you have every right to marry his daughter and enjoy her income that would be only fair well well echoed dan dully and reflected with his sad eyes on the carpet then he looked up anxiously meanwhile lillian may marry lord curberry oh said sir john coolly if you cant trust her he can trust her cried the voice of the girl herself and the curtain of the folding doors was drawn quickly aside lillian cried dan springing to his feet and opening his arms sir john saw his niece rush into those same arms and laughed hm said he whimsically i quite forgot that the foldingdoors into the next room were open you have been listening lillian twisted herself in dans arms but did not leave them as she felt safe within that warm embrace of course i have been listening she cried scornfully as soon as i knew dan was in the house and in the library i listened i told bolly that i was coming down to listen and though she tried to prevent me i came who has a better right to listen when all the conversation was about me and remember i should have seen him first well said her uncle unmoved its no use arguing with you a mans idea of honor and a womans are quite opposed to one another you heard what have you to say i think youre horrid snapped lillian in a schoolgirl manner as if my money mattered i am quite willing to give it to you and marry dan on what he has its better to love in a garret than to hate in a drawingroom quite epigrammatic murmured sir john cynically well my dear i am much obliged to you for your fifty thousand a year offer but i fancy what i have is enough for me i never did care for millions and always wondered why my late brother should wear himself out in obtaining them i decline whether you decline or not i marry dan said lillian hotly what does dan say the young man disengaged himself he had kept silent during the passage of arms between uncle and niece i say that i can trust lillian to remain true to me for twelve months for ever for ever for ever cried the girl her face flaming and her eyes flashing but dont make any promise of letting our marriage depend upon finding the woman who murdered my poor father ah said sir john contemptuously you never loved your father i see how dare you say that flashed out the girl panting with anger my dear ask yourself replied moon patiently your father has been basely murdered yet you do not wish to avenge his death and prefer your own happiness to the fulfilment of a solemn duty of course added sir john with a shrug for he now knew what line of argument to take you cant trust yourself to be faithful for twelve months and i can trust myself to be faithful and for twelve centuries if necessary no no no smiled moon shaking his head you prefer pleasure to duty i see you love yourself more than you loved your father well he rose and waved his hands with a gesture of dismissal go your ways my dear and marry danyou observe i call you dan mr halliday since you are to become my nephew straight away when is the wedding to be you consent cried lillian opening her eyes widely i cant stop you said moon still continuing his crafty diplomacy you will soon be of age and you can buy your husband at once since you dare not risk a probation of twelve months i can risk twelve years retorted lillian uneasily for in a flash she understood how selfishly she was behaving seeing that her fathers assassin was still at large and to prove it she looked at dan he understood and spoke although he had already made up his mind as to the best course to pursue to prove it he said steadily we accept your proposal sir john lillian will wait twelve months and during that time i shall search for the woman who murdered sir charles if i dont find her lillian marries lord curberry said moon quickly no cried the girl defiantly that part of the agreement i decline to assent to twelve months or twelve years it may take before the truth comes to light but i marry no one but dan sir john reflected on the dangers of aviation and swiftly came to a conclusion well see at the end of the year he said cautiously much may happen in that time so long as lillians wedding to curberry doesnt happen said dan obstinately i dont care but it is understood that lillian is not to be worried about the matter that depends upon what you and lillian call worry said moon drily so far as i am concerned i shall not coerce her in any way all i wish is the promise of you both that you will wait twelve months before taking any steps to marry meantime you must not see too much of lillian oh cried the girl indignantly you would push dan out of my life its a test explained sir john blinking nervously you will be in mourning for the next twelve months and should see few people of whom dan will be one she flashed out occasionallyvery occasionally you can see him but of course if you cant trust yourself to be true without being continually reminded that mr halliday exists there is no more to be said i can trust myself muttered the girl uneasily and i can trust lillian said dan promptly and decisively it does not look like it since you always wish to see one another and remember lillian you owe it to your fathers memory to put all thoughts of love which is self out of your heart until the mystery of his death is entirely solved there is something in that said halliday thoughtfully and lillian nodded but of course i can write to lillian occasionally said the baronet again you must both be tested by a years separation with a meeting or a letter every now and then duty must be the keynote of the twelve months and not pleasure well the lovers looked at one another and sighed the terms were hard but not so hard as sir john might have made them still both the boy and the girlthey were little elserecognized that their duty was to the dead afterwards pleasure would be theirs silently they accepted and silently adjusted the situation we agree said the two almost simultaneously very good said moon rubbing his hands how do you intend to begin your search for the missing woman mr halliday i dont know murmured dan miserably neither do i rejoined sir john with great amiability come to tea and to tea the lovers went as to a funeral feast but sir john rejoiced chapter iv an amateur detective dan left the mayfair house very mournfully feeling that sir john was indeed master of the situation by a skilful appeal to the generous emotions of youth to the boys honor and to the girls affections he had procured a respite of twelve months during which time the lovers could do nothing bound as they were by silken threads this would give curberry time to push his suit and there was always a chance that dan would come to grief in one of his aerial trips in which case lillian would certainly be driven to marry her titled swain halliday knew nothing of moons reckoning on these points or he would have only accepted the situation on condition that curberry was not to meet the girl or write to the girl oftener than himself logically speaking the peer and the commoner should have been placed on the same footing but dans grief at the parting confused his understanding and he had not been clever enough to seize his opportunity therefore sir john winning all along the line had cleared the path for curberry and had more or less blocked it for dan but as yet the young man did not grasp the full extent of sir johns worldly wisdom what halliday had to doand this dominated his mind immediately he left the housewas to solve the mystery of sir charless death the sooner he captured the false mrs brown who presumably had murdered the old man the sooner would he lead lillian to the altar therefore he was feverishly anxious to begin but for the life of him he did not see how to make a start he had absolutely no experience of what constituted the business of a detective and was daunted at the outset by the difficulties of the path all the same he never thought of halting but pressed forward without a pause and the first step he took was to consult a friend on the obvious assumption that two heads are better than one it was freddy laurance whom he decided to interview since that very uptodate young journalist knew every one of any note and almost everything of interest being indeed aware of much of which the ordinary man in the street was ignorant he and dan had been to oxford together and for many years had been the best of friends laurance had been brought up in the expectation of being a rich man but overspeculation ruined his father and on leaving the university he was thrown unprepared on the world to make his money as best he could without any sort of training in particular hearty praise from an expert for three or four newspaper articles suggested journalism and having an observant eye and a ready pen the young man was successful from the beginning for a time he was a freelance writing indiscriminately for this journal and for that until the proprietor of the moment a halfpenny daily secured his exclusive services at a salary which procured freddy the luxuries of life this was something to have achieved at the age of five and twenty the moment was a bright shootfollyasitflies sort of journal which detailed the news of the day in epigrammatic scraps its longest articles did not exceed a quarter of a column and important events were usually restricted to paragraphs it indeed skimmed the cream of events and ten minutes study of its sheets gave a busy man all the information he required concerning the doings of humanity also it daily published an extra sheet concerned entirely with letters from the public to the public and many of these were prolix as the paragraph rule did not apply to this portion of the journal people wrote herein on this that and the other thing ventilating their ideas and suggesting schemes and as many wrote many bought so that friends and relatives might read their letters therefore vanity gave the moment quite a large circulation independent of its orthodox issue the proprietor made money in two ways by supplying gossip for curious people and by giving vain persons the chance of seeing themselves in print seeing what human nature is it is scarcely to be wondered at that the moment was a great success and sold largely in town and country freddys post was that of a roving correspondent whenever any event of interest took place in any of the four quarters of the globe laurance went to take notes on the spot and his information was boiled down into concise illuminative paragraphs indeed the older journalists said that it was hardly worth while for him to make such long journeys for the sake of condensedmilk news but as freddys details were always amusing as well as abrupt the editor and the public and the proprietor were all satisfied a man who can flash a vivid picture into the dullest mind in few words is well worth money therefore was laurance greatly appreciated dan walked to a grimy lane leading from fleet street with some doubt in his puzzled mind as to whether freddy would be in his office at a moments notice the man would dart off to the ends of the earth and was more or less on the move throughout the three hundred and sixtyfive days of the year but of late sensational events had concentrated themselves in england so dan hoped that his friend would be on the spot an inquiry from the gorgeous individual who guarded the entrance to the red brick building wherein the moment was printed and published and composed revealed that mr laurance was not only in london but in his office at the very second so dan sent up his name and rejoiced at the catching of this carrierpigeon and it was a good omen also that freddy saw him straight away since he generally refused himself to every one on the plea of business but i couldnt resist seeing you dan remarked mr laurance when he had shaken hands before supplying his visitor with a cigarette and a chair i was coming to see you if the mountain hadnt come to mahommed dan lighted up and through the smoke of tobacco stared inquisitively at his friend wondering what this introductory remark meant laurance was rather like dan in personal appearance being tall and slim and cleanshaven with greek features and an aristocratic look but he was decidedly fair as halliday was decidedly dark and his eyes were less like those of an eagle than the eyes of the aviator but then laurance was not accustomed to the boundless spaces of the air although he had twice ascended in an airship therefore the new expression of the new race was wanting nevertheless he looked a capable alert young man able to get the full value out of every minute he was an admirable type of the restless presentday seeker well mahommed said dan leisurely heres the mountain what have you to say to it that murder of sir charles moon halliday quivered with surprise it was so amazing that laurance should hit upon the very subject which employed his own thoughts yes he inquired you are engaged to miss moon you were in the house when the crime was committed you saw the body you stop stop i was not in the house when the crime was committed i returned there from the theatre some time laterin fact about midnight i certainly did see the body as to being engaged to miss moonhm i came to see about that freddy the deuce you did great minds jump what laurance puffed a blue cloud sat down astride a chair and leaned his arms on the back strange that you and i should be on the hunt well it is on the hunt echoed laurance staring what do you mean i should rather ask that question of you said dan drily sir charles is dead and buried these many weeks and the woman who assassinated him cant be found in spite of the reward and the effort of the police why at this late hour do you wish to rake up stale news i thought that the moment was more uptodate it will be very much uptodate when the next murder is committed observed laurance grimly and significantly the legs of dans chair grated as he pushed back in sheer surprise what do you mean by the next murder he demanded sharply well this gang gang gang who says there is a gang and dans thoughts flew back to durwins reason for visiting sir charles humph growled laurance thrusting his hands into his pockets im disappointed i thought you knew more i know a good deal retorted the other quickly but i dont intend to talk to you about what i know until i learn your game what about your own that comes later also said halliday promptly go on i want to know why you rake up moons murder naturally you do seeing you are engaged to the daughter am i i am not quite sure she loves me and i love her but the new baronet wants her to marry lord curberry she refused and i kicked up a row some hours back result we are on probation for one year during which time i am to discover the assassin of sir charles and if you dont time enough to talk about that when i fail said halliday coolly at least i have twelve months to hunt round i came for your help but it seems that you want mine why freddy through sheer absence of mind flung away a halfsmoked cigarette and lighted another then he rose and strolled across the room to lean his shoulders against the mantelpiece we can help one another i think was his final observation i hope so in any case i intend to marry lillian all the same to pacify sir john i am willing to become a detective you know my game yours listen said laurance vivaciously i forgot all about the murder since there seemed to be no chance of the truth coming to the light and so did every one else for the same reason but a few nights ago i was dining out and met a chap called durwin scotland yard man interrupted dan nodding several times he came to see sir charles on business and found the corpse just so well after dinner we had a chat and he told me that he was anxious to learn who killed moon because he didnt want any more murders of the kind to happenas a police official you understand strange he should be confidential on that point murmured halliday thoughtfully seeing that he wished his theory regarding a possible gang kept quiet in the hope of making discoveries he has changed his mind about secrecy and so has tenson said freddy oh dan raised his eyebrows the inspector you have seen him also laurance nodded after i saw durwin and learned what he had to say i saw tenson and interviewed him they told me about the fly on the neck and remembering the case of the purple fern and having regard to the fact that the fly in question was artificial both men are inclined to believe in the existence of a gang whose trademark the said fly is dan nodded again quite so and then durwin came to see moon and hear about the gang he found him dead so you said so durwin said rejoined laurance quietly it seems very certain putting this and that together that sir charles became dangerous to this gang whatever it is and wherever it exists so was put to death by the false mrs brown who came expressly to kill him so far i am with you on all fours said halliday well well both durwin and tenson dreading lest the gang may commit another crime wish me to make the matter as public as i can so as to frighten the beasts hm said dan looking at his neat brown boots they have changed their minds it seems their first idea was to keep the matter quiet so as to catch these devils redhanded however publicity may be a good thing how do you intend to begin i have got facts from tenson and from durwin said freddy promptly and now since you saw the body and found the fly i want to get the facts from you on what i acquire i shall write a letter in that extra sheet of ours and you can be pretty certain from what you know of human nature that any amount of people will reply to my letter they may reply to no purpose im not so sure of that dan if i mention the fly as a trademark and recall the strange case of the purple fern some one may write about matters known to themselves from positive knowledge if this gang exists it has committed more murders than one but the fly being a small insect may not have been noticed as a trademark in the other crimes i wonder you spotted it anyhow it was easily seen being on the back of the neck near the wound besides flies in novemberthe month of the murderare rare finally tenson discovered the fly to be artificial which shows that it was purposely placed on the dead mans neck near the wound hm he reflected perhaps someone may know of some crime with the fly trademark and in that case we can be certain that such a gang does exist so i think cried laurance quickly and for that reason i intend to start a discussion by writing an open letter publicity may frighten the beasts into dropping their trade on the other hand it may goad the gang into asserting itself in either case the subject will be ventilated and we may learn more or less of the truth yes i think its a good idea freddy and the perfume did durwin or the inspector tell you anything about the perfume no i can see by your blank stare that they didnt listen freddy and store this knowledge in your blessed brain my son it is a clue i am sure and halliday forthwith related to his attentive listener details concerning the strange perfume which had impregnated the clothes of the dead man and sir charles hated perfumes he ended emphatically he didnt even like lillian or mrs bolstreath to use them and they obeyed him curious mused the journalist and idly scribbling on his blottingpaper he was back at his desk by this time what sort of scent is it my dear chap you ask me to describe the impossible retorted dan with uplifted eyebrows how the deuce can i get the kind of smell into your head it must be smelt to be understood all i can say is that the perfume was rich and heavy suggestive of drowsiness indeed i used that word and tenson thought of some kind of chloroform used perhaps to stupefy the victim before killing him but there was an odor about the mouth or nose on the handkerchief perhaps suggested the reporter no tenson smelt the handkerchief well if this mrs brown used this perfume you and miss moon and mrs bolstreath must have smelt it on her in the hall i understand from durwin that you all three saw the woman yes and lillian poor girl persuaded her father to see the wretch but we did not smell the perfume on the woman tenson or durwini forget whichasked us the question humph said laurance after a pause it may be a kind of trademark like the fly business he took a note i shall use this evidence in my letter to the public i suppose dan you would recognize the scent again oh yes i have a keen sense of smell you know but i dont expect i shall ever drop across this particular fragrance freddy theres always monsieur chance you know remarked laurance tapping his white teeth with a pencil perhaps the gang use this scent so as to identify one anotherin the dark it may belike cats how does that strike you as purely theoretical said dan with a shrug and reached for another cigarette its a case of perhaps and perhaps not laurance assented but everything so far is theoretical in this case he argued you have told me all you know every bit even to my year of probation do you know curberry yes he was a slapup barrister a pity he got title and money as he has left the bar and is a good man spoiled lucky chap all the same as his uncle and cousin both died unexpectedly to give him his chance of the house of lords how did they die motor accident car went over a cliff only the chauffeur was saved and he broke both legs do you know the present lord curberry i have seen him and think hes a driedup cruellooking beast said dan with considerable frankness id rather see lillian dead than his wife hear hear applauded laurance smiling the girls too delightful to be wasted on curberry you have my blessing on the match dan thanks said halliday ruefully but i have to bring it off first sir johns infernally clever and managed to get both lillian and me to consent to let matters stand over for a year during which time i guess hell push curberrys suit but i can trust lillian to be true to me bless her and mrs bolstreath is quite on our side after all murmured the young man disconsolately its only fair that sir charles should be avenged perhaps it would be selfish for lillian and me to marry and live happy ever afterwards without making some attempt to square things the question is how to start im hanged if i know and so i came to you well said laurance thoughtfully theres a hope of monsieur chance you know in many ways you may stumble on clues even without looking for them since this gangif it existsmust carry on an extensive business all you can do dan is to keep your eyes and ears and nose openthe last for that scent you know on my part i shall write the letter and publish it in the annex of the moment then we shall see what will happen yes i think thats about the best way to begin stir up the muddy water and we may find what is at the bottom of the pond but theres one thing to be considered and that is money if im going to hunt for these scoundrels i need cash and to own up freddy i havent very much youre so beastly extravagant said laurance grinning and your private income goes nowhere huh whats five hundred a year ten pounds a week more or less however theres your aviation i hear that you take people flights for money dan nodded its the latest fashionable folly which is a good thing for me old son i get pretty well paid and it means fun with some risk of death said laurance drily well yes but that is a peculiarity of presentday fun people love to play with deathit thrills them however if i am to hunt for the assassin of sir charles i cant give much attention to aviation and i repeat that i want money oceans of it would two thousand pounds suit you rather only im not going to borrow from you old man thank you i havent that amount to lend said freddy drily but you must have seen if you read our very interesting paper that our proprietor has offered a prize of two thousand pounds for a successful flight from london to york a kind of uptodate dick turpin i suppose laughed dan rising and stretching his long limbs good ill have a shot i may win you will if you use a vincent machine vincent vincent where have i heard that name everywhere if you know anything of the aviation world snapped laurance rather crossly for at times dans indolence in acquiring necessary information annoyed him solomon vincent who has been inventing airships and newfangled aeroplanes for ever so long yes yes i remember now hes a genius every one knows him every one knows of him except yourself but no one knows him personally he lives a secluded life up in hillshire on the borders of the moors where he can find wide space for his experiments in aerial craft i interviewed him a year ago andand laurance blushed red hullo whats this asked dan shrewdly can it be that the inventor has a daughter fair a niece retorted laurance recovering why shouldnt i be in love as well as you halliday however that doesnt matter it matters a great deal to you never mind what you have to do is to secure one of vincents machines and try for this race if you win the prize you will have heaps of money to search for the gang but why doesnt miss moon i dont take lillians money said dan curtly and blushed in his turn it is a good idea freddy how can i get hold of the machine i shall take you up to hillshire next week and you can see vincent for yourself he can talk to you and and you can talk to the niece whats her name oh shut up and get out said laurance turning away youre interrupting my work going to write a letter to the beloved said dan leisurely making for the door all right old son ill go you know my address so write me when you want me id like to see vincents machines as i hear he has made several good improvements and everything tells in a race salaam keep your eyes open laurance called after him remember monsieur chance may prove to be our best friend dan departed shrugging his shoulders i dont believe in heavensent miracles were his last words but they were wasted on freddy for that alert young man was already buried in his work it was painful to witness such industry in hallidays opinion in an inquiring frame of mind the amateur detective strolled along fleet street thinking of lillian instead of keeping his wits about him as freddy had requested it seemed impossible that he should strike on a clue without deliberately searching for it which he did not feel inclined to do at the moment monsieur chance indeed he was a mythical personage in whom this sceptical young man did not believe besides love dominated his thoughts to the exclusion of minor matters and he dreamed about his darling all along the strand thus he did not look where he was going and stumbled into the midst of a charing cross crowd where a motor had broken down after colliding with a bus a policeman was conversing with the chauffeur and the bus driver who were conversing abusively with one another the crowd blocked the street and stopped the traffic in order to enjoy the conversation which left nothing to be desired in the way of free language dan halted idly as a spectator not because he wished to be one but for the very simple reason that he could not get through the crowd into trafalgar square thrust up against one man and wedged in by two others and surrounded by hundreds he grumbled at the delay and peered over shoulders to see when the incident would end as he did so he suddenly in his minds eye saw a vision of sir charles lying dead in the welllighted library while wondering why he thought of the crime at this particular moment he became aware that a familiar scent assailed his nostrils the scent about which he had talked to durwin and tenson and laurance nosing like a hound he tried to find the person from whom it emanated and almost immediately later the man turned and dan found himself face to face with marcus penn chapter v muddy water the secretary of the late sir charles moon smiled irresolutely when he recognized dan that young gentleman who thought penn a weakkneed idiot had never taken much notice of him but for the fact that he was perfumed with the unusual scent would not have spoken to him now but as he looked at the lank creature with his yellow face and scanty moustache he guessed that he was exactly the effeminate sort of person who would use perfume what he wished to know was why he affected this particular kind of fragrance and whence he obtained it to gain the information he pretended a friendliness for the man he was far from feeling dan strong virile and selfconfident was not altogether just to penn who was not responsible for his pallid looks and weak character but halliday was not a perfect individual by any means and had yet to learn that the weak are meant to be protected and helped instead of being despised you here mr penn said dan thus formal to mark the difference between them yes replied the man in his faint hesitating voice and as they moved out of the crowd halliday smelt the weird perfume more strongly than ever shaken from penns clothes by his movements i stopped to look at the accident a very ordinary one rejoined mr halliday with a shrug by the way i have not seen you since the funeral of sir charles what are you doing now if i may ask i am secretary to lord curberry oh the reply gave dan something of a shock for he did not expect at the moment to hear his rivals name but then the whole incident of meeting penn and smelling the incriminating perfume was strange monsieur chance had proved himself to be an actuality instead of the mythical personage dan had believed him to be it was certainly odd that the meeting had taken place and odder still that penn should prove to be the servant of curberry as halliday said nothing more than oh the other man stroked his moustache and explained sir john got me the post mr halliday he said with his shifty eyes anywhere but on dans inquiring face i was quite stranded after sir charless unexpected death and did not know where to turn for employment as i support a widowed mother the situation was rather serious so i took my courage in my hands and went to sir john he was good enough to recommend me to lord curberry and i have been with his lordship for a month more or less i congratulate you mr penn and lord curberry also sir charles always said you were an excellent secretary dan stopped as penn bowed his acknowledgments to the compliment and cast a keen side glance at the man they were walking through trafalgar square by this time passing under the shadow of nelsons column do you know what i was thinking of when behind you in the crowd yonder mr penn he asked abruptly and it must be confessed rather undiplomatically if he wished to get at the truth no said the secretary with simplicity and manifest surprise no mr halliday how can i guess your thoughts i was thinking of the murder of your late employer said dan straightly penn blinked and shivered its a horrible subject to think about he remarked in a low voice i can scarcely get it out of my own thoughts i suppose the sight of me reminded you of the crime mr halliday scarcely since i was behind you and did not recognize you until you turned replied dan calmly and the other appeared to be surprised then how he began only to be cut short its that scent scent echoed penn nervously but manifestly still surprised i dont understand exactly what you mean mr halliday i like scent and use much of it dans lip curled so i perceive but where did you get the particular scent you are using now may i ask something in his tone annoyed the secretary for he drew himself up and halted i dont know why you should criticize my tastes mr halliday im not criticizing them and dont jump down my throat but you reek of some strange perfume which i last smelt he paused you cannot have smelt it anywhere said penn indifferently what do you mean by that exactly asked dan with considerable sharpness penn resumed his walk and drew his light eyebrows together i am willing to explain as soon as you tell me why you speak of the scent hang it man rejoined halliday dropping into step any one would notice the scent and speak of it since it is so strong ohpenns brow clearedi understand now you have taken a fancy to the scent and wish me to get you some halliday was about to make an indignant denial when he suddenly changed his mind seeing a chance of learning something well can you get me some no said penn coolly i cannot this is a particular perfume which comes from the island of sumatra i have a cousin there who knows that i like perfumes and he sent me a single bottle cant i buy it anywhere no it is not to be obtained in england said penn curtly in that case said halliday slowly it is strange that i should have smelt the same perfume on the clothes of sir charles after his death did you penn looked surprised that is impossible why sir charles detested scents and i never dared to use this one until i left him for the night you used it on the night of the murder of course i used it every night when i left sir charles on that evening he sent me away with my usual batch of letters and was going down to the house later i would not have seen him until the next morning so i took the opportunity to indulge in this taste then how did sir charless clothes become impregnated with it i am unable to say why do you ask surelypenn turned an alarmed face towards the speaker and looked yellower than eversurely you do not suspect me of keeping back anything from the police likely to lead to the detection of the assassin ask yourself mr penn said dan coldly i and inspector tenson and mr durwin smelt this particular perfume on the clothes of the dead man and i do not mind telling you that the police consider it something of a clue a clue to what to me it must be since i alone possess this scent i certainly came into the library when summoned by mr durwin and i helped to look after sir charles as i was strongly perfumed with the scent it is not impossible that my employers clothes took what doubtless you will call the taint i think ended penn in a dignified manner that such is the proper explanation you have found a mares nest mr halliday upon my word i believe i have said dan quite goodhumoredly but you must forgive me mr penn inspector tenson agreed with me that the fly and the scent were clues about the fly i know nothing said the secretary positively but this scent is not to be had in england and sir charless clothes could only have gathered the fragrance from mine if inspector tenson suspects me no no no interrupted halliday quickly i assure you that he does not he would if you told him of our meeting retorted penn as they passed into piccadilly circus and as i dont like even a suspicion to rest on me mr hallidayfor my good name is my fortunei shall go and see him and explain the whole circumstance indeed if he wishes it i shall give him the bottle which my cousin sent me from sumatra and never shall i use the scent again i do not like these injurious suspicions dont make a mountain out of a molehill said dan drily if i have hurt your feelings i apologize i accept your apology only on condition that you accept my explanation dan inwardly chuckled at penns dignity but replied readily enough oh yes for if i did not accept your explanation i should not make any apology you are probably right since the scent must have got on to sir charless clothes from your own the clueas we took it to behas ended in smoke but dont you think that i should see inspector tenson and explain there is no need dan assured him soothingly if the inspector says anything about the scent i shall explain and after all it was i who suggested the perfume as a clue would you like what is left of the bottle asked penn pacified by the very frank apology of the other no thanks i never use perfumes i hate them so did sir charles mused penn and eyeing dan with a lacklustre gaze i wonder he did not suspect me of liking them if he had come upon me scented in this manner he would have kicked me out it is to be hoped lord curberry has not the same dislike said dan who having learned all he wished desired to escape from such boring society no he has not said penn with great simplicity he is very kind to me i suppose he will marry miss moon then you suppose wrong he will not snapped halliday roughly he loves her devotedly insisted the secretary and with a glint of malice in his palecolored eyes goodday rejoined dan shortly as he did not wish to argue the matter he turned into regent streetfor by this time they had crossed the circuswhen penn ran after him and seized his arm is there any chance of the woman who killed sir charles being found no replied dan halting for a moment why because sir charles was good to me and i should like his death to be avenged that is only natural surely the police will search they are searching mr penn and can discover nothing perhaps lord curberry may hunt for this woman i shall ask him to and as he loves miss moon so devotedly he will try to learn the truth irritated by this speechfor penn knew very well of the rivalrydan became scarlet i shall discover the truth lord curberry need not trouble himself if you discover the truth began penn and hesitated well asked halliday sharply i think lord curberry will certainly marry miss moon what do you mean by that demanded dan but penn gave no answer shaking his head significantly he stepped back and in one moment was lost in the midst of the crowd which thronged the corner halliday would have followed for the mans last observation seemed to hint that he knew more about the truth than he was disposed to admit but many people came between him and the secretary so it was impossible to get hold of him again dan was forced to walk on alone and he walked on pondering deeply did penn know the truth it seemed impossible that he should know it the evidence of the typewriting girl went to show that he had not left his private room all the evening until summoned by durwin when the death was discovered what penn said about the perfume appeared to be reasonable enough as he certainly had handled the body and if reeking of the scentas he was reeking on this very dayit was not surprising that the odor should communicate itself to the dress clothes of the dead man some odors cling very powerfully and endure for a considerable time this sumatra scent assuredly had done so for it was quite three hours after the death that dan himself had seen the corpse and even then he had smelt the perfume however on the face of it halliday saw no reason to doubt penns statement and quite understood how he became through sir johns mediation the secretary of lord curberry only the last speech of the secretary was strange why should he say that if the truth were discovered by dan curberry would marry the girl when on the discovery of the truthso far as dan could seethe marriage of himself to lillian depended dan could find no answer to this question and had half a mind to follow penn to his new employers house so as to force an explanation but as he knew curberry did not like him he decided to let matters stand as they were and only reveal what he had heard to laurance for the next four or five days young halliday went about his business in a quiet determined manner and thought as little as possible of lillian he did not even write or call to see her since he wished to give up his whole attention to discovering the truth about moons death if he thought of love and lillian he certainly could not concentrate his mind on the necessary search and it was very necessary if he intended to marry the girl he became certain that in some way sir john intended to trick him but if he found out the false mrs brown and solved the mystery sir john would be forced out of sheer justice to sanction the marriage it was heroical of halliday to turn his thoughts from his beloved and it was no easy task to one so deeply in love as he but he saw the need of it and manfully set himself to endure present pain for future joy whether lillian saw things in the same light or resented his neglect he did not know as he had no word from her neither came there any letter from mrs bolstreath dan had certainly been pushed out of the girls life by her astute uncle but it was his own common sense that kept him out of itfor the time beingbe it understood love demands its martyrs and halliday had become one for loves sake by doing so although he knew it not he was displaying more real love towards her than he had ever done in his life before meanwhile laurance lost no time in publishing his letter which dealt with the mystery of moons death as the moment including its extra letterwriting sheet had a large circulation and as it was a season devoid of news the letter caused great discussions it was sufficiently alarming to those who loved law and order since it boldly announced that a gang of criminals existed which coldly and cautiously and deliberately employed its members to put people to death the letter called attention to the flyand that an artificial oneon sir charless neck near the poisoned wound and declared that such was the signmanual of the accursed society no mention was made of the scent since dan had explained what penn had said to laurance and laurance had accepted the explanation as valid but there was quite enough in the letter to startle the most dull especially when the writer called attention to the happening of various mysterious murders and suggested that such were the work of this misguided set of people who constituted the unknown gang finally freddy ended his letter by saying that moon had knowledge of the gang and had sent for a scotland yard officialname not givento explain the whole matter when he met with his death it was a fact therefore that the false mrs brown was an emissary of the gang who had been sent to murder sir charles and had performed her vile errand only too well a postscript to the epistle invited discussion and particularly called upon any person who knew of an artificial fly being found on a corpse to give evidence in two days the sheet was filled with letters from various people and the matter was much discussed some of the writers laughed at the idea of such a society existing in a civilized country such as england while others expressed alarm and asked what the police were doing not to arrest the criminals these last scribes evidently entirely forgot that no one knew where the central quarters of the gang were and that the letter of mr laurance was an attempt to root out the heart of the mystery those who appeared in print and aided the circulation of the moment by buying their own lucubrations certainly did not help much the generality of the letters were discursive and ornate wandering very much from the point and giving no positive information such as would assist freddys purpose but three or four epistles drew attention to certain mysterious crimes the perpetrators of which had never been brought to justice and who were not even known there was the case of a young girl found dead on the brighton railway line near redhill and who must have been thrown out of the train then some one wrote about a miser in the east end who had been strangled and another person recalled the drowning of a wellknown philanthropist in the serpentine a verdict of suicide had been brought in as regards this last victim but the writer of the letter positively asserted that the philanthropist had not the slightest intention of making away with himself finally came a batch of letters concerning children who had been murdered but only in one case did it appear that any fly was seen on the victim and that was when a schoolmistress was stabbed to the heart while in bed and asleep the assassin had entered and escaped by the window and the victims motherwho wrote the letter drawing attention to this casehad found the fly on her daughters cheek she had thought nothing of it at the time and had brushed away the insect but after the mention of the fly on sir charles moons neck she remembered the incident also it turned out that the schoolmistress had she lived would have inherited a large sum of money it was this last circumstance that suggested the intervention of the gang to murder the girl so that someone else might inherit but all the letters dealing with the various cases were vague and no enlightening details could be given all that could be said was that there were many unusual deaths the mystery of which could not be solved laurance reading the letters during the week of their appearance felt sure that the gang existed but he was more or less alone in his opinion even dan was doubtful it seems such a large order for a number of people to band themselves together to murder on this comprehensive scale he objected and i dont quite see the object many of the victims mentioned in these letters are poor you seem to have changed your mind about the matter said laurance drily for when my letter appeared you were assured that there was such a gang only because of sir charless remarks to durwin it was a pity sir charles was not more explicit retorted freddy crossly he had no time to be explicit said dan patiently since he died before he explained but let us admit for the sake of argument that such a gang exists why should the members murder poor people folks have been murdered by way of revenge as well as for money and let me remind you dan that four or five of these victims mentioned in the letters had money or were about to inherit money i am quite convinced said laurance striking the table that there is such an association an association for what you are very dull to get undesirable people out of the way remember in the reign of louis xiv there were dozens of poisoners in paris who undertook to kill people when engaged to do so the reason was for revenge or desire for money ororor for other reasons ended laurance vaguely hum dan stroked his chin it may be as you say certainly sir charles was got rid of because he knew too much about this gang insisted laurance since he was to see durwin about the same i am certain that such an association exists you said that before halliday reminded him and i say it again at all events there is one thing certainthat we have learned from these letters of many mysterious crimes but only in one case was the fly discovered objected dan again that is not to be wondered at replied the journalist the wonder is that such a small insect should be noticed at all no one would ever think of connecting a fly whether dead or alive with the death the mother of this schoolmistress did not until your experience with regard to moon was quoted in my letter the fly business is quite ridiculous and perhaps means nothing oh i think it does seeing that in moons case the fly was artificial probably in the case of the schoolmistress it was artificial also only the mother who noticed it did not make an examination why should she i wonder the gang dont have a better trademark perhaps the gang may think it would be spotted if it did then why have any trademark at all answered laurance sensibly if there is to be a sign there should be some sensible one if the fly was stamped on the skin as the purple fern was stamped there would be some sense in the matter but a fly artificial or real is freddy spread out his hands for words entirely failed him well said dan after a pause i dont know what to say since everything is so vague however i shall assume that such a gang exists and shall do my best to aid you to bring about its destruction as that means my marriage to lillian to help i must have money so the sooner we get north and engage one of vincents machines with all the latest improvements the better shall i be pleased he moved towards the door as they were in laurances rooms when this conversation took place and there he halted i think freddy you will have a chance of proving in your own person as to the truth of your supposition regarding this gang what do you mean asked laurance somewhat startled well murmured dan the gang knows you started the hunt for its destruction as i expect the members read the papers if that is the case you will be a source of danger such as sir charles was and ill look after myself interrupted laurance grimly well if you dont and the worst comes said dan agreeably i shall carefully examine your corpse for the celebrated fly ill look after myself said laurance again and if you think i am going to give up doing business through fear of death you are much mistaken if i can find the gang and exterminate the gang ill get a much larger salary and so will be able to marry mildred oh thats her name is it mildred vincent is she pretty you might not think so since miss moon is your ideal said freddy with a blush mildred is dark and tall and wellproportionednone of your skimpy women old man lillian isnt skimpy cried halliday indignantly i never said she was let us call her fairylike thats better and your mildred youll see her when we go north the day after tomorrow good dan nodded thankfully we go to vincent the day after tomorrow yes meet me at a quarter to twelve at st pancras station the train leaves at midday and we change at thawley for beswick about four oclock i expect well arriveall going wellat sheepeak about six good but why shouldnt all go well inquired dan after a pause laurance chuckled according to you the gang will hunt me down and as you are in my companywell he chuckled again oh i dont care a cent for the gang no more than yourself retorted dan with a shrug im not even going to think of the beasts we go north to get the machine which will enable me to win this two thousand and then and then echoed laurance with a grin then i shall discover the truth crush the gang and marry lillian in this way therefore the muddy water was stirred up chapter vi the inventor freddy laurance usually opened his mouth to ask questions rarely to talk about himself in the newspaper world confidences may mean copy given that such are worthy to appear in print therefore as the young man found it is just as well to be sparing of personal details and having made this discovery he was careful to keep his tongue between his teeth in all matters dealing with his private life this reticence useful in business but wholly unnecessary in friendshipparticularly when the friendship had to do with dan hallidayhad grown upon laurance to such an extent that he said very little about his love affair dan being a genial soul and a fellowsufferer in the cause of cupid and having a heartwhole liking for the journalist resented being shut out in this way he therefore made it his business to extract freddys love story from him when the two were in the train making for sheepeak vi thawley and beswick where did you meet her asked dan abruptly as they had the compartment to themselves and he had exhausted not only the newspapers but the magazines her repeated laurance who was calmly smoking with his feet on the opposite seat what her the her the one girl in the world for you oh bosh freddy colored and looked pleasantly embarrassed is it perhaps you are right and dan began to hum a simple little american song entitled i wonder whos kissing her now laurance took this personally no one is i can trust her trust who asked dan innocently the person you mentioned now miss vincent mildred did i mention her well now you recall her name i did old man we are the best of friends but this fourth estate habit of holding your confounded tongue is getting on my nerves give yourself a treat by letting yourself go i am ready to listen and he leaned back with a seraphic smile freddy did not fence any longer but came out with details after all since he could trust dan he was beginning to think that it would be delightful to talk his heart empty shes the dearest girl in the world was the preamble dan twiddled his thumbs we all say that now lillian mildred we are speaking of her freddy spoke very fast lest his friend should interrupt since dan wanted confidences dan should have them given to him in a most thorough manner mildred is an angel and her uncle is an old respectable clever beast yes said halliday persuasively i thought in that way of sir charles when he interrupted private conversations between lillian and myself i am of the same opinion as regards sir john moon because yes i know what you mean by because but with regard to mildred who is an angel yes i met her a year ago in londonregent street to be precise as to locality a snob spoke to her without an introduction so she appealed to me and i punched his head then i escorted her home to hillshire what a knighterrant chuckled dan dont be an ass i escorted her to the guelph hotel in jermyn street where she and her uncle were staying the uncle appreciated the service i did for his niece and made me welcome especially when he found that as a newspaper man i was able to talk in print about his machines for an inventor the old man had an excellent idea of business inventors being generally fools so you called the next day to see if miss vincents nerves were better freddy cast a look of surprise at dans dark face how did you guess that halliday well i did and i got on better with solomon vincent than ever undoubtedly you got on better with the niece murmured dan mischievously well laurance colored you might put it that way i do put it that way said dan firmly and from personal experience not with mildred well to make a long story short i saw a great deal of them in town and took them to dinner and got them theatre seats and fell deeper in love every day then vincent asked me to sheepeak to inspect his machines and i wrote several articles in the moment ah i thought i remembered vincents name i read those articles but you didnt mention the niece ass said the journalist scornfully is it likely well thats the whole yarn ive been several times to sheepeak and vincent likes me to the extent of taking you as a nephew inquired dan thoughtfully no hang him thats why i call him a beast he says that mildred is necessary to his comfort as a housekeeper and wont allow her to marry me she is such a good girl that she obeys her uncle because he brought her up when her parents died and has been a father to her a dull romance and a leaguelong wooing with the lady in hillshire and the swain in london how long is this unsatisfactory state of things going to last my son i dont know rejoined fred mournfully until her uncle dies perhaps then let us hope hell fly once too often said dan cheerfully but do not be downhearted i am sure it will be all right i shall dance at your wedding and you will dance at mine by the way theres no necessity to talk to vincent or his niece about our endeavors to spot this gang of course not the matter wont be mentioned all i am talking about is private and you come to sheepeak with me to get a machine so as to win the london to york race it will be an advertisement for vincent thats all right and mildredtalk about her old man i know you are dying to explain the kind of angel she really is lull me to sleep with lovers rhapsodiesa request with which freddy now having broken the ice was perfectly willing to comply he described mildreds appearance with a lovers wealth of details drew attention to her many admirable qualities quoted her speeches praised her talents and thus entertained his friendand incidentally himselfall the way to thawley dan closed his eyes and listened puffing comfortably at his pipe occasionally he threw in a word but for the greater part of the time held his peace and let laurance babble on about his darlings perfections secretly dan did not think these could match lillians in any way at the great manufacturing town of thawley which was overshadowed by a cloud of dun smoke the travellers left the main line and crossed to another platform where they boarded the local train to beswick this station was only six miles down the line and they turned on their tracks to reach it since it branched off from the main artery into the wilds it nestled at the foot of a lofty hill covered from top to bottom with trees now more or less leafless laurance informed his companion that there was a ruined abbey hidden in the wood and also pointed out several interesting places for he was well acquainted with the locality at beswick they piled their bags on a ramshackle old trap and proceeded in this to climb up a long winding steep road which mounted gradually to the moors as the year was yet wintry and the hour was late the air became wonderfully keen andas freddy saidinspiriting dan however did not find it so as he felt quite sleepy and yawned the whole way until the trap stopped at the solitary hotel of sheepeak a rough stone house with thick walls and a slate roof the landlady rawboned sharpeyed and not at all beautiful met them at the door smiling in what was meant for an amiable manner when she saw laurance oh youre here again she said defiantly and dan noticed that beyond the northern burr she did not reproduce the country dialect yes mrs pelgrin and i have brought a friend to stay three or four days we want two bedrooms and a sittingroom and supper straight away you shall have them said mrs pelgrin still defiantly and the price will be a pound each for the four days ventured freddy with ten shillings extra for the sittingroom said mrs pelgrin fiercely oh come now ill not take you in for less well put in dan shrugging sooner than stand here in the cold and argue i shall pay the extra ten shillings cold do you call it cold mrs pelgrins tone was one of scorn ha cold and she led the way through a flagged stone passage to a large and comfortable room at the back of the house will this suit you thats all right mrs pelgrin said freddy throwing himself down on a slippery horsehair sofaand supper youll have it when its ready no sooner and no later barked the ogress leaving the room cold is it and she laughed hoarsely i say freddy observed halliday in a lazy tone why is the good lady so very savage she isnt mrs pelgrin is quite fond of me ive stayed here often fond of you echoed dan with a chuckle good lord how does she speak to those she isnt fond of its northern brusqueness shes honest but rude the two seem to go together with many people they think they will be taken for rascals if they are decently polite laurance remonstrated mrs pelgrin is a rough diamond i like my jewels polished however here we are and here we stay and here we eat if that amiable lady will bring in supper then i shall go to bed as i shall certainly yawn my head off if i dont but its just after six cried laurance i want to take you to see vincent tonightthis evening that is go yourself and see the beautiful mildred muttered dan drowsily twos company and threes a crowd im going to bed and in spite of laurances arguments against such sloth to bed he went after a brisk fight with mrs pelgrin over a fire in his sleeping apartment he said that he wanted one while the landlady declared that it was unnecessary finally dan got his own way and when the fire was blazing mrs pelgrin said goodnight but youre no more nor a butterfly she informed her guest and went out banging the door with muttering remarks concerning people who felt cold no doubt this weather is here regarded as tropical murmured dan getting into bed and referring to the weather and he smiled over mrs pelgrins manners until he fell asleep next morning laurance woke him at eight and dan grumbled about getting up although he was assured that he had slept the clock round however a cold bath soon brisked him up and he came down to the sittingroom with an excellent appetite for breakfast mrs pelgrin brought it in and again joked in her fierce way about the cold which the butterflyas she again termed danwas supposed to feel so keenly laurance talked about mildred who had been delighted to see him but mentioned regretfully that he did not think that dan would get the machine he was in search of why not asked mr halliday lighting his pipe and finishing his third cup of coffee vincent wants his aeroplanes exploited doesnt he and where will he find a better chance than for an experienced man such as i am flying his latest invention in the moments london to york race vincents a queer fish thats all i can say retorted laurance well you cant say more and you cant say less i suppose well go and have a look at the queer fish in his pond whenever you like at eleven oclock then right oh i can talk to the uncle and you can talk to the niece its a fair division of labor this arrangement was willingly agreed to by laurance as dan was certain it would be since he saw that his friend was fathoms deep in love afterwards the two went out of doors and surveyed the landscape sheepeak was situated on the top of a lofty tableland the village being a tolerably large collection of substantial stone houses whence the moors spread north and south east and west from where they were the friends could see the green squares of cultivated fields the purple bloom of the heather and the azure hues which distance gave to the distant mountains here and there the vast country which looked enormously large from the elevation whence they surveyed it dipped into verdant dales snugly clothed with forests and sprinkled with manorhouses and villages big and little the lands were so farstretching and the prospect so extensive that dan became mightily impressed with the magnitude of the sky it covered them like a huge inverted cup and as there was nothing to break its leaguelong sweep dan felt quite small in the immensity which surrounded him above and below i feel like a pill in the desert of sahara said mr halliday sighing what is the sensation of feeling like a pill rejoined laurance drily for he was not an imaginative individual only a poet can explain freddy and you are very earthy i never knew you were a genius snapped laurance with a shrug you have much to learn replied dan reprovingly and as its near eleven oclock suppose we light out for vincent freddy agreed and skirting the village for threequarters of a mile they suddenly came upon a small cottage with walls and roof of yellowish stone covered with lichen and standing in a small garden of windtormented vegetation a low stone wall divided this from the high road and the visitors entered through a small wooden gate to pass up a cobblestone walk to the modest door but the cottage itself was dwarfed wholly by huge sheds of wood covered with roofs of galvanized tin which loomed up suddenly behind it on a vast scale more in keeping with the character of the landscape these were the workshops of vincent where he built his machines and housed them from prying eyes the fields at the back cultivated into smooth lawns were where the aeroplanes started to fly over hill and dale to the wonderment of the inhabitants though they are pretty well used to vincents vagaries by this time said freddy ending his explanation mildred received them in the small parlor of the cottage which was about the size of a dolls drawingroom and expressed herself as pleased to make the acquaintance of mr halliday her uncle she mentioned was busy as usual in his workshop but would see the visitors in half an hour while she explained dan took stock of her and admitted that she was really a very amiable and pretty girl though not a patch on lillian but then dan did not care for tall ladies with olive complexions blue eyes dark hair and the regal melancholy look of discrowned queens mildredthe name suited herwas too tall and stately for his taste which approved more of little goldenhaired women fairylike and frolicsome miss vincent looked serious and thoughtful and although her smile was delicious she smiled very seldom it seemed to dan that her solitary life in these moorlands and in the companywhen she enjoyed itof her morose uncle made the girl sober beyond her years which were not more than twoandtwenty however many minds many tastes and dan could not deny but what freddys fair saxon looks went very well with the celtic mystic appearance of the inventors niece they were a handsome couple indeed but much too solemn in looks and character for dan whose liking leaned to the frivolous side of things dont you find it dull here miss vincent asked halliday casually dull she echoed turning her somewhat sad eyes of dark blue in his direction oh not at all why i have a great deal to do we have only one servant and i assist in the housework my uncle is not easy to cater for as he has many likes and dislikes with regard to food then he employs a certain number of workmen and i have to pay them every saturday indeed i look after all the financial part of my uncles business is it a business or a whima hobby inquired dan respectfully for being frivolous he was struck with awe at the multitude of miss vincents employments well more of the last than the first perhaps said mildred smiling at his respectful expression uncle solomon really doesnt care for publicity all his aim is to construct a perfect machine and he is always inventing and improving and thinking of new ways in which to obtain the mastery of the air his machines have been tried by other people though remarked freddy oh yes and with great success but uncle doesnt even read the papers to see what is said about his aeroplanes although he is always anxious to read what other inventors are doing and takes a great interest in races across channel and over the alps and from city to city but he is wrapt up in his own schemes and works for twelve and more hours out of the twentyfour in perfecting his machines public applause or public rewards dont appeal to him you see mr halliday its the work itself ah that is the true spirit of genius said dan approvingly a man like that is sure to arrive he will never arrive said miss vincent quietly for as soon as he arrives at one point he only regards it as a restingplace to start for a further goal he doesnt care for food or drink or clothes or politics or amusements or anything for which the ordinary man strives his machine takes up all his attention happy man to have one strong aim and to be allowed to work at that aim is the true happiness of any man i shall be glad to have a talk with him he doesnt talk much mr halliday a man obsessed with one idea seldom does retorted the young fellow i hope however he will let me have a machine for this race i can handle any aeroplane once it is explained to me and freddy here says that your uncles machines have many improvements likely to tell against competitors i am not sure if he will let you have a machine said mildred her face clouding he is very jealous and whimsical you know like all inventors murmured laurance rising let us go and see him yes added dan also getting on his feet and then you take freddy away miss vincent and let me talk to your uncle i shall get what i want somehow mildred laughed and led the way out of the cottage by the back door it is not an easy task you have set yourself to do she said doubtfully here are the workshops and the buildings where the machines are housed and yonder is uncle solomon the buildings looked plebeian and gimcrack with their flimsy wooden walls and tin roofs impressive only in their magnitude they must have cost a deal to erect in this neighborhood where all the houses great and small were of stone and wood was comparatively scarce vincent as dan considered must be welloff to indulge in so expensive a hobby to be sure by racing he could gain prizes and if successful could also sell machines at a good figure but from what mildred said it seemed to dan that her uncle had the true jealous spirit of an inventor and did not let his darlings go out of his hands if he could help it to live on this vast moorland working at his inventions and experimenting with his ideas was enough for solomon vincent without the applause and rewards of the world undoubtedly to carry out his plans he must have a private income and not an inconsiderable one at that uncle this is mr laurance and mr halliday said mildred introducing the two young men though the first did not require mention but vincent like most inventors was absentminded and it took him quite a minute to recognize laurance whom he had not seen on the previous night mr laurance and mr halliday he said casually and turning from the workman to whom he had been speakingyes of course you understand about the propeller quinton he added again taking up his conversation with the workman it must be seen to at once and quite oblivious of the company he went on giving instructions until the man went away to do his task and mildred touched her uncles arm this is mr laurance and mr of course i know it is mr laurance said vincent testily do you think i am blind how do you do laurance goodby i am busy and this is mr halliday who wants a machine went on mildred persuasively indeed then mr halliday shant get one retorted vincent and sauntered into the nearest shed with a scowl on his lean face he was an acridlooking man of fifty with untidy gray hair and an untrimmed beard follow him and he will talk said mildred hastily i shall remain here with freddy as uncle doesnt like many people to be about him he is not easy to get on with sighed dan i can see that however he took the girls advice and went into the shed after the ungracious inventor leaving the lovers to return to the cottage parlor which they did forthwith laurance was quite astute enough to lose no time since the moments spent with mildred were all golden and not easily obtainable dan marched into the shed with a fine air of possession and again surveyed vincent who was examining some specifications near a window the man was carelessly dressed in a shabby suit of blue serge and seemed to care little about his personal appearance marking once more his shaggy hair and beard and yellow skin considerably wrinkled the young man went up to him as if waking from a dream vincent looked up and dan met the gaze of two very keen dark eyes whose expression was anything but amiable who are you and what do you want demanded the owner of the eyes crossly my name is halliday i want a machine to race between london and york i have just been introduced to you by your niece my niece should have more sense than to have brought you here cried the inventor fiercely you come to spy out my ideas and to steal them i assure you i dont said dan drily i am not a genius as you are all the more reason you should pick my brains snapped vincent in no way mollified by the compliment as dan intended he should be halliday laughed if i did i could make no use of my pickings mr vincent as you may guess i can handle a machine but i cant put one together who told you about me demanded the man suspiciously laurance hes a meddlesome fool well said dan cheerfully there may be two opinions about that you know i dont want him and i dont want you and i dont want any one why do you come and bother me when i dont want you because my wants are to be considered see here mr vincent added halliday in a coaxing voice for he saw that it was necessary to humor this clever man like a child there is to be a race between london and york for a big prize given by the moment the paper mr laurance works for i wish to compete but my machine isnt so good as i should like it to be i hear that you have made several improvements which make for speed and easier handling of aeroplanes let me have one of your latest and ill share the prize with you its two thousand you know i dont want money snapped vincent abruptly i congratulate you said dan coolly and yet large sums must be needed to help you to build machines you must be rich are you rich vincent grew a dusky red and glanced in an odd way over his shoulder as if he expected to find some one at his elbow mind your own business he said in a harsh voice and with suppressed fury whether im rich or not is my business you shant have an aeroplane of mine clear out dan did clear out but as he went wondered why the man was so angry and confused he seemed quite afraid of the simple question that had been put to him chapter vii the hermit ladies dan was not naturally of a suspicious nature but since taking up the profession of a detective he had become so slight matters that formerly he would not have noticed now attracted his attention and as the saying goes he saw a bird in every bush for this reason while returning slowly to the cottage he considered vincents backward glance which hinted at nervousness and his unnecessarily angry reply to the question as to whether he was rich usually dreamy and absentminded the turn taken by the conversation had awakened the tiger in the man and apparently he regarded halliday as overinquisitive yet why the inventor should take this view dan could not conjecture but after musing for a few minutes the young man began to think he was making a mountain out of a molehill and whatever secret vincent had in his life as his suddenly aggressive attitude showed it could have nothing to do with the particular quest upon which dan was bent halliday therefore dismissed the matter from his mind with a shrug and went into the cottage to disturb the lovers well mr halliday remarked mildred whose cheeks were flushed and whose eyes were bright what did my uncle say very little but what he did say was to the point he refuses to let me have a machine how like him ejaculated laurance quickly but upon what grounds dan scratched his chin really i dont know he seems to think that i am a spy desirous of learning his trade secrets he called you a meddlesome fool freddy ah that is because i wish to marry mildred replied freddy drily it is very natural that mr vincent should object to a man who comes to rob him of his treasure so i dont mind his abuse i am not a treasure cried mildred becoming pink you are who knows that better than i my darling you think too well of me impossible you are the best and dearest stop stop mildred covered her face remember we are not alone oh dont mind me said dan phlegmatically im in love myself miss vincent she nodded comprehendingly with miss moon freddy has told me has he told you that my marriage depends upon my finding out who murdered her father questioned the young man dismally yes and that you need money for the search which money continued laurance determinedly must be obtained by dan winning this london to york race that can be done i am certain with one of your uncles aeroplanes mildred as he has made wonderful improvements in their structure and but he declines to furnish me with a machine interrupted halliday in a vexed tone not even my offer to share the prize tempts him he is too rich i suppose he cast an inquiring glance at the girl mildred shook her head uncle solomon is not rich she replied quietly he must be insisted dan sharply he could not indulge in such an expensive hobby otherwise mrs jarsell helps him with money though to be sure he has a little of his own still unless she supplied money uncle solomon could not go on building aeroplanes especially as he rarely sells one and wishes to keep all his inventions to himself his idea is to invent a perfect machine and then sell it to the government and he fancies that if he allows any one else to handle his aeroplanes his secrets may be prematurely discovered well i can see his objection in that way assented dan since more ideas are stolen than pocket handkerchiefs as balzac says but mrs jarsell she is a rich and rather eccentric lady who lives at the grange said mr laurance before mildred could reply i am as wise as i was before freddy its an odd thing for a lady to finance an inventor of flyingmachines she must be largeminded and have a very great deal of money she is largeminded and she has plenty of money admitted mildred vivaciously her influence with my uncle is extraordinary not at all if she supplies the cash said dan cynically but i have an idea miss vincent suppose we enlist mrs jarsells sympathies about the murder no said halliday after thinking for a moment or so i dont see the use of talking too much about that the more secret freddy and i keep our hunt the better prospect have we of success since the gang will not be on guard as it were no miss vincent introduce me to mrs jarsell as a young and ardent lover who wishes to make money in order to marry the girl of his heart if she is romanticand nine old ladies out of ten are romanticshe will induce your uncle to give me his newest aeroplane if she decides to help you uncle solomon certainly will give you what you want mildred assured him since mrs jarsell has supplied him with so much money for his experiments she thought for a second then raised her head cheerfully we shall see mrs jarsell and miss armour this afternoon who is miss armour mrs jarsells companion and relative and confidential friend shes a dear old thing and is sure to sympathize with your romance all the better so long as she can influence mrs jarsell she can influence her as mrs jarsell swears by her put in freddy oh i think youll pull it off dan its a good idea to work old vincent through the hermit ladies the hermit ladies echoed dan wonderingly an odd reputation hermits are usually masculine mrs jarsell and miss armour are an exception said laurance laughing in fact they are modern representatives of that eccentric couple of ladies who lived at llangollen you remember them i have heard the names murmured dan reflectively the old ladies of llangollen who eloped together and lived in wales i should rather like to see this pair that follow so strange an example when are we to go this afternoon repeated mildred nodding brightly i really think something may come of the visit mr halliday you and freddy go back to the peacock for dinner and then call for me latersay at three oclock i am a favorite with the hermit ladies and have leave to bring any one to afternoon tea especially nice young men mrs jarsell and miss armour are fond of young men giddy old things said dan gaily i hope they will take a fancy to me as i shall do my best to charm them well you must go now mr halliday as i have much to do before taking an hour off vincent works you too hard mildred said laurance impatiently as he took up his cap you cant call a moment your own i shall call two hours or so my own this afternoon replied mildred amiably and sent the young men away quite happy since there was a promising chance that dan would gain his ends thats a delightful girl said dan when the two were seated at dinner i should like to marry her if lillian were not in existence im glad that lillian is dan since i want to marry mildred myself dont poach you animal i wont promised halliday generously i dont like dark hair but its no use arguing let us eat and drink for i have to fascinate mrs jarsell and her bosom friend ill get hold of that aeroplane somehow we are here for that purpose said laurance determined to have the last word and as dan was hungry he let him have it the grangeat which they arrived late in the afternoon the two men escorting the one girlwas a large rambling mansion built of yellowish stone its original color more or less washed out by rain and burnt out by sunshine the surface of the massive walls was grimy with black and rough with lichens while the broad flat stones of the roof were covered with damp green moss the house although in two stories was of no great height and stood on the uttermost verge of the hill which sloped abruptly down into the valley the view should have been very fine but sundry tall houses had been built round the grange which prevented the owner from enjoying the magnificent prospect this shuttinginaccording to the legendwas due to the malice of a disinherited brother in jacobean times who had created quite a village round about the estate so as to block out the view but the present inhabitants did not mind much for as mildred explained both miss armour and mrs jarsell stayed within doors a great deal in fact miss armour is more or less paralyzed and sits in a big chair all day reading and knitting and talking and playing patience said mildred as the trio turned into a small courtyard and found themselves facing a squat door set in a porch sufficiently massive to serve for the entrance to a mausoleum an elderly maid in an incongruous dress of brilliant scarlet admitted them into a darkish hall whose atmosphere suggestive of a turkish bath in a mild way hinted that the house was heated by steam pipes as indeed was the case there were some carved boxes of black oak in the hall and three or four uncomfortable highbacked chairs but the walls and floor were bare and the general aspect was somewhat bleak however when the visitors were conducted along a narrow passage illlighted and dismal they were introduced to a large lowceilinged room richly and luxuriously and picturesquely furnished the brilliant garb of the maidservant suited this room much better than it did hall or passage and there was a suggestion of tropical splendor about the woman and the sittingroom which revealed in mrs jarsell a strong love of color warmth and light indeed although there were three large windows looking out on to a garden and immediately facing the door by which they had entered yet the light which was admitted being insufficientperhaps because of the wintry gloomthe apartment was brilliantly illuminated by six lamps three of these stood at one end of the room and three at the other on tall brass stands and the light radiating through opaque globes filled the place with mellow splendor the vivid scene it revealed was a strange and unexpected one to find in these barren wilds what impressed dan straight away was the prevalence of scarlet the walls were covered with brightly toned paper the floor with a carpet of violently brilliant hue and even the ceiling was splashed with arabesque designs bloodred against the white background the furniture was of black oak upholstered in satin of the same fiery tint while the draperies were of a dense black funereal in aspect a large fire glowed on a wide hearth in a vermiliontiled alcove and the poker tongs shovels and pincers were of brass also there were brass candlesticks a tripod of the same alloy in which incense slowly smoldered and even brazen warmingpans of antique pattern were ranged on either side of the fireplace thus the general colorscheme was of black scarlet and yellow what with the barbaric hues the warm atmosphere and the faint scent of incense dan felt as though he had stumbled on the den of a magician malicious and dangerous but this may have only been an impression caused by coming suddenly into this tropical room out of the chill air and neutraltinted landscape neither mrs jarsell nor miss armour however carried their love of violent color into their personal attire as both were arrayedsomewhat incongruously considering the seasonin unrelieved white the former lady was tall and bulky and somewhat assertive in manner with a masculine cast of countenance and watchful dark eyes from the smooth olive texture of her skin she had probably possessed jetblack hair before age turned her still plentiful locks completely white she was not as dan concluded more than fifty as she possessed great vitality and gripped his hand in a vigorous manly way quite in keeping with her commanding looks her white gown was made perfectly plain she did not display even a ribbon and wore no jewellery whatsoever yet her whole appearance was distinguished and dignified indeed when she welcomed the young people she assumed something of a motherly air but if the hint conveyed by the barbarically decorated room was to be taken she was anything but maternal mrs jarsell as dan mentally confessed was something of a puzzle he could not place her as the saying goes miss armour had also an unusual personality being the antithesis of her friend in looks and manner to mrs jarsells massive assertiveness she opposed a fragile timidity and was as small of body as the other was large her oval manywrinkled face was the hue of old ivory her features were delicate and her small head drooped in a rather pensive manner her white hair not so plentiful as that of mrs jarsell was smoothly arranged under a dainty cap of white lace decorated oddly enough with diamond ornaments and indeed she wore enough jewellery for both ladies rings on her slender fingers and chains round her neck and bracelets on her wrists with a belt of turquoise stones a ruby brooch and earrings of pearls on a less refined person this overloading of ornaments would have looked vulgar but miss armour although she glittered at all points like a heathen idol preserved a calm dignity which caused her sumptuous display to appear perfectly natural it was very strange that such a mildlooking woman should deck herself out in this manner so she also was a puzzle to hallidays intelligence indeed the two ladies in their splendid room suggested to dan dreams of the arabian nights and gave him the impression of being concerned in some gorgeous romance miss armour seated in the big chair which mildred had mentioned looked over dan with mild brown eyes and evidently approved of his good looks i am glad to see you mr halliday she said in a soft and musical voice quite silvery in its sound to an old person such as i am the young are always welcome dan felt called upon to pay a compliment you dont look old he said bluntly well nowadays sixty cannot be called old said miss armour with a pretty laugh as i am assured that women of that age actually dance in london the agelimit has been extended since victorian times laughed laurance who had seated himself near one of the windows beside mildred yes assented mrs jarsell in deep tones suggestive of a mellowsounding bell in those times women went on the shelf at thirtyfive and lived again in their children nowadays there are no old people certainly not in this room said dan courteously you are irish i should say mr halliday remarked miss armour smiling as she resumed her knitting of a red and white striped shawl only an irishman could pay such a pretty compliment my mother was irish admitted dan amiably and i made a special journey to kiss the blarney stone in the hope that it might oil my tongue mrs jarsell in her heavy way seemed amused you have certainly accomplished your purpose mr halliday but what does a gay young man as i see you are do in this solitary neighborhood and her keen black eyes swept over him from head to foot inquiringly ah put in freddy quickly that question brings out the reason of our visit to you mrs jarsell behold in my friend a lover delightful cried miss armour with great animation and the lady miss moon the daughter of sir charles moon moon moon murmured miss armour as though she were invoking the planet i seem to have heard that name somewhere eliza she glanced at her friend dont you remember the murder we read about some months ago replied mrs jarsell heavily it was much talked about it would need to be to reach my ears eliza you know that i dont like hearing about crime in this neighborhood she addressed herself to dan we live a quiet and uneventful life and although we take one london newspaper daily we know little of what is going on in the world my friend reads to me about the theatres and dresses and sometimes politics but rarely does she inflict murder cases on me i dont like to hear of crime i read that particular case because it caused so great a sensation said mrs jarsell in a deprecating tone you remember sir charles was poisoned by some unknown woman and now i recall the case mr halliday your name was mentioned in connection with it probably said dan lightly i am engaged to miss moon have the police discovered who murdered sir charles no nor is there any chance that the police will make the discovery the woman came and the woman went after doing her work but she has vanished into thin air like macbeths witches i wonder why she murdered sir charles asked mrs jarsell after a pause halliday glanced at laurance and it was the latter who replied in a most cautious manner wishing to say as little as possible about the quest the reason is not known mrs jarsell but why began mildred only to be cut short somewhat impatiently by miss armour who had been moving uneasily dont talk any more about the horrid thing she broke out impetuously i dont want to hear tell me of your love affair mr halliday there is little to tell said dan relieved that the conversation was changed in this manner since he did not desire to say too much of his business in connection with the crime and i would not tell you that little but that i wish to enlist your sympathies and those of mrs jarsell you have mine already declared the old lady vivaciously but why elizas mrs jarsell can help me indeed said that lady looking at him hard in what way let me explain chimed in freddy impatient of dans slower methods mr halliday wishes to marry miss moon and wants money but she has plenty mr laurance the papers said that the late sir charles was a millionaire so he was and miss moon is his heiress cried dan quickly all the same i dont wish to live on my wife and so desire to be in a position to offer her a home however humble now i am an aviator miss armour and there is to be a race for between london and york i wish to compete and desire one of mr vincents machines as they are the most improved kind on the market they are not on the market said mrs jarsell frowning mr vincent will not part with his machines until he perfects a masterpiece and then hopes to sell it to the government i dont wonder you failed to get an aeroplane from him i did not say that said dan swiftly not in so many words rejoined mrs jarsell deliberately but i can guess why you want my assistance mr vincent will give you a machine if i ask him and you will said halliday eagerly oh eliza you must put in miss armour quickly vincent will do anything for you since you have helped him so much with money i shall be delighted to help said mrs jarsell in her quiet slow manner you shall have the machine mr halliday and i hope you will win the race and marry miss moon but you are a bold man to offer to wed an heiress on dont you want more money i want heaps and heaps said dan laughing but i have no chance of getting it however two thousand will do to start with lillianmiss moon that isloves me well enough to marry me at once even on the prize given by the moment well eliza will get you the machine that is certain mr halliday as to the rest i have no doubt you will be successful and win the money but you must have much more in order to marry miss moon since i can see that you are much too honorable a man to live on her millions the cardsmiss armour hastily put away her knitting and took a small box from a drawer in the tiny table which stood at her elbowmy patience cards mr halliday for you know having few amusements i am devoted to the game also i can tell fortunes i shall tell yours and she opened the box to take out two packs of cards dan isnt superstitious laughed freddy and approached with mildred i dont know said halliday gravely i have known cases well have your fortune told now broke in mrs jarsell going to the door it will amuse miss armour to reveal your future while i see about the tea i am sure you young people must be hungry but i havent thanked you for your promise to get me the machine mrs jarsell nodded in a friendly manner when you win the race and marry the young lady you can thank me she said with ponderous playfulness miss armour will tell you if the fates will be kind to you in both respects and she disappeared to get the tea or rather to instruct the redrobed servant to bring it in meanwhile miss armour her mild face quite flushed with excitement was spreading out the cards after dan had shuffled them she used only one pack and freddy looked on at the disposition of the colored oblongs with the deepest interest dan idly took up the unused pack and the moment he brought them near his eyes to examine them he became aware that there clung to them the same mysterious scent which penn had stated came from sumatra new as he was to the detective business he yet had enough sense to suppress his excitement at this discovery seeing that the exsecretary had stated very positively that no one but himself in england possessed the perfume it was strange indeed that dan should come across it in these wilds and connected with the personal possessions of a harmless old lady confined to her chair by partial paralysis in spite of his coolness he was so thunderstruck that he could scarcely stammer a reply to miss armour when she asked him if his coloredcard was clubs or spades she saw his confusion immediately what is the matter she demanded sharply and her face grew pale the heat of the room the scents make me feel rather faint said dan haltingly remove the incense burner to the end of the room mr laurance said miss armour and when the young man did so she turned to halliday are you then so susceptible to scents yes i dont like strong perfumes you do apparently miss armour why even your cards are scented and he held out the odd pack the lady took the cards and smelt them but showed no sign of emotion i expect its some scent eliza gave me a few weeks ago i had it on my handkerchief and it must have got on to the cards have you ever smelt a perfume like it before she asked suddenly no said dan lying promptly as he thought it best to be on the safe side and i hope i shant again its too rich for my taste and was for mine said miss armour indifferently i only used it once or twice strange that you should be so susceptible to scents however you feel better now thats right and the cards see there is great good fortune coming to you thats jolly said dan now quite recovered in a few weeks said miss armour impressively a wonderful chance will be offered to you if you take it a large amount of money will be yours within the year you will marry miss moon if you seize this chance if you do not she will marry another person and the fortuneteller gathered her pack in that case i shall take the chance at once said dan promptly miss armour looked at him hard i advise you to do so she said briefly illustration why even your cards are scented page chapter viii aviation the tea that followed the fortunetelling was quite a success as miss armour was a most amusing talker and the rest of the party proved themselves to be good listeners the old lady being an invalid had ample time for reading and concerned herself chiefly with french mmoires the cynical lighthearted tone of which appealed to her but she was also wellposted in english literature of the best kind and could converse very ablyas she didon leading authors and their works dan complimented her on the knowledge she had attained oh but it is no credit to me mr halliday miss armour protested i have so much time unoccupied and grow weary of playing patience and of knitting it would be strange if i did not know something after years and years of reading books are my best friends then mrs jarsell is also a book or say a human document said dan politely she is the best woman in the world cried miss armour while mrs jarsell bent her heavy white eyebrows in acknowledgment of the compliment you can have no idea how kind she is to me and to whom should i be kind but to my old governess said mrs jarsell in a gruff way why you have taught me all i know and i should think miss armour could teach a lot said laurance in his pleasant manner you know so much and have such tact that you should be out in the world governing people miss armour she sent a sharp glance in his direction as if to inquire exactly what he meant then she accepted the compliment with a charming laugh but for this dreadful paralysis i should indeed love to be out in the world i love to deal with human nature and make people do what i want can you asked mildred anxiously yes child replied the exgoverness quietly because i base my diplomacy on the knowledge that every one with few exceptions is ruled by self harp on that string and you can manage any one miss armour put in mrs jarsell in her deep voice rather talks of what she would do than what she does here we see few people i go up to town on occasions but very rarely you must find it dull said dan candidly for some reason miss armour appeared to think this speech amusing oh no i dont find life dull at all i assure you there is always a great deal to be done when one knows how to set about the doing as how questioned the young man somewhat puzzled books and music and cardgames and knittingwork said mrs jarsell quickly as if she did not approve of miss armours observations nothing more quite so nothing more assented the governess but with a sudden flash of her brown eyes directed towards her friend here we are out of the world do you stay long mr halliday only for another couple of days until i can get the machine you shall get it i promise you said mrs jarsell graciously when the trio arose to depart mr vincent owes me too much to disregard my request of course chimed in mildred uncle solomon would never be able to build his aeroplanes if you didnt help him with money goodby miss armour goodby dear child i shall say au revoir to you mr halliday as i shall expect you to come and see me again if only to let me know that your fortune has come true will it do you think yes said miss armour positively i am quite certain that the chance foretold by the cards will be given you dan hoped it would and thanked the lady for her happy prediction after which he and freddy with mildred between them left the weird house and walked up the darkened road toward the village halliday went at once to the peacock wishing to give freddy and his beloved chance of a ttette they took it readily enough as laurance escorted the girl home it was an hour before he returned to an overdue supper which mrs pelgrin served with fierce grumbling after supper dan spoke his mind to laurance when i took up that extra pack of cards he said abruptly i smelt that same perfume that hung about sir charless clothes when he was dead what freddy sat up aghast in his corner of the room the perfume about which penn explained the same but did he explain it seems to me that he told a lie if he only had one bottle and the perfume is not procurable in england seeing it is manufactured in sumatra how did miss armour become possessed of it it may not be the same scent said laurance still aghast you see a bird in every bush dan this is not a question for the eyes but for the nose i tell you freddy that the perfume is exactly the same why did you not ask miss armour about it i did you heard me she got it from mrs jarsell so she said now where did mrs jarsell get it from sumatra perhaps why not ask her straight out no said dan decisively i shall not mention the subject to mrs jarsell until i have questioned marcus penn once more he told me a lie once by saying that no one in this country possessed this especial perfume he shant tell me another how do you mean to get him to tell you the truth asked freddy dubiously never mind i have some sort of a plan i shant explain until it comes off there is some connection between that perfume and the crime i am certain concluded dan with a positive air laurance wriggled uneasily oh that is absurd on such assumption you suggest that miss armour knows about the matter about what matter you knowthe gang well said halliday smoking thoughtfully we are not entirely certain yet if such a gang exists its all theory anyhow in spite of the letters you drew from this person and the other penn certainly explained the scent but told an obvious lie since miss armour has it i dont say that she knows anything but it is strange that she should possess the sumatra perfume other people can send the same perfume to england retorted freddy penn isnt the sole person who has friends in sumatra mrs jarsell since she gave the scent to miss armour may have friends in that island ask her no said dan very positively i shall ask no one until i make penn speak out in any case i want to know why he told a lie perhaps he didnt im jolly well sure that he did then to put it plainlyyou suspect mrs jarsell to answer plainly i dont there can be no connection between two harmless old ladies living in these wilds and the murder of sir charles yet this confounded scent forms a link between the dead man mrs jarsell and penn laurance rubbed his chin reflectively its odd to say the least of it i suppose you are certain the perfume is the same ill swear to it dan rose and knocked the ashes out of his pipe and i intend to learn how mrs jarsell became possessed of it i may be on a wild goose chase all the same with the stake i have i cant afford to lose an opportunity so miss armour said when she told your fortune commented freddy thoughtfully yes i wonder what she meant dan stretched himself im for bed ring the bell and ask mrs pelgrin for the spirits laurance not feeling called upon to resume the conversation as he was tired himself did as he was told and mrs pelgrin rawboned and grim bounced aggressively into the room to demand fiercely what they required she sniffed when whiskey was ordered but as its consumption would increase her bill she brought in a bottle of johnny walker and a siphon of soda without argument when she turned to depart and wished them goodnight in tones suggestive of a jailer a sudden thought struck dan it would not be amiss he thought to question mrs pelgrin concerning the hermit ladies not that he expected a great deal to result from his exanimation as the worthy woman was a shecat and what she knew would probably have to be clawed out of her we had tea at the grange today mrs pelgrin said dan casually the landlady wrapped her hands in her apron and wheeled grimly at the door to speak aggressively ho she grunted whats that i said ho and hos all im going to say well drawled freddy with a shrug you cant say much less you know less or much i dont say anything retorted mrs pelgrin screwing up her hard mouth and nodding nobody wants you to say anything remarked dan lazily but on the alert of course this speech opened the landladys mouth people say as its queer two ladies should live like dormice in a haystack she observed significantly thats like people they will meddle with what doesnt concern them not me snorted mrs pelgrin violently and epigrammatically i dont say what i could say for what i could say wouldnt be whats right to say wouldnt it inquired freddy innocently no it wouldnt sir im not to be pumped cried mrs pelgrin try you ever so hard so there and she screwed up her mouth tighter than ever who is pumping asked dan coolly i simply remarked that we had tea with mrs jarsell and miss armour today friends of yours no doubt snapped the landlady i never saw them before today mrs pelgrin then dont see them again advised the woman sharply thank you for that advice anything wrong wrong wrong what should be wrong mrs pelgrin became more violent than ever theres nothing wrong then thats all right said halliday coolly goodnight mrs pelgrin stared hard at him evidently wondering why he did not press his questions seeing how significant a remark she had made the idea that her conversation was trivial in his eyes hurt her selfesteem she gave another hint that she knew something i wonder how those ladies make their money she observed casually to the ceiling ah i wonder agreed dan making a covert sign that freddy should restrain the question now on the tip of his tongue three motorcars said mrs pelgrin musingly four servants women all and sluts at that i do say with a house like a palace inside whatever it may be to look at from the road all that needs money mr halliday quite so nothing for nothing in this greedy world ten years have those ladies been here continued the landlady exasperated by this indifference as dan intended she should be and dull they must find that old house to be sure miss armour is ill and never moves from her chairso they say she ended emphatically and stared at halliday so who say he inquired phlegmatically every one sir shes paralyzedso they say and mrs jarsell attends to her like an angel remarked dan suavely they say that also you know why do you advise us not to see the ladies again asked freddy who could no longer rein in his curiosity halliday was annoyed by the question as he thought it would dry up the stream of mrs pelgrins hinted information but instead of this happening she became excessively frank well its this way mr laurance she said rubbing her nose in a vexed manner you are two nice young gentlemen and i dont want either of you to step in and spoil georges chance george my nephew he being the son of my late husbands brother and a porter at the thawley railway station mrs jarsell had taken quite a fancy to him he being a handsome lad in his way and the chances are she will leave him a lot of her money if you two gentlemen dont take her fancy now you know my reason for not wanting you to see her again oh i dont think mrs jarsell will leave either my friend or me money said dan affably george pelgrin is quite safe i suppose one good turn deserves another what do you mean said the landlady sharper than ever well george pelgrin must have done something for mrs jarsell to make her leave him money hes done nothing and she dont say shell leave him her money but george thinks she might seeing she has taken a fancy to him i dont want you or mr laurance here to spoil my nephews chances oh we shant do that rejoined halliday calmly i suppose george finds it dull at the thawley station when there are no sheepeak friends there with him working at the station that is oh he doesnt find it dull replied mrs pelgrin innocently he has made friends with plenty of thawley folk are you going away tomorrow perhaps and perhaps the next day said dan wondering at the direct question you see i wish to get an aeroplane from mr vincent and as soon as i do i shall go back to london youll be seeing mrs jarsell again halliday shook his head i shall be too busy to spare the time mrs pelgrin drew a breath of relief and again became fierce i aint ashamed of what ive said she declared pulling open the door violently you can tell the whole village if you like and she bounced out as she had bounced in leaving laurance overcome with surprise now whats the meaning of all that chatter he asked staring at dan oh its very plain mrs jarsell has taken a fancy to her nephew and mrs pelgrin thinks our fascinations may spoil his chance of getting money what i want to know is what george has done for mrs jarsell to warrant the deep interest she apparently takes in him evidently mused dan to himself there are not other sheepeak people employed at the thawley station what of that laurance stared harder than ever nothing only george pelgrin would be the only person likely to know mrs jarsell at the thawley station there are motorcars also remember i really dont see what you are driving at dan i scarcely see myself save that i want to learn the secret of that perfume and why it forms a link between moon and penn and mrs jarsell but how can this chatter of mrs pelgrins help asked freddy more and more puzzled dan lighted his bedroom candle and walked slowly to the door before he replied i shall have to sleep upon what i know before i can answer that he said nodding goodnight old chap but dan dan dan called out laurance who had heard just enough to make him wish to hear more tell me he stopped speaking as he saw that halliday was out of hearing it was in a very dissatisfied frame of mind that laurance retired to his bed next morning dan had evidently quite forgotten the conversation of the landlady for he made no remark and although freddy tried to start the subject again he declined to revert to it halliday declared that he did not know what to say that he was putting two and two together but as yet could not make four and that it would be just as well to seek mr solomon vincent to hear if he was disposed to supply an aeroplane only i wonder he remarked irrelevantly as he walked up the road with his friend how it comes that mrs pelgrin speaks more like a londoner than a derbyshire woman i thought we discussed that question before replied laurance schoolboards are doing away largely with the local dialect also mrs pelgrin as mildred told me was in service for some years at reading why do you ask oh i ask nothing said dan easily it was only an idea i had connected with the case yes and with mrs jarsell pooh you see a bird in every bush dan so you said before rejoined halliday drily why repeat yourself hullo there is our inventor he added as they drew near to the cottage and by jove hes smiling mrs jarsell had evidently spoken to him it was as dan said for vincent received the young men with a sour smile which sat uneasily on his face since he was more accustomed to frowning however as he was disposed to be amiable dan was thankful for small mercies and expressed his feeling loudly when the inventor graciously placed at his disposal an aeroplane of the latest construction i owe mrs jarsell much said vincent leading the way toward the shed so her requests must be granted here is the machine mr halliday its very good of you it isnt dont thank me but mrs jarsell speaking for myself i shouldnt allow you to have the aeroplane said vincent sourly i want to keep all my improvements to myself until i make a perfect machine oh ill keep all your secrets dan assured him cheerfully as they entered the vast shed and ill share the prize money with you i dont want it win the race and prove that my machine is the best that is all i ask by the way where is laurance dont you remember we left him in the cottage with your niece i dont want him to marry her and he shant said vincent with a frown speaking on the subject unexpectedly and what is more since hes a newspaper man i dont want you to talk too freely to him about my improvements laurance can hold his tongue rejoined dan somewhat stiffly your tradesecrets are safe with him so this is the machine he ended to avert further discussion on the inventors part yes said vincent forgetting all else in the passion of his hobby and he began to explain matters a biplane as you see and it can carry enough oil and essence for a twelve hours flight wheel it out he added turning to a quartette of workmen mr halliday will try a flight dan was only too ready as the beauty of the machine appealed to him immensely especially when he beheld it in the pale light of the sun when it was brought into the open the men wheeled it out of the back part of the shed on to a level lawn which could serve as a startingplace vincent talked all the time in a great state of excitement and pointed out the various improvements and beauties of the masterpiece the planes were not exactly horizontal since vincent considered that he gained more power by making them branch at a slight angle the wings were doubly covered with fine canvas and a broad streak of crimson ran through their white which the inventor informed dan was a characteristic of all his machines a sort of distinguishing mark as it were said vincent another improvement was that the aviator could steer with his knees on occasions which gave freedom to the hands when necessary the engine was light and powerful with tremendous drivingpower considering its size finally the steeringseatthe bridge of the airship as it might bewas fenced in comfortably with aluminium and a broad expanse of mica protected the controller of the aeroplane from the force of the winds it was really an admirable machine and halliday was loud in his praises to which however its maker paid little attention genius does not require laudation talent does dan inspected the machine in every direction tried the steering gear which ran easily saw that the engine was well supplied with fuel and tested as well as he could the various spars and ropes and bolts then he took his seat in the pilotbox and prepared for a trial flight not that she hasnt been out before said vincent while dan gathered his energies to start ready mr halliday let her go the workman ran the machine along the lawn dan set the propeller going and after lightly spinning along the ground for some distance the aeroplane rose into the gray sky like an immense bird a side glance showed dan that mildred and her lover were running out of the shed and had arrived just a moment too late to witness his start however he had no time to pay attention to terrestrial matters for all his capabilities were given to handling the new craft up and up he went to a considerable height with the engine running true and sweet then dived nearly to earth in switchback fashion only to tower again like a hawk shortly he was at a lofty elevation travelling along at top speed in the direction of the tenmiledistant thawley vincent and his workmen laurance and the girl became mere black dots and beneath him the earth slipped past at more than railroad speed once in the vast spaces of the firmament dan let his engines travel at their fastest and the vanes of the propeller spun as an american would say like greased lightning hallidays pulses raced almost as fast as the joy of playing with death seized him in the delicate structure of the aeroplanebeing its soul and controlling powerhe felt like a bird and swooped in mighty arcs in proof of his mastership of the sky in a few minutes he was over thawley and a downward glance showed him innumerable black insects running with excitement here there and everywhere as the machine was sighted dan dipped nearly to the weathercock of the parish church then slid out toward the northern portion of the town making his aerial way with the speed of the wind thawley was soon left behind and the aviator hovered over a wide country dotted with villages intersected with streams and rough with more or less high hills that divided the many vales of the country ten minutes took him out of hillshire and he flew over the mild yorkshire moors the air sang past him on either side of the mica screen which prevented his breath being taken away everything was taut and fit and neat and in its right place and the engine sang a song of triumph which mingled with the droning hum of the screw below was the painted earth above the gray sky faintly illuminated by the wintry sunshine and between the two halliday flew with the swiftness of a kestrel sighting its prey dan was used to this sublime excitement and could control his feelingsotherwise he would have shouted for joy which would have been from his point of view a mere waste of energy he finally reached york circled round the minster and then turned his craft homeward in glee the machine was certainly the best he had yet handled and he made sure that given moderately decent conditions he would win the race and gain the necessary to continue his search for moons murderess and the capture of her as he reminded himself meant his marriage with lillian no wonder the young mans heart beat high for it was not easy to come by so magnificent an aeroplane and he felt as grateful to vincent for building it as he felt to mrs jarsell for procuring him the mastership of the same those left behind on the lawn behind the sheepeak shed stared steadily into the gray distance and shortly saw a dim spot moving toward them with the swiftness of an eagle larger and larger it grew until they could distinguish the aeroplanes construction like a delicate tracery against the clouds in a wide circle it moved gracefully and then like a bird folding its wings settled gently at the very feet of its inventor the trial was a complete success in every way chapter ix mahomets coffin the aeroplane acquired by halliday could be dismounted in three parts so that it could easily have been taken to pieces and packed for transfer to london but the race for the moment prize was to take place within seven days and dan wished to familiarize himself with the machine as much as was possible in the interval for this reason he decided to go by air to the metropolis taking the journey in easy flights with intervals of rest between he therefore arranged to send his baggage back to town with freddy and carried only a small black bag containing absolutely necessary personal effects freddy did not object to this plan as he did not wish to leave mildred sooner than was necessary therefore dan started and laurance remained behind to pass golden hours in the girls society however he promised his friend to be in london within two days and as halliday besides covering the hundred and sixtyodd miles in short flights desired to practise aviation in the open spaces of the country before getting to the capital it was not needful for freddy to return to his business until fortyeight hours had passed this arrangement suited both the young men very well vincent who was now as hot in dans favor as he had been cold presided at the start and again and again went over various details in connection with the machine which was much dearer to him than any child could have been now that his objections had been set aside by the intervention of mrs jarsell the inventor was desperately anxious that dan should win the race as such a triumph would undoubtedly show the value of the newfangled biplane not that vincent wished for the money or even for the glory but he very greatly desired to show other inventors that he was their master his vanity being purely concerned with the result of nights and days of meditation could only be gratified by actual proof that he had conquered the air not entirely that is for vincent was far too thorough in his genius to believe that rome could be built in a day but at all events he trusted that his machine would reveal itself as the best that any man had yet constructed so far as that was concerned halliday accustomed to aviation believed that the sour old man had succeeded if i dont win the race it wont be your fault mr vincent dan assured him as he stepped into the pilots box and with this farewell speech the inventor expressed himself very well content he did not expect impossibilities and he saw that the man to whom he had entrusted his darling airship was both cool and enthusiastic qualities which go far toward complete success it was a calm day with scarcely any wind when dan began his flight and as the biplane could easily attain sixty miles an hour he would have had no difficulty in reaching london early in the afternoon but he did not make straight for the south but circled gradually down to rugby where he proposed to remain for the night dawdling in the air it was five hours before he alighted outside the town and feeling weary with the strain on his nervesfor the machine required dexterous handlinghe determined to rest without much difficulty he found a friendly farmer who was willing that the airship should be housed in an empty barn for the night when all was safe and halliday had arranged that no one should enter the barn he sought out a cheap inn on the borders of the place to rest for the night within watchingdistance of his craft next morning after breakfast he concluded to start again but after a visit to the barn to see that all was well he returned to the inn for an hour it was necessary he thought to consider the situation and his future plans and he wished for solitude to do so owing to his fatigue he had not been able to think much on the previous night before sleep overtook him the plan which dan intended to carry into effect when he reached town was to force penn into confessing what he actually knew concerning the perfume he had obviously spoken falsely as to his being its sole possessor in england since mrs jarsell had given the like scent to her old governess yet why should penn lie in this fashion unless there was some secret connected with the perfume which he desired to keep concealed and assuredly the scent had clung round the clothes of the dead man dan determined to force penn into confession and that could only be done by frightening him greatly to carry out this plan halliday wrote to the man asking him for an interview and when he cameas dan was certain he wouldintended in some way to inveigle him into taking a flight once penn was in the air his fears could be played upon to some purpose at least dan thought so and was eager to make the experiment of course the young man did not suspect mrs jarsell of being connected in any way with crime of any sort still it was strange that the perfume from sumatra should form a link between her and sir charles moon with penn intervening it was also strange that mrs pelgrin should hint that mrs jarsell had secrets she had not said as much in so many words but the general trend of her cautious conversation went to show that mrs jarsell was not entirely open and aboveboard the landlady had wondered where the owner of the grange got her money now why should she so wonder unless she had proofs that the said money was not come by honestly and why also should she in a quite unnecessary way mention her nephew who was the thawley station porterfriendly with mrs jarsell to such an extent that there was a chance of his getting a legacy ladies of wealth do not make friends of railway porters without reason and dan wished to learn the reason in this particular case by a diplomatic question he had ascertained from mrs pelgrin that her nephew was the sole sheepeak person employed at the station consequently he would naturally be the sole person who knew mrs jarsell and all about her therefore it was not impossible that the lady befriended the man so that he might not speak of her visits to town yet why should he not do so should mrs jarsells doings be entirely honest then there were three motor cars a quite unnecessary number for a lady to keep especially as according to her own story she went out little and spent most of her time in attending to miss armour on the whole although his suspicions were vague dan had an idea that mrs jarsells doings would not bear the light of day stilland especially since she had procured him the biplanehe would not have troubled about her rustic affairs save for the fact of the perfume it might beand this he hoped to discoverthat penns confession would show more plainly the link which connected mrs jarsell with the hampstead crime yet on the face of it the very idea seemed monstrous and dan scorned himself for his folly as he wrote the letter to penn nevertheless something stronger than himself drove him to post the letter afterwards to get the unpleasant taste of conspiring out of his mouth the young man wrote a loverlike epistle to lillian telling her about his capture of the aeroplane you and mrs bolstreath must come and see the start of the race at blackheath wrote dan and your mere presence will inspire me to do my very best to win so much hangs on my gaining this race as i want the money to prosecute the search for your fathers assassin then halliday left business for pleasure and telling lillian that he adored her to distraction urged her not to see too much of lord curberry finally he declared that he was hungering for a glimpse of her angel face and now that he was returning to london intended to call and see her despite the prohibition of sir john there was much more passionate writing to the same effect and the letter ended with sentiments of lively and lofty devotion if another man had written the letter dan would have smiled at its vehemence since the scribe cast himself under miss moons dainty feet to be trampled upon but as dan was the author of the epistle he only regretted that he could not say more ardent things than he had set down to such lengths does the passion of love carry the most matteroffact of men and halliday certainly prided himself upon being a very uptodate child of this materialistic age believing in nothing he could not see or touch or feel the letters having been posted and the bill paid and the black bag packed dan took his way to the barn of the friendly farmer he found quite a number of people before the great doors as the news that an aviator was in the neighborhood had spread rapidly the farmer did not wish to take any rent for the nights lodging of the aeroplane but as it had been guarded so carefully and was housed so comfortably halliday insisted on the man having some recompense for his kindness then with the assistance of three or four willing onlookers the machine was wheeled out into the meadow wherein the barn stood it was close upon midday when dan started and the spectators gasped with awe and delighted surprise when the biplane like a big dragonfly soared into the cloudy sky willing to give them pleasure since an airship was not a common sight in the neighborhood halliday did some fancy flying and circled and dipped and towered directly over the town before finally waving his hand in farewell a thin cry of many throats came to his ears as he sped southward and he was delighted to find how readily the machine answered to every motion of his hand he almost felt that he was riding on a live thing all nerves and energy so obedient was the craft to his will the machine was like a flying beetle the planes motionless to sustain the body like the front wings of the insect while the propeller spinning vigorously acted like the back wings to drive ahead dan had a faint idea of seeing some comparison of this sort in a magazine and wondered if vincent having seen it also had constructed his aeroplane on insect lines but he soon dropped all conjecture to attend strictly to his business which was to reach london as speedily as possible no very difficult task considering the swiftness of his vehicle it was convenient that dan should know a shed at blackheath where he could house his machine as lord curberrys house was in that neighborhood once on the spot it would be easy to have an interview with marcus penn and perhaps not difficult to induce him to take the air in the loft spaces of the sky the neighborhood was well known to halliday for his occupation of aviation brought him often there and he had experimented with various inventions at various times where the land afforded room for the departure and arrival of the machines therefore when he reached londons outskirts he made for blackheath and without difficulty brought the aeroplane to earth a stonethrow from the shed in question it said a great deal for the capabilities of the biplane that her pilot was enabled to strike his destination so exactly of course the usual concourse of people gathered when the great birdlike structure fluttered down from the sky but dan sent a messenger to the man who looked after the shed and soon had vincents masterpiece safely put away under lock and key as he had been practising flying and strenuously testing the qualities of the machine it was quite five oclock before he was free to do what he would as the distance from rugby was just over eighty miles he could have arrived much earlier had he wished but there was no need to do so and every need to accustom himself to handling the biplane easily in view of the great race when dan had given certain instructions to the man who looked after the shed and was responsible for the safety of the machine he walked across the heath to a comfortable inn where he was well known as he had put up at it many times previously it was here that he had appointed the meeting with marcus penn for the next morning but so eager was he to come face to face with the man and wring the truth out of him that he almost decided to walk to lord curberrys house which was two miles distant but a swift reflection that he could do nothing until the next morningsince penn had to be coaxed on to the aeroplane and certainly would decline a nightrundecided him to wait the black bull was a particularly comfortable hotel and the landlady supplied tasty dinners therefore halliday took the good the gods sent him and settled down for a quiet evening after a stroll to the shed to see that vincents creation was all right he returned to the inn and went to bed his nerves speedily relaxed and he slept deeply until nine oclock in the morning as he had invited penn to see him at eleven he had just time to take his breakfast comfortably read the newspaper and saunter out to take the fresh air before his visitor arrived marcus penn had not improved in looks since dan had last seen him his thin face was still yellow his hair and moustache still scanty and he appeared to be as nervous as ever when he sat down he looked apprehensively at halliday with his pale eyes and passed his tongue over his dry lips it seemed to the aviator that penns conscience was not quite at rest else he would scarcely look so scared whenon the face of itthere was no need to do so dan however soon set him at his ease which was the first necessary step towards gaining his confidence for unless that was gained he assuredly would not set foot on the aeroplane how are you getting along mr penn said halliday genially have a cigarette and something wet oh i forget you dont drink so early in the day i am glad you are up to time as i am just starting out on a fly really remarked the secretary eagerly i should like to see you make a start is your flyingmachine near at hand in the shed over yonder on the verge of the heath said dan jerking his head over his left shoulder but i daresay you wonder why i asked you to see me mr penn well erthat iseri did wonder a trifle hesitated the pale man and again looked anxious it has to do with your literary ambitions said halliday slowly penn flushed looking both relieved on learning why he had been summoned to the meeting and pleased that the subject should be of such personal interest what do you know of my literary ambitions he asked doubtfully all that miss moon could tell me said dan promptly and this was absolutely correct as lillian had long ago asked him to aid the secretary although he had never troubled about the matter until now yes i certainly did tell miss moon that i wished to become a novelist i found her sympathetic yes she would be she always is i suppose said dan darting off at a tangent that you are comfortable with lord curberry oh yes assented the man cheerfully i have good pay and little to do and lord curberry is very kind i have plenty of time to write my stories have you had any published no sighed penn sadly i have tried again and again to get some short tales printed but so far without success well then you know that i have a friendmr frederick laurancewho is on that newspaper the moment i suggest that you should send me some of your manuscripts for him to read if he approves of them he will see what he can do as he knows nearly every one of any note in the literary world oh you are too good i shall be delighted all the same penn hesitated and writhed why should you do this for me it is miss moon who is doing this for you rejoined halliday saying what was perfectly true she asked me to help you i suppose she comes sometimes to lord curberrys house oh yes said penn with a swift glance at him her uncle sir john and miss moon and mrs bolstreath dined with lord curberry last week i am afraid mr halliday added the secretary timidly that you will lose miss moon dan laughed cheerfully i dont think so why should i her uncle is very anxious for her to marry lord curberry who is also very desirous to make miss moon his wife that shows curberrys good taste said halliday rising and putting on his cap however she is to be my wife and curberry and sir john can go hang i should not be so sure mr halliday said penn in a mysterious manner when lord curberry wants anything he generally gets it he is crying for the moon just now said the other man making a pun and the moon is no mans property however i must go off to start for my flying practise i am going to compete in the london to york race next week come with me and see me start as to your stories you can send them to me at my old address which you knew when you were with sir charles i shall see mr laurance about them you are good murmured penn drawing a long breath and following dan out of the inn i am obliged to you to miss moon you mean she is the one who takes an interest in your literary efforts but come along and see my machine i got it from an inventor called vincent and dan turned suddenly to shoot an inquiring glance at his companion it occurred to him that penn might have heard the name since penn had the perfume as well as mrs jarsell who knew the inventor but evidently penn had not heard the name for he gave no sign of knowledge i hope it is a good machine he said innocently and weakly very good said halliday as they halted near the great doors of the shed a clipper why not try a fly with me oh penn shrank back i should be afraid nonsense man joked the aviator while the aeroplane was wheeled out and the usual crowd of onlookers began to gather as a literary man you ought to experience all sensation so as to write about it coming stories will be full of flyingmachines and airships isnt it dangerous asked penn looking at the delicate structure which appeared almost too fragile to sustain one person let alone two not at all especially if one doesnt do any fancy flying which i shall avoid if you come with me i should like to have the experience hesitated the secretary that is if you will not fly too high or too far ill take you across the heath and back again and will keep within a tolerably safe distance from the ground its tempting quavered penn wistfully while dan busied himself in getting things square please yourself rejoined halliday carelessly and satisfied that the timid man was nibbling at the bait i cant stay here all day he slipped into the pilots seat well well i really think i should likewhere am i to sit in this place dan touched a spring and the pilot box of aluminium lengthened out so that there was room for two people this was one of vincents improvements upon which he prided himself as the vehicle could by adjusting the closedin car seat two people or one as the need arose but dont come if you feel the least fear those of the idle spectators close at hand grinned at penns pale face and he was stung into accepting hastily what he would have rejected in a cooler moment i am not afraid he said trying to steady his voice and with an air of bravado he stepped in beside the aviator oh i say he gasped and no wonder dan did not give him a moment to change his mind having captured his prey he intended to keep him so set the engine going almost before penn was comfortably seated in less time than it takes to tell the aeroplane whirled along the ground swiftly and lifted herself gracefully upward penn gasped again and glanced down at the sinking ground where the spectators were already beginning to grow smaller but the motion of the biplane was so easy and the face of her pilot was so composed that after the first thrill of terror penn began to feel that flying was not such a very dangerous pastime as he had imagined wonderful wonderful he murmured as the great artificial bird glided smoothly through the air but dontdont go too high mr halliday i shall go high enough to smash you said dan coolly he was circling in swallow flights round the heath now high now low now swift now slow and had the machine so entirely under command that he was enabled to give a certain amount of his attention though not all to his companion penn gasped again and his terror revived smash me oh he almost shrieked yes said dan not looking since he had to watch where he was going but speaking rapidly and clearly all the same i want to know the truth about that perfume about the sumatra perfume you told me was possessed alone by you that was a lie and you know it was a lie iii dont know anything more about it whimpered the secretary yes you do out with the truth said dan relentlessly if you dont i shall drop you overboard to smash like an egg penn clung to his seat desperately that would be murder i daresay but i shouldnt suffer accidents will happen in aeroplanes you know you are like mahomets coffin slung between heaven and earth and overboard mahomets coffin will go in a few minutes unless dan swerved the machine which tilted slightly and penn went green with terror whatwhatwhat do you want to know he wailed as the biplane dipped nearly to earth to sweep upward in a graceful curve who is mrs jarsell ioh lordi dont know you do she has this perfume also has it anything to do with a gang yes yes penns teeth were chattering and the sinking motion made him sick what has it to do with a gang itsits aa sign was sir charles murdered by this gang i dont knowi dont know oh penn screamed and clutched again at the side of the car you do this false mrs brown belonged to the gang i cant say i darent tell you if i say anything i shall die you shall die if you dont say what i want you to say said dan between his teeth and again the machine dipped and towered ill tilt you out i swear if you dont tell me who murdered sir charles i dont know i tell you cried penn desperately the perfume has to do with a society of people whowhobut i darent speak i should be killed i have said too much as it is and if you reveal what i have said you will be killed also i dont care is mrs jarsell connected with this gang i dont know mrs jarsell said penn sullenly although his terrified face showed that he was nearly frightened out of his wits do you belong to this started dan when a sudden action of penn took him by surprise in endeavoring to frighten the man he had flown too low and the aeroplane was only six feet off the ground preparing to swing skyward again the secretary in desperation flung himself sideways out of the machine as it curved at the lowest and fell heavily on the herbage of the heath dan could not stop to see if he was safe or hurt but soared aloft again to a considerable height circling widely he came sailing directly over the spot where the secretary had tumbled out in his desperate endeavor to escape already the man had picked himself up and was limping off toward the town as quickly as he was able now said dan grimly to himself he will have me arrested for attempted murder thats all right and he chuckled although not entirely successful in his endeavor to make penn confess chapter x another mystery in his anxiety to learn the truth dan was perfectly willing to be arrested on whatever charge penn might wish to bring against him after all publicity was what he chiefly aimed at and if he gave his reasons for threatening the secretary he felt confident that the man would find it difficult to clear his character certainly halliday had not intended to take penns life and had not the man been such a coward he would have simply laughed at the idea of being tilted out of the machine but his nerves shaken by the possible danger had given way and he had said much which he would have preferred to keep locked up in his heart but that the aeroplane by dipping so low had afforded penn the chance of escape at the risk of a rough fall he would have spoken at greater length and yet after turning the matter over in his own mind dan could not be sure of this but this much halliday had learned a gang assuredly existed and the perfume was a sign of recognition amongst the members who apparently followed each others trails by scent penn declined to say if his late employer had been done to death by the fraternity but the perfume on the dead mans clothes answered this question very positively also the secretary had denied that the false mrs brown belonged to the gang a statement which was absurd as undoubtedly she was the emissary employed to bring about the death finally the fact that mrs jarsell used the sumatra scent brought her into connection with the hampstead crime whatever penn might say dan felt that he had struck a trail which would end in the capture of moons assassin and the breaking up of a dangerous organization on reflection he concluded that penn would have said very little more even though face to face with what he believed to be imminent death he had hinted sufficiently to show that revelation was dangerous not only to himself but to halliday for if the gang learned that their secret was betrayed it was certain that death would be portioned out to the man who heard as well as to the man who spoke on this assumption dan felt confident that penn would take no action in the matter and would probably hold his tongue about the adventure if he told any of the gang to which he presumably belonged he would have to admit that he had betrayed the secret of the perfume in which case he would assuredly be killed by his unscrupulous associates the death of dan as the young man believed would follow but he also believed that by taking care of his own skin penn would remove any risk of vengeance following himself therefore he was not surprised when he heard nothing from penn or of penn during the days that passed before the morning of the great race meanwhile he detailed the conversation to laurance that young gentleman had returned to town with some regret since mildred vincent was not by his side but to assure himself of an early marriage by securing a steady income he flung himself into journalistic work with redoubled energy working night and day to gain an increased salary he was in his office employed on a political article when dan presented himself and was not overpleased to give up even a moment of his precious time in fact he grumbled i wish you would come after business hours halliday he said testily oh fudge retorted dan lightly a journalist hasnt any business hours like a king he is always in harness why do you require me to tell you such elementary truths freddy i have an important article to write well then you can write it in ten minutes or so i shant keep you long laurance pushed away his writing paper leaned back in his chair and reached for a cigarette what is it then he asked resignedly dan paced the office and related his adventure so you see old son that the perfume is of great importance as i always suspected laurance nodded gravely it appears so but if what you think is true would the man have disclosed a secret dangerous to his own safety people will disclose anything when on the rack replied dan with a shrug and the aeroplane was my rack the fool really believed that i would tilt him overboard and therefore said what he did say to save his confounded skin if he had not escaped so cleverly he would have admitted more i doubt it from the hint he gave if it was death for him not to confess to you because you could kill him it was equally death for him to speak if his associates are prepared to murder him for babbling however we are now certain that the gang alluded to by sir charles does exist undoubtedly he was got out of the way since he knew too much it is a pity he did not reveal his knowledge to durwin he intended to do so but was murdered before durwin arrived as we know by the way durwin is as keen as we are over this search i met him the other day and he said that he was hunting everywhere for evidence why not tell him what you have learned dan he can make penn speak out penn wont speak further denied dan abruptly i think as it is he dreads the vengeance of his comrades durwin belongs to scotland yard and has powers to drive penn into a corner so he may be able to force confession i think you should consult with durwin about the matter after the race then why not before the race which does not take place for a couple of days i dont like doing things in a hurry said halliday uneasily i want to question mrs jarsell and see if she knows anything if she does which is doubtful she will assuredly refuse to speak so far i see no connection between her and the gang you forget the perfume hm yes said laurance meditatively perhaps you are right i want to have more evidence before i can give an opinion but since penn told you so much arent you in danger from the gang yourself dan i think not penn for his own sake will hold his tongue at all events he has not moved so far that doesnt say he wont move i should examine that aeroplane very carefully before the race if i were you oh ill do that i know the machine thoroughly by this time and if it has been tampered with i shall soon spot the trickery well now that i have brought you up to date with my information i shall leave you to work one moment is miss moon going to see you start for york yes i got a letter from her this morning she and mrs bolstreath come to the aviation ground with lord curberry confound him and with a frown dan took his leave he was anything but amiably disposed towards his rival everything was quiet as regards the criminal business for the next two days as penn made no attempt to punish dan for the fright he had given him halliday himself was much too eager over the race to trouble about the matter but he kept a sharp eye on the vincent machine still stored at blackheath so as to guard against any tampering the start was to take place at blackheath and on the appointed day five competitors were on the spot surrounded by a large crowd of curious people anxious to witness the conquest of the air amongst those present was durwin who pushed his way to where dan was looking over his aeroplane the aviator did not see the lean keeneyed man until he was touched on the elbow is it all right halliday asked durwin nodding toward the machine perfect shes a beauty and it wont be her fault if i dont lift york minster before sunset what are you doing here mr durwin i didnt know that you took an interest in aviation i take an interest in this search for moons assassin said durwin drily but in low tones laurance saw me and related your discovery i am looking about for marcus penn and intend to ask him questions he may be on the ground said dan glancing around since lord curberrys place is a stonethrow away but he wont speak ill make him speak said durwin with a grim look well i hope youll win halliday when you return to town look me up i may have something to tell you and he moved away with a significant look dan could not leave his machine or he would have followed as there were several questions which he greatly desired to ask the day was cold and dry with few clouds and a good deal of sunshine so the conditions for the race were fairly good the wind was rather high and that vexed the aviators as the art of flying is not yet so perfect as to control the winds when they are overstrong however to go against these strong aircurrents would be an excellent test of the qualities of the various machines the start was to take place at one oclock and the competitors hoped to reach their destination before five oclock some of the aeroplanes could travel at forty miles an hour others at fifty but so far as dan knew his was the sole machine which could gather sixtymilesanhour speed if vincent could be believed the aeroplane ought to travel the hundred and eightyodd miles if the conditions were tolerably good in a trifle over three hours dan now having perfect mastery of the biplane hoped to accomplish the wonderful journey in a shorter space of time but this hope had yet to be verified meanwhile having seen that all was in order he turned to speak to lillian who had just come up accompanied by mrs bolstreath lord curberry was in attendance and in the distance dan caught a glimpse of the yellowfaced secretary looking unhappy and nervous oh dan i do hope you will win cried lillian who looked extremely pretty but more than a trifle anxious it does seem so dangerous to fly in such a light machine shes the best i have yet struck dan assured her dont you think shes as perfect as lillian mrs bolstreath the elderly lady laughed and cast a sideglance at curberry to see how he took hallidays complimentary speech well i suppose you cannot think of anything prettier to say i have heard of a woman being compared to a gazelle and to a ship but never to a flyingmachine mr halliday is very up to date in his compliments said curberry with a slight sneer he was a tall biliouslooking man with pale blue eyes and a thinlipped sinister mouth not at all prepossessing in appearance although immaculate in dress dan laughed being confident that lillian would never marry this spectre he could afford to laugh we young people he said with emphasis go with the times lord curberry meaning that i belong to the past generation retorted the other with a flash in his pale eyes you will find that i dont in some ways and he glanced significantly at lillian mrs bolstreath looked nervous but miss moon was supremely indifferent she did not care for lord curberry and in spite of her uncles advocacy had not the slightest idea of marrying the man therefore she ignored him as consistently as she could considering the way he thrust himself into her company without taking notice of this passageatarms she began to question her lover about the airship and gathered quite a stock of information before the start curberry being ignorant of aviation was out of the picture as the saying goes so fumed and fretted and looked daggers at dan it took all mrs bolstreaths diplomacy to keep him in a moderately good temper luckily laurance strolled up notebook in hand as he was reporting for the moment and greeted the party gaily he knew curberry slightly and nodded to him without any word or salutation in common with many other people freddy did not like the man who was by no means a popular character isnt it a splendid day for the race miss moon said laurance casting an upward glance at the grey sky i look forward to chronicling dans triumph in the moment tomorrow morning well old fellow he slapped halliday jovially on the back are you prepared for what jules verne would call the very greatest journey of the century the century is yet young replied dan drily and its only one hundred and eighty odd miles i have to travel considering that aviators have reached a successful distance of five hundred miles this race is a trifle well said lord curberry trying to be amiablea hard task for him seeing how much lillian was taken up with the hero of the momentaviation has certainly accomplished wonders since santos dumont took his flight of ten yards some four years ago oh you do know something about aviation lord curberry said dan coolly i know that it is dangerous mr halliday oh dan lillian grew pale knowing what the spiteful speech meant i think flying looks more dangerous than it is said dan with a reassuring glance and miss moon has come here to be my mascot you will wire your safe arrival as soon as you get to york said mrs bolstreath anxiously oh every one will wire cried freddy taking out his fieldglass the telegraph offices will be kept hard at work all the night as sure as i stand here mrs bolstreath dan will be the richer tomorrow by if he is safe i shall be content breathed lillian and she looked as though she would have kissed dan then and there in spite of the presence of the crowd and lord curberry that unsuccessful suitor scowled and was about to make one of his acid speeches when those authorities arranging the race came to declare that all was ready for the start already the cinematographs were at work taking pictures of the crowd and the machines and their various pilots policemen drove back the throng to some distance so that the aeroplanes might have a clear space to run in and just as the hour of one sounded the start was made amidst a breathless silence the aeroplanes ran along the ground like startled hens and sprang into the air at various points the eyes of the people from looking level now began to stare upward at the diminishing dots which towered and raced for the north a zigzag monoplane was leading but lillian had only eyes for dans craft freddy gave her his fieldglasses so that she might get a better view three of the aeroplanes bunched but two circled away some distance in wide arcs and of the two one machine belonged to dan the onlookers saw him increase the speed of his propeller and then like an arrow from the bow he sped swiftly out of sight in a straight line a cheer rose from the throng as the vincent airship was leading by some lengths and lillian gave freddy back his glasses i hope hell come back safe she said with quivering lip of course he will laurance assured her dan is one of the most cautious aviators we have but there is always a risk sneered lord curberry probably only a brave man would take the risk you dont fly yourself mr laurance as you see was the calm reply as curberrys enmity was too paltry to trouble about well miss moon we cant see anything more so i suppose you will go home miss moon is coming to luncheon with me said lord curberry and mrs bolstreath also i am very hungry said that lady pensively so i dont say hallo interrupted laurance as a clamor arose on the outskirts of the now fast diminishing crowd whats the matter in the interests of my paper i must see what is taking place and with a hasty raising of his hat to the ladies he left them to the care of lord curberry as he pushed his way toward the commotion he heard a voice asking if the man was quite dead and fancied that someone must have fallen down in a fit but when he broke through the ring of policemen and beheld durwin lying on the ground with staring eyes and a ghastly expressionless face the sight so startled him that he caught a constables arm whats all this he demanded hoarsely is mr durwin dead durwin echoed the policeman sharply do you know the gentleman of course he is mr durwin one of the scotland yard officials i wonder you dont know that i never heard of him sir he must belong to the detective department whats the matter with him has he had a fit hes been murdered said the constable shortly murdered laurance stared at the man in a horrified manner and his thoughts flew to the gang which he and dan and durwin were trying to root out was this another crime similar to that committed at hampstead when sir charles was killed for knowing too much is there a fly on him asked the reporter hastily see if theres a fly a fly the policeman evidently thought the speaker was crazy what has a fly to do with the matter heres the inspector who was sent for some time ago you had better speak to him sir laurance did so and advanced toward the soldierlylooking official who made his appearance in a low and rapid voice laurance hastily explained that the prone man was mr durwin of scotland yard and also handed the inspector his own card meanwhile a doctor was examining the body and found that the deceased had been murdered by having a dagger thrust under his left shoulderblade he was quite dead and must have passed away almost immediately the blow was delivered the inspector received this uncompromising statement with natural surprise and knelt down beside the corpse to verify the declaration there was no doubt that the medical man spoke the truth for a stream of blood stained the back of durwins coat and had soaked into the ground the thrust must have been made with a very sharp instrument and was undoubtedly delivered with great force who knows anything of this demanded the inspector rising and looking at the awestruck faces of the crowd sharply a slim ladylike girl stepped forward i was standing close to the gentleman she explained nervously and we were all looking at the airships as they went away i heard him give a gasp and when i turned at the sound he was slipping to the ground thats all i know did you see any one strike him no i didnt how could i when with the rest i was staring at the airships going away the gentleman was staring also i think but of course i didnt take much notice of him as he was a stranger to me i saw him fall put in a rough man something like a navvy he was crushed up against me in the crowd and i felt him tumbling i heard him gurgle too and heard this young lady cry out then i saw him on the ground and pushed back the folk saying there was a cove dying but i didnt think it was murder ended the man shuddering nor did i chimed in the slim girl i fancied it was a fit im sure we were all so crushed up with the lot of people that i shouldnt have been surprised if he had taken a fit this was all that could be learned and the inspector took the names and addresses of the two who had spoken there were other people who had noted the man on the ground but these were the sole ones to see the fall they had as it were almost caught the assassin redhanded but it was impossible to say who was guilty for the throng was so dense and every ones attention had been so earnestly fixed skyward on the airships that no one could say who had struck down the unfortunate gentleman the inspector was much impressed when he learned the identity of the dead man once or twice he had received official letters from durwin but he had never set eyes on him until he beheld him dead but for laurance he would not have known who he was and therefore questioned that young gentleman closely when the body was carried by four policemen off the ground to the nearest place where it could be placed under shelter and what about this fly asked the inspector who had heard of the question from the policeman who laurance had first addressed dont you remember the case of sir charles moon yes the woman who killed him was never discovered i remember about the fly and also i remember the letters written to that newspaper of yours i wrote the first letter that brought forth the correspondence said freddy quickly sir charles had some idea that a gang of criminals was in existence and invited mr durwin to his house to explain before mr durwin arrived sir charles was murdered since then he had been looking into the matter and i believe that he also learned too much you think that this gang you mention had him put out of the way yes i do and that is why i asked if there was a fly on him its the trademark of these devils i fancy well there didnt appear to be any fly on him said the inspector in an uneasy tone all the same i think your idea is right moon was murdered because he knew too much and mr durwin has been got out of the way for the same reason at least i think so however we shall learn more between this and the inquest you will attend mr laurance of course i am only too anxious to find out all i can about this dangerous gang it must be broken up the breaking up will be attended with considerable danger said the inspector in a very dry tone then he noted freddys address and let him go laurance returned to the office of the moment and hastily wrote his description of the start for the london to york race after which he saw the editor and related what he knew about the death of durwin permitted to write the article dealing with the subject laurance gave a concise account and although he did not say too much yet hinted very plainly that the death of the scotland yard official was connected indirectly with the murder of sir charles moon remembering that penn was now lord curberrys secretary and that lord curberrys house was near the aviation ground freddy wondered if penn had been amidst the crowd dan could have told him that he had been but at present laurance did not know this however he had a shrewd idea that as penn was connected with one murder he was probably connected with the other then freddy cursed himself for not having observed if there was any special perfume hanging about the dead mans clothes as he did not know the particular smell of the sumatra scent he could not say if it was the one dan had traced to mrs jarsell but if there was any scent at all it was worth while looking into the matter to repair his negligence he finished writing the articlewhich was very shortand then started for blackheath to view the corpse again as he was leaving the office of the paper a telegram was put into his hand it proved to be from dan and had been sent from bedford had an accident ran the wire rudder broke no bones broken but shaken by fall i return this evening to town and will call halliday now i wonder murmured laurance when he read the telegram if that machine was tampered with after all if so the gang must be getting scared first moon then durwin now an attempt on dans life by jove ill be the next the idea was by no means a pleasant one chapter xi on the trail when dan looking rather pale and sick presented himself at the moment office late that same evening the first question laurance put to him was relative to the accident was your machine tampered with asked freddy in a breathless manner and the second almost the door was closed no it wasnt replied halliday sinking with a tired sigh into the nearest chair i was making a quick turn and the rudder gave way i put too great a strain on it and came fluttering to the ground like a shot partridge that was a few miles beyond bedford however i had the aeroplane dismounted and packed away in a village close at hand then after a rest caught the express to st pancras you got my wire yes and i fancied this tumble must be the work of the gang not a bit of it my bad flying thats all well i have lost the race and the man who flew the zigzag monoplane has won though he took his own time in arriving at york a dashed bad machine i think he had even though its come out top for the time being im a bit shaken and feel sick but a nights rest will put me square why didnt you go straight home and get it inquired freddy anxiously for there was no denying that dan looked considerably fagged i read about this death of durwin in a late edition of an evening paper and couldnt rest until i knew the truth the paper only gave a hint tell me what you know laurance did so and then handed halliday a proof of his article on the subject which was to appear in the morning issue of the moment he supplemented the same with further information i went down to see if there was any scent on the clothes of the corpse he explained its still at blackheath you know in charge of the inspector theres no perfume anyhow and no fly no i asked that the moment i saw durwin stretched out on the ground if this crime is the work of the gang the signmanual is absent all the same it is the work of the gang i truly believe remarked dan in grim tones durwin has been on the hunt and very probably since he discovered the death of moon first of all he has been watched one of the gang got behind him in the crowd and knifed him in the crush it would be perfectly easy for the assassin to slip away without being noticed since every one was watching the flight of the aeroplanes laurance nodded i agree with you but who is the assassin well said dan reflectively i saw penn on the ground the deuce you did cried freddy jumping up did he dont be in too great a hurry he seems to me much too nervous a man to handle this job but he belongs to the gang insisted laurance sharply he has as good as admitted that much by what he said of the perfume oh yes i believe he has something to do with the association which by the way appears to be a kind of jointstock company like that one mentioned by balzac in his story histoire des treize and oh hang your literary references interrupted freddy anxiously pacing the office do you believe that penn struck the blow no i dont the gang must have better men than he to strike or women muttered laurance thinking of the false mrs brown however since penn was in the crowd and is plainly in the secret of the gang dont you think we ought to tell the blackheath inspector about the matter and also inspector tenson who had charge of the hampstead crime no said dan after a pause if penn is arrested and questioned he will say nothing as he hinted he would be killed if he gave away the gang so as he wouldnt split when i threatened him on the aeroplane he certainly wont speak out if questioned by the police and we havent got enough evidence to prove his complicity remember better keep silence freddy and let the police fog out this crime alone meanwhile we can look round and keep an eye on penn after some argument laurance agreed to act as his friend suggested it was no doubt the wiser course to take no action until absolute proof could be procured that the secretary was a member of the gang also if penn were arrested the organization might break up and scatter out of sheer alarm in which case all the villains would not be caught dan deemed it best to work quietly until the whole of the scoundrels could be netted and to do so it was necessary to preserve silence thus it came about that at the inquest on durwin nothing came to light likely to connect this crime with the preceding one the hint given by freddy in the moment was not taken and indeed was laughed at there was neither perfume nor fly on the corpse of the unfortunate man and consequently no link between blackheath and hampstead an open verdict was brought in and durwin was buried without the truth becoming known in any detail then a new sensation took up the attention of the public nevertheless both dan and his friend were convinced that darwin having learned too much had been done to death by the gang for its own safety in the same way as sir charles moon had been put out of the way they employed a private detective to watch penn but gave him no hint that they suspected him in any way through penn who was the sole person they knew for certainand on the evidence of the perfume was connected with the gangthey hoped to arrive at the truth but the time was not yet ripe for questioning him as regarded his nefarious doings but they kept him well in sight so as to watch the path he took in life there was no doubt that by following the same they would arrive at a gathering of the dangerous persons whose association threatened to disintegrate society as dan quoting balzacs fiction had observed it was ferragus and his fellowconspirators in a modern setting dan having lost the race and consequently the was short of funds and laurance not being rich could not lend him any money however the two managed to borrow a certain sum from a grasping moneylender which supplied the sinews of war for the time being halliday had the vincent aeroplane brought to blackheath again and made some money in his usual way by taking various people trips for short distances aviation was now quite a society craze especially for ladies desirous of a new sensation so dan did extremely well a few months later he intended to attempt a crosschannel flight for which a french millionaire was offering a large prize but in the meantime he got along as best he could nothing happened for a week or two likely to stir up the muddy water which concealed the doings of the gang and there were no new murders then dan took lillian to a cinematograph exhibition and made a discovery of course lillian was profoundly grieved that her lover should have lost the race but comforted herself with the reflection that he was safe had she been able she would have interdicted dan from trying further flights especially in the face of the many accidents which were occurring in connection with aviation all over the world dan however laughed at her fears and insisted upon continuing his dangerous vocation nevertheless he promised in a moment of tenderness to give up aviation when he and lillian were married though at present affairs in this direction did not look bright as yet dan had discovered very little likely to lead to the detection of moons assassin and until that individual was brought to justice sir john would never consent to the match the course of true love in these dark days was by no means running as smoothly as the pair desired lord curberry haunted sir john moons house and pestered lillian with undesired attentions until she was openly rude to him but this did not at all damp his ardor he merely smiled acidly and continued to send flowers and theatre seats and lastly articles of jewelry which she declined to accept and always sir john was at her elbow croaking out what a lucky girl she was to attract the attention of the peer with her money and his title to say nothing of his talents the marriage would be an ideal one lillian did not think so and with the obstinacy of a woman in love with the wrong person preferred to think of and long for dan halliday more than that with the connivance of mrs bolstreath who was heart and soul with the poor suitor lillian contrived to meet him at various times and enjoy herself not a little on these occasions they were like children let loose from an oversevere nursery sometimes mrs bolstreath came as chaperon and sometimes knowing that dan was a gentleman she allowed them to be together alone which naturally they liked much better but on the whole and so that no one might talk the goodnatured smiling woman followed their restless footsteps to restaurants and theatresmatinees that iseven to cinematographs it was at one of these last entertainments that dan received a shock on this particular occasion mrs bolstreath was not with them as she had gone shopping in regent street an appointment had been made by her to meet lillian and dan at five when the trio intended to have afternoontea in new bond street meantime as it was only three oclock the lovers had the whole of london to themselves the day was rather fine so lillian proposed to go to the unfashionable spaces of the park where she was not likely to meet with any acquaintance dan was willing and they walked along piccadilly in a leisurely manner then lillian stumbled on a biograph theatre and read the programme when she saw that a set of pictures represented the aviation ground at blackheath and the start for the london to york race nothing would serve her whim but that she must go in and see the film dan was willing to oblige her as he also was curious to see himself in a movingpicture therefore they soon found themselves being guided by an attendant with an electrictorch through the warm darkness of the hall to a couple of wellcushioned seats the performance was a continuous one the pictures repeating themselves again and again so the lovers arrived in the middle of an interesting story of which they did not know the beginning anxious to see what had gone before lillian exacted a promise from her complaisant swain that they should wait until the repetition dan agreed but reminded her that this delay would mean no walk in the park never mind said lillian slipping her hand into his under cover of the friendly twilight we can stay here until we meet bolly in new bond street you know i adore cinematographs and me also i hope insinuated dan to which the answer was a friendly and very emphatic squeeze as is usual with such entertainments the pictures were a mixture of comedy and tragedy so as not to dwell too long on one note but lillian in an impatient mood waited anxiously for the aviation scenes these were in due time thrown on the screen and the girl gave a little cry of pleasure when she saw dan tinkering at his aeroplane every gesture being faithfully reproduced halliday himself was greatly amused by this resurrection of his doings and felt an odd feeling at coming face to face with himself in this way but he started greatly surprised for in front of the crowd and disproportionately large in comparison with the rest of the figures he beheld the massive form of mrs jarsell moving across the illuminated picture she even paused to look round at someone in the mob so he had a distinct front view of her powerful face there could be no mistake as she was a singularly noticeable woman and when she finally passed away from the screen he sat wondering at the odd chance which had shown him that she had been on the blackheath aviation ground on the very day and about the very time durwin had met with his mysterious death her presence suggested the possession of the sumatra scent perfume which in its turn recalled penns ownership of the same and the scent of the dead sir charles moons clothes more than ever dan was convinced that mrs jarsell was connected with the gang and therefore with the two tragedies which were perplexing justice he was glad that he had promised to wait for the repetition and when lillian wished to go after she had seen the start of the picture which had met them halffinished on their entrance dan urged her to stop and witness the aviation scenes once more it is so amusing to see ones self in this way said dan artfully lillian pouted i wish i could have been taken also she said with a sigh of pleasure and willingly consented to wait the second view convinced halliday absolutely that he was right it was mrs jarsell who moved so royally across the screen and what puzzled him was that she appeared to be well dressed without any attempt at disguise yet if she had come to blackheath bent upon crime she would surely have worn a veil so as not to be noticed still mrs jarsell living a secluded life at sheepeak would not be known to any one in london and might not think it necessary to disguise herself in any way moreover if by chance she was recognized through any possible disguise such a thing would mean the asking of leading questions however there was no doubt that she had been on the aviation ground when durwin was murdered and dan determined to go that same night to sheepeak and make inquiries he was very silent when at the afternoon tea with the ladies but lillian chattered enough for two and gave mrs bolstreath a vivid account of the animated pictures the companion certainly did hint that halliday was not quite himself but he averted further inquiries by saying that he had a headache then he took leave of the pair and went to see what train he could catch to thawley being in so great a hurry that he did not even call on freddy laurance to acquaint him with his wonderful discovery thus halliday most unexpectedly found himself standing on the thawley station platform a few minutes after nine oclock as he had left st pancras by the six oclock express it was now too late to travel by the local to beswick for when he reached that place there was the long hill to climb to sheepeak and the peacock hotel would probably be closed by the time he got to his destination dan therefore decided to remain in thawley for the night and secured a bed at an hotel near the station early next morning he came to look for george pelgrin with whom he wished to talk and had no difficulty in finding him a brotherporter brought the man to him and handing over his bag halliday requested to be led to the platform whence the beswick local departed then he began to ask artful questions pelgrin was a big bovine creature with sleepy blue eyes and a slow ponderous manner which argued small intelligence dan wondered why a clever woman like mrs jarsell should interest herself in such a creature and to find out cautiously introduced the ladys name i was staying at your aunts hotel in sheepeak some time ago said dan as george carried his bag over the bridge and she told me that you are quite a favorite with my friend mrs jarsell of the hall aye grinned george amiably that i be sir i come from sheepeak and mrs jarsell she takes interest in sheepeak folk send for george she says when coming to london and i puts her straight as she likes she comes to town pretty often i expect said halliday lightly which is all the better for your pocket why no said pelgrin thoughtfully she dont go away much from sheepeak not even to come to thawley once in a few months she goes to london to see things george she says im going to look up friends or george im after lawyers business this day she says oh shes good to me and aunt marian is mrs jarsell i wish shed come to london oftener ended george in dismal tones for she gives me halfacrown always and dont come as often as id like seeing as i wants money ah shes a stayathome commented halliday looking after that friend of hers miss armour she is agreed george well she has been a good friend to me said the other man shuffling into a firstclass compartment for she got me an aeroplane from mr vincent aye said pelgrin i know him crosspatch he is sir i think so too but mrs jarsell promised to come to london and see me in the london to york race you heard of it i suppose aye that i did said pelgrin and mentioned the exact date wed a heap of traffic that day folk going to york to see them airships arrive but mrs jarsell wasnt one of them sir she wouldnt go to york but to london she didnt go nowhere said george doggedly on that day anyhow send for george she always says and on the day of that flyingrace send for me she did not so she stayed at home i reckon oh dan looked disappointed i did so want her to see me flying in this race pelgrin since she got mr vincent to give me the aeroplane well she didnt see you sir for she never went to london on that day early or late i swear she dont go much away from sheepeak and hasnt been thereto london that is sirfor months and she always tips me half a crown ended george once more dan took the hint and handed over the money there you are and i hope mrs jarsell will travel oftener so that you may become rich aye i need money me being engaged as it were said pelgrin with a grin touching his forelock and he went on explaining his private affairs which had to do with a girl until the train steamed out of the station dan was puzzled according to the cinematograph mrs jarsell had certainly been in town on the day of the race yet this yokel swore that she had not travelled from the thawley station yet there was no other route by which she could come of course according to mrs pelgrin the woman owned three motors and could go to london in that way there was just a chance that she might have done so but dan did not know how he was to find out it would be no use asking mrs jarsell as she would deny having been out of sheepeak yet since she was wholly undisguised on the blackheath ground why should she deny her identity it might be that she would admit having gone to the big citysay by motorand would defy him to credit her with the death of durwin not that dan would be foolish enough to accuse her of the same as he had no evidence to go upon save the fact of the perfume and that was a weak reed upon which to lean mrs pelgrin might know something however and to mrs pelgrin he determined to apply for information at the end of his journey and when he arrived in a ramshackle fly he was welcomed by her as usualthat is she bounced out of the inn and placing her arms akimbo smiled grimly oh so you are here again she said in exactly the same way in which she had greeted laurance yes said halliday readily having his excuse cut and dried i lost the flying race and have come to apologize to mr vincent for misusing his machine i only want a midday meal as i leave again this afternoon you shall have your dinner snapped mrs pelgrin leading the way into the inn after dan had arranged for the driver of the trap to wait for three or four hours so you didnt win that race aye mr vincent will be rare mad with you thinking what he does of those kites he makes halliday sat down in the wellremembered room and laughed the fortune of war mrs pelgrin but i am sorry i lost the race mrs jarsell who got me the aeroplane will also be disappointed did she tell you about the start eh man would a lady like her come chattering to a humble body like me was the landladys reply as she laid the table rapidly not that she saw the race mind you mr halliday oh but she must have replied dan with pretended surprise she promised to come and see me start from blackheath she did not go to london persisted mrs pelgrin her eyes becoming angry at the contradiction i mind that well because she came to see me about some eggs on the very day you were flying and says she it will be a good day for mr vincents machine to win the race are you sure asked dan more puzzled than ever to find that the stories of mrs pelgrin and her nephew were in accordance with one another do you take me for a fool cried mrs pelgrin her sallow face becoming a fiery red am i not telling you again and again that mrs jarsell never went to see your rubbishy race she came here to get some eggs from me and sat in this very room at nine oclock or a little after you take me for a liar youyouoh ill best see to the dinner or ill lose my temper and the sharptongued woman having already lost it bounced out of the room mrs jarsell was here at nine oclock or a little after repeated dan in a wondering tone then she could not have been in london all the same i swear i saw her on that cinematograph here he opened his bag and took out an abc to see the trains from thawley to london an examination showed him that even if mrs jarsell had left thawley station at nine oclock exactly she would not have reached st pancras until twelvefive this would scarcely give her time to arrive at blackheath the aeroplanes had started in the race at one oclock and according to the evidence at the inquest the people had been looking at them flying northward at the moment durwin was stabbed mrs jarsell could not have arrived on the ground by one oclock if she only got to st pancras at midday and then to do that she would have been obliged to leave thawley at nine oclock according to george she had not been near the station on that day and if mrs pelgrin was to be believed she was in the very room he now occupied at the hour when the express departed it was clearly impossible that she could have got to thawley for the nine oclock train let alone it being impossible that had she caught the express she could have arrived in london to execute the crime by one oclock or a trifle later yet on the other hand was the evidence of mrs pelgrin and her nephew while on the other hand was the evidence of the cinematograph one or the other must assuredly be wrong of course the landlady and george might be telling lies but on the face of it there was no need for them to do so moreover as dan had sprung his questions on them unexpectedly they could not have been ready with false answers she must have used a motorcar thought halliday restoring the abc to his bag yet even so she was here at nine oclock and could not have reached town in the three hours and odd minutes d it mrs pelgrin brought in the dinner with compressed lips and showed small disposition to chatter anxious not to arouse her suspicions by asking any further questions dan began to talk of other matters and gradually she became more friendly he told her that he had employed george and had given him halfacrown since the mention of money appeared to melt her into civility more than did anything else mrs pelgrin smiled grimly and observed that george was a grasping hound an amiable speech which did not argue that she was on the best of terms with the sleepyeyed man at thawley station after dan had learned indirectly all he could from her he sought out vincents cottage only to learn that the inventor and his niece were absent for the day as he could frame no excuse to visit mrs jarsell there was nothing left for him to do but to travel back to town therefore he found himself once more in st pancras station comparatively early in the evening wondering what was the solution of this new problem chapter xii an amazing adventure next day dan went to look up laurance and have a consultation as he was considerably puzzled over the new problem and did not know exactly how to act but fate was against him so far as having a second opinion was concerned for laurance proved to be absent an anarchistic plot of which the moment desired to know the details had taken him to vienna and it was probable that he would not return for at least a week halliday might have expected something of the sort as in the prosecution of his business freddy was here there and everywhere never knowing his next destination which depended entirely on the latest sensation but hitherto few startling events had summoned laurance out of england and dan had been accustomed to always finding him on the spot for a consultation he left the office of the moment in a rather disconsolate frame of mind there was no doubt that halliday badly needed someone to talk to about the matters which occupied his thoughts but failing freddy who was working with him he did not know any one worth consultinganyone that is whose advice would be worth taking certainly there were the two inspectors of policeone at hampstead and one at blackheathwho were deeply interested in the respective deaths of moon and durwin they would have been delighted to discuss the entire business threadbare in the hope of solving the mystery of the two crimes but dan did not wish to bring the police into the matter until he had more evidence to go upon after all what he knew concerning mrs jarsell and penn was both vague and uncertain while the clue of the perfume being so slight might be scouted as ridiculous by these cutanddried officials what halliday wished to do was to establish a connection between the doings at sheepeak blackheath and hampstead on evidence that could not be questioned so that he might submit a complete case to the police he could not do this until he acquired positive proof and he desired to acquire the same by his own endeavors supplemented by those of laurance therefore as freddy was away on business and dan did not care about placing his unfinished case before the inspectors he went about his ordinary affairs waiting for his friends return this was all that he could do and he did it reluctantly a hint from lord curberry had evidently made sir john more vigilant as regarded his niece dan called at the house and was denied an interview he wrote a letter and received no answer and although he haunted bond street and regent street the parks and the theatres he could catch no glimpse of lillian after three days of unavailing endeavor he went to bedford and attended to the transfer of his aeroplane to blackheath bringing it up in the train personally then he put it together again and took short flights in the vicinity of london after repairing the damage done to the propeller all the same his heart was not in the business of aviation at the moment as the detective fever had seized him and he felt that he could not rest until he had solved the mystery of the two crimes but at the moment he saw no way by which he could advance toward a consummation of his wishes and simply fiddled away his time until the return of laurance then after a threshing out of details he hoped to make some sort of move in the darkness but fate decreed that he should act alone and without advice and the intimation of fates intention came in the form of a short letter from marcus penn asking for an interview i am confident wrote the secretary that from what you threatened in the aeroplane you suspect me of knowing something relative to sir charles moons murder as i am entirely innocent i resent these suspicions and i wish you to meet me in order that they should be cleared away if you will meet me at the bookingoffice of the bakerloo tube i can take you to the person who gave me the perfume he will be able to tell you that i have no connection with any criminal then the letter went on to state day and hour of the appointment and ended with the feeble signature of the writer dan always thought that penns signature revealed only too plainly the weakness of his character of course he intended to go even though he remembered that penn had declared the identity of the person who had given him the perfume his cousin in sumatra had sent the same to him the secretary had said yet he now proposed to introduce dan to another person who was the donor of the scent unless indeedand this was possiblethe sumatra cousin had come to england with the intention of exonerating penn certainly penn might mean mischief and might be dexterously luring him to a trap but halliday felt that he was quite equal to dealing with a timid personality such as the secretary possessed also when going to keep the appointment he slipped a revolver into his hippocket to be used if necessary it might beand dans adventurous blood reached fever heat at the mere ideathat penn intended to introduce him to his brother scoundrels who constituted this mysterious gang if so there was a very good chance that at last he might learn something tangible concerning the organization undoubtedly there was a great risk of his losing liberty if not life and it was impossible to say what precautions this society of cutthroats might take to preserve its secrets but halliday was not of a nervous nature and moreover was willing to risk everything on one cast of the die instead of lingering in suspense he therefore got himself ready without saying a word to any one and kept the appointment and indeed now that laurance was absent there was no one to whom he could speak it chanced to be a somewhat foggy night when dan descended to the underground in trafalgar square but out of the darkness and in the light he had no difficulty in recognizing penn the secretary was well wrapped up in a heavy greatcoat and welcomed the young man with a nervous smile blinking his pale eyes furiously as was his custom when much moved however he spoke amiably enough and appeared to bear no malice against his companion notwithstanding the threat in the aeroplane i am glad you have come mr halliday said penn in a wouldbe dignified tone as i wish to clear my character from the grave doubts you cast upon it when we last met your admissions favored the grave doubts retorted dan lightly i spoke foolishly mr halliday as i was quite upset by your threats hm i wonder to see you trust yourself again to such a bloodthirsty being as i am mr penn oh i knew you were only bluffing in the aeroplane said the secretary in a meek voice and with a shrug the means you took to escape further questioning showed me that the dry tone of dan stirred the mans chilly blood to greater heat you have no right to interfere with my private affairs he said furiously but when those affairs have to do with a crime they have not i know nothing about the matter penns breath was short and he tried to keep his voice from quavering when you see my cousin he will prove that he gave me the scent oh then your sumatra cousin is now in england yes otherwise i should not have asked you to come are we to meet him here questioned dan glancing round curiously no we can go to him in a taxi i thought of the tube first but we can get to our destination quicker in a motor come and penn leading the way ascended the stairs down which halliday had lately come where are we going to asked dan but the secretary being some distance ahead either did not hear the question or did not desire to reply to the same i suppose added halliday as the two stood once more in the foggy upperworld that your cousin wishes to see mrs jarsell my cousin doesnt know mrs jarsell neither do i retorted penn sharply curious that she should possess the perfume murmured dan sceptically and one which you say is unique in england that is said the secretary as they stepped into a taxicab which evidently was waiting for them near the trafalgar square lions but this lady whose name you mention may know someone in sumatra also and in that way the perfume may have come into her possession ah dan made himself comfortable while penn pulled up the windows of the taxi so as to keep out the damp air the long arm of coincidence the improbable usually occurs in real life and not in novels mr halliday dan laughed and watched the street lights flash past the blurred windows as the taxi turned up the haymarket he wondered where they were going and as he believed that penn would not give him any information he carefully watched to see the route his companion adjusted his silk muffler well over his mouth with a murmured explanation about his weak lungs and then held out a silver cigarette case to dan clicking it open as he did so will you smoke mr halliday no thank you replied the other cautiously for the present i dont care about it and penn shrugged his shoulders evidently understanding that dan did not trust him or his gifts after a time he took out a cigarette and lighted a match these cigarettes are of a particular kind he remarked and blew a cloud of smoke directly under hallidays nose after which he readjusted the muffler not only over his mouth but over his nose dan started for the whiff of smoke filled the close confinement of the taxi with the wellknown flavor of the sumatra scent he was about to make a remark when the scent grew stronger as the cigarette burned steadily with a red smoldering tip and he felt suddenly faint pull down the window he gasped and leaned forward to do so himself for answer penn suddenly pulled the young man back into his seat and enveloped him in a cloud of drowsy smoke keeping his own mouth and nose well covered meanwhile with the silk muffler halliday made a faint struggle to retain his senses and the control of his muscles but the known world receded rapidly from him and he seemed to be withdrawn into gulfs of utter gloom the last coherent thought which came into his mind was that the pretended cigarette produced by penn was a drugged pastil then an effort to grasp the undoubted fact that he had been lured into a skilful trap which had shut down on him used up his remaining willpower and he remembered no more whither he went into darkness or what he did dan never knew as there seemed to be no break in the time that elapsed from his becoming unconscious in the taxi and waking with the acrid smell of some reviving salts in his nostrils he might have been on earth or in sky or sea he did not know for he opened his eyes languidly in a dense gloom where am i he asked but there was no reply his senses came back to him with a rush owing perhaps to the power of the stimulant applied to bring him round he sat up alertly in his chair and felt immediately that his arms were bound tightly to his sides so that he could not use his revolver or even strike a match he certainly would have done this latter had he been able to for he greatly desired to be informed as to the quality of his surroundings he presumed that he was in a large room of some kind and he became convinced by his sixth sense that the room was crowded with people when fully himself dan could hear the soft breathing of many unseen beings but whether they were men or women or a mixture of the sexes he could not say even when his eyes became accustomed to the gloom he could discern nothing for the darkness was that of egypt and the silence save for the steady breathing was most uncanny dan felt it incumbent on him to make some attempt towards acquiring knowledge what is the meaning of this outrage he demanded loudly and in a resolute tone i insist upon knowing from the near distance came a whispering voice which made him shiver no one insists here said the unknown speaker all obey who is it that all obey demanded the prisoner undauntedly queen beelzebub murmured the voice soft and sibilant there flashed into dans mind some teaching secular or sacredhe could not tell which at the momentrelative to a deity who had to do with flies a phoenician deity he fancied but surely if his memory served him a male godling beelzebub the god of flies he remembered now and remembered also the trademark of the mysterious society formed for the purpose of murdering various people for various reasons known and unknown so you have got me at last he said aloud i might have guessed that penn would trap me no names said the unseen speaker coldly it will be the worse for you if you mention names am i addressing beelzebub asked dan and for the life of him he could not keep the irony out of his tones for the whole thing was so theatrical queen beelzebub i see you have given the god of flies a consort may i ask why i have been brought here we intend to make you an offer who we what we the members of the society of flies of which i am the head hm i understand dont you think you had better loose my hands and turn up the lights be silent ordered the voice imperiously and as dan fancied with some hint of temper at the flippant way in which he talked be silent and listen i cant help myself said halliday coolly go on please there was a soft rustle as if the unseen company admired his courage for behaving calmly in what was undoubtedly a weird and trying situation then some distance away a disk of red light like a winter sun appeared with nerveshaking swiftness it revealed none of the company for all were still in the gloom but concentrated its angry rays on a large and solemn visage unhuman in its stillness and awful calm it was an egyptian face such as belongs to the statues of the gods of kem and the headdress stiff and formal was also suggestive of the nile of more than usual size dan could only see its vast features but fancied that a red robe fell in folds from the neck downward there was something grand about this severe face and in the darkness with the scarlet light gleaming fiercely on its immobility it was assuredly effective if somewhat theatrical the lips did not move when queen beelzebub began to speak but the eyes were alive the eyes of the person concealed behind the mask dan noticed that when the face became visible in the angry red light the speaker ceased to whisper and the voice became deep voluminous and resonant as that of a gong the tone was that of a man but it might have been a woman speaking through an artificial mouthpiece the final thing which dan noticed was that the whole atmosphere of the room reeked with the rich fragrance of the sumatra scent you are very daring and meddlesome said the voice issuing in chilly tones from behind the stately mask for you have intruded yourself into affairs which have nothing to do with you they have everything to do with me retorted halliday decisively and feeling reckless if you and your society are omniscient you should know omniscient is a good word we know that you love lillian moon and wish to marry her we know that her uncle is willing this should be if you discover the truth about his brothers death you have been searching for the assassin and you are still searching that search must stop i think not if you refuse to obey said queen beelzebub coldly we can put you out of the way as we have put others out of the way the law a faint murmur of laughter was heard suggestive of scorn we care nothing for the law said the speaker contemptuously oh i think you do or you would not have taken all this trouble to have me brought here you are here to receive an offer indeed i shall be glad to hear the offer we wish you to join the society of flies and swear to obey me the queen thank you but an association of cutthroats does not appeal to me think twice before you refuse the voice became threatening i think once and that is sufficient returned dan drily you are at our mercy we can kill you as we have killed others there are worse things than death dishonor you talk like a fool scoffed queen beelzebub what is dishonor merely a word it means nothing i can well believe that it means nothing to you and your friends said dan who was weary of this fencing may i ask what advantage i gain by becoming a member of your bloodthirsty gang we are an association boomed the great voice banded against the injustice of the world we resent few people having wealth and the majority going without the necessaries of life being limited in number the law is too strong for us and we cannot gain our objects openly therefore we have to strike in the dark and your objects to equalize wealth to give our members wealth position comfort and power oh its a kind of socialistic community you work for the poor we work for ourselves rather selfish isnt it people will only work for self and to those who labor for us we give all that they wish for become a member and you will realize your hearts desire perhaps said halliday in a caustic tone i may realize that without your aid we think not to marry lillian moon you must find who murdered her father and that person will never be found then why stop me from searching it is a pity you should waste your time said queen beelzebub sarcastically besides you are one who would do honor to our society perhaps but would the society do honor to me we can give you what you desire on certain conditions what are they you must take the oath and sign the book swear to obey me who am the head of this association without question promise to be secret and give all your talents to forwarding the aims of the society of flies hm said dan coolly a very comprehensive oath indeed and the aims wealth and power we are banded together to get what we want independent of the law and we think that the end justifies the means we accept money from those people who desire to get rid of their enemies or of those who stand between them and their desires we supply plans of english forts to foreign powers on condition that large sums are paid to us we trade on the secrets of people which we learn in various ways if we are asked by any member to get him something all the resources of the society are at his disposal rivals can be removed if he wants to marry relatives can be put out of the way if he wishes for their money there is no height to which an ambitious man cannot climb with our aid join us and you shall marry lillian moon within the year and also shall enjoy her large fortune desirous to learn more of the villainies with which this precious band of scoundrels were concerned dan temporized and if i refuse you will be put to death now at this very moment dans blood ran cold for after all he was yet young and life was sweet to him no you will be allowed to go and death shall fall upon you when you least expect it thus your agony will be great for death may find you tomorrow or in a week a month or a year we are not afraid you will tell the police for if you do it will only hasten your end besides you do not know where you are and shall be taken away as secretly as you have been brought here the law cannot touch us because we work under ground like moles and even if you told the police your story of what has happened would only be laughed at the police here the voice sneered think everything is known and refuse to believe that we exist well said dan as if making up his mind can i ever leave the society if i once join it yes said queen beelzebub unexpectedly when you take the oath you must swear to be sober chaste and secret since these qualities are needed to keep a member in good working trim a certain amount of work you must do in connection with our aims so that you dare not speak without being implicated in our doings but after a time you can leave with money position or powerwhatever you desire and then can lead your own life however profligate it may be but while a member you must be a saint a black saint murmured dan wondering at the solid ground upon which this association was founded and thinking how dangerous it could be with its misdirected aims well i dont say no and i dont say yes i must have time to think what my answer will be you shall have one month to consider and then you shall be brought here secretly again said queen beelzebub authoritatively but you will be wise if you join us we wish you to do so because you have brains and we want brains our society will rule the world if we get clever men to join as the training of our members in sobriety chastity selfcontrol and secrecy is that of the socalled saints i see said dan cheerfully the lords prayer said backward so to speak your majesty well the whole business is clever and extremely well managed as i can see i shall take my months respite and then and then if you say yes you will have all that the world can give you if you say no prepare for death a murmur vague and indistinct went round the dark room prepare for death and if i speak to the police in the meantime asked dan yawning you have been warned that if you do death will follow immediately declared queen beelzebub no human law can protect you from us enough has been said and you have thirty days to decide what to do as she spoke the red light vanished as abruptly as it had come dan could only hear the steady breathing of many people in the gloom and wondered how many members of this devilish society were present at that moment and while the thought was yet in his mind he felt that a pastil was being held under his nose the drowsy scent stole into his brain although he tried to avert his head and almost immediately he became again unconscious again he fell into gulfs of gloom and remembered nothing when he recovered his senses he was seated in a four wheeler driving in an unknown direction and he was alone his head ached but he struck a match and looked at his watch it was eleven oclock where did you find me he asked the cabman putting his head out of the window and noticing that he was in a welllighted street a friend of yours brought you to my cab said the man saying you was drunkdead drunk he gave me your address and im taking you home clever said dan to himself accepting the explanation without comment chapter xiii a bold determination dan went to bed with an aching head doubtless induced by the power of the drug which had been used to stupefy him the sumatra perfume was evidently both powerful and useful as it was used by the society of flies not only as a means of recognition in the form of a harmless scent but as a soporific to bring about insensibility probably many a person had been rendered unconscious by the drowsy smoke and taken to the headquarters of the infernal association there to become members but where the headquarters were to be found dan had not the slightest notion and as his head pained him greatly he decided to wait until the next morning before thinking out the matter off and on he managed to sleep a trifle but it was not until the small hours that true slumber came to him it was nine oclock when he woke and then he found his head clear and the pain absent only an evil taste remained in his mouth and after a cold bath he felt more himself although a touch of languor remained to recall to his recollection what he had been through after breakfast he lighted a pipe and began to think over late events as carefully as was necessary on alighting at his own door he had paid the driver of the fourwheeled cab and had asked questions which the man was willing enough to answer halliday hoped by learning where the cabman had picked him up to discover at least the neighborhood wherein the headquarters were situated it was difficult to think that an unconscious person as he had been could have been taken any great distance along streets or roads or lanes without attention being attracted but the cabman explained that the friend who had placed his fare in the fourwheeler had removed him from a taxi which the friend declared had broken down and he wanted to get you home you being drunk explained the driver so he shoved you into my trap and i drove off having the address i was to take you to leaving your friend to look after the brokendown taxi along with the chauffer from this explanation it was apparent that on being removed from the dark room dan had been transported for some distance long or short in the taxi he did not believe that the same had broken down but that his friendprobably marcus pennhad hailed the first cab he saw and on pretence of an accident had got rid of him in this clever way it was west kensington where this exchange had taken place according to the cabmans story but since he had been driven an indefinite distance by penn in the taxi the headquarters might be in hampstead or blackheath or ilford or indeed anywhere round about london if not in the heart of the metropolis itself all bearings were lost by the clever way in which the return had been carried out and now halliday scarcely knew what to do or how to act he did not dare to tell the police as the first sign of activity on the part of the authorities would mean his own death in some mysterious way he also would be found with an artificial fly near the wound and the odor of the sumatra scent on his clothes as dan did not wish to die he therefore hesitated to make any statement to inspector tenson of hampstead who was so anxious to learn the secret and gain the reward in fact he hoped that the man would not come to his roomshe had been there several times in quest of informationlest he should smell the sumatra scent dan found that he had brought the perfume away on his clothes when he examined them which was scarcely to be wondered at considering how powerfully the dark room had reeked of the odor certainly tenson did not know the scent so well as halliday did although he had experienced a whiff of it when examining the body of sir charles moon but he might have forgotten the smell while dan turned over his clothesthe blue serge suit he had worn on the previous nighthe found a piece of paper in one of the trousers pockets which contained a message typewritten in crimson ink it was set forth in the third person by no less an individual than queen beelzebub herself and ran as follows queen beelzebub warns daniel halliday that not only his own life depends upon his secrecy but the life of lillian moon also should he apply to the authorities or in any way recount his adventures the girl he loves will be put out of the way and afterwards daniel halliday will be dealt with at the end of thirty days queen beelzebub expects to receive homage from her new subject who will receive notice of time and place fixed for the ceremony remember quite a charlesthefirst ring about that last word thought dan frowning at the threatening message the scoundrels they have tied my hands with a vengeance what the deuce am i to do it was useless for him to ask himself this question as the only answer could be nothing if he moved in any way likely to harm the society he ran the chance of sacrificing not only himself but lillian it was bad enough that he should be done to death but he might have risked that so as to break up the organization but it was impossible to place the girl he loved in so dangerous a position queen beelzebub knew what she was about when she used the phrase and halliday was well aware that the society had a long arm and that nothing could protect lillian from these moles who were working in darknessclever deadly and unscrupulous for the next two days the young man went about in a dream or rather in a nightmare he did not dare to see lillian or to write to lillian lest the members of the society should believe he was betraying them they appeared to have spies everywhere and there was no move on the chessboard which he could make which might not be detected yet he could not wait passively for the rest of the thirty days since he had no idea of joining the band and had only asked for a respite so as to think out some means of escape more than ever he longed for the return of laurance he could trust him and a consultation between the two might evolve some scheme by which to baffle the subjects of the accursed woman who called herself queen beelzebub dan wondered if she was mrs jarsell but the evidence of the perfume seemed too slight a link to join her with this deadly organization of course there was marcus penn who was a member and knew everything but he would not speak since he ran also a risk of death should he betray too much still dan being in the same boat and under the same ban fancied that the secretary might be frank as his confidence could not be abused now if he could get penn to state positively that mrs jarsell was queen beelzebub he might have something tangible upon which to work but taking into consideration the egyptian mask and the alteration of the voice by means of the artificial mouthpiece dan believed that she wished to keep her identity secret always presuming that queen beelzebub was the she in question on this assumption halliday concluded that penn would not speak out and bothered himself for hours as to whether it would be worth while to ask the secretary questions while still in this undecided frame of mind he received a morning visit from laurance who turned up unexpectedly freddy in pursuit of his business played pussinthecorner all over the world coming and going from london in the most unexpected manner he reminded dan of this when the young man jumped up with an exclamation at his sudden entrance you might have known that i would turn up anyhow he said sitting down and accepting an offer to have breakfast i never know where i shall be on any given date and you must be always prepared for the unexpected so far as i am concerned i heard you were looking for me when i returned last night from vienna so i came along to feed with you halliday ordered his man to bring in a clean cup and poured out coffee after which he heaped freddys plate with bacon and kidneys there you are old fellow eat away and get yourself ready for a long talk i have heaps to tell you likely to be interesting about the murder of durwin questioned laurance reaching for toast yes and about the murder of sir charles moon also you dont mind my smoking while you eat no smoke away have you seen the moment this morning no anything interesting in it about your austrian excursion oh yes said laurance indifferently i managed to learn a good deal about these anarchistic beasts and its set all out in print but thats not what i meant he fumbled in his pockets hang it i havent brought a paper and i meant to theres a death chronicled this morning dan sat up and shivered another of the murders yes marcus penn this time penn halliday dropped his pipe the devil he picked it up again i wonder why they killed him he told you too much maybe said laurance drily anyhow the gang has got rid of him by drowning him in an ornamental pond in curberrys grounds he might have fallen in suggested dan uneasily or he might have committed suicide out of sheer terror well he might have admitted freddy thoughtfully but from what i saw of the man i should think he was too great a coward to commit suicide dan smoked in a meditative manner i suppose she killed him or had him killed he said aloud after a pause she who the shedevil who presides over the society of flies queen beelzebub laurance dropped his knife and fork to stare hard at his friend so you have learned something since i have been away several things wait a moment dan rose and retired to his bedroom while freddy pushed away the breakfast things as he did not wish to eat further in the face of hallidays hint which had taken away his appetite in a few minutes dan came back to the sittingroom carrying the clothes he had worn on the night of his kidnapping which still retained a faint odor of the fatal scent belonging to the gang smell that said dan placing the clothes on his friends knee laurance sniffed is this the sumatra scent he asked hm quite a tropical fragrance but i thought you proved to your satisfaction that there was nothing in this perfume business i always had my doubts said halliday drily they were lulled by penns lies and reawakened when i found the scent at mrs jarsells now i know all about the matter i place my life in your hands by telling you is it as serious as that asked laurance uneasily yes serious to me and to lillian also read that the journalist scanned the crimson typewriting and his eyes opened larger and larger as he grasped the meaning of the message where the deuce did you get this he demanded hurriedly i found it in my pocket when i got back the other night where from from the headquarters of the society of flies there is a gang then asked laurance starting yes a very wellorganized gang presided over by queen beelzebub the consort of the gentleman of that name who is the god of flies where are the headquarters i dont know we may be able to trace the gang by this said freddy examining the typewritten paper if inspector tenson if tenson gets hold of that and learns anything which by the way i dont think he can from that paper my life wont be worth a cent neither will that of lillians i might not care for my own life but i care a great deal for hers i want to have a consultation as to what is best to be done to save her from these devils well you can depend upon my saying nothing dan it seems serious tell me all about your discoveries halliday did so starting with his visit to the cinematograph with lillian and his recognition of mrs jarsell in the animated picture then he recounted his journey to hillshire and what he had learned from mrs pelgrin and her nephew so on the face of it concluded dan earnestly i dont see how mrs jarsell could have got to london she didnt go by train and could not have gone by motor yet im sure she was on the blackheath grounds it is a puzzle admitted freddy drawing his brows together but go on you have something else to tell me rather and dan detailed all that had taken place from the time he received penns invitation to meet him in the bakerloo tube to the moment he arrived at his rooms again in the fourwheeler what do you make of it all freddy asked halliday when he ended and relighted his pipe give me time to think said laurance and rose to pace the room for a time there was a dead silence each man thinking his own thoughts it was dan who spoke first and said what was uppermost in his mind of course my hands are tied he said dismally i dare not risk lillians life the beasts have killed her father and durwin and penn all because they got to know too much they may kill lillian also and in the same mysterious way but she knows nothing said freddy anxiously no but i do and if i speakwell then you know what will happen queen beelzebub saw that i cared little for my own life so she is striking at me through lillian the girl he loves says that message clever woman mrs jarsell she has me on toast but my dear fellow you cant be sure that your masked demon is mrs jarsell since you did not see her face or recognize her voice i admit that the mask concealed her features and i believe that she spoke through an artificial mouthpiece to disguise the voice still there is the evidence of her possessing the perfume which plays such a large part in the gangs doings also her appearance in the animated picture which proves her to have been on the blackheath ground but mrs pelgrin and her nephew declare positively that she could not have been there quite so but mrs pelgrin and her nephew may be paid to keep silence retorted dan in a worried tone then miss armour if you remember prophesied that i should have a wonderful offer made to me if i accepted i should marry lillian and enjoy a large fortune well an offer in precisely the same words was made to me on condition that i joined the gang but surely you dont believe that a paralyzed woman like miss armour has anything to do with this business questioned laurance skeptically dan shrugged his shoulders miss armour is the friend of mrs jarsell whom i suspect and certainly told my fortune as you heard mrs jarsell may have told her what to say knowing that the prophecy would be fulfilled i dont say that miss armour knows about this infernal organization as the very idea would horrify her but mrs jarsell may use the poor woman as a tool i cant believe that miss armour knows anything said freddy decidedly to begin with the society of flies needs useful people and an invalid like miss armour would be of no use i admit that miss armour is in the dark replied halliday impatiently all the same her prophecy together with the perfume and the cinematograph evidence hints at mrs jarsells complicity again the false mrs brown who murdered sir charles was stout and massive mrs jarsell is stout and massive plenty of women are stout and massive asserted the reporter but you saw the false mrs brown yourself did you recognize mrs jarsell as that person no but mrs brown was so wrinkled for a fat woman that i remember thinking at the time she might be a fraud i daresayi am positive in factthat her face was made up and while i looked at her she let down her veilanother hint that she did not wish to be examined too closely if you think that mrs jarsell murdered moon and durwin and you have the evidence you speak of you should reveal all to the police and risk lillians life and my own freddy you must take me for a fool laurance shook his head no i dont underrate your cleverness and i see that you are in a tight place you cant move with safety to yourself and miss moon yet if you dont move what is to be done well said dan after a pause i have a month to think matters out my idea is to hide lillian somewhere under the care of mrs bolstreath and then take action so long as lillian is safe i am ready to risk my own life to bring these mysteries to light i am with you cried freddy enthusiastically its a good scheme dan i wonder how miss moon is to be hidden though since the society of flies may employ spies to find her whereabouts oh every member of the society is a spy was hallidays answer although i dont know how many members of the gang there are penn could have told us and perhaps could have proved the identity of mrs jarsell with queen beelzebub but hes dead and and was murdered broke in laurance decisively i am quite sure thatbecause he could prove too much for mrs jarsells safetyhe was got rid of oh dan looked up with a smile then you believe that mrs jarsell i dont know what to believe until more evidence is forthcoming said the reporter impatiently but miss moons hidingplace where is it best to place her with mrs bolstreath as her guardian halliday reflected and then made the last answer freddy expected to hear considering the circumstances at sheepeak with miss vincent he declared dan are you serious you place her under the guns of the enemy quite so and there has been proof that under the guns is the safest place in some cases it is in this i am sure should mrs jarsell be the person we suspect her to be she will not foul her own nest at sheepeak therefore she will not dare to have lillian killed within a stonethrow of her own house by daring all we gain all its a risk said laurance pondering i can see that so can i everything is risky in this business then theres mildred rejoined the journalist uneasily i really do not want her to be brought into the matter it will be all right freddy and much the safer for lillian mrs jarsell wont have the courage to hurt my promised wife when your promised wife is in her company still if you have qualms no no no interrupted laurance eagerly after all i cannot be half a friend and if mildred is willingwhen she learns the whole circumstance that is i shall agree after all if anything does happen we can accuse mrs jarsell and if she is queen beelzebub she will end her career in jail i dont think she will risk that by hurting the girls oh she would never hurt miss vincent i am sure and would only harm lillian because i have to be frightened into joining her gang no freddy a daring policy is the best in this case well place lillian with mrs bolstreath under mildred vincents chargeunder the guns of the enemy as you say i am sure the result will be good but sir john moon will make a row if you take his niece away let him retorted dan contemptuously i can deal with that fribble of a man after all lillian need only be absent from london for a month and during that time we must break up the gang with or without the aid of the police if we dont i shall certainly be murdered like moon and durwin and penn have been and on the same groundsthat i know too much but i daresay lillian will then be left alone and sir john can carry out his pet scheme and marry her to curberry i wonder said laurance musingly if curberry has anything to do with the gang in question i think not he has nothing to gain now he hasnt said freddy drily but he had a good deal to gain when he was a barrister and two lives stood between him and a title and a fortune the two men looked at one another i see what you mean said dan slowly hm of course he may be a member and the society may have cleared his uncle and cousin out of the way but we cant be sure one thing at a time freddy i am going to see lillian and mrs bolstreath and get them to fly to sheepeak but you will have to reveal what we know and that will frighten them dan looked vexed and gnawed his nether lip i dont want to say more than is necessary he replied as for their own safety the less they know of the business the better perhaps i may induce lillian to elope with me to sheepeak and need not explain to her but mrs bolstreath must know more well said freddy putting on his hat i leave these matters in your very capable hands so far as i am concerned i am going to blackheath to see about this death of penn i may get into the house he paused well asked halliday raising his eyebrows well if curberry does favor this society of flies who knows what i may discover also some truths may come out at the inquest penn belonged to the gang as we know and when he wanted a situation he was taken on by lord curberry that hints at much however we shall see we shall see and with a careless nod freddy took his leave while dan changed his clothes with the intention of calling at sir john moons house owing to a late breakfast and the long conversation with laurance it was quite one oclock before dan reached his destination he half expected to be refused admittance as usual especially when he learned from the footman that miss moon was not in the house but failing lillian who had no doubt gone out on a shopping expedition and would shortly return to luncheon dan sent in his name to mrs bolstreath with a request for an interview it was best to explain the situation to her he thought since no time could be lost in assuring lillians safety the chaperon saw the young man at once and when introduced into the room where she was seated he was struck by her worried air his thoughts immediately flew to the girl lillian he asked anxiously is anything the matter with lillian oh that girl will break my heart with her freaks said mrs bolstreath in an irritable tone she knows that sir john does not approve of her going out by herself and that my retaining my situation depends upon my looking after her closely yet she has gone out without telling me where has she gone to well said mrs bolstreath looking at him i think she has gone to lord curberrys house dans lip curled that ought to please sir john is he with her no sir john is in the country for a few days he would not be pleased at lillian going to see lord curberry without my being present but why has she gone to see a man she hates asked halliday perplexed it is not lord curberry she wishes to see mrs bolstreath hesitated i suppose you saw that mr penn is dead she asked irrelevantly it was in the morning paper i knowthat is the announcement of his death said dan laurance came and told me well this morning lillian received a letter from mr penn written a few days ago saying that if anything happened to him she was to go to lord curberry and find some important paper he has left behind him for her perusal oh dan started to his feet then penn has left a confession a confession mrs bolstreath looked puzzled he must have guessed that his death was determined upon said halliday to himself but loud enough for his companion to hear perhaps the truth will come out in that confession what truth for heavens sake mr halliday speak plainly i am worried enough as it is over lillians escapade is anything wrong a great deal mrs bolstreath i have to confide in you in order to save lillian from deathfrom a death like her father suffered mrs bolstreath screamed oh what is it what is it you must be silent about what i tell you of course i shall i can keep a secret but tell me tell me she panted if you dont keep the secret all our lives are in jeopardy there is no time to be lost i must follow lillian to curberrys house at once listen mrs bolstreath and remember every word i say is important then dan hastily related much that he knew though not more than was absolutely necessary however he told enough to make mrs bolstreath almost crazy with terror keep your head and my confidence said halliday sharply we must beat these demons at their own game get ready and come with me to blackheath on the way i can explain you think lillian is safe implored mrs bolstreath preparing to leave the room and assume her outofdoor things yes yet if curberry is connected with the gang and thinks she is hunting for penns confession he maybut it wont bear thinking of we must go to lillian at once you will work with me to save lillian with all my heart and soul and body cried the chaperon wildly then get ready and come with me at once said dan imperiously chapter xiv a busy afternoon lord curberry was something of a student and a great deal of a manabouttown so his residence at blackheath was an ideal one for an individual who blended such opposite qualities his pleasant georgian mansion of mellow red brick stood sufficiently far from london to secure privacy for study and yet was sufficiently near to enable its owner to reach piccadilly bond street the clubs and the theatres easily when he felt so disposed the chief seat of the family indeed was situated in somersetshire but curberry not possessing a sporting nature rarely went to live in the country the blackheath estate was not large consisting only of a few acres of woodland surrounded by a lofty stone wall but this wall and the trees of the park so sequestered the house that its seclusion suggested a situation in the very wildest parts of england in every way therefore this compact place suited lord curberry and he lived there for the greater part of the year when dan and mrs bolstreath arrived they found that the house had been thrown open to the public so to speak that is there was a crowd at the entrancegates many people in the grounds and not a few in the very mansion itself there was not much difficulty in guessing that marcus penns death had drawn a morbid multitude into the neighborhood wherein he had come to his untimely end moreover the inquest was to be held in the house and the public desired ardently to hear if the verdict would be suicide murder or merely accident in any case sensational developments were expected since the death of the secretary was both violent and unexpected as a barrister curberry assisted the law in every possible way and had permitted the inquest to take place in the house instead of ordering the body of the unfortunate man to be removed to the nearest mortuary every one commented on his kindness in this respect and approved of his consideration for the time being curberry was more popular than he had ever been before as dan walked up the short avenue and noted the disorganization of the establishment he made a significant remark to the agitated chaperon i dont think that curberry will have much time to give to lillian all the better isnt it im sure i dont know what you mean said mrs bolstreath much flustered well penn must have concealed his confession somewhere about the house so if lillian wishes to find it she must get rid of curberry somehow but wouldnt it be wise of her to tell him and ask him to assist in the search suggested the lady no if penn wished curberry to see his confession he would have given it to him for delivery to lillian he doesnt want curberry to see what he has written hm dan reflected that he had used the present tense i forgot that the poor chap is dead but surely mrs bolstreaths voice sank to a horrified whisper surely you dont think that lord curberry has anything to do with these horrible people you have been telling me about i say nothingbecause i know nothingfor certain that is i only suspecterwellthat curberry may be in the swim now dont go and give away the show by changing your manner toward the man continued halliday hastily act as you have always acted and indeed i want you to make yourself as agreeable as possible take him away if you can and leave me alone with lillian but for what reason well if curberry is mixed up in this shady business he will not leave lillian alone he may wonder and probably does at her unexpected presence here on this day of all days therefore he may suspect a confession by his secretary and will keep his eyes open oh you go too far cried mrs bolstreath fanning herself with her handkerchief perhaps i do assented dan in a very dry tone but in a case like this it is just as well to take all necessary precautions and in any case curberry will haunt lillians footsteps until she is out of the house if only to find out why she paid this unnecessary visit he can ask her said the chaperon curtly he wont if he is what i suspect him to be but there i may be accusing the man wrongfully im sure you are lord curberry is a perfect gentleman perfect gentlemen have been discovered doing shady things before now however you know what comedy we have arranged you have come to fetch lillian back and i came to escort you then get curberry away on some pretext and let me have ten minutes talk with lillian understand yes gasped mrs bolstreath but i dont like these things one cant touch pitch without being defiled quoted dan cynically as they arrived at the open hall door we wish to see lord curberry this last question was addressed to a footman who came to meet them he recognized mrs bolstreath as having been in the house before with miss moon so readily explained that the young lady was with his master in the drawingroom everything was so upset with the inquest that he never thought of asking for a card so conducted the visitors to where lord curberry was entertaining the girl having announced the names and fairly pushed them into the room the footman departed in a hurry as there was much excitement amongst the servants and he wished to hear all that was being said had not curberry been attending to lillian he would have kept better order as he was a severe master and expected decency under all circumstances but no doubt he also was disturbed by the unusual invasion of his house mydearlillian cried mrs bolstreath in large capitals and advancing toward the end of the room where lillian was seated looking uncomfortable my dear lillian she glared at lord curberry the gentleman had evidently been pressing his suit a proceeding which sufficiently explained miss moons discomfort he was as cadaverous as ever in his looks and his paleblue eyes thin lips and general sneering expression struck dan afresh as uncommonly unpleasant the man flushed to a brick red under mrs bolstreaths glare and hastened to excuse himself i am not to blame i assure you he said hurriedly blame echoed lillian with a thankful glance at the sight of her lover why do you say blame lord curberry you ask that said mrs bolstreath plumping down indignantly when you go away without my knowledge to pay an unauthorized visit to aaa bachelor if i thought that lord curberry i am not to blame said that gentleman again with a scowl for he did not like to stand on the defensive of course you arent remarked miss moon easily and with another glance at dan to point her words i saw in the paper that poor mr penn was dead and as he had been my dear fathers secretary i came on the impulse of the moment to learn exactly what had happened curberry nodded acquiescence i have explained the circumstance to miss moon and i shall explain matters to you mrs bolstreath as for mr halliday he frowned at dan i dont know why he has come to escort me at my request said mrs bolstreath coldly it was necessary for me to call here and take lillian home why did you come she asked again to hear about mr penn repeated lillian rather crossly i have been telling you so for the last few minutes i am curious about penns death myself said dan agreeably did he commit suicide curberry wheeled at the word why should he commit suicide he demanded with suspicion written on every line of his cleanshaven face dan shrugged his shoulders im sure i cant say he answered goodhumoredly only a man in good health isnt found drowned unless he has some reason to get into the pond penn was not in good health said curberry sharply he was always complaining and did his work so badly that i intended to give him notice perhaps he committed suicide because you did no i did not tell him to go and after all i cant say that he did kill himself he was all right at luncheon yesterday which was when i last set eyes on him i went to town and returned at five oclock to hear that he was dead one of the servants walking in the park found his body in the ornamental water at the bottom of the garden did any one push him in asked mrs bolstreath i think not he was on good terms with the servants although not popular in any way no one in my employment would have murdered him and as the gates were closed and no one called between luncheon and five oclock yesterday it is quite certain that he was not murdered by a stranger in fact i dont believe he was murdered at all suicide then suggested dan once more and again curberry looked at him unpleasantly as if not relishing the idea so far as i saw he had no intention of committing suicide he said in a cold manner however the evidence at the inquest will settle the matter i expect he didnt look where he was going and fell in said lillian suddenly mr penn was always absentminded you know i frequently found him so remarked curberry grimly he made a great mess of his work occasionally i am inclined to agree with you miss moon well said dan after a pause let us settle that penn fell in by accident until we hear the verdict of the jury when does the inquest take place in another hour responded the host glancing at his watch i was just impressing upon miss moon the necessity of returning home when you arrived i have to be present of course so as to state what i know of penn you will give him a good character asked halliday pointedly curberry stared in a supercilious way the best of characters he said i had no fault to find with him save that he was absentminded a quality which no doubt accounts for his death poor chap well well its all very sad said mrs bolstreath in a matter of fact way but all our talking will not bring the poor man back lillian child we must go home now that your curiosity is satisfied but first i shall ask lord curberry to give me some of those hothouse flowers i see yonder and she nodded toward a conservatory which could be entered from the drawingroom by means of a french window oh i shall be charmed said curberry with alacrity and perhaps miss moon will come also to choose the flowers i can wait here replied lillian carelessly i have every confidence in mrs bolstreaths choice curberry scowled at dan for he understood well enough that lillian wished to remain with his rival however he could make no further objection without appearing rude so he moved reluctantly toward the conservatory beside the chaperon yet dan saw plainly that he was determined not to lose sight of the two for he plucked the flowers which were directly in front of the french window and thus could gain a view of the young couple every now and then when facing round to speak with mrs bolstreath lillian noticed this espionage also and whispered to dan who had sauntered across the room close to her elbow he wont let us out of his sight said lillian rapidly and i cant get to the library although i have been trying all the time why do you wish to get to the library asked dan in a low voice lillian rose suddenly and dropped a piece of paper put your foot on it and pick it up when he is not looking she said swiftly hush hes coming back and then she raised her voice as curberry returned to the room of course mr penn was always nervous i really think his health was bad still on the disagreeable subject of the death remarked curberry who had a handful of flowers to offer i wish you wouldnt think of these things lilliani beg pardon miss moon please take these flowers and let me escort you and mrs bolstreath out of the house its atmosphere is uncomfortable just now he took no notice of dan but offered his arm to lillian with a swift glance at her lover at mrs bolstreath at the room the flowers at anything save dans right foot which was placed firmly on the scrap of paper she accepted his offer the chaperon followed and when curberrys back was turned she noticed that halliday stooped swiftly to pick up the paper but that he gave her a warning glance she would have asked an indiscreet question as it was she went after her host and pupil walking beside dan who had now slipped the paper into his trousers pocket but mrs bolstreath could not restrain her curiosity altogether what is it she whispered as they walked into the entrance hall nothing nothing he replied softly take lillian home at once i shall follow later and with this mrs bolstreath was obliged to be content although she was desperately anxious to know more i wish i could escort you home said curberry as the two ladies and he stood on the steps but my duty keeps me here for the inquest perhaps mr halliday will oblige i am afraid not said dan stolidly i promised to meet my friend mr laurance here he is coming about the matter of penns death why there he is and sure enough at a moment that could not have been better chosen freddy appeared up the avenue well said mrs bolstreath catching a significant glance from dan we are not able to wait and chat lord curberry we detain you no no let me walk for some distance with you cried curberry and bareheaded as he was he strolled down the avenue between the two ladies laurance took off his hat and lillian bowed graciously as did mrs bolstreath but lord curberry took no notice of the reporter beyond a rude stare thats just as it should be remarked halliday watching the mans retreating form while freddy came up to him youre just the man we want we echoed laurance glancing round lillian and myself see here this is the note sent by penn to her and it asks her to do something which she has not been able to accomplish owing to our noble friends vigilance whats that im just going to find out i havent read the note as yet and with a second glance to make sure that curberry was at a safe distance dan opened the piece of paper and read it hurriedly a moment later he slipped it again into his pocket and took freddys arm its only a few lines saying that penn has left a document which he wishes lillian to read it is to be found between the pages of the second volume of gibbons decline and fall hum so that is why lillian wished to get into the library let me go said freddy eagerly no no you catch curberry as he returns and keep him in conversation on some plea or other then i can slip into the house and seek the library without being noticed wont the servants oh the house is all upset this day with the inquest and every one is wandering about more or less at large ill chance it but if lord curberry asks for you say that i am in the library and that i am waiting to have an interview on what subject asked laurance rather puzzled by this scheming ill find the subject said dan retreating toward the door of the house all i want is five minutes in the library to find the confession detain curberry for that time here he is coming back and here i am going forward as he spoke dan vanished into the house and came face to face with the butler i am waiting for lord curberry said dan will you show me into the library please suspecting nothing wrong and impressed by dans cool manner the butler conducted him to the room in question and after intimating that he would tell his lordship departed closing the door halliday ran his eye round the shelves which extended on three sides of the large compartment from floor to ceiling it seemed impossible to find the book he was in search of in so short space of time as would probably be at his disposal he wished that penn had indicated the position of gibbons masterpiece however halliday by a stroke of luck suddenly realized that curberry numbered his shelves alphabetically and catalogued his books so to speak by the initial letter of the authors name those beginning with a were placed on the shelf ticketed with that letter as allison allen anderson and so on while the shelf b contained browning bronte burns and others going by this way of finding the whereabouts of books dan discovered gibbons decline and fall on shelf g and laid his hand on the second volume but as luck would have it lord curberry suddenly entered the room just as he was about to open it halliday looked up retaining the volume in his hand i am rather surprised to see you here mr halliday said curberry in a cold and haughty tone you know that i am busy with this inquest and have no time for conversation besides he looked hard at his visitor you could have explained your business out of doors not in the presence of the ladies said dan promptly however i wont keep you more than five minutes and he wondered how he was to secure the confession without the knowledge of his host i am waiting to hear what you have to say said curberry throwing his lean figure into a chair you have been making yourself at home he added with a sneer glancing at the book dan laid it on the table i took up gibbons second volume just to pass the time said he carelessly i apologize if you think me presuming i dont think anything rejoined curberry with a shrug except that i am anxious to know why you desire a private conversation it is about lillian miss moon if you please lillian to me lord curberry nothing of the sort sir cried the other suitor furiously and his pale eyes grew angry sir john moon wishes me to marry his niece probably but his niece wishes to marry me that she shall never do oh i think so and what i wish to say lord curberry is thisthat you annoy miss moon with your attentions they must cease how dare you how dare you how dare you oh i dare anything where lillian is concerned retorted halliday and again in a careless manner took up the book leaning against the table and crossing his legs as he did so leave my house cried curberry starting to his feet for this nonchalant behavior irritated him greatly oh willingly i simply stayed to warn you that lillian must not be annoyed by you in any way and if i do not obey you sneered the other quivering with rage i shall make myself unpleasant lord curberry do you know to whom you are speaking well said dan slowly and with a keen glance at the angry face i am not quite sure i am not asmodeus to unroof houses you know curberrys yellow face suddenly became white and his lips trembled nervously i dont understand you i scarcely understand myself and wait interrupted curberry as a knock came to the door there is no need to let every one overhear our conversation come in he cried aloud the butler entered you are wanted at the inquest my lord he said and as curberrys face was bent inquiringly on that of the servant dan seized the opportunity to slip a stiff sheaf of papers out of the gibbon volume as a matter of fact it was three or four sheets joined at the corner by a brass clasp scarcely had he got it in his hand when curberry wheeled after hurriedly telling the butler that he would come shortly what have you there demanded the host advancing menacingly some papers of mine said dan preparing to put the sheets into his pocket its a lie you must have taken them from the table or out of that book mr halliday yes i am sure you did give me what you have taken no said dan retreating before curberrys advance you are not to before he could get another word the man flung himself forward and made a snatch at the papers held loosely by the corner clasp they flew into a kind of fan and curberry managed to grip one or two of the sheets in the momentary struggle these were torn away and then the owner of the house released himself suddenly the next moment he had flung the sheets into the fire apparently thinking he had got them all dan cleverly thrust the one or two remaining sheets into his pocket and played the part of a man who has been robbed how dare you destroy my papers he cried indignantly they were mine said curberry gasping with relief and now they are burnt they were penns retorted halliday sharply perhaps that is why they have been destroyed by you what do you mean what do you mean never mind i think you understand i dont i swear i dont in that case said dan slowly you can make public the fact that i came into your library to find a document in the second volume of gibbon which was placed there by marcus penn but you wont lord curberry if the papers were not destroyed i would place them before the coroner at once said curberry wiping his face and with a glance at the fire on which fluttered a few black shredsall that remained of what he had thrown in i think you must be mad to talk as you do if i am why not make the matter public asked dan drily i dont care about a scandal said curberry loftily well halliday retreated to the library door perhaps the death of penn will be scandal enough those papers doubtless contained an account of the reasons which led to his death im sorry that i burnt them then said curberry in a studied tone of regret i am an impulsive man mr halliday and you should not have annoyed me in the way you did how did you know that the papers were in the second volume of gibbon never mind were they addressed to you never mind what were they about never mind d you sir how dare you goodday lord curberry interrupted dan and walked out of the room leaving his host looking the picture of consternation and dread chapter xv absolute proof it did not require a particularly clever man to guess that lord curberry was connected with the society of flies had he been entirely ignorant of that association he would not have displayed such agitation when he saw the papers in dans hand nor would he have struggled to gain possession of them much less have destroyed them penn certainly was one of the gang and on that account probably curberry had engaged him as a secretary after the death of moon also he may have had some suspicion that penn was a traitor and had guessed that the papers betrayed the society otherwise he would have placed the same before the coroner so as to elucidate the reason why the secretary had been done to death that he had been halliday was quite convinced as penn was too nervous a man to commit suicide and must have been assisted out of the world by some other person but the verdict of suicide has been brought in argued laurance when dan related his adventure i daresay curberrys evidence was to the effect that penn had been considerably worried of late of course that is true but he wouldnt have killed himself ill swear however dan chuckled i have a sheet or two remaining of the confession and we may learn much from that will it state that curberry belonged to queen beelzebubs gang i think so if curberry does not he would have made a row and kicked me out of the house i had no business in the library and no right to take the papers you know but i defied curberry to create a scandal and left him in a pleasing state of uncertainty as to what i knew and what i intended to do he was green with fright you had better take care dan or the society will murder you warned laurance in an uneasy tone oh im safe enough for the given month returned halliday positively so far i have said nothing and until i do notify the authorities all will be well with me but miss moon i join her and mrs bolstreath at st pancras this evening to catch the six oclock express to thawley have you written to miss vincent yes there is no time to receive a reply but she is aware that the ladies will stay at the peacock hotel sheepeak under the wing of mrs pelgrin i only hope added freddy emphatically that you are doing right in placing miss moon in the lions mouth under the guns of the enemy you said before oh yes i am right especially that i now hold a part of penns confession i shall contrive to let mrs jarsell know that i do and that if anything happens to lillian i can make it hot for her does the confession implicate mrs jarsell yes it does i have not had time to decipher the crooked writing of our late friend but intend to do so when in the train this evening but the little i saw hinted that mrs jarsell was in the swim i wish you would leave the confession with me said laurance who was desperately anxious to know the exact truth cant my dear fellow nor have i time to let you read it even if i had it on me which i havent my taxi is at the door of this office and im off to st pancras in five minutes remember freddy that this confession is my sole weapon to protect lillian when mrs jarsell learns that i have it she will not dare to move and will keep her subjects off the grass also but curberry will tell her that he has destroyed the confession so he thinks chuckled halliday but i shall tell her that i rescued enough of it to damn her and her precious gang but how can you tell her without danger i shall find a way although i havent formulated any scheme as yet perhaps she will ask me what all thisthe story of queen beelzebub you knowhas to do with her i shall reply that it has nothing to do with her but that i know she desires to assist in my love affair oh ill manage somehow old son you may be certain goodby wait a moment said laurance following dan to the door what about sir john moon he will make a row over lillians flight and you will get into trouble he may make a row if he likes but as lillian is under the wing of mrs bolstreath her dulyappointed chaperon i dont see what he can say she is quite ready to take all blame of course said laurance thoughtfully sir john may belong to the society himself in which case like curberry he dare not make a row no rejoined dan positively i dont believe sir john belongs to the gang i wish he did as it would smooth things curberry dare not make open trouble because he is one of queen beelzebubs subjects but sir john may because he isnt however i shall risk taking lillian away with mrs bolstreath to play the part of dragon and sir john can do what he jolly well likes luckily he is in the country on a visit just now so we can get clear away without a fuss by the way you were at the inquest was there any fly found on penns body or was there mention of any scent no the man was drowned and it was not possible for either scent or fly to be on his corpse or clothes the evidence clearly pointed to suicide hm curberry brought that about said dan grimly however i am jolly well sure that penn was murdered by one of the gang not by curberry he was away at the time of the death perhaps id like to be certain of that but in any case he may have others of the gang in his employment who could polish off the traitor queen beelzebubs subjects are of all classes well im off halliday took his way to st pancras forthwith and found mrs bolstreath and her charge waiting for him lillian was greatly excited and curious as she did not yet know the reason for this sudden trip northward instructed by dan the chaperon had refused to impart knowledge as the young man intended to tell the girl everything when they were in the train however miss moon was enjoying the unexpected journey and had every faith in her companion also so long as she was in dans company she did not care where she went or why she went or when she went she loved halliday too completely for there to be any room for distrust in her mind dan said mrs bolstreath when they were stepping into the firstclass compartment which halliday had wired to reserve to themselves i have written to sir john saying that lillian required a change and that i was taking her to hillshire to see some friends of mine when he has this explanation he will not make any trouble or even any inquiries he has every trust in me good said dan heartily you make an excellent conspirator conspirator echoed lillian gaily now what does that mysterious word mean dan i am quite in the dark you shall know all before we get to thawley make yourself comfortable do we stay at thawley asked the girl arranging her rug for the night i have telegraphed engaging rooms for you and mrs bolstreath at the best hotel tomorrow we go to sheepeak where is that some miles from thawley you must live quietly for a short time lillian its all immensely exciting of course cried miss moon petulantly but i should like to know what it all means patience patience said dan in a teasing tone little girls should be content to wait by jove were off the long train glided out of the station gathering impetus as it left the lights of london behind mrs bolstreath made herself comfortable in one corner of the compartment and lillian did the same in another corner while dan sat on the opposite seat and addressed his conversation to both impartially the girl could scarcely restrain her impatience so anxious was she to learn the reason for this unexpected journey now dan now she cried clapping her hands there is no stop until bedford so we have plenty of time to hear the story one minute said halliday who was now in possession of the three sheets of foolscap which he had rescued from curberrys grip i must bring the story up to date and cannot do so until i read this statement by the way lillian why should he send to you about the matter im sure i dont know but of course he knew how grieved i was over my fathers murder and perhaps wished to set my mind at rest dan looked at her curiously why should you think that penn knew of anything likely to set your mind at rest on that point lillian cast down her eyes thoughtfully i always thought that mr penn knew much more than he would confess about poor fathers death i quite forgot that i thought so until i got the letter asking me to look into the second volume of gibbons decline and fall in lord curberrys library dear me murmured the girl folding her hands how i did try to get into the library curberry would not let you no i think he was puzzled why i wished to go but he did not ask me any questions i quite believe that said dan grimly asking questions was a dangerous game for him to play however when he found me in the library he evidently recalled your desire to go there and it flashed across him that we were working in consort no wonder he destroyed the papers on the chance that penn might have left incriminating evidence behind him i dont know what you are talking about said lillian fretfully well observed dan smoothing out the foolscap penn no doubt left the clue as to the whereabouts of the confession to you so that you might learn who murdered your father ah i always believed mr penn knew is the name in that paper she asked eagerly and leaning forward it may or it may not be dear you see the greater part of the confession was destroyed by lord curberry he was afraid dan lillian caught her lovers hand you dont think that lord curberry killed my father no no no said halliday quickly i am sure he did not however you shall hear all that i know and laurance knows and all that mrs bolstreath is acquainted with only let me read these few sheets first the girl on fire with curiosity would have objected but that mrs bolstreath touched her shoulder significantly with an effort to restrain her curiosity which was creditable considering the circumstances she nestled into her corner of the carriage while dan glanced through the manuscript in spite of penns crooked handwritingand it was very bad indeedit did not take much time for the young man to master the contents of the confession he uttered an exclamation of vexation when he reached the end like a serial story it breaks off at the most interesting part he said crossly however i have learned something what have you learned demanded mrs bolstreath immediately all in good time said halliday quietly i must first tell lillian what we both know and then i can bring our discoveries up to date by saying what is in this confession and he tapped his breastpocket wherein he had placed the sheets now then lillian now then dan she mocked just tell me all for i cannot keep silence any longer you will have to if you desire to hear the story only dont be worried by what i am about to tell you you are safe with me lillian shrugged her shoulders as if to imply that there was no need for him to state such a plain truth and looked at him with inquiring eyes as she appeared to be brave and collected dan had no hesitation in relating to her all that he had already told mrs bolstreath and thus the girl became thoroughly informed of the underhand doings which had taken place since the death of her father as halliday explained her eyes became larger and rounder and more shining still the color did not leave her cheeks and although she was intensely interested she did not display any fright this was creditable to her courage considering that the revelation hinted at many possible dangers to herself and to her lover dan brought the story up to the time they started from london and then waited to hear her opinion its dreadful and wonderful and very horrid said lillian drawing a deep breath do you think that mr penn murdered my father no the evidence of the girl to whom he was dictating letters to be typewritten proves that he did not enter the library at the time when the death was supposed to have taken place then lord curberry he i dont believe lord curberry either directly or indirectly had anything to do with the matter said dan decisively sir charles approved of his suit rather than of mine so it was to curberrys interest to keep your father alive and well my dear it was the false mrs brown who killed sir charles and she came as an agent of this ghastly society of flies because he got to know too much about the association then mrs brown is mrs jarsell asked mrs bolstreath anxiously i cant be sure of that said the young man thoughtfully of course the sole evidence that proves mrs jarsell to be connected with the gang is the presence of the sumatra scent in her hillshire house and her presence on the blackheath grounds when durwin was murdered but by your own showing she could not have reached london in time that is quite true and yet i recognized her plainly enough on the day lillian and i saw the animated pictures however we can leave that fact alone for the moment i am certain that mrs jarsell is queen beelzebub for penn says as much he tapped his breastpocket again oh cried lillian eagerly what does the confession say ill give you the gist of it replied halliday quietly penn begins with a statement of his early life he was the son of a clergyman and his mother is still alive from a public school he went to cambridge and thence to london where he tried to make a living by literature not being clever he did not succeed and fell into low water i am bound to say that he did not trouble much about his own poverty but seemed to be greatly concerned on account of his mother who is badly offso he says then he was tempted and fell poor devil who tempted him demanded mrs bolstreath a young man whom he met when he was staying in a bloomsbury boardinghouse very hard up the man said that he belonged to a society which could make its members rich and proposed to introduce penn this was done in the same way i presume in which i was taken to these mysterious headquarters the first fruits of penns connection with queen beelzebub was that sir charles moon engaged him as secretary so getting a good salary he was enabled to give his mother many comforts lillian looked alarmed but my father did not belong to the association no of course he didnt but penn was placed as his secretarythe business was managed through curberry who does belong to the gangso that he might inveigle sir charles into becoming a member penn appears to have lost his nerve and did not dare to persuade sir charles so another person was put on to the business the name is not given but why did queen beelzebub wish my father to belong to the gang asked lillian with natural perplexity the reason is plain my dear sir charles was an influential man and could be of great service to the association he learned enough to show him what a dangerous organization existed and then sent for mr durwin who belonged to new scotland yard so that he might reveal what he knew penn learned this since he saw the letter written by your father lillian and at once told the society then the false mrs brown was sent to stop sir charles and dan made an eloquent gesture with his hands there did not seem to be much need of further explanation mrs brown undoubtedly murdered sir charles commented mrs bolstreath in a thoughtful way but is she mrs jarsell penn says as much repeated dan who had made the same remark earlier but it is just at that point he ends listen and i shall read you the last sentence and halliday took the papers from his pocket the three sheets were intact as curberry did only rend away the remainder from the brass clasp at the end of the third page halliday read mrs jarsell of the grange hillshire can explain how mrs dan broke off with a frown here we come to the end of the page and can learn no more curberry burnt the most important part of the confession which doubtless gave full details of mrs jarsells connection with the gang she could explain about mrs brown i suppose said lillian quietly yes the first word over the page is i am certain brown what is more i believe mrs jarsell and mrs brown are one and the same if i see mrs jarsell i may recognize her dan i saw the false mrs brown remember and it was because of me that she was admitted to an interview with my father if you do recognize her which i doubt you must not let on you know who she really is dan warned the girl our business just now and until we get more evidence is to pretend entire ignorance of these things you are up in hillshire for a change of air lillian and know nothing mrs jarsell relying on the clever way in which she was disguised will never dream that you connect her with the poor woman who came on that fatal night to see your father you understand quite put in mrs bolstreath before the girl could speak and i shall see that lillian acts her part of knowing nothing remember you deal with an extraordinarily clever woman mrs bolstreath i am a woman also so diamond can cut diamond but dan asked lillian timidly do you think that mrs jarsell really did murder my father on what evidence we have i believe she did she murdered your father and durwin because they knew too much and i should not be surprised to learn in spite of the verdict at the inquest that she got rid of penn why should she penn let out too much to me explained dan putting away the confession and in any case was a weak sort of chap who was a source of danger to the society queen beelzebub who is i believe mrs jarsell evidently thought it was best to silence him i am sure that penn did not commit suicide and was drowned by mrs jarsell still in the absence of further evidence we can do nothing what action will you take now asked mrs bolstreath quickly before leaving thawley tomorrow morning said halliday after a pause i shall post this confession to laurance and tell him to make use of it only should he hear that anything happens to me or to me chimed in lillian and looked a trifle nervous my dear nothing can happen to you said dan decidedly cheek by jowl as it were with mrs jarsell you are perfectly safe queen beelzebub confines her doings to london and keeps the name of mrs jarsell clean in hillshire for obvious reasons the grange is her place of refuge and no one would connect an innocent country lady with criminal doings in london if she is what we think her to be she will not hurt a hair of your head in hillshire all the same i dont intend to see her said lillian determinedly there is no reason that you should she may call and try to learn why you are staying at the peacock hotel and if so will probably ask you to the grange dont go ended dan emphatically of course not put in mrs bolstreath equally decisive leave that to me since i am responsible for lillian you can say that i am ill with nerves or consumption or something said the girl vaguely i dont want to meet the woman if she murdered my father if you do said dan impressively dont reveal your suspicions and then he went on to instruct the two ladies how they were to behave in the enemys country that they were safe there so long as they pretended ignorance dan did not doubt but should mrs jarsell learn that they knew so much about her she might adopt a counsel of despair and strike it did not do to drive so dangerous a woman into a corner for the rest of the journey very little was said the subject had been thoroughly threshed out lillian had been informed of what was going on and all plans had been made for the future the girl was to live at the peacock and see miss vincent and chat with mrs pelgrin and take walks and admire the country and to conduct herself generally as one who came simply for a change of air if she did not go to the grangeand on the plea of illness she could excuse herself from goingmrs jarsell could not harm her in any way and indeed even if mrs jarsell did succeed in getting her to come to afternoon tea dan had a plan in his head whereby to ensure lillian against any use being made of the sumatra scent it was a daring thing to take miss moon into the jaws of the lion yet that very daring would probably prove to be her safeguard but halliday had done what he could to guard against the events of a threatening future and now could only wait to see what would take place at the moment there was nothing more to be done in due course the train arrived at thawley station and dan singled out george pelgrin to convey luggage to a cab mindful of his last tip george displayed great alacrity in performing his duties as porter and what is more when he received another halfcrown gave inadvertently a piece of valuable information which halliday was far from expecting thats the second twoandsix since yesterday said george spitting on the coin for luck mrs jarsell gave me the same when she came back yesterday evening oh dan was startled but did not show it your sheepeak friend has been to london then went a couple of days ago and came back last night said pelgrin and she says to me george look after my traps for youre the only smart porter in this station she says ah shes a kind lady is mrs jarsell and that civil as never was theres the luggage in the cab all right sir the vulcan hotel yes sir drive on cabby mrs bolstreath and lillian had not heard this conversation but dan pondered over it on the way to the hotel mrs jarsell had then been in london at the time of penns death and probablyalthough he could not prove thisshe was responsible for the same when the young man arrived at the hotel and the ladies went to rest he wrote a letter to laurance detailing the new fact he had learned and instructed him what use to make of the confession if anything happened to himself in hillshire then he enclosed the confession and went out personally to register the packet once it was posted he felt that he had done all that was possible and now said dan to himself well see what move queen beelzebub will make chapter xvi dans diplomacy mrs pelgrin welcomed her unexpected guests with great delight and showed her appreciation of their coming by emphatic aggressiveness why she should mask a kind heart and an excellent disposition by assuming a brusque demeanor is not very clear but certainly the more amiable she felt the more disagreeable did she become in fact the landlady appeared to believe that honesty of purpose was best shown by blunt speeches and abrupt movements consequently she did not get on particularly well with mrs bolstreath who demanded respect and deference from underlings which mrs pelgrin positively declined to render she termed the chaperon a fine madam in the same spirit as she had called dan a butterfly and was always ready for a war of words but admiring lillians gay and lively character she waited on the girl hand and foot yet with an air of protest to hide the real satisfaction she felt at having her in the house to mrs pelgrin lillian was a goddess who had descended from high olympus to mingle for a time with mere mortals out of consideration for hallidays desire to seek safety for lillian by placing her under the guns of the enemy mrs bolstreath decided to remain a week at the peacock hotel later she arranged to go to hartlepool in durhamshire where she and her charge could find shelter with two spinsters who kept a school the chaperon admitted that she felt uneasy in the near vicinity of queen beelzebub and all dans assurance could not quieten her fears she thought that he was playing too bold a game and that ill would come of the stay at sheepeak lillian was more confident always confident that dan could do no wrong and she was quite indifferent to mrs jarsells doings however she agreed to go to hartlepool and as mrs bolstreath was bent upon the change halliday accepted the situation meanwhile he decided to call at the grange on some innocent pretext and diplomatically give queen beelzebub to understand that he held the winning card in the game he was playing with the society of flies this could be done he ventured to think by assuming that mrs jarsell knew nothing about the nefarious association and he did not believe that she would remove her mask since it was to her interest to observe secrecy in hillshire however he left this matter of a call and an explanation in abeyance for the time being and for a couple of days attended to the three ladies the third it is needless to say was mildred vincent who called at the peacock hotel on receipt of her lovers letter she gave dan to understand that he was out of favor with the inventor uncle has never forgiven you for not winning the race said mildred at afternoon tea he says you should have gained the prize i wish i had said halliday dryly the money would have been very acceptable it was my fancyflying did the mischief as i broke the rudder however i shall call and apologize he wont see you mr halliday ah thats so like an inventor who is as touchy as a minor poet mrs jarsell is annoyed also continued mildred sadly she says you should have made a better use of the favor she procured for you it seems to me that i am in hot water all round miss vincent all the same i shall survive these dislikes it is absurd cried lillian with indignation dan risked his life to win the race and if he hadnt had such bad luck he would have won thanks my dear girl but it was less bad luck than carelessness and a certain amount of vanity to show how i could handle the machine you are very modest dan said mrs bolstreath laughingly it is my best quality replied halliday with a twinkle in his eyes where is mr vincents machine now questioned mildred at blackheath stored away i suppose as it was only lent i shall have to return it to your uncle but i shall have a final fly on it when i go back to london in a few days does miss moon go back also not to london interposed mrs bolstreath we propose to visit some friends in scotland lillian looked up in surprise as hartlepool certainly was not in scotland and she thought that mrs bolstreaths geography was at fault but a significant look from dan showed her that he understood why the wrong address had been given mrs bolstreath with too much zeal mistrusted mildred although she had no cause to do so certainly mildred in perfect innocence did she know the actual destination might tell her uncle who would assuredly tell mrs jarsell and for obvious reasons it was not necessary that mrs jarsell should know where the city of refuge was situated all the same dan did not think for a moment that mildred knew anything about the society of flies but he was beginning to fancy that vincent had some such knowledge as mrs jarsell financed him and that she would not do so he was positive unless she made something out of the matter it was very convenient for queen beelzebub to have an inventor at her elbow who could construct swift aeroplanes and it was at this point of his meditations that dan jumped up so suddenly as to spill his tea whats the matter asked lillian making a dash at the cup and saucer to save breakage ive got an idea said halliday with a gasp i must go out and think it over and without excusing himself further he rushed from the room thats not like dan remarked mrs bolstreath uneasily he is calm and coolheaded as a rule i wonder what is the matter oh hell tell us when he comes back replied lillian philosophically i can always trust dan then she turned the conversation in a somewhat heedless manner do you like living here miss vincent well admitted mildred it is rather too quiet for my taste but i have plenty to do in looking after my uncle and his business he depends so much on me that i wonder what he will do when i get married when do you intend to get married asked mrs bolstreath curiously she could not disabuse herself of the idea that living so close to mrs jarsell and having an uncle who was helped by mrs jarsell the girl knew something about the society of flies next year the year afteri dont exactly know it all depends upon my dear freddys success we must have a home and an income but i suppose we shall marry sooner or later and then mrs jarsell can look after uncle solomon who is mrs jarsell asked lillian artfully and cautiously she is an old lady who lives at the grange with another old lady her former governess miss armour both are charming if you are dull here perhaps miss moon you would like to meet them later later put in mrs bolstreath hurriedly thank you for the suggestion miss vincent meanwhile we wish to explore the country it is a charming neighborhood although very quiet in many respects mildred agreed and then began to plan excursions to this place and that with the idea of making the stay of the visitors at sheepeak pleasant so agreeably did she behave and took such trouble in designing trips that mrs bolstreath revised her opinion and began to believe that so nice a girl could not possibly know anything of mrs jarsells doings whatever knowledge her uncle might be possessed of and dan walking at top speed along the high road in a vain attempt to quieten his mind was convinced that the inventor had some such knowledge the idea which had brought him to his feet and had sent him out to work off his excitement was that the inventor was responsible for mrs jarsells presence in london at unexpected moments she financed him and retained him at her elbow so to speak that she might utilize his capabilities and his clever inventions if on the day of the london to york race mrs jarsell was at the peacock hotel about the hour of nine oclockas she certainly was on the evidence of mrs pelgrin who had no obvious reason to tell a lieshe could not have got to london by train or motor in time to murder durwin yet she was assuredly at blackheath if the cinematograph was to be believed dan had hitherto been puzzled to reconcile apparent impossibilities but at teatime the solution of the problem had suddenly flashed into his mind mrs jarsell had travelled to town on an aeroplane it is about one hundred and sixty miles from this place to town muttered dan walking very fast and talking aloud to himself in his excitement so she could accomplish that distance with ease in three hours considering that vincents machine can fly at sixty miles in sixty minutes he said so and i proved that he spoke truly when i experimented with the machine he lent me mrs jarsell was at the peacock hotel at nine oclock and the cinematograph showed she was at blackheath at one oclock the race started then and durwin was killed shortly afterwards sixty miles an hour means one hundred and eighty miles in three hours say she started at halfpast ninewhich she could easily do leaving mrs pelgrin immediately for vincents placeshe could reach london by halfpast twelve if not earlier seeing she had just one hundred and sixty miles to go there would be no difficulty in her reaching blackheath and stabbing durwin at the time the death took place halliday was convinced that in this way the miracle of mrs jarsell had taken place no other means of transit could have landed her at the place where durwin had met with his death of course this assumption intimated that mrs jarsell was an accomplished aviator and that there had been no hitch in the journey from sheepeak to blackheath but these were not impossibilities for vincent probably had taught the woman how to fly and perhaps had handled the machine himself there was room for two in the aeroplane as dan very well knew since he had taken penn for a flight himself and the vehicle used was probably built on the same lines as the one lent since aviation was yet in its infancy there was certainly a possibility that such a journey could not take place without accidents or hindrance but as inferior machines had accomplished greater distances dan quite believed that mrs jarsell with or without vincent as pilot had reached london in one smooth stretch of flying on other occasions she might not have been so successful but on this one she probably had for to get to blackheath in time to commit the crime it would have been necessary for her to use rightfully every second of the given time no wonder with such a means of transit at her disposal she could prove an advantageous alibi when occasion demanded also since the late conquest of the air afforded her the opportunity of swift travelling greatly in excess of other human inventions it was quite reasonable that she should live so far from the scene of her criminal exploits thinking thus halliday stumbled across the very person who was in his thought he rushed with bent head along the roads and unconsciously mounted towards the vast spaces of the moorlands stretching under gray skies thusand he swiftly decided that the collision was meanthe ran into mrs jarsell who approached in the opposite direction she laughed and expostulated as if dan was in the wrong although she must have seen him coming and the road was wide enough for her to move to one side really mr halliday you require the whole country to move in said mrs jarsell in her heavy way and with an affectation of joviality iii beg your pardon stammered dan not quite himself and stared at her as though she had suddenly risen out of the earth indeed so far as he was concerned she had done so ignorant as he was of her approach the woman was arrayed in her favorite white but as the day was chilly she wore a voluminous cloak of scarlet silk quilted and padded and warm both in looks and wear her black eyes set in her olivehued face peered from under her white hair as watchfully as ever at the present moment her heavy countenance wore an expression of amusement at the startled looks of the young man and she commented on them with ponderous jocularity one would think i was a ghost mr halliday you will admit that i am a very substantial ghost and she shook her silvermounted cane playfully at him i didnt expect to meet you here said dan drawing a deep breath and thinking how best he could introduce the subject of lillian nor did i expect to meet you responded mrs jarsell still phlegmatically playful have you risen from the earth or dropped from the skies i did not even know that you were in the neighborhood dan grimly decided that this last statement was false since he had been a whole two days at the peacock hotel and he was certain mrs jarsell must have heard of his visit also of the ladies sheltering under mrs pelgrins wing for in the country gossip is more prevalent than in town i came up for a day or two or three or four said dan still staring you dont appear to be very decided in your own mind rejoined mrs jarsell dryly and sat down on a large block of granite which was embedded amongst the heather our neighborhood evidently has a fascination for you her eye searched his face carefully i am pleased as we are proud of our scenery hereabouts those who come once come twice quite a proverb isnt it is your friend mr laurance with you not on this occasion answered dan coolly and coming to the point i came with two ladies miss moon and her companion they are stopping at the peacock hotel for a short time miss moon miss moon mused mrs jarsell oh yes the young lady you are engaged to marry the daughter of that poor man who was murdered you have an excellent memory mrs jarsell we have little to exercise our memories in this dull place said the woman graciously and with a motherly air you dont ask after miss armour i observe that is very unkind of you as you are a great favorite with her miss armour is my very good friend responded halliday cautiously and so are you since you induced mr vincent to lend me the aeroplane i am as glad that i did that as i am sorry you lost the race mr halliday fortune of war said dan lightly we cant always be successful you know mrs jarsell i wish you had seen the start it was grand i wish i had said the woman lying glibly but it was impossible for me to leave miss armour on that day as she had bad health in fact mr vincent wished to go also and see how his machine worked but he could not get away either still added mrs jarsell with a cheerful air perhaps it is as well so far as i am concerned that i could not go aviation seems to be very dangerous and i should have been afraid for your safety oh i shall never come to harm in the air i hope responded dan with emphasis you must let me take you up some day mrs jarsell shuddered i should be terrified out of my wits she protested fancy a heavy woman such as i am trying to emulate a bird why i am quite sure i would fall and smash like an egg even supposing there is any machine capable of bearing my none too trifling weight oh i think there is mrs jarsell some machines can carry two you know and lately in france an aviator took five or six people from one given point to another it is quite safe mrs jarsell shook her head seriously i think not since aviation is yet in its infancy in five years if i live as long i may venture but nowno thank you mr halliday most ladies are afraid certainly even miss moon who is plucky will not let me take her for a fly miss moon of course i was quite forgetting her i hope you will bring her to see me and miss armour if she stays here certainly but i think of returning to town tomorrow so i may not be able to bring her i daresay mrs bolstreath will however ended dan quite certain in his own mind that the chaperon would find some good excuse to avoid the visit i shall be delighted mrs jarsell murmured vaguely how have you been mr halliday since i saw you last it seemed to dan that she asked this question with intention and he was entirely willing to give her a frank answer in frankness as in taking lillian under the guns of the enemy lay the safety of both halliday was convinced of this i have been rather worried he said slowly and with a sideglance at mrs jarsells watchful face i had an adventure i love adventures replied the woman heavily and this one well i was hustled into a taxicab and carried in a drugged condition to some place where i met with a collection of scoundrels a kind of murdergang you might call it who slay blackmail and thieve for the sake of power rather a strange reason said mrs jarsell equably and not at all moved i should say the reason was for money that with power explained dan but indeed this society appears to be governed on wonderful principles such as one would ascribe to honest men in what way mrs jarsell was quite curious in a detached manner well the members are chaste and sober and industrious they must be virtuous you are describing a society of saints quite so only these saints apply their virtues to crime they have a head who is called queen beelzebub mrs jarsell shuddered and drew lines on the dust of the road with her cane slowly and carefully did you see her she asked its a horrid name full of horrid possibilities no i did not see her or anyone said dan frankly the room was in darkness save for a red light around queen beelzebubs mask oh this person wore a mask how did you know she was a woman well you see the name is queen beelzebub that might be taken by a man to hide the truth it might admitted the other carelessly and indeed i dont think that any woman would have the nerve to belong to such a gang i agree with you said mrs jarsell gravely well and what happened i was asked by queen beelzebub to join the gang and share the profits which you may guess are large i have a month to think over the matter mrs jarsell looked at him keenly surely you would never belong to such an organization she said with a reproachful tone in her heavy voice oh i dont know i have my own axe to grind like other people and if this gang helps me to grind it i may consider the offer do i shock you mrs jarsell your voice sounded as though i did you shock me more than i can say she replied decisively that an honest man should even think of such a thing is dreadful this gang should be denounced to the police i wonder you have not done so already dan shook his head and admired the cool clever way in which she was playing a very dangerous game though to be sure she was far from suspecting he guessed her connection with queen beelzebub i cant do that yet what do you mean byyet questioned mrs jarsell and this time there was a distinct note of alarm in her voice i risk death if i denounce the gang not only to myself but to miss moon i am sure she and i would be killed as her father was killed if i moved in the matter also i am not sure of many things mrs jarsell still drawing patterns spoke thoughtfully i dont think you are wise to speak of this gang if it is so dangerous even to a country mouse such as i am of course i shall say nothing as i have no one to say anything to and if i had i should not speak but if you talk to a stranger like me about things you were told to keep secret you or miss moon may be murdered i thought so a week ago admitted halliday candidly then you dont think so now no not since marcus penn died mrs jarsell drew a long breath and wriggled uneasily who is marcus penn well he was the secretary of sir charles moon and afterwards he was the secretary of lord curberry now hes a corpse oh cried mrs jarsell suddenly i wish you wouldnt talk of these horrible things has this gang murdered him finished the young man yes i believe so although a verdict of suicide was brought in but poor penns death may be the means of saving me and miss moon indeed the womans tone became harsh and imperative but she did not ask any questions yes he left a confession even the sideglance dan sent in mrs jarsells direction showed him that her olive cheeks had turned to a dead white however she said nothing although she moistened her lips slowly so he went on easily as if he were telling an idle story this confession was concealed in lord curberrys house but penn sent a note of its whereabouts to miss moon who told me i got the confession and placed it in safe keeping that was wise said mrs jarsell with an effort and the safe keeping oh i shall only tell the whereabouts of the confession and the name of the person who holds it when there is no necessity for the confession to be used i dont see quite what you mean mr halliday well you see mrs jarsell i have to protect myself and miss moon from the machinations of the society the person who holds the confession will not open the sealed envelope in which it is placed unless something happens to miss moon or to myself therefore so long as no member of the gang hurts us the secrets of the gang are quite safe to his attentive ear it seemed that mrs jarsell drew a long breath of relief with a command of herself which did her credit she displayed no emotion but observed playfully it is very clever of you and very wise to guard yourself in this way certainly the gang cannot hurt you in any way so long as there is danger of the confession being opened in the event of things happening to you or to miss moon suppose the confession is a very dreadful one mr halliday it is not so dreadful or so full as i should like it to be said dan in his calmest manner but there is sufficient set down to warrant the interference of the authorities if that confession comes into the hands of the scotland yard officials they can lay hands on the gang he was bluffing when he said this as he was not quite sure if curberry had not let mrs jarsell know that the confessionas curberry thoughthad been destroyed i think the police should know said mrs jarsell rising thank you for nothing said dan following her example but if i move in the matter i run the risk of death besides i may accept the offer of the society who knows dont do that implored mrs jarsell so earnestly that dan was convinced curberry had not told her of any confession its so wicked perhaps it is however if the society leave me and miss moon alone the confession wont be opened and the gang is safe otherwise otherwise the whole association will be exposed to the danger of arrest said mrs jarsell lightly well it sounds all very dreadful to a country lady as i am i wish you had not told me why did you tell me because said dan ironically i look upon you as a friend mrs jarsells face cleared and she smiled i am your friend she said in an emphatic way and believe me when i say that i am sure miss moon is safe thank you replied dan agreeably i am sure also then they parted with mutual compliments smiles and handshakes chapter xvii at bay when dan left mrs jarsell he was very well pleased with the promise she had given concerning the safety of lillian he fully believed that she in her role of queen beelzebub would keep that promise faithfully if only because her own interests demanded such honesty the fact that the confession of penn was in the hands of a third party to be made use of should anything happen to miss moon prevented the society of flies from carrying out the threat made to him at the secret meeting to save their own lives the members would be forcedmuch against their will no doubtto spare those of lillian and himself dan chuckled at the way in which he had circumvented the deadly organization but he had only scotched the snake he had not killed it and until he did so there was always that chance that it would strike when able to do so with safety but while penns confession remained in laurances hands all was well one thing struck halliday as strange and that was the persistence with which mrs jarsell kept up the comedy of havingnothingtodowiththematter during so confidential a conversation she knew that penn had been a doubtful member of her gang she knew that he had been despatchedas dan truly believedbecause he was not to be trusted and now she knew that he had left a confession behind him which was in the hands of her enemies also she was aware that the man who spoke to her had read the confession and must have guessed that her name as queen beelzebub was mentioned therein this being the case it is to be presumed that she would speak freely but in place of doing so she had pretended ignorance and for his own ends he had humored her feigning either she doubted that such a confession existed or she guessed in whose possession it was and intended to regain it queen beelzebub knows well enough that freddy is my best friend thought dan as he returned to the peacock hotel and it would be reasonable for her to believe that he had penns confession which is certainly the case i should not be at all surprised if freddy was inveigled into a trap as i was so that he might be forced to surrender the document or rather what remains of it if that were managed queen beelzebub would revenge herself on lillian and on me since there would be nothing left to shield us from her spite and in any case freddy is in danger as i am certain she guesses that he holds the confession he mused for a few moments and then added aloud i shall return to town at once and see him the more he thought the more he saw the necessity of doing this mrs jarsells first move to counterplot him would be to seek out lord curberry and learn what she could relative to what penn had left behind him certainly curberry would assure her that he had burnt the confession in which case queen beelzebub would think that she would be free to act but halliday believed she was of too suspicious a nature to be quite convinced that he had only bluffed before taking any steps she would decidedly ascertain for certainalthough in what way it was difficult to sayif there really was any compromising document in laurances hands to do so she would as dan had thought a few minutes before set a trap for him and browbeat him into stating what he knew and what he held therefore for freddys sake it was necessary to go to london and report in detail the conversation on the moor then the two could arrange what was best to be done they were dealing with a coterie of daring scoundrels who would stop at nothing to secure their own safety and it behoved them to move warily we are walking on a volcano was hallidays concluding reflection of course as it was useless to alarm the ladies dan said nothing of his meeting with queen beelzebub on the moor however on being questioned he confessed the sudden thought which had sent him out of doors and both lillian and mrs bolstreath agreed that it was entirely probable that mrs jarsell did travel in uptodate aeroplanes like a mischiefmaking fairy then in turn they told him that mildred had stayed for quite a long time and was altogether more charming each time she appeared she suggested many trips and mrs bolstreath was inclined to stay at sheepeak longer than she intended in spite of the near menace of queen beelzebub lillian was delighted with the lovely scenery so gracious after the drab hues of london i dont see why we shouldnt get a house here after we are married she said to her lover one of those delicious old manor houses of faded yellow stone i could live quietly with mrs bolstreath while you ran up to business on your aeroplane and all the time you would be fretting lest any harm came to him said the chaperon shaking her head besides my dear when you are married you wont want me to be with you dear bolly i shall always want you and so will dan nonsense said mrs bolstreath briskly twos company and threes none well remarked halliday leisurely we can settle the matter when we are married lillian remember before your uncle will consent i shall have to discover who murdered your father you have discovered who murdered him it was the false mrs brown who is mrs jarsell who is queen beelzebub so i believe but i have to prove my case said dan dryly and moreover i wont find it easy to place the woman in the dock when she has this accursed society at the back of her you dont think there is danger asked lillian hastily no no no things are safer than ever my dear i go to town this evening and can leave you here with the certainty that all is well you go to town this evening said mrs bolstreath anxiously isnt that a very sudden resolution oh i think not answered dan in an easy way i came down here only to settle you and lillian by the way sir john i wired our address and he wrote me interrupted mrs bolstreath he is quite pleased that we are away i rather think the lady added thoughtfully that sir john is not illpleased we are away at his age the constant presence of two women in his house is rather disconcerting finding we had left town he returned there to enjoy his own house to himself in that case said dan cheerfully he will be glad to see lillian married but to lord curberry not to you i would die rather than marry lord curberry said lillian decisively and with her chin in the air you wont be asked to do either one or the other my dear replied dan in his calmest tone we shall marry right enough whatever opposition sir john may make as to lord curberry he hesitated well asked mrs bolstreath impatiently i intend to see him when i return to town i think it will be as well better have a complete understanding with him so that he will not worry lillian any more he wont answered dan grimly and now i shall have to get away i see mrs pelgrin has had the trap brought round take care of lillian lillian kissed her lover and followed him to the door of the sittingroom with a gay laugh lillian can look after herself she said lightly i am not afraid of mrs jarsell or of anyone else but you take care dan i fear much more for you than for myself im all right dan with an englishmans dislike for an emotional scene kissed the girl again and slipped out of the door they saw him drive away in the gloom of the evening and then settled to make themselves comfortable neither lillian nor mrs bolstreath would admit as much but both felt rather downcast at dans sudden departure luckily as he had been so cool and composed they did not connect it with any fresh development likely to give trouble in some vague way mrs bolstreath guessed that dan had spiked the guns of the enemy under which they were encamped and her certainty of safety being infectious lillian also felt quite at her ease meanwhile dan reached the beswick station in the ramshackle trap and was lucky enough to catch the ingoing train to thawley just as it started to glide past the platform the fortunate connection enabled him to board the seventwenty express to london where he hoped to arrive shortly before eleven that same evening knowing that laurances work kept him up late at night he wired from thawley asking him to come to st pancras station important as was freddys time dan knew that he would respond to the call at once knowing that large issues would be the outcome of the present situation therefore as the train dropped south halliday felt quite comfortable as he had done all he could to arrange matters for the moment indeed so assured did he feel that he had taken all possible precautions that he did not even trouble to think over the matter but fell asleep and refreshed his weary brain and body only when the train arrived at st pancras did he tumble out sleepy still to catch a sight of his faithful friend on the platform nothing wrong asked laurance hurrying up nothing wrong responded dan with a yawn but i have much to talk to you about get a fourwheeler a taxi you mean i dont mean i wish to travel as slowly as possible so as to explain matters tell the man to drive to the moment office there i can drop you and go on to my rooms thus understanding the situation freddy selected a shaky old cab drawn by a shaky old horse and the rate at which it progressed through the brilliantly lighted streets was so slow that they were a very long time arriving at the moment office in fleet street in the dampsmelling interior of this antique conveyance halliday now quite alert and clearheaded gave his friend a full account of all that had happened particularly emphasizing the interview with mrs jarsell hm commenced freddy when he ended so she didnt give herself away no and very wisely too i think she didnt know how much i knew and wasnt keen on giving me rope to hang her but she knows you have read penns confessionwhat there is of it i didnt tell her that i had anything else than the full confession old son she may think i have the whole document intact orand this i fancy is probableshe may believe that there isnt any confession in existence curberry may have written to her telling her that he burnt the confession no said dan after a pause i really dont think he has done that mrs jarsell went dead white when i mentioned a confession then she believes that you spoke the truth persisted laurance hopefully she may or she may not as i said before retorted halliday anyhow as she cant be sure if im in jest or earnest she will delay proceedings until she sees curberry if he swears that he burnt the confession mrs jarsell may act therefore i want you to send him an unsigned telegram containing these three words all is discovered what will that do put the fear of god into curberry into queen beelzebub and into the society of flies as a whole the warning will be so vague that they wont know who will strike the blow they will suspect you dan in that case replied halliday promptly queen beelzebub will leave lillian alone and my object will be obtained i want to gain time and can only do so with safety to lillian by keeping these beasts in a state of uncertainty as to how much or how little is known i see laurance thought the plan a good one since you say that you have the confession and curberry will say that he destroyed it queen beelzebub will be undecided this telegram like a bolt from the blue will clinch matters and make her and her gang pause before they take steps to hurt you or miss moon ill send the wire what then thentomorrow that isi go down to see curberry and have it out with him his name is mentioned in the portion of the confession which you hold and we know enough to ensure his arrest that is doubtful protested freddy thoughtfully i have read the confession penn hints a lot about curberry but doesnt say enough to never mind he says enough for my purpose which is to scare curberry belonging to the society of flies as he does i believe he got his uncle and cousin put out of the way to inherit the title and property ill harp on that string if queen beelzebub calls theres the danger dan interposed freddy quickly and anxiously i know i am far from suggesting that there is not danger as we are driving these people into a corner if i dont turn up at your office by five oclock tomorrow freddy or if i dont send a wire saying that i am safe you get inspector tenson tell him all show him the confession and come down with him to blackheath to see the inspector who had charge of the durwin murder then armed with the authority of the law you can go to curberrys house if i am missing you will know how to act laurance drew a deep breath as the cab turned into fleet street its a big risk for you dan pooh as an aviator i am always taking risks i must settle this business somehow if i wish to marry lillian and save her life as well as my own from these infernal beasts here you get down freddy dont forget to do as i tell you and laurance promised to faithfully adhere to his instructions while the fourwheeler lumbered away in the direction of the strand halliday possessed one of those rare natures which invariably reveal their best in time of danger he knew what to say and how to act when in a tight corner and his training as an aviator had learned him to take risks from which less levelheaded men would have shrunk at the present moment he required all his energies to cope with unforeseen emergencies since he did not quite know what action would be taken against him of course he was confident that some sort of action would be taken since he had aroused the wrath of a brilliantly clever and intensely evil set of people fearful for their own safety the society of flies would do its best to get rid of him and to get rid of lillian as they had gotten rid of others who had stood in their crooked path both he and the girl were safeguarded so far by the confession but it all depended upon what curberry said to queen beelzebub as to how long such a safeguard would be efficacious he had told the woman one story but curberry would tell her another so it was doubtful which she would believe the telegram from an unknown source might turn the balance in his favor and lead both mrs jarsell and her friend to believe that there was a chance of their devilish doings coming to light having arrived at this conclusion dan fell asleep quite indifferent to the fact that the sword of damocles hung over his head and that the single hair might part at any moment herein he showed the steadiness of his nerves and the value of a nature trained to face the worst smilingly next morning halliday arose brisk and cheerful with the expectation of having a most exciting day and as soon as he finished his breakfast made his way by train to blackheath on arriving there somewhere about twelve oclock he did not go immediately to curberrys house but walked to the place where the vincent aeroplane was housed it had just struck him that mrs jarsell might have wired to one of her friends to damage the machine so that it could not be used she had procured it for him and heto put it plainlyhad abused her friendship so it was not likely she would permit him to retain unharmed a wonderful airship with which he could make money and win fame but when he reached the shed and saw the man whom he had engaged to watch the machine he found that his fears were groundless no one had been near the place and so far as he could ascertain the aeroplane was in perfect condition then it struck dan as it was yet too early to call on lord curberry that he might indulge in a little fly his enemys house was only a stones throw distant on the borders of the open space and halliday did not intend to lose sight of the entrance gate lest mrs jarsell should steal in unobserved in the air and hovering directly over the grounds he could see all who came and went also incidentally he might gain information as to what was going on in the gardens somewhat oddly it occurred to him that if queen beelzebub came she might push curberry into the ornamental pond as marcus penn had been pushed there was no knowing what she might do in her despair in brutal english queen beelzebub was at bay and could fight like the rat she was in the corner into which she was being slowly driven by circumstances engineered by mr daniel halliday therefore dan saw to the fittings of the biplane and ascertained by sight and touch that they had not been tampered with he oiled the engine saw that it did not lack petroleum and in fact was as careful of all and everything connected with the structure as though he was preparing for a long race of course there was the usual crowd of loafers who came to see him start and he swept upward from the ground in a graceful curve the aeroplane acted easily and truthfully according to its very excellent design and the aviator after making a wide circle dropped down to pass slowly over the grounds of curberrys mansion he could see no one about even though the day was fine and sunny so concluded that the owner having received the anonymous telegram was shivering within doors terrified to venture out in his impatience to learn the absolute truth dan turned his machine back to the shed and came to rest almost at the very door owing to the examination of the aeroplane and the experimental flight to test its working order time had passed uncommonly swiftly and it was now fifteen minutes past one oclock dan made up his mind to beard curberry in his library without waiting for the arrival of queen beelzebub who after all might not arrive his man and some willing onlookers wheeled the machine into the great shed and the doors were about to be closed when one of the crowd uttered an exclamation which was echoed by many others halliday always on the alert for the unexpected came quickly to the door of the building and saw everyone looking upward and northward to where a small black dot spotted the blue of the sky it increased in size rapidly and there was no difficulty in seeing that it was a flyingmachine at once a thought entered dans mind that there was mrs jarsell on a vincent biplane paying her expected visit although he had no reason to suppose that she was the pilot wondering if he was right or wrong in his surmise he waited with a fastbeating heart and became certain of the truth of his guess very shortly travelling at a great height the strange biplane poised itself directly over the open space and then began to drop slowly into the enclosed grounds of lord curberrys mansion not having fieldglasses halliday could not make out if the pilot was a man or a woman but when the machine cleverly managed disappeared below the trees and walls of the park he was convinced that queen beelzebub had arrived at once he determined to make a third at her interview with curberry whatever objections might be raised but first he arranged what to do in order to guard against future events of a dangerous nature wheel my machine out again he ordered the man and those who had assisted see that everything is in order and have everything prepared to start do not let anyone touch this and he tapped the aeroplane you understand yes sir said the man stolidly youre going for another fly exactly the person who arrived is a friend of mine i am going into yonder house to ask if a race can be arranged knowing that he could trust his man to guard the machine and certain it would not be tampered with when hundreds of eyes were watching it halliday walked across the open space with serene confidence it struck him that if mrs jarsell wished to escape she would certainly use her biplane and it was just as well to follow in his own and run her to earth as both machines were made by vincent the speed of each would be about equal and in any case dan hoped to keep queen beelzebub in sight if it was necessary to give chase having thus prepared for possible emergencies the young man entered the big gates of the park and hastened up the short avenue soon he found himself at the front door and as he rang the bell glanced around for mrs jarsells flyingmachine it was not visible so he presumed she had left it on the broad and spacious lawn on the further side of the house it was in his mind to go and tamper with the engine to prevent her further flight but before he could make up his mind to this course the door opened and the footman appeared i wish to see lord curberry said halliday giving the man his card on most important business can he see me ill inquire sir he is with a lady just now and has been for the last ten minutes please wait here sir and he introduced dan into the hall again when left alone halliday had the impulse to go out and look to the gear of the machine with the idea of putting things wrong and again the footman appeared before he could decide if it would be wise to do so his lordship will see you sir said the man who looked rather uncomfortable but he seems to be ill ill echoed dan wondering what new deviltry was taking place and the lady she is not with his lordship now sir said the footman in a bewildered manner yet i showed her into the library a few minutes ago do you know the lady asked halliday sharply no sir at least i cant tell sir she came in one of them flyingmachines and wears a thick veil shes a stout lady sir with a sharp manner take me to your master commanded dan not caring to ask further questions since it was best to ask them of lord curberry himself and the man obeyed still bewildered and nervous in his manner the entrance of queen beelzebub into the house had evidently upset things ushered into the library dan waited for the closing of the door and then advanced to where curberry was seated at his desk near the window the man looked gaunt and haggard and very sick when the young man advanced he rose as if moved by springs and held out a telegram in a trembling hand youyousent this quavered curberry and halliday could see that the perspiration beaded his bald high forehead in a flash halliday guessed that this was the wire which laurance had dispatched according to arrangement no i did not send you any telegram he denied calmly and with perfect truth you sent this saying that all is discovered stuttered curberry again and dropped back into his seat you have learned too much she says that you know everything queen beelzebub ah you know the name i guessed as much she is here she is furious who is queen beelzebub demanded dan anxiously you know why do you ask questions you know the answer to i know why you have come to have me arrested i thought i destroyed the confession of that infernal penn but she says i retained sufficient to show me yes yes you know all you have won i fought you for lillian and there is no chance of my gaining her for my wife you wont either you have to reckon with queen beelzebub as for meas for me he faltered and trembled dan stepped right up to the desk whats the matter iii have taken poison gasped curberry and dropped his head on his hands with a sob chapter xviii the flight poison echoed dan startled out of his composure for he was far from expecting such a word the doctor no doctor can do me any good sobbed curberry lifting his haggard face and looking up with wild despairing eyes there is no antidote to this drug i have taken it is painless more or less and in an hour i shall be dead as it works but slowly time enough for me to speak let me get a doctor insisted halliday for so distraught did the man look that he was not surprised that the servant had been uncomfortable you must not die without curberry struggled to his feet and laid hands on his visitor no no i am ready to die he said in a harsh strained voice why should i be kept alive to be hangedto be disgracedto be then you admit i admit everything in thisthis he touched a few loose sheets of paper lying on the desk this confession like penn i have made one you must have a doctor said halliday and ran to the bell curberry with a wonderful strength seeing how ill he looked rose swiftly and sprang after him if you call a doctor i shall shoot myself he said hoarsely and pulled out a small revolver i would rather die by means of the poison i have taken since it is more painless but sooner than be taken by the police i shall shoot myselfand you tooand you too halliday waived aside this threat you wont see the police the doctor would try to save me insisted curberry fiercely and i will not be saved only to be hanged stay here and listen to me i have something to say touch the button of the bell and i shoot as he spoke he levelled the revolver quick quick what will you do have your own way agreed halliday and moved to the desk where he sat down on a convenient chair curberry with a groan returned to his seat and laid the revolver on the blotting paper ready for instant use should necessity arise even as yet he did not wholly trust halliday and there was cause for his suspicion since dan was unarmed he could do nothing against a man with a quickfiring weapon but he made up his mind to snatch at the revolver the moment curberry was off his guard yet even as he decided upon this course he said to himself that it was foolish the mans recovery supposing a doctor did arrive meant the mans arrest and in dans opinion as in curberrys death was better than disgrace it was a most uncomfortable situation but halliday did not see anything to do but to listen to what his host had to say the poor wretch had poisoned himself and was keeping all help at bay with his revolver he would be dead in an hour or half an hour as he hinted so the best thing was to hear his story in the hope that by its means those who had brought him to this pass could be punished but it was a weird experience to sit beside a tormented man who declined to be saved from a tragic death did queen beelzebub give you the poison asked halliday shivering at the gray pinched look on curberrys face long ago long ago not now muttered the man groaning every member of the society of flies has this poison to escape arrest should there be danger it is a painless poison more or less and acts slowly andbut i have told you all this before there is not much time he pressed his hands on his heart while i retain my strength and my senses listen but where is this woman you call queen beelzebub demanded dan looking round anxiously i saw her arrive in an aeroplane she did she came to tell me that you knew all about our society you belong to it yes curse it and those who dragged me into the matter i was getting on all right in the law when i was tempted and fell your uncle and your cousin yes yes broke in curberry with another groan she said that if i joined the society they could be got rid of they were got rid of because i wished for the title and the money but for what reason so that i could marry lillian moon refused to listen to me so long as i was merely a struggling barrister but when i became wealthy andandoh this pain the poison is a lie like all the rest of the business she declared it was painless and nowand now he broke off to wipe the perspiration from his face dan half rose let me call assistance it may not be too late curberry pointed his revolver at him as he moved it is too late he said setting his teeth if i do not die i must face the worst youyou have brought me to this i echoed halliday sitting down again in what way you meddled and meddled andand you sent that telegram i did not then your meddling has brought the police into the matter that telegram may have been sent by a friend or an enemy in either case it is true for all is discovered i was curberry gasped with pain again and moistened his dry lips i was sitting with it wondering if it was best to end things or to wait and see if the warning was a true one then she came in through yonder door he nodded towards the entrance from the terrace into the library she told me that youthat youohoh he groaned and rocked himself from side to side yet kept a grip on the revolver lest dan should call or ring for assistance or endeavor to secure the weapon so you took the poison said halliday wondering how he could manage to evade being shot and summon a doctor when she said that all was known i did then sheshe queen beelzebub you mean curse her yes like eve she tempted me and like adam i fell where is she up in penns old rooms searching for any further confession he may have left oh curberry rocked and moaned i thought when i snatched it from you and burnt it that all evidence was destroyed i saved a few sheets do they contain mention of my name yes they do and i thought so i thought so its just as well that i took poison the title and money i paid such a price to obtain will go to my cousin who is at oxforda young fool with no brains oh to lose all when everything was so bright i could have married lillian and served my country and you could not have married lillian interrupted dan positively for she loves me and me only as to serving your country how could you with an easy conscience when you have broken its law by taking the lives of your uncle and cousin i did not the society saw to that gasped curberry with a twisted grin you engaged the society to end their lives youyoumurderer dont call names moaned the man at least i have not murdered you although i have every reason to you meddled with matters which do not concern you i meddled in matters which concern every honest man who loves law and order lord curberry said dan sternly apart from the death of sir charles moon which i was bound to avenge for lillians sake it was my duty to stop this wholesale murder perhaps you had moon killed yourself i didnt i didnt it was to my interest that he should live for if he had i should have been married to his daughter by this time queen beelzebub murdered him because he was offered a chance of belonging to the society and refused in that said dan sternly acting as an honest man he acted as a foolish man for learning too much he sent for durwin to reveal what he knew penn found out his intended treachery and told the queen she cameyou saw her when she cameand she killed him she killed durwin yes gasped curberry who was growing whiter and more haggard every moment and marcus penn i killed him i had to or be killed myself he betrayed too much to you only out of fear said dan looking at the murderer more with pity than with anger for he was suffering greatly not even fear should have made him reveal anything about the scent he confessed his folly and was doomed to death i went away on that day and then came back secretly having ordered penn to meet me by the ornamental water to speak about the society he suspected something because he wrote that confession and let lillian know where it was concealed but he came and i managed to stupefy him with the sumatra scent after which i thrust him under water and when i was sure he was dead i got away secretly returning openly to hear that his body had been found you wicked wretch said dan scarcely able to restrain his disgust although he felt he should not be too hard on one already being severely punished for his crimes dont call names said curberry with an attempt at a laugh after all i am better than you think since i am trying to save you i want you to live and marry lillian and keep this confession he laid his hands on the loose sheets of paper from queen beelzebub so that you can put an end to her wicked doings hide the papers when she comes back or she will destroy them as this was very probable dan stretched out his hand for the papers curberry feverishly gathered them together speaking in a halting manner as he did so wait till i put them together he said painfully this is a full account of my connection with the society and its evil doings it accounts for the death of moon of durwin of penn and of myself but take care halliday for queen beelzebub will not give in without a fight she can do nothing said dan watching curberry pinning the loose papers together laurance has what remains of penns confession and will inform the police shortly if you would let me get a doctor no no no i refuse to live and face the reward of my wickedness i prefer to pay the cost of my folly in joining the society my name is disgraced but i wont be on earth to suffer for the disgrace that brainless young fool who succeeds me will not trouble you so long as he gets the money and the title which he is certain to but marry lillian and take care of her queen beelzebub will strike at you through her she dare not while i hold the confession of penn said dan grimly sooner or later she shall stand in the dock that she never will believe me she has a means of escape if the worst comes to the worst oh curberry half rose and then fell back in his chair the end is coming my eyes are growing dim andandah he uttered a shriek save yourself and with a shaking hand he grasped the revolver as curberrys eyes were looking past him dan with the subconscious instinct of selfpreservation had just time to rise and swerve to one side when a hand grazed his shoulder the young man gripped his chair and swung it up as a barrier between himself and a stout woman who was immediately behind him she was dressed in a long black cloak with a closefitting cloth cap and wore a heavy veil of the motor style with pieces of mica let in as eyeholes not a word did she say but seeing dans action drew back with a deep indrawn breath like the hiss of a baffled snake take care take care she hasthe serpent poison gasped curberry who was sitting loosely in his chair gripping his revolver halliday remembered the wicked wound on sir charles moons neck and his flesh grew cold for the slightest touch of that morsel of shining steel in queen beelzebubs hand meant swift death you fiend he shouted and with a cry of anger flung the heavy chair fairly at her with the leap of a pantheress she sprang to one side and the chair crashed against the opposite wall while the woman glided rapidly round to the open door of the terrace a shot rang out as she reached it and dan knew that the dying man had fired on his enemy apparently the bullet did not reach its mark for queen beelzebub still moved on silent sinister and dangerous halliday flung himself forward to get between her and the door so as to prevent her escape but with a faint snarl like a beast at bay she stabbed at him with the deathtips piece of steel he leaped back to save himself from being scratched while curberry dragged himself painfully to the bellbutton near the fireplace and pressed it with his remaining strength im done forcall the police youyou oh he fell prone on the hearthrug and the revolver dropped beside him halliday ran forward on the impulse of the moment to offer aid hastily picking up the weapon meanwhile and as he did so queen beelzebub sprang through the door into the open shes making for the aeroplane cried dan and would have followed on the instant but that curberry gripped him fast stay stay a priest a clergyman im dying and a deadly fear became apparent in his glazed eyes get aaa help as he cried retaining dans coat in a grip of iron the door of the room opened and the butler with the footman beside him rushed in the shot as well as the ringing of the bell had brought them immediately to the spot trying to disengage himself dan gave hasty orders send for a doctor send for a clergyman send for the police that woman has murdered your master catch her stop herohoh curberrys grip loosened and he rolled over with a moan whether he was dead or alive dan did not wait to see every moment was precious if he intended to stay the flight of queen beelzebub the terrified men came to assist their dying master and more servants attracted by the noise poured in at the library door a backward glance showed dan that curberry was being attended to and then he sped along the terrace towards the lawn at the side of the house here he arrived just a moment too late for already the aeroplane was spinning along the turf with queen beelzebub in the pilots seat like the wicked fairy of nursery tale she was escaping in her dragoncar and even in that hour of success she did not utter a sound silent and menacing she mounted into the air and halliday dashed forward with a cry of rage as she lifted above his reach there was not a moment to be lost and without another glance he raced down the avenue and made for the entrance gates queen beelzebub might make for her lair in hillshire or it might be that she would cross the channel to seek safety on the continent but wherever she went dan intended to follow she would not escape him this time and he flew like an arrow from the bow across from the open space outside the park to where his man still stood guard by his own machine the little crowd around had their faces turned heavenward and were shouting at the sight of the biplane now dwindling to a black dot as it receded swiftly from blackheath dan felt a throb of satisfaction as he saw that queen beelzebub was making for the north out of the way out of the way gasped the young man charging through the throng and it scattered at his approach let her go let her go and he sprang into the pilots seat to start the engine immediately the screw began to spin slowly at first but gathering in speed every second the aeroplane moved and ran with birdlike swiftness along the ground then soared with the hum of a giant bee halliday swept in a vast circle like an actor taking the stage then turned the nose of his machine in the direction of the black dot this was to be his polestar towards which he was to continually direct his course until the goal wherever it might be was attained the many men women and children standing round the blackheath shed shouted and cheered thinking that they were witnessing the start of an exciting race but they little knew that it was a chase dealing with the serious issues of life and death halliday heard the thin sound of their voices reach him faintly then settled down to handle his biplane in a masterly manner since both aeroplanes were made by vincent it was probable that both were equal in durability and speed but queen beelzebub had gained a very fair start and dan knew that it would require all his knowledge of aviation to catch her up her escape or capture depended entirely upon the dexterity with which he manoeuvered the delicate structure which bore him on her part the woman would use all her knowledge to get away safely but dan did not believe that her capability as an aeronaut was equal to his own in this contest it was science against despair and given the machines as equal yet the pilots as unequal it was hard to say what would be the result halliday racing to save lillians life and to gain her as his wife believed that the final victory would remain with him it was an unusually pleasant day with a pale blue sky lightly sprinkled with feathery white clouds a gentle wind was blowing which was not sufficiently strong to impede the speed of the aeroplanes yet it was chilly in these high altitudes and in his haste dan had not put on his overcoat before the end of the chase he grimly expected to be wellnigh frozen but did not mind so uncomfortable a prospect so long as he gained his aim before him fled the woman he was determined to capture and place in the criminal dock to answer for her manifold sins thinking of what she had done and how her path was strewn with victims the young man set his teeth and tried his best to force the pace but this was useless as the biplane could not do more than it was intended to do although he had now been racing northward for over an hour the distance between pursuer and pursued appeared to be much the same and the receding black dot did not seem to be growing larger dan was irritated yet felt that even though he was not gaining he was not losing and that was much taking all things into account there was always the chance that queen beelzebubs machine might break down and then she would be as helpless as a bird with a broken wing alsoand dan did not blind himself to this possibilityhis own aeroplane might come to grief as it had done during the london to york race but benefiting by his former experience he did not try any fancyflying and held to a straight undeviating course both machines were making a beeline for the goal which halliday now guessed very plainly was the grange in sheepeak hillshire it had been about two oclock when the chase started but already those taking part in it were miles upon miles distant from london since the aeroplanes were flying at the rate of between fifty and sixty miles an hour harrow st albans luton bedford and northampton had long since dropped behind and queen beelzebub swerving to the left was making for rugby so as to get into the straight line for hillshire and particularly for thawley passing over the famous schooltown the pace slackened somewhat and dan managed to secure the advantage of a few miles but when her machine lifted birmingham she increased her speed a fact which made dan curse he had been under the impression that she was running short of oil and petroleum but apparently this was not the case she had simply reduced her speed so as to nurse her resources since she could take this bold step because of the start she had gained at the outset halliday grudgingly confessed to himself that the woman knew her business as she wasted no time her machine neither rose nor fell nor deviated to right or left overmuch and all she did was to hold to a straight line at a moderate height above the earth humoring her engine and straining as little as might be the wings spars bolts and suchlike gear of the biplane vincent had taught her admirably and dan no longer undervalued her as an antagonist she was dexterous bold resourceful and venturesome his admiration now freely given was mixed with pity that so clever a human being should debase her gifts to harry mankind such qualities as she possessed made her more dangerous as she was an intellectual animal slaying with taught skill rather than with instinctive cunning as the afternoon drew on and the chase still continued the night began to shut down gliding over derby the town was veiled in the gray mists of swiftlyfalling dusk and when nottingham came in sight it was distinguished by a thousand glittering pinpoints of light the usual nightly illumination matlock and mansfield holdbrook and wayleigh gleamed beneath like jewelled crowns and when the stars began to appear the aeroplanes were flying between two firmaments radiant with multicolored orbs of light at last thawley rose into view burning like a furnace under its veil of smoke and the dim shroudings of twilight while a vague murmur like the swarming of bees came muffled to the ears of those who drove the machines yet at these heights the coming dark was not yet very intense and queen beelzebubs aeroplane beginning to slacken speed dan was able to keep it well in view he saw it rather vaguely closer at hand a shadow against the shadow of the gray sky minute by minute he drew nearer and began to discern the outlines more or less clearly but it must be admitted that at the best the clearness was not quite that which deserved the use of such a word however dan cold hungry and weary with the strain on his nerves could think of none better at the moment queen beelzebub was decidedly losing speed her machine seemed to falter after it left thawley as if it was doubtful how to find its way home in this world of shadows but at beswick the woman made a last effort as it seemed like a wounded animal dragging itself faster homeward as it neared its den and her aeroplane towered aloft to the vast tableland of the moors halliday was close behind and when they hovered over sheepeak the two biplanes were only a stone throw from one another he exulted for now he had driven the woman to her citadel and for her there was no escape even by her machine as that wasso to speakworn out she was at her last gasp and would have to fight or yield she elected to fight when the airships swung in the foggy air over the fields near the grange if she alighted queen beelzebub knew that her pursuer would alight also and capture her so she described a rapid circle with what motive power was left her and plunged downward on her enemy to ram his machine dan saw the movement and with his hand on the steering gear swerved to one side dropping lower as he did so the other machine swooped harmlessly overhead but recovering quickly once more came down with the dip of a hawk on a heron halliday dodged again then thinking that two could play at the dangerous game he watched his chance and rushed straightly at his prey queen beelzebub saw him coming and adopted his tacticsthat is she dropped below his onset and dans aeroplane swept on without result once more he came down to her level and by this time the machines were only twenty feet from the ground this time as he dashed forward the woman was not dexterous enough to get out of the way and the two clashed violently with a ripping breaking smashing sound with the engines still spinning but with broken wings the biplanes dropped to the earth tangled together dans uppermost clutching at its prey so to speak like a hawk clutching a partridge down they came and the rising earth met them with a smashing blow halliday was shaken but did not become unconscious clearing his feet and arms from the tangle of ropes and canvas he emerged from the confused heap and dragged out the woman by her dress which fluttered out from the wreckage to tear off her veil and light a match took a single minute miss armour cried dan greatly amazed and miss armour it was quite senseless chapter xix treachery in the chill gray gloom of the fields damp depressing and misty with the wreckage of the airship piled up around him and the insensible woman lying at his feet dan stood bewildered his nerves jangling like illtuned bells the twenty feet fall had not harmed him in limb or body but the violent contact with the earth broken in some measure by the fact that his enemys aeroplane had been underneath resulted in a displacement of his normal powers he felt battered and bruised deadly sick and wished to lie on the wet grass indifferent to everything and everyone but with a dangerous creature at his elbow this was not to be thought of even though that same creature was unable to exercise her wicked will moreover the grange was only a stones throw distant and doubtless mrs jarsell had been watching for the coming of her friend if this were the case she would come out with helpfor queen beelzebub that is how halliday would be treated he was much too muddled in his brain to consider finally he dropped on his knees longing for brandy to pull him together and began to think with difficulty this woman was not mrs jarsell but miss armour seeing that he knew her to be old feeble and paralyzed this was most remarkable curberry had called her queen beelzebub so miss armour and not mrs jarsell was the head of the society of flies and the cause of all the trouble in a weak way dan considered that she evidently was not so old as she had made herself out to be and certainly she was not paralyzed no woman without the use of her limbs could have escaped so swiftly or have worked the aeroplane so dexterously miss armour the delicate kindhearted old lady was the infernal queen beelzebub who had spoken behind the mask when in the darkness the scarlet light had made an accursed halo round her head and now she was deadstone dead a moments reflection assured him that he could not be certain on this point without examination so he tore open her dress and laid his hand on her heart it beat feebly so he knew that she was still alive although she was crumpled up in a heap amidst the wreckage this knowledge restored halliday more positively to his senses she was so dangerous that even helpless as she appeared to be he could not tell what devilry she might not make use of to get the upper hand she still had the piece of steel tipped with the deadly snake poison and even a feeble woman could inflict death with that the idea made dan search in her pockets to secure the subtle weapon of defence but even while he fumbled and hunted he was pulled violently backward mr halliday gasped mrs jarsell holding a lantern to his white face hold him she added to a couple of men who were beside her iveive caught queen beelzebub redhanded muttered dan striving to get on his feet and thinking in a muddled way that mrs jarsell had seen the arrival of the aeroplanes the battle in the air and the catastrophe she must have come stealthily across the intervening fields with her myrmidons and thus he had been caught unawares he knew well that once in her grip since she was an accomplice of queen beelzebubs he could expect no mercy and what was worse lillian would be in danger he therefore in a weak way fought his best to escape if he could only reach mrs pelgrins hotel he would be safe but the men were too strong for him and he was beaten to his knees then what with the hunger that gnawed him the bitter cold the fall and the general surprise of the situation his senses left him he uttered a weary sigh and slipped to the ground limp and unconscious then again as had happened when penn had drugged him in the taxicab he felt himself swallowed up in gloom felt himself falling interminably and lost sight of the physical world and its surroundings to all intents and purposes he was dead and from the moment he closed his eyes in that misty meadow he remembered nothing more when his eyes opened again they shut at once for the blaze of light was painful dimly he fancied that he heard a telephonic voice give an order and he felt that some ardent spirit was being poured down his throat the fiery liquor put new life into him his heart began to beat more strongly and he felt that his weak limbs were regaining a fictitious strength with a thankful sigh he opened his eyes again and a bewildered look round made him understand that he was in the barbaric sittingroom of the grange he saw the violent contrasts of red and yellow and black he realized the glare and glitter and oppressive splendor of the many lamps and his nostrils were filled with the wellknown sumatra scent reason came back to him with a rush and he knew in what a dangerous position he was placed here he was in the power of queen beelzebub and her factotum mrs jarsellat their mercy completely as it were although he was assured that he would receive none at all he had hunted down the gang he was breaking up the gang and now in his hour of triumph he was at the mercy of the gang queen beelzebub was top tail and bottom of the society and he was in her grip she would not relax it he knew very well until the life was squeezed out of him the realization of his danger and the memory of what his helplessness meant to lillian nerved him to recover full control of his consciousness while there was life there was hope and as his captors had not murdered him while he was insensible dan concluded that they would not do so when he had recovered his wits queen beelzebub would play with him he fancied as a cat plays with a mouse and in that case he might find some means of escape so far he had beaten her all along the line and he might beat her still although she certainly held the winning cards at the moment as these things flashed across his brain he yawned and stretched himself looking round in a leisurely way as he did so still feeling a trifle stiff and sore his thinking powers were nevertheless in good working order as they at once responded to the command of his indomitable will therefore with wonderful selfcontrol he smiled amiably and stared into every corner in order to spy out the weakness of the land but he was being watched as he soon knew and his thought was read no snarled a silvery voice higher in tone than that of mrs jarsell i have you and i mean to keep you queen beelzebub alive and well and as completely in possession of her senses as he was sat in her big carved chair near the open fireplace just as she had sat when he paid that long distant visit with freddy laurance and mildred her face was as wrinkled as ever but instead of being of the ivory hue which had impressed him on a former occasion it was deadly white and looked particularly venomous her white hair had been smoothly brushed and she wore a loose cloak of scarlet velvet which fell to her feet but in the fall she had suffered since dan noticed that her right arm was bound up in bandages and splints resting in a black silk scarf against her breast his eyes fastened on this and miss armour laughed in a thin spiteful manner which hinted at the wrath that consumed her yes she said in answer to his mute query i have broken my arm thanks to you mr halliday you smashed my aeroplane and sent me to the ground that is what you tried to do with me said dan drily and settling himself comfortably in his chair since he felt convinced that he was in no immediate danger tit for tat queen beelzebub or shall i call you miss armour the real name or the feigned name doesnt matter rejoined the lady very coolly you can call me what you like for the time you have to live oh said halliday equally coolly and aware that the catandmouse torment was beginning so thats it is it mrs jarsell stood beside her friends chair and was handing her food in an anxious manner the large and ponderous woman looked like a child overcome with terror her eyes were sunken her cheeks were hollow and the immense vitality she possessed appeared to be at a very low ebb she was arrayed in white as usual but her garb was not so colorless as her face she even looked smaller than formerly and was shrunken in her clothes there was something pitiful in the spectacle of this large phlegmatic female broken down worn out and overcome with dread of the future as she attended to miss armour the tears rolled down her face which had so suddenly grown old the sight seemed to irritate the other woman who was much more frail but who had a much more powerful will dan saw in a flash that he had been mistaken in thinking that mrs jarsell was strong her strength lay in her imposing looks but she was the mere tool of that fragile delicate old lady whose glittering eyes revealed the iron will which dominated her weak ageworn body here indeed was the true queen beelzebub driven into a corner and prepared to fight to the last halliday felt with a creeping of the flesh that he had come to grips with an evil power which it would be desperately hard to conquer miss armour saw the shadow in his eyes youre afraid she taunted him dan agreed not physically you understand he said quietly but you seem to be so thoroughly wicked that the spiritual part of myself quails for the moment but it doesnt matter much you know seeing that you have much more cause to fear that i may shoot you at sight and he fumbled in his pocket for curberrys revolver which he had picked up when leaving the room i removed that when you were insensible gasped mrs jarsell wiping her eyes and turning a heavy white face in his direction of course said miss armour in a hard voice i ordered the search to be made in case you had any weapons now you are quite defenceless and at my mercy you meddling ape how long have i been insensible asked dan ignoring the feminine spite which led her to call him names for quite an hour sighed mrs jarsell whose great body was shaking as if with the ague i had you brought here along with miss armour you were both in a kind of faint now you are all right and and i am all right finished miss armour imperiously which is much more to the purpose better had you died when you fell from the aeroplane mr halliday than have recovered so completely as you seem to have done you mean mischief oh yes i mean mischief replied queen beelzebub amiably and i mean torture such as will make you wince ill prove what sort of a man you are you had better make haste then said dan with a shrug and bracing up his courage to beat this fiend with her own weapons by this time the police know all about curberry whats that to me the police cant connect me with his death not so far as you know but as my friend laurance promised to take action at five oclock if he did not hear from me i expect with the blackheath and hampstead inspectors he is now in lord curberrys house an explanation from him will soon bring the authorities to this den mrs jarsell burst into hysterical tears i knew there was great danger she wailed i knew the end had come and she sank at miss armours feet in a fit of despair the picture of a beaten woman oh shut up eliza said queen beelzebub savagely and her eyes glittered more venomously than ever you always play the fool when wits are needed to keep things straight you cant keep them straight said dan calmly lounging in his chair your career is at an end miss armour well see about that mr halliday oh you neednt look at me in that way my friend i still have the snakepoisoned lancet you know and if you try to spring on me even though my arm is broken you will meet with a sudden and unpleasant death i dont want to touch you retorted halliday i shall leave the hangman to finish you off that he never shall do snapped miss armour her eyes flashing and her nostrils dilating not one member of that glorious society i have founded shall ever be done to death by those accursed people in authority i and my subjects who obey me so loyally will vanish will you not while the ports and railway stations are watched sneered halliday with contempt and i dont think your friend vincent can supply aeroplanes in sufficient quantity for you all to get away even if you did by some extraordinary chance the world would be hunted for you it can be hunted from the north pole to the south mr halliday but neither the members of the society of flies nor its queen will be discovered we will be as if we had never been she concluded triumphantly and as she spoke the big woman sobbing at her feet shivered and shook and uttered a muffled cry of terror queen beelzebub kicked her get up eliza you fool she said contemptuously you know quite well that i have made ready for everything this long time but i dont want to if you say another word interrupted miss armour viciously you shall afford sport for this society as this meddling beast shall do dan laughed gaily determined not to show the white feather although his heart was filled with fear he did not mind a clean short sharp death but he did not wish to be tortured and mutilated as he believed this incarnate demon intended he should be curiously enough his laugh instead of exciting queen beelzebub to further wrath seemed to extort her unwilling admiration you are a brave man mr halliday she muttered reluctantly then burst out furiously oh you young fool why did you not accept the offer i made you the offer you prophesied in this very room would be made said halliday complacently well you see miss armour or queen beelzebub or whatever you like to call yourself i happen to have a conscience that is your weakness said the woman calmly throw it on the rubbish heap my friend it is useless now it is so far as joining your infernal organization is concerned i am quite sure tomorrow the police will be here and the society of flies will cease to exist that is possible and yet may not be probable mr halliday if the society does cease to exist it will not do so in the way you contemplate eliza added miss armour impatiently if you will sniff and howl go and do so in some other room i cant stand you just now my nerves are shaken and my arm is hurting me go away and leave you with mrs jarsell cast a terrified look at dan pooh cried queen beelzebub contemptuously you dont think that i am afraid of him i have the lancet with the snakepoison and if he tries to get out of the door or the window you know very well that every exit is watched go away and employ your time better than sobbing and moaning you know what you have to do you poor silly fool yes sighed mrs jarsell and stumbled towards the door like a rebuked infant ill send the telegrams before eight but the village postoffice will learn too much if i send them never mind the whole world will learn too much before tomorrow night my dear eliza however neither you nor i nor anyone else concerned will be here to get into trouble mrs jarsell threw her hands above her head the end has come the end has come she wailed tearfully we are lost lost lost i know that as well as you do said miss armour cheerfully thanks to this idiot here however he shall pay for his meddling but if the police if you dont get out interrupted queen beelzebub in a cold fury i shall prick you with the lancetyou know what that means it would be better than the other thing moaned mrs jarsell clinging to the door which she had opened what other thing inquired halliday on the alert for information queen beelzebub replied you shall know before you die eliza will you go and send those telegrams you silly fool if you dont obey me the womans face took on such a wicked expression that mrs jarsell with a piteous cry fled hastily closing the door after her then miss armour drank a little of the wine that was on the table beside her and looked smilingly at her prisoner i never could make anything of eliza she explained always a whimpering crybaby i wouldnt have had her in the society but that i wished to use this house which belongs to her and of course when we started her money was useful halliday being alone glanced around to see if he could escape he could not attack miss armour old and feeble as she was because of the poisoned piece of steel which she had concealed about her he had seen the effects on sir charles moon and did not wish to risk so sudden a death for the sake of lillian it was necessary that he should live since if he did not there was no one left to protect her therefore he did not think of meddling with queen beelzebub but cast an anxious look at windows and door escape that way was equally impossible as all were guarded there seemed to be nothing for it but to wait and take what chance offered itself later he could see none at the moment the position was unpleasant especially when he remembered that he was to be tortured but his manhood prevented his showing the least sign of fear to intimate that he cared nothing for her threats he took out his pipe and tobacco pouch do you mind my smoking miss armour not at all unless you would rather eat theres food on the table behind you oh she laughed when she saw the expression on his face as he glanced around dont be alarmed i dont intend to poison you that death will be too easy you can eat and drink and smoke with perfect safety i intend to end your life in a less merciful manner well said dan going to the table and taking a sandwich together with a glass of port wine i think you are spiteful enough to give me a bad time before dying so i am quite sure that i can eat and drink with safety oh what a pity what a pity said miss armour thoughtfully when the young man returned to his seat and began to make a hurried meal whats a pity asked dan carelessly that you and i should be enemies i gave you the chance to be friendly with me you know but you wouldnt take it yet i admire you and have always admired you you have courage brains coolness and persistence these are valuable qualities such as i needed for a member of my society if i had not seen that you possessed them and wished to make use of them by binding you to my society i should have ended your life long ago as sir charles moons life was ended as durwins life was cut short as penn was disposed of and as lord curberry was dispatched well no curberry poisoned himself because he feared that everything was about to come out as it will probably said queen beelzebub indifferently but there are yet some hours before the end no my friend you will not die like those you have mentioned your cleverness demands a more ingenious death you are a very clever woman said dan finishing his glass of port i am you will admire my cleverness when you she checked herself and laughed i knew a chinese mandarin once and he told me many things mr halliday you can guess what he told me something about torture said dan lighting his pipe quite so you go to the chinese to learn how to hurt a man i thought you were more original miss armour sneered isnt this indifference rather overdone mr halliday well it is a trifle im in a blue funk and can you blame me he shuddered a man doesnt like to die by inches you know however as we understand one another suppose we wile away the time by your telling me how you came to start this damned gang of yours my dear young friend i admire your courage so much that i can refuse you nothing mocked miss armour wincing as she moved her broken arm i really should be in bed with my hurt youll get feverish if you dont lay up dan advised her oh i dont think so i know about other drugs than the sumatra scent mr halliday of course a broken arm she added with a sigh cant be mended by all the drugs in the world time alone can put it right and thanks to you i shant have time to get cured if you had only fought with me instead of against me this would not have happened well my society yes what about your society questioned dan politely and easily queen beelzebub cast an admiring look in his direction and began to speak in a quiet ladylike manner as though she were presiding at a teatable and the subject of conversation was quite an ordinary one i was left an orphan at an early age she said leisurely poor and honest and friendless for years i led what you fools call a decent life earning my bread by going out as a governess but poverty and honesty did not please me especially since the first was the outcome of the last i never wished to marry as i did not care for men i did not wish for society or fame or flirtation or indeed anything a woman usually longs for i desired power and as she uttered the last word an infernal expression of pride came over her white and delicate face power for a bad purpose well you see mr halliday i could not get power for a good one the sole way in which i could obtain my ends was to appeal to peoples selflove i read of those italian societies and the way in which they terrorized the world whatever the members of those societies want they get because they work by blackmail by threats by the knife and with poison i always wished to found a society of that sort but i noticed how frequently things went wrong because the members of various societies got mixed up with women or drank too much or gave themselves away in a moment of profligacy ah dan smoked calmly now i understand why your rules were so stringent you speak of them in a past tense said miss armour curiously well dan pressed down the tobacco in his pipe the society is done for its gastados used up busted and all the rest of it well well echoed the woman passing over his remark with a sneer i wished to collect a body of men and women who were to live like saints and use all the power such selfdenial gave them to gain all they wanted for themselves a devilishly clever scheme but not original like my tortures queen beelzebub assured him in australiasydney new south walesi fancy there are societies who have the same rules they call such an organization there a push i think dan nodded i have heard of such things well thento make a long story short as i want to go to bed and cant enjoy your delightful society much longeri intended to work on those lines years and years ago mrs jarsell was a favorite pupil of mine we parted and she married a man with money he died miss armour laughed in fact since he treated eliza badly i got rid of him oh so that is the hold you have on her quite so i met her again and got rid of the husband he left her his money and i came to live with eliza as a companion for a time we went into london society and i soon managed to get a few people together by appealing to their egotism some kicked at my ideasothers did not and in the end i collected quite a large number then i made eliza take this house as it struck me that aeroplanes might be utilized for criminal purposes i dont say that when this idea struck me aeroplanes were so good as they are now but i believed that aviation would improve and that the air would be conquered chance brought vincent into my life he became a member of the society of flies and manufactured the machines he also taught me how to handle them i am bound to say that he had an excellent pupil put in dan politely thank you miss armour smiled and nodded i fancy i am pretty good but you see that by using an aeroplane i was able to get up and down to london without people knowing i was so to speak in two places at once by travelling fast and so could prove an alibi easily then durwin no eliza murdered him she went up in an aeroplane along with vincent since she is too silly to handle one herself to kill moonthat was my work because he learned too much and refused to join mei went to town by train in the character of the false mrs brown penn was killed by curberry who had to obey me or suffer himself oh i assure you i am quite autocratic mr halliday finished the woman merrily i quite believe that said halliday drily but did all this villainy give you pleasure oh yes miss armours nostrils again dilated and her eyes again flashed triumphantly think of the power i held until you interfered i pretended for greater safety to be paralyzed and no one ever connected a poor invalid lady with queen beelzebub i did not i assure you i believed queen beelzebub to be mrs jarsell eliza miss armour scoffed why shes a poor weak fool and only did what i ordered her to do because i implicated her along with myself in the murder of her husband however she has been useful as without her money i could not have started the business power she repeated yes i have a great power high or low rich or poor there was no one i could not remove if i chose my subjects worked for me willingly or unwillingly you are a kind of old woman of the mountain like the gentleman of that name who invented the assassinsthat gang about the time of the crusades quite so although it is not polite of you to call me an old woman by the way i got curberry his title by getting rid of his uncle and cousin yes so he told me said dan marvelling that the woman could speak so calmly about her wickedness oh you are shocked she laughed gaily what a fool you are i could tell you much concerning many murders and disappearances which the police knew nothing about for some years i have ruled like a despot andandwell she yawned its all over oh what a pity i think not people will sleep quieter when they know queen beelzebub and her demons are harmless harmless she echoed the word with a laugh and touched a silver bell that stood at her elbow we shall all be harmless enough tomorrow if indeed you speak truly and your friend laurance is coming up here with the police he is i assure you said dan wondering why she rang the bell but who are the members of your gang youll see them tomorrow when you afford sport for them said queen beelzebub in a weary way and looking fagged out meanwhile i must have you safely locked up and as she spoke two big men entered the room hang you i shant began dan and sprang to his feet but the two men had their hands on him and shortly he was trussed up like a christmas turkey you are less clever than i thought said queen beelzebub sneering or you would not fight against impossibilities good night take him away and as they were commanded the two big men took him away in silence chapter xx queen beelzebubs end unable to resist superior force dan ceased to struggle thinking it was best to play a waiting game until chance afforded him the opportunity of escape hitherto his good fortune had saved him from grave perils and he trusted that finally it would prove strong enough to extricate him from this last difficulty he was taken down a short flight of damp steps and thrust into what he took to be a disused coalcellar here the two big men released him from his bonds and retired locking the door behind them once or twice he asked questions but receiving no reply he asked no more they left a lantern for his use and the light although only that of a candle was very acceptable in the cimmerian darkness of this underground dungeon when left alone the prisoner stretched himself swung his arms and stamped with his feet to get warm after which he made an examination of his surroundings halliday found that the cellar was small with stone floor stone roof and stone walls all more or less humid light and air came through a shaft on the right of the entrance which was too narrow to permit of escape evidently the place had been used before as a prison and no doubt for refractory members of the society since there was some spare furniture in one corner was a low bed in another a deal table in a third a washstand and finally there was one kitchen chair on which dan took his seat to think over matters he had eaten so did not feel hungry and solaced himself with his pipe a luxury for which he felt very grateful it could not be said that his thoughts were pleasant they could scarcely be so under the circumstances as there was no denying he was in a most uncomfortable plight so miss armour the delicate maiden lady was queen beelzebub and the imposing mrs jarsell was only her tool dan was surprised when he reflected on this and could not help admiring the infernal cunning of the woman who had arranged matters miss armour was without doubt a born criminal who much preferred doing evil to doing good as mrs jarsells companion she could have led a blameless existence surrounded by attention and comfort and luxury but her craving for power had led her into dark paths for all her care she might have guessed that in a lawabiding country the truth of her murderous association would come to the notice of the authorities sooner or later and when the knowledge had become public with all her cunning she was unable to cope with the situation like the fox in the fable her many wiles had proved useless and here she was driven into a corner what she intended to do dan could not think he did not see in what way she could escape punishment of course the young man was perfectly satisfied that freddy was moving in the matter down south according to instructions he must have gone to lord curberrys house at blackheath when he failed to receive news of his friend and what he discovered there would assure him that it was time to take public action and inform the police of what was going on the servants would be questioned and curberrys body would be examined while the visit of the veiled woman and her flight in the aeroplane would be explained laurance would guess at once that the unknown lady was queen beelzebub attending to her iniquitous business and an inquiry at the shed would soon inform him of the pursuit halliday believed that on the morrow laurance together with the police would arrive at sheepeak and then the end would come meanwhile he was in great danger unless freddy appeared in time to rescue him for miss armour was very spiteful and her last act of power would undoubtedly be to murder him for the action he had taken in bringing about her downfall but this had to be faced and if death was certain he hoped that it would be immediate since even his brave nature quailed at the idea of suffering ingenious chinese tortures as to lillian dan was quite sure she would not be harmed because queen beelzebub had her hands full and would not have time to kill her indeed if she decided to do so it would not be easy for her to find anyone to execute her commands for every member of the society of flies must by this time have been aware of the danger which threatened their organization halliday believed that the telegrams alluded to by miss armour and which were to be sent by mrs jarsell were intended to summon the members to a conference yet what use such a meeting would be the young man could not think the net of the law would capture the entire gang without doubt and yet queen beelzebub was so infernally cunning that dan could not be sure she would not find some means of saving herself and her subjects even at the eleventh hour in thoughts such as these the night passed slowly and the hours seemed interminable the candle in the lantern burned itself out and he found himself in complete darkness while the silence was only broken by the drip of water from the walls or by his own breathing and restless movements dan felt as though he were in a tomb and his lively imagination conjured up all kinds of horrors until worn out physically and mentally he fell into a profound slumber when he opened his eyes again it was dawn for he saw the cold light streaming down through the air shaft a glance at his watch assured him that it was seven oclock and he wondered if food would be brought to him shortly as he had only eaten a sandwich and drank a glass of portwine since a yesterday morning breakfast he felt most uncommonly hungry and in spite of the peril in which he stood he longed ardently for food in the meantime for comfort he lighted his pipe again sat on his bed and watched the thin beam of sunlight move slowly across the stone floor of his cell this was an unexpected adventure sure enough and unpleasant as it was now it promised to be still more unpleasant before it was concluded all that halliday could hope for was that laurance with the police would arrive in time to save his life and deliver him from imprisonment at ten oclockdan looked again at his watch when the door openedmrs jarsell entered with a tray on which were two boiled eggs bread and butter and coffee placing this on the table she was about to leave as she had entered in silence when dan caught her dress at once with a shiver she drew back and displayed the lancet tipped with the serpentpoison if you try to escape i shall kill you she said in her heavy voice dan looked at her curiously and saw that she was less imposing than ever for all her massive looks all her selfrestraint was gone her eyes were red her face was disfigured with tears and her big body looked flabby and inert a greater collapse or a more pitiful spectacle can scarcely be imagined and dan felt quite sorry for her even though he knew she was banded against him with others to bring him to a cruel death i shall not try to escape he said slowly that is i shant try just now pausing at the door mrs jarsell still on guard with the lancet looked at him sorrowfully you can never escape she said brokenly try as you may for the house is guarded by four men who are sworn to obey miss armour queen beelzebub you mean said halliday with a shrug i wish i had never heard the name cried mrs jarsell with a sob i quite believe that i am very sorry for you you have every need to be thanks to you we are all caught in a trap and there is no means of escape really i thought that miss armour mrs jarsell shuddered she has an idea but i hope it will not be necessary for her to carry out her idea after all things may not be so bad as they seem mr halliday if you mean the police i am afraid they are he retorted with another shrug and with great emphasis by this time my friend laurance has informed the scotland yard authorities of what we know what do you know demanded mrs jarsell with a gasp and she was forced to lean against the door for support everything said dan briefly so with your permission i shall have my breakfast mrs jarsell and he began to eat with a good appetite oh how can you how can you cried the big woman convulsively think of the danger you stand in i shall escape escape and from queen beelzebub nobody has ever escaped her i shall and you will be the means of my escaping me mrs jarsell used bad grammar in her astonishment how can i that is your affair broke in halliday pouring out the coffee why should i help you to escape because you are a woman and not a fiend miss armour is one i admit but i can see very plainly that you are a most unwilling accomplice i am i am cried mrs jarsell vehemently years ago i was a decent woman a good woman she came into my life again and poisoned my existence she worked on my jealousy and on my fear and i know i know she enabled you to get rid of your husband ah mrs jarsell reeled back as though she had been struck she told you that did she she told me everything then you will never escape she would never let you go free with the knowledge you have of her secrets you are doomed as to my husband mrs jarsell appeared to be speaking more to herself than to dan he was a wicked and cruel wretch he starved me he beat me he was unfaithful to me and led me such a life as no woman could endure miss armour showed me how to rid myself of him when i was distraught with misery and passion i thought it was sympathy with me that made her help me it was not all she desired was to gain some hold over me and use my money for her own vile ends you dont appear to love her said halliday coolly the woman closed the door placed her back against it and clenched her hands in a cold fury i hate her i loathe her i detest her she cried in a guttural voice evidently consumed with rage for years and years and years i have been her slave after i killed my husband under her directionsalthough i dont deny but what he deserved deaththere was no retreat for me as she could have and would have informed the police i should have been hanged she made use of her power to use my money in order to create this wicked society it murders and slays and blackmails and i know i know said dan soothingly she told me all about it then you know how evil she is i have had to commit crimes from which my better self shrank at her command such as the murder of durwin put in dan quickly that is only one out of many deeper and deeper i have sunk into the mire and now the end has come i am glad of it why not turn kings evidence and denounce this woman and her gang then you would be pardoned there is no pardon for my wickedness said mrs jarsell in a sombre tone i have sown and i must reap as i have sown it is too late i know that your friend will come with the police they will find the whole wicked lot of criminals here which constitute the society of flies ah those telegrams yes i sent off thirty last night for now penn and curberry are dead there are just thirty members today all will come up since the danger to all is so great i sent the wires last night and i am confident that the members have started for sheepeak this morning this afternoon everyone will be under this roof all the worse for you dan quailed does she really mean to torture me he asked nervously and it was little to be wondered at that such a prospect did make him feel sick yes she does rejoined mrs jarsell gloomily when the members find that there is no escape they will be delighted to see the man who had brought this danger on them mutilated and done to death by inches a pleasant set of people muttered dan bracing himself to meet the worst but i think you would not care to see me tortured no i wouldnt you are brave and young and clever and handsome and added dan quickly thinking of a means to move her to help him i am to marry lillian moon surely you have some sympathy with me and with her supposing i have what can i do help me to escape said dan persuasively its impossible she growled and went suddenly away closing the door after her with a bang that sounded in dans ears like his deathwarrant all the same with the courage of a brave nature and the hopefulness inseparable from youth he went on with his meal hoping for the best mrs jarsell was moved by his plight he saw that and deeply stained as she was with compulsory crimes she might hope to atone for them by doing one good act at the eleventh hour she might set him free and undoubtedly she would think over what he had said this woman unlike the others was not entirely evil and the seeds of good in her breast might bring forth repentance and a consequent help dan knew that he was clinging to a straw but in his present dilemma there was nothing else to cling to after breakfast he lay down again and again began to smoke for hours he waited to hear his fate sometimes stretched on his bed sometimes seated in the chair and occasionally walking up and down the confined space of his cell he could not disguise from himself that things were desperate his sole hope of escape lay with mrs jarsell and that was but a slight one even though her remorse might wish to aid him her terror of queen beelzebub might be too strong to let her move in the matter halliday was uncommonly brave and extraordinarily hopeful yet the perspiration beaded his forehead and he shivered at the prospect of torture without doubt he was in hell and the devils presided over by the infernal queen were waiting to inflict pains and penalties on him it terrified him to think that but this wont do said dan to himself as he heard the key grate in the lock late in the afternoon i must pull myself together and smile whatever these beasts do to me i must die game butbutlillian with a quiet smile he turned to greet mrs jarsell who did not look him in the face nor did she even speak with a gesture he was invited to come out and for the moment had a wild idea of escape as soon as he reached the upper portion of that wicked house but the sight of the lancet in her hand prevented him from making a dash for liberty he knew that the merest scratch would make him a corpse so it was not worth while to risk the attempt only when he was at the door of the barbaric sittingroom he whispered to mrs jarsell you will help me to escape i know you will even now you are thinking of ways and means perhaps she gasped in a low whisper then hastily flung open the door and pushed him into the room with that word of hope ringing in his ears halliday faced his judges with a smile on his lips the room was filled with people who greeted his entrance with a roar of anger he was spat upon struck at kicked and shaken by those despairing creatures whom he had brought to book queen beelzebub seated in her big chair at the end of the apartment smiled viciously when she saw his reception but did not interfere for some moments then she waved her hand let him be let him be she said in her malicious silvery voice you shall have all the revenge you desire but let everything be done in order left alone by the furies halliday stood with his back to the door and with mrs jarsell on guard beside him he glanced round at the pallid faces and thought that he had never seen such an assemblage of terror there were old men and young men mixed with women of the higher and lower classes some were welldressed while others were badly clothed some were handsome and others were ugly but one and all bore the mark of despair written on their white faces and in their agonized eyes it was like a gathering of the damned and only the individual who had damned them one and all seemed to be unmoved queen beelzebub appeared calm and unshaken looking at her prisoner quietly and speaking in a tranquil manner dan found himself wondering if this creature was indeed a human being or a fiend we are all here said miss armour in a dignified manner and waving her hand again this time to indicate the assembly this is the society of flies which you see face to face for the first and the last time you have brought us together for an unpleasant purpose to torture and murder me i suppose said halliday with studied insolence and bracing his courage with the memory of mrs jarsells whispered word no that part of our business is pleasant queen beelzebub assured him i look forward to enjoyment when i see you writhing in torment but the unpleasant purpose is the disbanding of our society a wail of terror arose from those present some dropped on their knees and beat the ground with their foreheads others stood stiff and terrorstruck while a few dropped limply on the floor grovelling in despair since all these people were criminals who had inflicted death and sorrow on others it was strange how they hated a dose of their own medicine even in the midst of his fears dan found himself wondering at the illogicality of the degenerate mob who expected to do evil and yet enjoy peace then he remembered that cruelty always means cowardice and no longer marvelled at the expression of dread and fear on every ghastly face how i propose to disband our society went on queen beelzebub quite unmoved by that agonized wail there is no need for you to know it may be that we shall break up and each one will go here there and the other place it is certain that we cannot keep together since i have received news of the police being after us headed by laurance exactly headed by your friend laurance i should like to punish him but there is no time so you will have to bear his punishment as well as your own mr halliday what have you to say why we should not torture you and kill you and force you to die by inches fists were shaken feet were stamped and a dozen voices asked the same question dan looked round at his foes calmly and shrugged his shoulders in contempt there was a burst of jeering laughter you wont look like that said queen beelzebub significantly when she broke off with a dreadful laugh and glanced at the fireplace there dan saw irons of curious shape pincers and files and tongs and what was worst of all in the centre of the flames reddened a circle of steel he could not help turning pale as he guessed that this would be placed on his head and again he comforted himself with the memory that mrs jarsell even at the eleventh hour might help him when he changed color there was a second burst of laughter and halliday glared fiercely around are you human beings or fiends he asked to think of torturing me kill me if you will but shame as men and women should prevent you mutilating a man who has done you no harm no harm it was queen beelzebub who spoke while her subjects snarled like illfed beasts you dare to say that when you have brought us to this pass i acted in the cause of law and order said dan boldly we despise law and order yet you are now being brought to book by what you despise retorted the prisoner and again there came that unhuman snarl the more you speak in that way the worse it will be for you said miss armour coldly yet you can escape some tortures if you will tell us all how you came to learn the truth about us i dont care a damn about your tortures said dan valiantly and i will explain what you ask just to show that clever as your organization is it cannot escape discovery nor has it you are all snared here like rats in a trap and should you venture out of this house you will be caught by the authorities to be hanged as you deserve a howl of rage went up and queen beelzebub waved her hand once more all in good time she said quietly let us hear what he has to explain it was the sumatra scent on the body of sir charles moon which put me on the track declared dan folding his arms i traced it to penn who told me a lie about it i believed him at the moment and disbelieved him when i smelt the same perfume in this very room here questioned miss armour and for the first time her face wore an expression of dismay as if she had been caught napping yes if you remember i spoke about your cards being scented you told me a lie about it but that clue connected you with moons murder i watched you and i watched mrs jarsell i saw her face in a cinematograph which was taken on the day of the london to york race when durwin was murdered oh mrs jarsell gasped and moaned and dan could hear some of the men in impotent fury grind their teeth queen beelzebub was as calm as ever penn told me much when i was taking him for that flight in which i said i would throw him overboard unless he confessed then i was taken to the headquarters of your society in london and again smelt the perfume i believed that queen beelzebub was mrs jarsell and was astonished when i found miss armour played that part penns confession was not all destroyed and my friend laurance has by this time shown what remains of it to the police and the telegram which curberry received demanded queen beelzebub laurance sent that in vague terms so as to frighten curberry it did and he committed suicide after declaring to me that he murdered penn by your damned orders miss armour then thank you we know the rest she said in a quiet tone which was infinitely sinister in its suggestion you followed me in the aeroplane and smashed us both up he broke my machines the two of them said a hoarse voice of wrath and dan looked sideways to see vincent glaring at him furiously well you have fallen into your own trap said queen beelzebub savagely i caught you and i hold you and after we have had a conference as to how you will be tortured you will expiate your crimes crimes echoed dan thats a nice way to put the matter i have done a service to the state by ridding the world of all you devils you cant escape hanging not one of you and he looked defiantly round the room we shall all escape said queen beelzebub quietly those who think that they will not have no trust in me she rose and stretched out her arms i have never failed you never never i shall not fail you now i swear that not a single one of you will suffer on the gallows apparently her sway over the society was great and they believed that she could accomplish even impossibilities for the faces of all cleared as if by magic the look of dread the expression of terror disappeared and there only remained an uneasy feeling as though none felt themselves quite safe until queen beelzebub performed her promise for his part dan believed that the woman was lying as he could not see how any could win free of the net which was even now being cast over the house you are a set of fools as well as a pack of wolves cried the young man in a vehement manner the police know too much for you to escape them my friend laurance will lead them here he knows this house you are safely trapped say what that woman will thieves rogues liars murderers lawyers doctors actors soldiers scoffed queen beelzebub they all belong to the society of flies and you can see them here mr halliday some of those ladies are in society some are in shops some are married and others are not but both men and women have acted for the good of the society which i have founded to give each and everyone what he or she desires you are all devils raged dan his wrath getting the better of his discretion redhanded criminals the only decent one amongst you is mrs jarsell i am decent gasped mrs jarsell looking up surprised yes because you were driven by that fiend he pointed to the smiling miss armour to compulsory crimes you feel remorse does she cried queen beelzebub gaily and what good does that do my very dear eliza when you know what you have to do mrs jarsell looked at her companion with a long and deadly look of hate such as dan had never thought a face was capable of expressing i loath and detest you she said slowly but for you i would have been a good woman i have been driven to sin by you and i shall still drive you shouted queen beelzebub furiously take that man away until we decide what tortures we will inflict on him then when he is dead and punished for his meddling you will either do what i have commanded you to do or you shall be tortured also the assembly now quite certain that in some way their head would deliver them from the talons of the law shouted joyfully glad to think that two people would be done to death instead of one mrs jarsell smiled in a faint bitter manner you shall be obeyed she said slowly come mr halliday and say your prayers cried queen beelzebub as the door opened to let the pair out youll need them and as the door closed with dan and mrs jarsell on the outside the young man heard again that cruel laughter they are all in there whispered the woman catching dans wrist and speaking hurriedly the men who captured you included the house is quite empty outside that room come where will you take me inquired dan hanging back and wincing for now his fate hung in the balance indeed outside i am setting you free run away and probably you will meet your friend and the police and pray for me pray for me she ended vehemently why not come also said dan when he found himself at the entrance door of the grange you are a good woman and i am not good i am wicked and may god forgive me but i am doing one decent thing and that is to set you free to marry lillian moon when you leave this house i shall do another decent deed and that is dan stepped outside yet lingered to hear her answer you shall see tell the police not to come too near the house and in a hurry she pushed him away and bolted the door halliday ran for all he was worth from that wicked dwelling on the high road he saw a body of men approaching and was certain that here were the police and laurance coming to save him shouting with glee at his escape he hastened towards them when he heard a sullen heavy boom like distant thunder he looked back at the grange and saw a vast column of smoke towering into the sunlight then came a rain of debris at last the society of flies was disbanded for the house and its wicked inhabitants were shattered into infinitesimal fragments chapter xxi sunshine after the storm came the calm and with the spring a realization of mr hallidays hopes with regard to his future sir john moon no longer objected to dan as the husband of his niece and was indeed profoundly thankful that she had escaped becoming lady curberry the story of the society of flies and the wickedness of queen beelzebub and the blowing up of the grange was a nine days wonder the papers for some weeks were filled with little else and the moment almost doubled its circulation when the able pen of mr frederick laurance set forth the complete story halliday became quite a hero as indeed he was although he did not appreciate the rewards of his conduct to be interviewed to have his portrait more or less unlike him in dozens of illustrated papers to receive offers from musichall managers and even proposals of marriage from various enthusiastic ladies did not appeal to dan as soon as he could he went out of london and took refuge in sir johns country seat so as to escape publicity needless to say lillian was there and mrs bolstreath also laurance was due within seven days to be dans best man at the june wedding and with him mildred was coming at lillians special request once twice and again the owner of the house had heard the story of the late events and also had read them more or less garbled in different newspapers yet he never wearied of the recital and admired halliday greatly for the part he had played from objecting to dan as a nephewinlaw the baronet now urgently desired that he should make lillian mrs halliday in fact when he thought of what the young man had saved lillian from the uncle of the girl could not do enough for his estimable young friend so dan having become famous was about to become rich but neither fame nor wealth appealed to him so much as the undoubted fact that he was on the eve of wedding the girl he adored and i think said lillian holding on to dan as if she feared to lose him that you and i would be as happy in a cottage as in a palace money is a nuisance i think dear you say that because you have never experienced the want of it said dan in a sententious manner all the same he slipped his arm round the girls slim waist and kissed her for the pretty sentiment she had expressed relative to a poor but arcadian existence the happy pair not yet joined in holy matrimony but to be made one in seven days were seated in the delightful garden of sir johns house which was situated in the pleasant county of devon they had strolled out after dinner leaving mrs bolstreath to chat with the baronet who approved of the big placid woman and enjoyed her society lillian and dan however liked to be in one anothers company without any third person to spoil their pleasures and on this occasionbeing humored as loversthey were entirely alone the garden sloped down to a yellow beach which was the curve of a tiny bay and under the orb of a brilliant may moon the waters of the vast sea murmured softly almost at their feet there was a marble bench here with a marble statue of cupid near at hand perched on a pedestal so the spot was quite that which lovers would have chosen dan chose it because the screen of shrubs and trees quite shut off the nook they occupied from the many windows of the great house and he could kiss lillian when he wished without any uneasy feeling that someone was looking on it is quite unnecessary to say that he frequently availed himself of his privilege the abouttobe bride fully approved of his ardor in this respect but you really must be serious said miss moon sedately after the last embrace given out of compliment to her loveinacottage sentiment i want to ask you a few questions ask what you will i can deny you nothing its about the society of flies hesitated the girl my dear said dan patiently and coaxing a loose leaf around his cigar i dont want to be disagreeable but i am really tired of the society of flies only a few questions said lillian nestling to his side and then we can forget all about the matter that wont be easy for me to do replied mr halliday rather grimly i can never forget what i suffered when i was expecting to be tortured by that fiend queen beelzebub she could not have chosen a better name my dear i sometimes doubt if she was a human being at all poor misguided woman murmured lillian resting her head on dans shoulder dont pity her dear she does not deserve your pity now mrs jarselli have always been sorry for her so have i said the girl promptly she was very good to you dear good is a weak way of expressing what i owe her retorted halliday think of what she saved me from perhaps queen beelzebub would not have tortured you after all dan laughed incredulously i shouldnt have cared to have trusted to her mercy i tell you lillian as i have told you before that already the implements of torture were being made ready they would have crowned me with a redhot circlet of steel and pinched my flesh with redhot pincers and dont oh dont lillian turned pale it is really too dreadful and to think that i was with bolly at mrs pelgrins quite ignorant of the peril you were in i wish i had been with you i am glad you were not my one feeling of thankfulness was that you had escaped being hurt in any way i didnt mind dying so long as you were all right my darling although i much prefer being alive and here lillian my dear dont cry its all over weeks ago iii cantcant help it sobbed the girl clinging to him it is all so dreadful when mr laurance came that day with the police and said you were at the grange i thought i should have died there there dan soothed her as he would have soothed a fretful child it is all over and done with by the way how was freddy so certain that i was at the grange he never quite explained his certainty well dear said miss moon drying her eyes with dans handkerchief when he did not hear from you in london he went down to blackheath with inspector tenson of hampstead they saw the local inspector and called at lord curberrys house after what mr laurance told but already a policeman had been summoned by the servants lord curberry was dead of poison and they found his confession saying how he had taken it because he believed that his connection with the society of flies was found out then the servants explained how queen beelzebub had come in an aeroplane they did not call her queen beelzebubthe servants i mean said dan who had heard the explanation before but was glad to hear it again told in lillians soft voice no they did not know who she was as she was cloaked and veiled but they told mr laurance that you had declared this veiled lady had murdered lord curberrythat wasnt true you know true enough in one sense interrupted dan quickly seeing that she drove him to suicide well well then mr laurance guessed that she was queen beelzebub and wondered where you were he went to the shed where you kept your aeroplane and heard that you had followed her those at the shed thought that it was a race it was said dan grimly again and i won mr laurance guessed that you had followed her all the way to sheepeak although he fancied and indeed hoped that both aeroplanes had broken down he dreaded lest you should get into trouble at sheepeak which i certainly did although not quite in the way freddy expected lillian laughed at the memory of his escape and rubbed her soft face on the sleeve of his coat mr laurance told the police all about the matter and they wished to telegraph to thawley so that the police there might go over to sheepeak but mr laurance stopped them as he fancied you might have been taken captive by queen beelzebub and that if such a move was made she might hurt you she intended to hurt me very severely and then freddy heard from the police about those numerous telegrams all in the same words calling thirty people to sheepeak it was the similarity of the messages that made the telegraph authorities suspicious and when the police came to askknowing where queen beelzebub lived from freddythey were shown the telegrams but by that time all those who got the telegrams had come north said lillian quite excited they all went up by the early train yes and the police with freddy followed delaying action until such time as they thought they could collar the whole gang by jove they just came in time freddy was a fool to tell you that i was in the grange he was not quite certain and only thought so because the wrecked aeroplanes were found in the field near the house oh dan lillian put her arms round her lovers neck mr laurance told me how thankful he was when he saw you running along the road and knew that you had escaped he might have been thankful also that i caused him and the body of police to halt said dan quickly if they had not everyone would have been blown up as it was i very nearly got smashed by the falling sticks and stones and what not there must have been tons of dynamite in the cellars of the grange who do you think put it there dan queen beelzebub of course she said that she had made everything ready against possible discovery and warned poor mrs jarsell that she would have to commit a last crime crime by jove why the best days work the woman ever did was to blow up that gang of devils i suppose mrs jarsell did blow up the house dan of course she did her heart softened for some reason and she pushed me out of danger then she must have gone straight down to the cellar and set a light to the stored dynamite the explosion happened so quickly after i was free that i am sure she acted in that way it was certainly efficacious for not one of the blackguards either men or women remained alive to be hanged well that was a good thing said miss moon with a shudder you know that their relatives would have been disgraced dan nodded quite so and the names have never become public this person and that person and the other person disappeared from various neighborhoods and from various family circles but when the relatives read about the explosion in hillshire and freddys brilliant account of that infernal society they made a pretty good guess as to what had happened to the disappearing party very few people gave information to the police that their relatives or friends had disappeared tenson was rather annoyed as he wanted to make a big fuss over the matter i dont see what bigger fuss could have been made dan why the papers were filled with nothing else for weeks all the same tenson wanted the names of those who belonged to the gang and people declined to gives names of those who had disappeared from their midst we know that curberry belonged to the gang and penn also mrs jarsell vincent and queen beelzebub but only one or two other names came to light in print i think said lillian thoughtfully that so many wellconnected people were mixed up in the matter that everything was hushed up as much as was possible hm said halliday throwing away the butt end of his cigar it is not unlikely that a hint was given in high quarters that no more need be said than was absolutely necessary heigh ho he rose and stretched i am weary of the business come down and walk on the beach dear and let us talk about ourselves lillian was only too glad and the lovers descended the marble steps which led down gently to the sands the moon glowed pure silver in a sky of the darkest blue with the old moon in her radiant arms in dark ripples fringed with creaming white the wavelets murmured on the sands and at either side of the bay great cliffs bulked huge and densely black it was a night of soft winds and glorious moonshine fit for romeo and juliet to converse about love yet lillian still harped on the prosaic facts of the dangers she and dan had escaped perhaps it was natural for they had assuredly passed through a most trying time why did queen beelzebub found such a wicked society asked lillian she wanted power and perverted her talents to base ends in order to gain it my dear well well she has gone to her account so we need say no more about her she was a clever woman but a fiend incarnate and mrs jarsell poor soul she was but an example of the influence of a strong mind on a weak one i think she loathed the whole business thoroughly but she had gone too far to retreat do you think mrs pelgrin or her nephew knew anything of the matter no i dont said halliday very decidedly although tenson had his suspicions of george mrs jarsell who was used as a blind by miss armour in her turn used george as a blind to say if necessary how seldom she went to town i forgot to tell you lillian that the police discovered that both mrs jarsell and the leader of the society used frequently to motor for miles and miles to different stations further down the line in order to reach london without remark being made mrs jarsell only used the thawley station so as to get george pelgrins evidence that she scarcely ever went to town in that way of course it was next door to impossible to connect two harmless old ladies with these many dreadful murders it was only your cleverness about that scent which formed the link said lillian proud of dans characteristic sharpness and by using the biplane to travel to blackheath when mr durwin was murdered mrs jarsell was able to get mrs pelgrin to prove an alibi oh it was chance that showed mrs jarsells complicity on that occasion my dear said dan modestly but that we went into that animated picture entertainment we should never have known she was at blackheath i suppose miss armour did not feel equal to committing that particular crime so sent mrs jarsell to carry out the job miss armour was never really paralyzed i suppose no she pretended to be when anyone paid a visit nor do i believe that either she or mrs jarsell were so old as they pretended to be what a queer thing human nature is went on dan thoughtfully here was miss armour who could have lived a very pleasant and comfortable life plunging herself and that miserable woman into dangerous crime just for the love of power one would have thought that she would have liked to show her power publicly but she was quite content to be a secret despot i suppose it gave her a certain amount of pleasure though it is hard for a simple person like i am to see where it came in but her power could not have been exercised amidst public applause dan seeing what it meant quite so the police would soon have ended her career had her infernal sway been known do you think asked lillian after a pause that the members of the society expected that explosion no answered halliday very promptly i do not else in spite of the danger i believe the half if not the whole of them would have run out even into the arms of the police to be hanged in due course but they seemed to have an enormous belief in queen beelzebub who was undoubtedly as clever as her father the devil the members expected that in some way she would manage to save them but all the timeas i guessed although i could not understand what she was aiming atshe was preparing some way of getting rid of the lot herself included she must have summoned them to a pretended conference so as to house all under one roof and then fire the mine i expect she filled the cellars of the grange ages ago with dynamite and arranged with mrs jarsell to explode the mine of course where mrs jarsell got the better of queen beelzebub was that she did not give her the pleasure of revenging herself on me and fired the dynamite unexpectedly while miss armour and her demons were thinking how to torture me they all wentwell we wont say where they went but there wasnt enough left of them to form a single human being and there is an immense hole in the ground where the grange stood said lillian with awe mr laurance told me and mildred also i daresay that hole will form the basis of a legend in years to come was dans reply and a very picturesque story can be made out of the material supplied by that infernal woman she was as wicked and cruel and callous as that ezzelin who played dice with the archfiend by the way lillian i suppose mildred vincent was very much cut up over the death of her uncle no she was not of course she regretted his awful end and that he should have been so wicked but he was never kind to her and she had not much love for him i dont know ended miss moon reflectively if we can be sure that he ever committed a crime yes he did declared halliday quickly every single member of that society had to commit a crime in order to belong to the gang vincent i truly believe was not a bad man as his sole idea was a craze for inventing aeroplanes but queen beelzebub wanting him for her purpose no doubt inveigled him into committing himself as a criminal as she inveigled mrs jarsell and curberry poor lord curberry sighed lillian he is more to be pitied than blamed i dont think the young man who holds the title now cared that he died can you expect him to asked dan sceptically seeing he has got a title and a lot of money in a clean way too for curberry consented to the murder of two relatives so as to secure what he wanted no lillian it is your kind heart that makes you pity curberry but he was not a good man no decent fellow would have belonged to that association of demons but i think we have discussed the subject threadbare let us talk of more pleasant matters about mr laurance and his marriage cried lillian gaily well yes although being selfishly in love i would much rather discuss our own freddy will be able to marry mildred now since you have given him enough money to start a newspaper it is very good of you i dont think so said miss moon as they began to climb the steps again and return to the house mr laurance helped you to learn who killed my dear father and deserved a reward as you did i gave him money and and you gave me yourself so i have been rewarded very richly well freddy will make a very good proprietor and editor of a newspaper and mildred can help him to make it a success alls well that ends well and you are quitequite happy dear quite quite only i fear dan sighed that some people will call me a fortune hunter seeing that i without a penny am marrying a rich woman lillian stopped in the path up to the house and took hold of the lapels of dans coat to shake him how can you talk such nonsense she said reproachfully why after your portrait and an account of all you have done appearing in the papers you could have married half a dozen women but none so sweet as you dear said halliday kissing her for her lips were temptingly near his own well i must not despise my good fortune but what can i give you in return miss croesus a promise said lillian earnestly that you will not go up any more in those horrid flyingmachines i shall always be afraid of losing you if you do you know that quite well let me take a tiny little flight occasionally coaxed dan gaily well yes on condition that you take me if there is an accident we can be smashed up together dont argue she placed her hand on his mouth that is the only way in which i shall agree to your flying wilful woman will do what she wants said halliday resignedly and tucked lillians arm beneath his own hello there is sir john and mrs bolstreath on the terrace they seem to be very happy together so happy whispered lillian in his ear that i believe she pursed up her lips and looked unutterable things well said dan laughing it would not be at all a bad thing for sir john to make mrs bolstreath lady moon she can nurse him and amuse him and bury him in due course what a heap of marriages you and i freddy and mildred sir john and mrs bolstreath see shes waving her hand to us let us go inside as its growing a trifle chilly hark said lillian raising her finger and dan listened to hear the wild delicious strain of a nightingale singing from a distant thicket it sings of my love for you he whispered and of your love for me what other than such a song can express our feelings darling this said lillian and kissed him fondly clever girl the end
