long norris street haymarket the silver bullet chapter i the house in the pine wood we had better lie down and die said robin peevishly i cant go a step further and to emphasise his words he deliberately sat infernal little duffer growled herrick huh might have guessed you would joyce he threw himself down beside his companion and continued grumbling you have tobacco a fine night and a heather couch of the finest yet you talk as though the world were coming to an end im sure this moor never will sighed joyce reminded of his cigarettes we have been trudging it since eight in the morning yet it still stretches to the backofbeyond hai the pedestrians were pronouncedly isolated a moonless sky thickly jewelled with stars arched over a treeless moor farstretching as the plain of shinar in the luminous summer twilight the eye could see for a moderate distance but to no clearly defined horizon and the verge of sight was limited by vague shadows hardly definite enough to be mists the moor exhaled the noonday heats in thin white vapour which shut out from the external world those who nestled to its bosom a sense of solitude the brooding silence the formless surroundings and above all the insistence of the infinite would have appealed on ordinary occasions to the poetical and superstitious side of robins nature but at the moment his nerves were uppermost he was wornout fractious as a child and in his helplessness could have cried like one herrick knew his friends frail physique and inherited neurosis therefore he forebore to make bad worse by ill advised sympathy judiciously waiting until joyce had in some degree soothed himself with tobacco he talked of the commonplace nine oclock said he peering at his watch thirteen hours walking nothing to me robin but a goodish stretch to you however we are within hail of civilization and in england a few miles further well pick up a village of sorts no doubt one would think you were exploiting africa the way you howl he spoke thus callously in order to brace his friend but joyce resented the tone with that exaggerated sense of injury peculiar to the neurotic i am no hercules like you jim he protested sullenly all your finer feelings have been blunted by beef and beer you cant feel things as i do also continued robin still more querulously it seems to have escaped your memory that i returned only last night from a two days visit to town if you will break up your holiday into fragments you must not expect to receive the benefit its enjoyment as a whole would give you it was jolly enough last week sauntering through the midlands till you larked up to london and fagged yourself with its detestable civilization joyce threw aside his cigarette and nervously began to roll another it was no lark which took me up jim the letter that came to the southberry inn was abouther business sorry old man i keep forgetting your troubles heat and the want of food make me savage well rest here for a time and then push on not that a night in the open would matter to me joyce made no reply but lying full length on the dry herbage stared at the scintillating sky at his elbow herrick crosslegged like a fakir gave himself up to the enjoyment of a disreputable pipe the more highlystrung man considered the circumstances which had placed him where he was two months previously robin joyce had lost his mother to whom he had been devotedly attached and the consequent grief had made a wreck of him for weeks he had shut himself up in the flat once brightened by her presence to luxuriate in woe he possessed in a large degree that instinct for martyrdom latent in many people which searches for sorrow as a more joyous nature hunts for pleasure the blow of mrs joyces death had fallen unexpectedly but it brought home to robin the knowledgestrange as it may soundthat a mental pleasure can be plucked from misfortune he locked himself in his room wept much and ate little neglected his business of contributor to several newspapers and his personal appearance thus the pain of his loss merged itself in that delight of selfmortification which must have been experienced by the hermits of the thebiad not entirely from religious motives was the desert made populous with hermits in the days of cyril and hypatia herrick did not realize this transcendental indulgence nor would he have understood it had he done so emphatically a sane man he would have deemed it a weakness degrading to the will if not a species of lunacy as it was he merely saw that robin yielded to an unrestrained grief detrimental to his health and insisted upon carrying him off for a spell in the open air with less trouble than he anticipated robins consent was obtained the mourner threw himself with ardour into the scheme selected the county of berks as the most inviting for a ramble and when fairly started showed a power of endurance amazing in one so frail jim however being a doctor was less astonished than a layman would have been he knew that in joyce a tremendous nerve power dominated the feebler muscular force and that the man would go on like a bloodhorse until he dropped from sheer exhaustion the collapse on the moor did not surprise him he only wondered that robin had held out for so many days but i wish you had not gone to london said herrick pursuing aloud this train of thought i had to go replied joyce not troubling to query the remark the lawyer wrote about my poor mothers property in my sorrow i had neglected to look after it but at southberry junction feeling better thanks to your open air cure i thought it wise to attend to the matter then joyce went on to state with much detail how he had caught the paddington express at marleightheir last stopping placeand had seen his lawyer the business took some time to settle but it resulted in the knowledge that joyce found himself possessed of five hundred a year in consols also the flat and the furniture said robin so i am not so badly off i can devote myself wholly to novels now and shall not have to rack my brains for newspaper articles herrick nodded over a newlyfilled pipe did you sleep at the flat no i went up on tuesday as you know and slept that night at the hull hotel a small house in one of the strand side streets last night i joined you at southberry and it is now thursday said herrick laughing how particular you are as to detail robin well southberry is a goodish way behind us now and saxham is our next resting place feel better yes thanks in another quarter of an hour i shall make the attempt to reach saxham but we are so late i fear no bed oh thats alright we can wake the landlord i calculate we have only three miles quite enough too by the way jim what did you do when i left you in the semidarkness herrick chuckled fell in love said he hm you lost no time about it and she a daughter of the gods divinely tall dark hair creamy skin seablue eyes the figure and gait of diana and more of the celt than the greek interrupted joyce blue eyes black hair that is the irish type where did you see her in southberry church talking to a puny curate who did not deserve such a companion oh robin her voice like an eolian harp it must possess a variety of tones then jim did she see you herrick nodded and laughed again she looked and blushed beauty drew me with a single hair therefore i thrilled responsive love at first sight robin heighho never again shall i see this helen of marleigh live in hope said joyce springing to his feet allons mon ami the more leisurely herrick rose markedly surprised at this sudden recuperation wonderful man one minute you are dying the next skipping like a two year old hysterical all the same he added as joyce laughed those three miles explained the other feverishly i feel that i have to walk them and my determination is braced to breaking point that means youll collapse half way retorted the doctor unstrapping his knapsack light a match valerian for you my man robin made no objection he knew the value of valerian for those unruly nerves of his at present vibrating like so many harpstrings twangled by an unskilful player his small white face looked smaller and whiter than ever in the faint light of the match but his great black eyes flamed like windblown torches the contrast of herricks suntanned saxon looks struck him as almost ludicrous joyce needed no mirror to assure him of his appearance at the moment he knew only too well how he aged on the eve of a nerve storm for the present it was averted by the valerian but he knew and so did herrick that sooner or later it would surely come we must get on as fast as possible said herrick the knapsack again on his broad back food drink rest you need all three forward for some time they walked on in silence robin was so small dr jim so large that they looked like the giant and dwarf of the old fairy tale on their travels but in this case it was the giant who did all the work joyce was a pampered lazy irresponsible child in the direct line of descent from harold skimpole if jim herrick must be likened to another hero of romance amyas leigh was his prototype the shadows melted before them and closed in behind and still there was nothing but plain and mist at the end of two miles a dark bulk like a thundercloud loomed before them it stretched directly across their path bogey laughed robin a wood said the more prosaic jim this moor is fringed with pinewoods remember the forest we passed through this morning in the cheerful sunshine shuddered joyce i dont like woodlands by night the fairies are about and goblins of the worst ha yonder the lantern of puck oberon holds revel in the wood puck must be putting a girdle round the earth then robin said herrick and stared at the white starry light which beamed above the trees hecates torch cried joyce a meeting of witches and he began to chant the gruesome rhymes of the sisterhood as macbeth heard them the scene is a blasted heath too said he by this time the moon was rising and silver shafts struck inward to the heart of the pines the aerial light vanished behind the leafy screen as the travellers came to a halt on the verge of the undergrowth we must get through said dr jim or if you like robin we can skirt round saxham village is just beyond i fancy let us choose the beeline murmured joyce i want a bed and a meal as soon as possible this part of the world is unknown to me you lead i dont know it myself however heres a path well follow it to the light that comes from a tower of sorts too high up for a house with herrick as pioneer they plunged into the wood following a winding path in the gloom their heads came into contact with boughs and treetrunks but occasionally the moon made radiant the secret recesses and revealed unexpected openings the path sometimes passed across a glade on the sward of which joyce declared he saw the fairies dancing and anon plunged into a cimmerian gloom suggestive of the underworld no wind swung the heavy pineboughs the wild creatures of the wood gave no sign made no stir yet the explorers heard a low persistent swishswurrswish like the murmur of a dying breeze it came from no particular direction but droned on all sides without pause without change of note herrick heard robins hysterical sob as the insistent sound bored into his brain he would have made some remark but at the moment they emerged into a open space of considerable size here ringed by pines loomed a vast grey house with a slim tower in that tower burned the steady light outshining even the moons lustre but what was more remarkable still was the illumination of the mansion every window radiated white fire queer said robin halting on the verge of the wood not even a fence or a wall a path or an outhouse one would think that this was an inferior aladdins palace dropped here by some negligent genii all ablaze too he added wonderingly the owner must be giving a ball no signs of guests anyhow returned herrick as puzzled as his companion hm queer thing to find versailles in a pine wood however it may afford us a bed and a supper it was certainly strange the circle of trees stopped short of the building at fifty yards on all sides stretched an expanse of shorn and wellkept turf pathless as the sea in its midst the mansion was droppedas joyce aptly put itunexpectedly a twostorey tudor building with battlements and mullioned windows terraces and flights of shallow steps the whole weatherworn and grey in the moonlight overgrown with ivy and distinctly ruinous the dilapidated state of the house contrasted in a rather sinister manner with the perfectlykept lawn also another curious contrast was the tower this tacked on to the western corner stood like a lean white ghost watching over its earthly habitation its gleaming stonework and sharp outlines showed that it had been built within the last decade a distinct anachronism which marred the quaint antiquity of the medival mansion he must be an astrologer said joyce referring to the owner or it may be that the tower is an inland pharos to guide travellers across that pathless moor a horrible place he muttered why horrible asked dr jim as they crossed the lawn robin shuddered and cast a backward glance i can hardly explain but to my mind there is something sinister in this lonely mansion ablaze with light yet devoid of inhabitants we have yet to find out if that is the case robin hullo the door is open and in the strong moonlight they looked wonderingly at each other the heavy dooroak clamped with ironwas slightly ajar herrick bent upon consummating the adventure pushed it slightly open they beheld a large hall with a tesselated pavement and stately columns between these last stood black oak highbacked chairs upholstered in red velvet also statues of greek gods and goddesses holding aloft opaque globes radiant with light a vast marble staircase with wide and shallow steps sloped upwards and on either side of this from the height of the landing fell scarlet velvet curtains shutting in the hall the whiteness of the marble the crimson of the draperies the brilliance of the light these sumptuous furnishings amazed the dusty pedestrians it was as though on a lonely prairie one should step suddenly into the splendours of the vatican the palace of the sleeping beauty whispered the awestruck robin who can say romance is dead when one can stumble upon such an adventure herrick shared robins perplexity but of a more practical nature he addressed himself less to the romance than to the reality seeing no one hearing nothing he touched an ivory button that glimmered a white spot beside the door immediately a silvery succession of sounds shrilled through theapparentlylonely house electric bells electric light the hermit of this establishment is uptodate he is also deaf and has no servants said joyce impatiently after a few minutes had passed has a borgian banquet taken place here the guests seem to be dead hai the whole thing is damnable dont let yourself go said the doctor roughly squeezing the little mans arm wait and see the upshot again and again they rang the bell and themselves heard its imperative summons but no one appeared then they took their courage in both hands and stepped into the house passing through the crimson curtains they found themselves in a wide corridor enamelled green with velvet carpet and more lightbearing statues on either side were doors draped with emerald silk herrick led the way through one of these for joyce rendered timorous by the adventure would not take the initiative in the first room an oval table was set out for a solitary meal the linen was bleached as the alpine snow the silver antique the crystal exquisite the porcelain worth its weight in gold an iridescent glass vase in the centre was filled with flowers but these drooped withered and brown the bread also was stale the fruits were shrivelled from their early freshness magnificently furnished and draped the room glowed in splendour under innumerable electric lights but the intruders had eyes only for that sumptuous table with its air of desolation and its place set for one anything more sinister can scarcely be conceived no one has sat down to this meal said herrick lifting the covers of the silver dishes it has stood here for hours if not for days let us see if we can find the creature for whom it was intended perhaps you expect to find the beast that loved beauty since you call him a creature said robin hysterically here is wine dr jim went to the sideboard whereon were ranged decanters of venetian glass containing many different vintages passing over these he selected a pint bottle of champagne we must make free of our position he said unwiring this afterwards we can apologise ugh cried robin as the cork popped with a staccato sound in the silence how gruesome give me a glass at once jim i dont know if it is good for you in your present state replied the doctor brimming a goblet however the whole adventure is so queer that an attack of nerves is excusable drink up robin did so and was joined by jim they finished the bottle and felt exhilarated and more ready to face the unknown again herrick led the way to further explorations adjacent to the diningroom they discovered a small kitchen whitetiled and completely furnished our hermit cooks for himself declared dr jim eying the utensils of polished copper this is not a servants kitchen also it is off the diningroom robin made no reply but followed his friend his large eyes becoming larger at every fresh discovery they entered a drawingroom filled with splendid furniture silver knickknacks costly china and eastern hangings of great price there was a library stored with books in magnificent bindings and with tables piled with latterday magazines novels and newspapers our hermit keeps himself abreast of the world commented jim then came a picture gallery but this was on a second storey and lighted from the roof treasures of art ancient and modern glowed here under the radiance of the light which illuminated every room a smokingroom fashioned like a ships cabin a japanese apartment crammed with the lacquer work and stiff embroideries of yeddo and yokahama a shooting gallery a bowling alley a music room containing a magnificent erard finally a dozen bedrooms furnished with taste and luxury to crown all they discovered a gymnasium fitted up completely even to foils and boxing gloves and a huge bathroom this last was throughout of white marble with a square pool of water in the centre what a pond to bathe in cried jim enviously for he was hot and dusty our hermit is an ancient roman he understands how to enjoy life come along robin but by this time they had explored almost the whole of the wonderful house there remained the back premises but on entering they found nothing but darkness and dirt squalor and coldness the hermits attention to his mansion stopped short at the servants door and i dont believe he has any servants declared joyce how the deuce does he keep all this clean the doctor shook his head he hardly knew what to say the situation was beyond him a palace in the wilderness with an open door inviting thieves crammed with treasures brilliant with light uninhabited deserted was there ever anything so wonderful he had to pinch himself to make sure that he was awake we have got into the world of the fourth dimension the fairyland of the arabian nights what do you think joyce i think we had better climb up to the tower said robin with unusual common sense it is the only place we have left unexplored there is a light there too aladdin may be aloft herrick shook his head he would have heard the bell however come along we must find someone with some difficulty they discovered the staircase leading to the tower it was narrow but straight and not so steep as might have been expected at the top herrickleading as usualwas confronted by a closed door of plain deal it was not locked however and having knocked without receiving a reply he opened it joyce at his heels peeped over his shoulder and beheld a small square room with windows on all four sides and a large central globe burning in the ceiling in contrast to the rest of the house this room was absolutely bare blank walls chinese matting on the floor a camp bedstead in one corner a deal table without a covering in another and two cane chairs no anchorite could have had a more ascetic cell herrick took in the scene at a glance took in also itsto himcentral feature the body of a man lying face downwards near the bed joyce saw the corpse also and remained at the door shaking and white murder or suicide jim asked himself as he turned over the dead that which had once been a man was in evening dress in the finest of linen and jewellery the most immaculate of clothes it lay under the scrutinising eye of dr herrick a lean evil face with a hook nose scanty grey hair cut short and a long moustache carefully trimmed the left hand gripped a revolver the shirt front over the heart was covered with blood and a stream coagulated and black streaked the matting in gods name cried joyce not daring to enter what is it it was once the owner of this house i suppose said herrick grimly now it is a piece of carrion suicide apparently dead over twentyfour hours shot through the heart a steady hand to do that hm lefthanded too is it suicide or murder heres a damnable discovery to cap the adventure said dr jim gravely from the doorway came a gasp a tittering laugh jim had just time to spring forward when joyce lunged into his arms the long expected nervestorm had come at last chapter ii de mortuis nil nisi malum and sunsets fire the saxham spire my guide post unto heaven so sang midway in the last century a local poet who died long since and passed poems and all into oblivion but the famous spire in its copper sheathing still catches the sunlight and glows in the centre of saxham a veritable pillar of fire those natives who have emigrated enlisted as soldiers taken situations in london and elsewhere shipped before the mast as some have done always remember church and spire the children recall its ruddy blaze when they read exodus saxham was not a large place it might have contained a couple of hundred inhabitants probably less and these principally agricultural labourers they worked on the farms and estates which dotted the vast alluvial plain stretching to beorminster as the city like that one mentioned in the bible is set upon a hill the twin towers of the cathedral and bishop gandolfs spire can easily be seen from saxham but the villagers prefer their own spire and their own parson rarely venturing the three miles to beorminster those who do go always return to their beloved hamlet more convinced than ever as to the superiority of their birthplace a sturdy stubborn set of rustics these men and women of saxham the topography of the country as set down in herricks map showed that saxham was almost the centre of the district taking beorminster as the real navel the great plain was covered with many such hamlets each clustering round its parent church but saxham was the nearest to the city far away on the other side was smoky irongrip the manufacturing town almost in sight of marleigh and heathcroft then sixteen miles across southberry heath which herrick and joyce had so wearily trodden on the previous night southberry junction roared with perpetual traffic for here the great main line tapped the local railways which converged from all points the pinewoods sheltering saxham from the chill winds of the moor also barred it from the outside world as southberry was considered to be saxham with its neighbouring hamlets claimed to belong solely to beorminster the folk would have called themselves autochthonous had they known of such a word and its meaning the plan of the village was simple in its centre was a genuine village green with a quincunx of immemorial elms from this ran four streets through the mass of houses until they passed beyond them altogether and out into the country on one side stands st ediths church in a nest of trees on the other the carr arms an inn of undoubted antiquity the remaining two sides are occupied by rows of medivallooking houses inhabited by those whom saxham calls the best people by which is meant the tradesmen there was no doctor or lawyer and the rector representing the gentry in the village itself dwelt on its outskirts the country people lived outside the village on their estates and visited it only on business and as there were no radicals in saxham these were looked upon as more than mortal under the red tiled roof of the carr arms robin joyce was still sleeping the next morning when the green was filled with excited people talking of the murderso they called it the events of the previous night had so shaken the nerve of the little man that it was all herrick could do to get him out of that ghastly mansion and down to the inn dr jim rousing the landlord had told his story and after seeing robin to bed had turned in himself what did it matter to him that the great house was still ablaze in the pinewood still filled with precious things and its doors and windows open to thieves he was too tired almost to think and the moment his head was on the pillow he fell into a heavy dreamless slumber which lasted until ten the next morning from this muchneeded rest he was awakened by napper the landlord a burly man with a ruddy face suggestive of beef and beer in large quantities in no very pleasant humour jim sat up to demand with a growl and an adjective what was wanted on being informed that mr inspector bridge of beorminster waited to see him the events of the night came back on his still drowsy brain with a rush thoroughly awakened he promised to be down in half an hour and forthwith tumbled into the largest cold bath napper could provide after a douche and ten minutes gymnastics the doctor hurried into a clean shirt and his homespun suit while he dressed he meditated on the fact that napper had lost no time in telling the police what had happened in a few minutes he looked into robins bedroom and finding his companion still in an exhausted slumber he went downstairs alone to face the officer inspector bridge was a tall lean man with a serious face andwhat was surprising taken in conjunction with his funereal looksa jocular manner the mans humour lurked in his eyesa grey pair of twinklers which belied the turneddown corners of his mouth his movements were slow his tone was brisk and businesslike rather a contradictory personality herrick thought and concluded that bridge resembled nothing so much as an undertaker out for a holiday his profession would thus account for the solemnity and slowness and the holiday explain his brisk jocularity this incongruous officer considered the young man with a pursedup mouth and a humorsome eye he saw that herrick was a gentleman and this opinion being confirmedin the inspectors mindby the sight of a signet ring he treated him with more deference than he had been prepared to show nappers report of the pedestrians had led bridge to infer that they were of the genus tramp good morning sir began the inspector genially i have come to see you about this murder of colonel carr my cardmrmr dr herrick said jim glancing at what he profanely called the official ticket have you breakfasted mr inspector if not or if you haveit really doesnt really mattertake the meal with me i must eat before i can talk bridge was only too willing and herrick went up several degrees in his good opinion napper can cater excellently said he rubbing his hands i have often tested his hospitality dr jim privately thought that the inspector was not averse to testing anyones hospitality but the man seemed decent enough and herrick was sufficiently worldlywise to make himself agreeable to jackinoffice in another half hour the two were seated in a pleasant parlour before a wellspread table bridge performed wonders in the way of eating how he could remain lean with such an appetite was a wonder to jim but the doctor himself was not far behind and between the two of them they swept the table clean then herrick lighted his pipe ensconced himself in a chintzcovered armchair near the window and prepared to answer the inspectors questions before asking several of his own at the outset bridge detailed all that had been done up to that moment three policemen were looking after the pines so was the house called and guarding the dead a doctor was expected from beorminster to inspect the body the coroner to attend to the inquest and the relatives of the deceased had been notified then mr inspector put herrick through a stiff examination and took down all he said when the officer was quite satisfied and his notebook was full jim proceeded to make enquiries on his own account the strangeness of the whole affair roused his curiosity andas bridge pleasantly observedhe showed marked symptoms of detective fever this was the first time jim had stumbled across the disease the dead man was called colonel carr asked dr herrick crossing his legs the inspector nodded a wellknown county name said he wilfred lloyd carr you can see it in burkes landed gentry but what you will not see added bridge with a dry cough is the name he was known by hereaboutswicked colonel carr sir that is what every man woman and child called him not without reason doctor hm it does sound as though he had a bad reputation bad sir echoed the inspector not without pride a regular out and out rip but that he belonged to the gentry he would have been through my hands i can tell you and to think of him being murdered i aint astonished no i aint astonished he was too wicked to die in his bed as the christian he wasnt why do you say he was murdered asked jim alertly the revolver was in his hand looks like suicide to meat the first glance of course bridge laughed grimly and shook his head colonel carr was the last man in the world to take his own life sirtoo much afraid of the burning pit for that i examined the body this morning and i saymurder certainly my examination was cursory but if he had shot himself through the heart the linen over it would have been scorched there is no mark of powder not even a singe no sir that shot was fired at a long range if you did not alter the position of the body dr herrick i should say that the shot had been fired from the door i did not alter the position of the body mr inspector i merely turned it over and replaced it hm murder you say and the assassin placed the revolver in the dead hand to hint at suicide clever man or woman mr inspector which lord knows replied bridge rubbing his grey hair the colonel had heaps and heaps of enemies i can tell you whether man or woman i do not know but ill tell you one thing dr herrick whosoever fired the shot knew the colonel excellently well i see what you mean the assassin knew that his victim was lefthanded right sir youve hit it now added bridge meditatively could it have been frisco frisco who is he or her frisco was the servant of colonel carr explained the inspector and as great a mystery as his master san francisco he called himself and that i take it is the name of a town the wicked colonel shortened it to frisco for short yes frisco might have killed him if you would only give me a concise biography of carr i should be less in the dark mr inspector oh youll hear plenty of stories about himnone of them creditable but to put all you need know at present into a nutshell i can only say that the wicked colonel returned here from foreign parts ten years ago he built that tower and shut himself up to live the life of a recluse he brought frisco with him and the two inhabited that house all alone no one thought of going near it ah that is why the crime was not discovered earlier certainly doctor the milkman the baker and the butcher were always instructed to leave their goods in a porch at the side of the house in that porch added bridge we have found two days provisions today is friday last night when you discovered the body was thursday and the provisions for that day and wednesday were untouched hm so carr was alive on tuesday i believe doctor that he was murdered on tuesday night according to napper frisco was drinking here on that evening and spoke ill of his master carr must have been alive then if frisco killed him he would leave saxham on tuesday night therefore the provisions for wednesday and thursday would not be taken in did not the baker and the rest suspect anything when they found two days provisions untouched lord bless you no sir said bridge jovially the wicked colonel was that queer that nothing he did seemed strange well said jim after a pause from what you tell me it seems likely that this man frisco knows something of the murder if he did not commit it himself cant you find him there is no sign of the man sir what about his appearance a stout sailor thats what he looked like said bridge reflecting red hair and blue eyes an american way of speaking and a cross on his forehead right above the nose a cross what do you mean a scar sir a crisscross slash with a knife frisco said he got it in south america but i dont rightly know how frisco could be secret if he liked even in his cups and he could drink rum by the bucket have you set the detectives after him not yet i am waiting until the inquest is held it takes place today at the pines you will be there dr herrick and your friend certainly but my friend can tell you no more than i can if i were you though mr inspector i should certainly seek out this frisco man at once what is his real name i dont know nor anyone else sir he was a mystery i tell you as to looking him up i like to do things in an orderly manner first the inquest and all the available evidence sir then we shall see herrick shrugged his broad shoulders it was not his business to instruct bridge but it seemed to him foolish to delay hunting for this mysterious frisco the man might be innocent but on the face of it there appeared to be a strong suspicion against him men do not disappear without some reason and as frisco was gone leaving a dead body behind him it looked as though terror had winged his heels his reasons could resolve themselves into only one of two things either he had murdered his master himself and had fled to avoid the consequences or he knew who had committed the crime and intimidated by the assassin had made himself scarce while herrick was turning over the situation in his own mind a knock came to the door immediately afterwards a girl entered she was a slip of a thing who looked about nineteen slim and wellset up her face was oval and thin and burnt red by wind and sun herrick had never before seen hair of such a glorious red it resembled ruddy gold and was wreathed in burnished coils round her wellshaped head this young lady had eyes of a sapphire blue and a firmset mouth dressed in a navy serge plainly made with a linen collar a brown leathern belt and gauntlet gloves she looked trig and neat a girl likely to be passed over in a crowd until one looked into her wonderful eyes the soul that looked out of them proved she was a woman of no common intelligence her manner was refined and wellbred she was remarkably cool and after a shrewd glance at herrick addressed herself to the inspector i beg your pardon for interrupting you she said in a brisk but not unmusical voice this inquest mr inspector it takes place at the pines this afternoon miss endicotte replied bridge who seemed to know her well but surely miss you will not attend certainly mr bridge i do the copy for the chronicle besides poor colonel carr was my friend and i want to hear the truth about his death herrick looked sharply at the only person he had heard speak sympathetically of the dead man there lives some soul of good in all things evil he quoted and a flash of the girls teeth showed that she perfectly understood oh i know that everyone speaks ill of the colonel said she a trifle sadly he was bad enough no doubt yet your quotation applies to him more than the gossip about him would lead you to suppose here she glanced at bridge not so much to emphasise the fact that he talked ill of the dead as to invite an introduction bridge was quick to see her real meaning this is dr herrick who found the body said he and this lady doctor is miss bess endicotte who reports for the beorminster weekly chronicle jim was a trifle surprised and disappointed to find that this charming young lady occupied such a position though why he should have been either he could not explain even to himself however he bowed with a smile and received the same courtesies in return miss endicottes eyes rested approvingly on his splendid figure this is what i call a man they seemed to say but with her tongue she uttered quite different sentiments i am glad to meet you dr herrick she said gracefully you must tell me all about your discoverythat is you do not mind my making copy out of you not at all responded herrick eagerly i am accustomed to be made copy of my friend mr joyce who is at present upstairs asleep is a literary man i am quite hand and glove with the guild i assure you in that case we must be friends said miss endicotte frankly mr joyce was with you last night unfortunate yes miss endicotte he is a nervous man and not strong i am sorry to say that the terrible sight upset him all the good i hoped he would obtain from this walking tour has disappeared are you on a walking tour asked bridge who was putting on his cap yes for the last fortnight we have been tramping over the country the last place we stopped at was southberry then we crossed the heath to stumble on this disagreeable adventure why do you smile miss endicotte the girl flushed a trifle i have heard of you of me jim stared but i am not known in this part of the country my dear lady have we met before somehow your face seems familiar it would be more familiar were i two inches taller and had dark hair said miss endicotte with an amused look if you will stare at ah interrupted jim eagerly i remember now the lady i saw talking to the little curate in southberry church was my sister replied the girl when you mentioned southberry i remembered that she mentioned how you stared at her and described your appearance then i recognised you i hope your sister did not think me rude said jim rather confused but the fact is she is so i know interrupted miss bess composedly ida is accustomed to admiration but this is not business she added turning to bridge well whats to be done now mr inspector nothing can be done until the inquest is held he replied going towards the door but i recommend you miss bess to interview this gentleman he can tell you much that will be of interest to your readers the inspector slipped out with a laugh and miss endicotte turned her sparkling eyes on dr herrick i hope you wont think me a nuisance she said hesitating but if you could only too pleased said jim placing a chair what is it you wish to know miss endicotte all about yourself and your friend and the walking tour and the discovery thus far she rattled on blithely but then flushed and stammered please do not think me rude she murmured in my present capacity i am simply a machine for the beormister chronicle if you do not wish to tell me anything i have not the slightest objection replied jim laughing do you object to my smoking i can answer your questions better if i smoke please do cried miss endicotte eagerly i am used to it my brother frank is never without a pipe in his mouth your brother and i should get on well together then said herrick artfully not that he wanted to meet the brother so much as the beautysister of southberry church howeverthis interview miss bessas the inspector called her pulled out a pocketbook and became the reporter at once she was versed in her profession and put the shrewdest of questions all the same she appeared to be nervous at times and herrick guessed that it was the innately refined woman struggling with the necessary obstrusiveness of the breadwinner however he did his best to put her at her ease and told his story as concisely as possible my name is james calthorpe herrick he said i am a doctor supposed to be practising in west kensington london my friend joyce was one of my patientsis i should say he lost his mother and fell illby the way you need not put that down miss endicotte all you need let your readers know is that mr joyce and myself have been on a walking tour and stumbledas i said before on the pines and the body after which statement herrick detailed the arrival at the lighted house the exploration and the discovery miss endicotte put all this down and promised to amplify it in such a manner that it would not trench upon herricks private affairs then he asked the girl about colonel carr she was rather reticent on the subject i do not feel that i am justified in speaking of the matter she said shaking her head all i can say is that colonel carr was better than his reputation from what i can gather he was murdered well he expected to bethat is she broke off and flushed he expected to be murdered herrick looked keenly at her hush said miss endicotte with a glance at the door i have no right to say that it is a long story and not very clear if you remain in saxham if we become better acquainted i mighthow long do you stay it all depends upon my friend replied herrick his curiosity at feverheat with these hints he is ill i am afraid i must go up and see him now we shall meet again i hope i think so i shall be at the inquest and you of course i must give evidence joyce also if he is well enough by the way bridge mentioned some relatives of carrs who are they mrs marsh and her son said the girl with some reluctance they live in the bishops close at beorminster it will be a great shock to them although they were not on good terms with the colonel will they be at the inquest mr marsh will be there but his mother is very ill she caught cold a day or two ago and is now in bed with a sharp attack of pneumonia troubles never come singly said herrick sententiously by the way the suspicions of bridge about frisco i am sure he is innocent cried miss endicotte flushing frisco was bad but he loved the colonel he would not have killed him ii she suddenly shook her head checked herself and walked out of the room herrick stared was it possible that this charming girl knew the truth chapter iii the verdict of the jury robin woke calmer after his rest the nervous excitement had passed away but the reaction had left him as weak as a child he looked shrivelled up and pale when herrick saw him at once the doctor sat down to feel the little mans pulse which was slow and faint you must stay in bed today ordered the doctor replacing his watch i shall send you up some strong soup sleep as much as you can that is the best thing to pull you round should i not get up to look after this business with you there is no need the police have taken charge of the case your evidence is exactly the same as mine so i shall represent you at the inquest is there to be an inquest asked joyce with languid interest certainly this afternoon at the house from what inspector bridge told me it would seem that colonel carr was shot on tuesday night is the dead mans name colonel carr yes wicked colonel carr from all accounts he was one of the worst why did he commit suicide he did not if bridge is to be believed he insists that the man was shotperhaps by his servant who has vanished however we shall hear all that is to be heard this afternoon a colour crept into the wan cheek of joyce i should like to get up and hear all about it said he there might be material for a story you can hear details later on at present you must stay in bed until we return to town what about our walking tour i have decided to cut that short replied the doctor this adventure has given me a distaste for the trip in a day or so when you are rested we will return to london my practice is small but i must attend to it and what about me jim well reflected herrick you are now well enough off not to make work an imperative necessity i think you should go abroad for a time and do nothing until you are quite yourself explore italy or spain and dont do a stroke of work change of scene and company will make you your old self again in a short time never never moaned joyce i shall never get over her death nonsense dont give way robin you must be a man it was so sudden pleaded robin piteously i know didnt i attend her but apoplexy always ends suddenly your mother was a stout woman and took no exercise that fit might have been expected i warned her often you know i am sorry for your loss robin but sorrow will not bring back the dead you have your part to play in the world so you must put this grief behind you if i talk a little brutally you must excuse me to a man of your temperament sympathy is the worst thing possible in herricks hands joyce was more or less of a child so he submittedrather against his willto remain in bed while his friend went forth to hear the news as might have been guessed robin employed his solitude in gloating over his sorrow this weakness he did not dare to reveal to jim fearing lest he should be lectured again still he could not but acknowledge to himself that herricks advice was sensible meantime the doctor made a tour of the village the villagers swarming like bees in the excitement of the moment recognised a stranger and guessed that this was one of the two gentlemen said to have discovered the body hence herrick found himself the subject of considerable curiosity but was not molested or accosted in any way until he met with a clergyman this was on the outskirts of the village where a gorsecovered common stretched up to the pine wood surrounding the house of colonel carr the parson seemed to have been wandering on the waste land for he appeared suddenly at herricks elbow like a ghost probably he had seen the stranger coming and had just stepped out from behind a bush you are dr herrick he asked nervously jim signified that he was i am addressing the vicar he hazarded the rector corrected the other i am mr pentland corn you will excuse my breaking in on your meditations he continued but i guessed that you were the finder of the body of our late lamented friend humph from all i have heard there is very little lamentation over the colonels death scandal and evil tongues replied mr corn rather tautologically carr had his good points that is what miss endicotte says indeed i was not aware that you knew miss endicotte she came to the inn this morning to see inspector bridge about this wait said the revd pentland in a hurry some mistake miss bess is the journalist her elder sister miss ida is the head of the family the nominal head i should say since miss bess manages everything the rector smiled as he spoke and herrick on account of that smile took rather a fancy to him the revd pentland cornwonderful namewas something under forty and looked more like a soldier than a parson he had a smart soldierly figure wore a moustache and his hair cropped close but for his clothes herrick would have taken him for a military man he looked pale there were dark circles under his eyes and he seemed to be labouring under considerable stress of emotion perhaps the death of carr had been too much for him yet after the first remark he shirked the subject and talked of the endicottes that is the proper name of the family said corn hurriedly a very old family in these parts but miss bess calls her collective brothers and sisters the biffs dr jim smiled there seemed to be something fascinating about the name something characteristic of the girl he had met at the inn the biffs he repeated laughing outright and how is that derived from the high sounding name of endicotte it is not derived from that at all dr herrick it is simply the initials of the family there are five of them bess ida frank flo and sidney i see biffs ha ha how amusing do they live near here a quarter of a mile away at the back of my house sidney is my pupil and a strange boy he is but i have no business to tell all these things to a stranger added corn in confusion anything you say to me is perfectly safe replied herrick pleasantly i think miss bess a clever young lady and as good as she is clever a great friend of the late colonels i believe said jim pentland corn moistened his dry lips he was kind to her was his reply delivered in a faint voice you will excuse my emotion dr herrick but i am rather shaken by this death usually we are free from crime and for this to happen in my parish it is terrible you knew colonel carr well very well i tried to win him from his evil ways but he was cut off in the midst of his sin oh it is awful yet i liked him he was a good friend to me on one occasion the reason i stopped you was to ask if you met anyone in the house last night no one myself and my friend hunted all over it the servant bolted i have been told frisco has certainly disappeared responded corn looking at the ground but i do not think he is the guilty person he was devoted to the colonel then why did he run away ah who can say there was a mystery in colonel carrs life mr herrick which i fear will never be cleared up you will be at the inquest yes it takes place at three this afternoon and you sir no i shall not be there i cannot bear tobut that is neither here nor there broke off corn hurriedly tell me was the house alight every room was lighted it blazed like a palace in the wood colonel carrs whim he surrounded himself with the most beautiful things and installed the electric light water power you know added the rector rather inconsequently i expect the wheel was going constantly for the two days before the body was discovered herrick recollected the murmur in the wood and now guessed that it came from the waterfall which turned the wheel for the dynamos there was no doubt that colonel carr surrounded himself with every comfort did he ever have guests to stay with him he asked the rector made a gesture of surprise if you had known colonel carr you would not ask such a question he hated his fellowmortals then why had he so many bedrooms i cannot tell you but i am certain that he never had anyone to stay in the house i have been in it once or twice myself and miss bess has paid a visit but no other person has ever entered humph quite a mystery what about marsh ah i expect you heard of him from miss bess he is a great friend of the biffs stephen marsh will inherit the colonels property i expect what relation was he to carr his nephew but the two never spoke they hated each other mrs marsh then is the colonels sister oh dear me no the present mrs marsh is only stepmother to stephen a violent terrible woman with italian blood in her veins it was she i think who put stephen against his uncle she is very ill i hear pneumonia dear me said corn startled why she was at my house on tuesday but it was raining when stephen came for her i expect she got a chill then no doubt at all events she is seriously ill now i understand ha said the rector and looked down again i wonder if any doctor will attend her she has quarrelled with them all well there is no more to be said dr herrick by the way if i have talked freely you must excuse me for doing so i have a reason some day i hope to tell it to you are you stopping here for long a day or so i am on a walking tour with my friend mr joyce we return shortly to london goodday mr corn goodday replied the rector raising his hat and slipped away into the gorse bushes like a ghost herrick walked on somewhat puzzled what was the meaning of this frank speech to a stranger the parson looked smarter and more of a man of the world than many serious minded people would have approved of yet he had talked to say the least of it in a most indiscreet manner moreover he had promised quite unnecessarily to explain his reason for doing so to the doctor what did it all mean does he know something as well as miss bess thought herrick returning to the inn both of them seem to have a better opinion of colonel carr than the rest of the people humph i seem to be surrounded by mysteries here well we shall see what the inquest will do robin proved more fractious than herrick expected he was most anxious to be present at the inquest but in the end overruled by the stronger will of his friend he consented to remain where he was the doctor walked by himself to the pines and was received by inspector bridge who introduced him to the coroner and to dr tiler who had examined the body after some discussion bridge collected a jury of mixed villagers and beorminster citizens after these had inspected the body the witnesses were called herrick gave evidence of his discovery of the position of the body and of the condition of the house he was followed by tiler who declared that in his opinion carr had been shot on tuesday night going by the condition of the body he flouted the idea of suicide the shirtfront was neither blackened nor singed said tiler and it would have been had the deceased fired the revolver at so close a range he was shot through the heart and as i believe by someone who stood at the door it seems to me that he was standing by the bed and heard a footstep on the stairs at once he turned only to meet the levelled revolver the shot passed through his heart and imbedded itself in the opposite wall again there are three other shots in different parts of the body one in the neck another in the abdomen and a third in the right leg but the shot that killed the deceased was the the first that went through the heart how do you know that such a shot was the first asked the coroner from an examination of the wounds replied tiler the remaining three shots were fired when the man was down and dead said the coroner aghast certainly the deceased must have died almost instantaneously a thrill of horror passed through those present at the idea that the assassin had fired three more shots at the dead body there was something horrible about the wreaking of such vengeance and vengeance it must have been for bridge proved that no robbery had taken place but the most interesting part of bridges evidence was yet to come he produced the revolver found in the hand of the dead man all six chambers proved to be loaded therefore it would not have been this weapon which had been used the idea of suicide was out of the question also gentlemen continued the inspector the first shot was fired with a different weapon to that employed to fire the other three the bullet which passed through the heart and embedded itself in the wall has been extracted here it is the other three shots were found in the body and in the floor here they are the pieces of evidence thus produced were placed before the jury the first bullet was roundof the oldfashioned kind fired from a muzzleloading pistol the remaining three were conical in shape and of the most modern manufacture plainly then two pistols had been used one of an antique pattern to fire the first shotthe shot which killed the colonel and the other a revolver of the most modern type and this latter had been merely employed to make a target of the dead body finally said bridge after explaining all this the third pistolor rather revolver found in the hand of the deceased was not fired at all the chambers are loadedthere is no smokestain on the barrels it was simply put into the left hand of the dead to hint at suicide the person who did so knew that colonel carr was lefthanded but in his agitation forgot that the six chambers were loaded in fact he defeated his own scheme this evidence was surprising enough why should the assassin use two pistols when one would have sufficed and asked the coroner why do you say he mr inspector do you then think that the guilty person is a man i dont think a woman would have committed so brutal a murder said bridge bluntly she would have been satisfied with killing the man and not have proceeded to mutilate the body also the idea of putting a revolver into the hand of the dead would not occur to a woman there i differ from you mr inspector contradicted the coroner a woman might do such a thing and it is more likely a woman would forget in her agitation that the revolver was loaded than would a man in the like circumstances inspector and coroner argued out this point at length bridge losing his temper stated that he believed frisco shot his master and called napper as a witness the landlord stated that on tuesday night at six oclock frisco had been drinking rum at the carr arms he seemed to be angry with his master whom he alleged had treated him badly as he left the inn about seven oclock he said let him take care or he wont live long at the time napper thought it was merely a drunken threat but in the face of the death and friscos flight he thought that the man was guilty of course the coroner who had lost his temper with bridge told napper that he did not want his opinion but simply his evidence there was further trouble about this remark in which the inspector got the worst of it a final witness was stephen marsh he was a tall slight young man with bowed shoulders and a pensive face he stated that he had called on the evening of the murder for his mother at the rectory she had been up at the pines in the afternoon and as she drove home told him that colonel carr had expressed his intention of living for many a long day coroner why is mrs marsh not here to give evidence marsh my mother is seriously ill in bed and could not come coroner her evidence must be taken did she say how the conversation came about to induce the deceased to make such a speech marsh yes my mother wanted the colonel to lend her some money he refused she said that he might as well as when he died the estate would come to me it was then that my uncle expressed his determination to live for many a long day i merely give this evidence to show that my uncle had no thought of committing suicide coroner have you seen your uncle lately marsh no not for six months we were not on good terms coroner how was it then that mrs marsh called to see him on the afternoon of the murder marsh she was determined to go i asked her not to but she insisted at this reply there came a smile upon the faces of those of the jury who lived at beorminster afterwards herrick learned that mrs marsh was well known as possessed of a violent temper and there was no doubt as some one remarked that she had given the colonel a good talking to however the evidence of marsh did not point to who had killed carr at the time there was no more available evidence bridge insisted that frisco was guilty he had left the house in the clothes he stood up in evidently driven forth in a panic he had made inquiries and had heard from the police at southberry that friscoor a person answering to the description of friscohad gone to london by the morning train at this moment herrick asked to be allowed to give further evidence he had just recollected that he had seen such a man as was described i was stopping at southberry said herrick waiting for my friend mr joyce who had gone to london he went up on tuesday morning i was stopping at an inn near the railway station i got up earlyabout sevento send a wire to my house in london i had to go to the telegraph office at the station on the platform i saw a stout man with a soft hat pulled over his face he was dressed in a blue serge suit with a red tie and looked like a sailor i waited until the london train went and saw him get into a third class carriage coroner how is it dr herrick that you recollect this only now because i never thought of the matter before since inspector bridge has given a description of the dress and especially the red tie i am sure the man was frisco i did not see his face the coroner was displeased with this evidence and said so in fact he was a disagreeable man with a strong animus against bridge as there was no more evidence he summed up trying to prove that frisco could have had nothing to do with the murder however the jury were of a different opinion and more sensible so they brought in a verdict of wilful murder against frisco this made the coroner illtempered again and he left the pines in a great rage however the verdict was given the inquest was at an end and the jury left the house stephen marsh as the nearest relative of the dead man asked bridge to allow the three policeman to remain in the house as he had to return to his mother bridge consented and then marsh went up to herrick who was standing in the hall doctor said he will you come with me to beorminster i want you to attend my mother herrick stared she has a doctor already has she not mr marsh marsh shook his head no he replied in a low voice no beorminster doctor will attend her please come sir she is so ill although he was partly prepared for this explanation herrick could not help staring what had mrs marsh done that the medical fraternity at beorminster should boycott her in this way you are quite sure that no one will attend her he asked incredulously perfectly she has quarrelled with all the doctors i am very lucky to find you dr herrick or i should be obliged to send to london or to southberry and we are so poor that the expense would be too much for us you will come i hope jim liked the young mans face it was soft and mild but remarkably handsome in a dark way he could quite understand from such a face that a woman of imperious temper such as mrs marsh appeared to be could dominate and bully her stepson if fact stephen gave herrick the impression of being crushed it seemed to be herricks fate to meet with people who needed to be bolstered upwitness robin joyce also he had a shrewd suspicion that the revd pentland corn was of the weak type the proverb says that some men come into the world booted and spurred others saddled and bridled herrick was of the former type and these three weaklings of the latter however in spite of his strong will and dominating character jim had a kind heart he therefore consented to do marsh the favour he asked but i must go first to the inn he said my friend is there and i must see after him ill wait for you said stephen but pray do not be long i think my mother is dying nonsense said dr jim cheerily ill pull her round never give way marsh put out his hand and shook jims i have wanted a friend for many a long day he said i believe i have found one in you thats all right marsh and so jim took a second burden on his shoulder chapter iv at beorminster on their way to the inn herrick and his companion met bess endicotte she looked angry and her eyes sparkled as she advanced towards the two men isnt it a shame she said rapidly that verdict i mean i dont believe that frisco killed the colonel if he did not there was no reason why he should have run away replied marsh well cried miss endicotte indignantly i did not expect to hear you say that stephen you know as well as i do that the colonel always said that frisco was in the same danger as he was himself what danger was that asked herrick sharply bess hesitated and seemed to regret that she had let her tongue wag so freely but marsh answered for her we do not know what it was he said simply but my uncle always hinted that he had enemies frisco knew his secrets we did not and if that is the case why should frisco kill him retorted bess however what is done cant be undone i suppose frisco will be arrested theyll have to catch him first said dr jim a trifle grimly and as the man has got away so rapidly and is now lost in the wilderness of london i expect they will have some difficulty in doing that you are sure it was frisco you saw at southberry well i did not see his face but the clothes of the man at the station were the same in all respects as those described by napper ive put everything down said miss endicotte and now i am going home to biffstead to put the article into shape but i do not believe that frisco is guilty who is i do not pretend to know but i intend to find out what the police fail to do you cannot bess said stephen wagging his head but we must not wait dr herrick is coming with me to beorminster im so glad cried the girl it is a shame none of the doctors seeing your mother how lucky that dr herrick is here i shall see you again doctor shant i i have much to say to you i shall call on you with pleasure said jim gravely shaking hands at biffstead i suppose both stephen and bess laughed oh that is only my joke said she i call our family the biffs and the house biffstead the grange is where we live anyone will point out the place come when you can as the two men resumed their walk herrick could not forbear expressing himself about bess what a clever girl she is said he those eyes of hers twinkle like stars when she grows excited you know the family do you not marsh i have known them all my life we played together as children ida is my greatest friend herrick glanced a little jealously at the young man i saw her by chance at southberry he said carelessly she is very beautiful very but not so clever as bess bess is the head and tail and middle of the family were it not for her it would go to pieces but here we are at the inn ill wait for you here herrick i wont be long said the doctor and ran up the stairs as might be guessed robin the selfish was by no means pleased to be left alone he did not want jim to go to beorminster not even although the call was so imperative what shall i do without you he asked you will go to sleep replied herrick calmly now no nonsense joyce i have promised to see mrs marsh and i must keep my word how long will you be it all depends upon the state in which i find mrs marsh if she is very ill i may stay all night goodbye robin goodbye returned the little man a trifle sulkily there is far too much of the good samaritan about you jim you never think of that in relation to yourself said herrick with a laugh i hope to be back this evening make yourself comfortable as he ran down to rejoin marsh he could not help contrasting the two natures of stephen and robin it is true that he had not had much experience of marsh but from what he had seen of him he judged that he was of a grateful kindly disposition joyce on the other hand although he looked upon jim as his best friend was selfish to the core herrick from long association and because he had plucked him back on one occasion from the grave was attached to him but he oftentimes acknowledged that were not robin an interesting case from a medical point of view as he undoubtedly was he could not stand much of him still he had been so long the little mans friend that he could not tear himself away from old associations nevertheless robins yoke was beginning to gall and herrick was glad to get a day away from his society friendship is a tender plant and nothing kills it sooner than selfishness but robin in his peevish selfsatisfaction had not the sense to see that do you mind going by the bus asked marsh with a flush i am not rich enough to afford a cart of any sort i am quite used to public conveyances said herrick gaily and as to your being poor the dark days are over now i suppose so replied marsh thankfully at least my uncle always told me that i was to be his heir although we quarrelled so much i have to take the name of carr and fulfil certain duties i do not know what they are but i shall do them if only to get the money i do so want to be rich ah here is the bus what about the will asked herrick as they climbed up to the roof of the clumsy conveyance pardon me perhaps i should not ask you i do not mind in the least said stephen indeed i am glad to find that you take an interest in me i have had a lonely life the biffs are my only friends by the way who told you about the biffs herrick described his meeting with pentland corn and the conversation that had ensued he was remarkably confidential said herrick that is strange said marsh thoughtfully he usually keeps his mouth very much closed however he added in a lighter tone we can talk of him again at present we will speak of the will i have written to my uncles solicitors informing them of his terrible death i expect to hear from them tomorrow or the next dayperhaps later who are your uncles lawyersor rather i should say yours frith and frith of steel lane cheapside asked herrick in a tone of surprise yes do you know them i know of them they are the solicitors of my friend joyce that is strange said marsh gaily the world is very small after all is it not but i am forgetting my mother he added sadly i was told that mrs marsh was your stepmother so she is but we get on very well together she is devoted to me i expect you have heard of her violent temper well i have said herrick hesitating it seems to be well known if you will excuse my saying so oh its town talk replied stephen with a vexed flush but she is really a good dear woman and her own worst enemy since my fathers death five years ago she has been my best friend once she nursed me through a most serious illness there are worse women in the world than my stepmother herrick as you will find she is a noblelooking woman and i am glad to be rich if only for her sake she is fond of luxury but for my sake has borne poverty and we have been very very poor finished stephen with a sigh every word the young man uttered revealed his good heart jim was pleased to find such an unsophisticated youth for once in his life the young men he knew were usually old before their time and took a pride in being so but marsh talked with such candour that herrick saw he was as simple as the day you are a good fellow marsh said jim i am glad to have met you i echo your compliment said the other but here we are at beorminster i hope my mother is no worse the vehicle stopped at the foot of the hill upon which the cathedral was built herrick followed his companion up a winding street as steep as those at malta and after a breathless climb found himself in the great square the vast fabric of the cathedral rose black against a saffron sky and the bells were ringing for the evening service stephen led the way towards a far corner of the square and turned into a dingy side street sloping down the other side of the hill stopping at a tall narrow house three doors down he admitted himself by means of his latchkey and conducted his companion into a dark passage a woman with a candle held high above her head appeared at the end she was very old with white hair and fierce black eyes a foreigner as herrick guessed how is my mother petronella asked stephen hurriedly eh gran dio bad very bad signor replied the old italian she die if no doctor come i have brought one petronella thanks be to the saints cried petronella this way signor dottore my signora is up the stair piano piano she is bad so bad piano herrick suppressed a laugh the piano piano of petronella reminded him of the opening chorus in the barber of seville however he recovered his grave air when introduced into the bedroom of mrs marsh a few minutes examination convinced him that she was extremely ill her pulse was rapid she was in a high fever and her face looked scarlet still she was conscious and when the doctor had finished with her for the time being she beckoned to her stepson the deaththe examination she asked hoarsely the jury have brought in a verdict of wilful murder against frisco in spite of the pain she was suffering mrs marsh sank back on her pillow with a smile i always thought that man would kill carr some day she muttered who is the doctor stephen marsh detailed all he knew about herrick while that gentleman was giving directions to petronella his stepmother listened attentively and nodded when he finished i am glad he had the decency to come she said these wretches here should be punished by the law i dont want to die now there is a chance of being comfortable for the rest of my life you must not talk mrs marsh said herrick coming to her bedside and i think your son had better go downstairs am i very ill asked the woman oh you are not so bad as you might be replied jim cheerfully do not excite yourself obey my directions and you will be all right shortly i suffer such pains moaned mrs marsh i can get no sleep chloral whats that asked herrick sharply chloral or morphia give me something to soothe the pain ill see to it said the doctor cheerfully and looked at the handsome face of his patient he saw that she was a highlystrung woman and from the word she had used he guessed that she was in the habit of taking chloral to induce sleep mrs marsh was the kind of person who would end her days in a madhouse if not soothed by artificial means from the passionate expression in her eyes the wrinkles on her face her impatient gestures herrick saw that she had absolutely no control over her temper perhaps the rumours he had heard of her influenced such a judgment but afterwards he found that he was absolutely right the outbursts of rage to which mrs marsh was subject were little removed from madness the only person who could deal with her was petronella who as herrick learned had been her nurse and knew how to manage and humour her i shall stay here all night he said to the italian after certain remedies had been applied make up a bed for me somewhere and send out to the chemist for this prescription to be made up it was late when jim descended he found stephen waiting for him at the foot of the stairs and was conducted by him into a small bare room sparsely furnished with two arm chairs a few books and a table covered with writing materials herrick rather tired threw himself into one of the chairs and informed stephen that he would stay the night is my mother so ill asked the young man anxiously pretty bad but i have seen worse cases dont you trouble yourself marsh ill do the best i can to save her life save her life echoed stephen sadly ah what a terrible thing it will be if she dies now when wealth is coming she always wanted to be rich and nowlife is very cruel that depends upon the way you look at it said jim give me some supper marsh and a whisky i feel rather played out the meal was waiting in a povertystricken looking diningroom jim saw that the pauperism of the marshes was no fiction they were evidently terribly poor certainly the colonel had done nothing to alleviate their distress he would not give us a penny said stephen after supper and when they were smoking in the small room which proved to be the young mans special sanctum all the time he kept telling me that i was his heir but refused to help my mother and me i do not want to speak evil of the dead added stephen but colonel carr he shook his head by this time herrick had seen his patient sinking into a sleep and leaving petronella to call him should anything go wrong was prepared for a little conversation he utilised the time by asking marsh about himself and his uncle the young man answered him with the utmost frankness and indeed seemed glad to have a friend in whom he could confide my father was a gentleman farmer he said but he attended more to pleasure than to business while out hunting he saved the life of miss carr the colonels sister afterwards she married him i was their only child for my mother died when i was born my father lost all his money from reckless living and went abroad for economy in italy he met my stepmother who is the daughter of an english consul by an italian mother he met her in a little town on the adriatic coast her father was dead and she was alone save for petronella it was her intention to become a singer but she fell in love with my father he brought her home to beorminster along with petronella who would not leave her with what remained of his money my father bought this house five years ago he died leaving my mother two hundred a year with this freehold and that income we have managed to scrape along i was educated at bedford and afterwards went to oxford my father said that though he could give me no money he could at least afford me a decent education i believe he pinched himself to do so mrs marsh helped me for she has always been good to me i was twentyone years old when my father died and after the funeral i wanted to go to london and become a journalist mrs marsh however would not hear of this she insisted that i was the colonels heir and that i should wait till he died ah interrupted herrick shaking his head bad thing waiting for dead mens shoes do you think it was my wish to do so protested stephen passionately i should much have preferred to earn my own living and fight my way in london i have some talent as a poet and a writer and i was prepared to battle with the world like other people but mrs marsh made me stop with her i am twentysix years of age now and i have done nothing i write poetry and send it to the american magazines also a few prose articles these keep me supplied with pocketmoney it was bess who put me on to the new york papers there the editors are more open to new talent and the colonel refused to help you always but i never asked him i hated that man said marsh between his teeth i never went near his house at times my mother called to see him she always fought viciously with him and i think he liked her for that most people were afraid of him and he admired her for standing up to him colonel carr thought me a fool and a weakling because i stayed with mrs marsh instead of going out into the world but i ask you herrick what else could i have done mrs marsh had always been good to me she sacrificed much so that i might be well educated so the least i could do was to stop with her again and again i wanted her to come with me to london but she always refused i understand said jim filling his pipe she wished to keep an eye on the colonel i think so carr always said that i was to be his heir he has no relative but me and he was reported to be wealthy i should think so marsh that house is filled with treasure did he inherit his money stephen looked up alertly ah now you are touching on the secret of carrs life he said with some excitement his father died ruined and left him nothing but the pines with a few acres of farm and cornland do you know how old colonel carr was doctor no i saw him only after his death not very old i should say just sixty replied stephen and into his life he crammed enough wickedness to fill a century he was twenty when his father died and in the army by gambling and speculating he supported himself and left his sister my mother in that old ruined house afterwards he left the armycashiered for cheating at cards and led a hand to mouth existence but he would never sell the pines however hard up he was he stopped there on occasions and played the devil all round i cant tell you how bad he was it is the commontalk of the countryside he was called mad carr and wicked carr colonel carr put in herrick no he was only a captain when he left the army at the age of thirty i believe he called himself colonel when he returned ten years ago from what quarter of the world marsh shook his head i cannot tell you said he slowly for twenty years carr vanished from england my mother was left behind in the old house and afterwards married my father she should have made a better match but she had little money and the reputation of her brother did her no good however she married my father and afterwards died when i was born that was the end of her the colonel left his lawyers to look after the property and remained away i always heard that it was in south america he picked up his money at all events he returned here ten years ago with plenty of cash the first thing he did was to put the house in order and fill it with splendid furniture he engaged a staff of servants and wanted to entertain at first the people were disposed to be friendly but he went on worse than ever and everybody cut him in a rage he sent away all the servants and only kept frisco did frisco come back with him from south america yes but whether it was south america or north i cannot say frisco could hold his tongue when he chose however carr turned his back on the country people and went on worse than ever he was said to be mad but i think it was mere devilment myself one queer thing he didno two queer things the building of the tower was one said herrick shrewdly marsh nodded and the other mad act was the throwing down of the walls and fences round the pines dr jim looked puzzled humph said he i noticed that the house had no fences round it one came upon it suddenly as if it had been dropped from the skies carr threw down the walls to show that he was not afraid on the other hand he must have built that tower to show that he was i do not understand what you mean why it is not difficult if you remember what you said to me when we met that girl you hinted that carr was afraid of something in which frisco was concerned well then evidently his first attitude was one of defiance towards this fear afterwards he thought better of it and built the tower a man would not leave that splendid house to sleep in a bare room at the top of a tower unless he was afraid i think you are right said stephen musingly but i dont know what he was afraid of it was the third year after he returned that he built the tower and he was in such a hurry to get it done that he had the men working at it by night you know he has a magnificent system of electricity round about the pines well the lights were on night after night until the tower was finished and relays of workmen replaced one another the whole county wondered at the way carr went on he gave no explanation no he saw no one but shut himself up like a hermit frisco attended to the house and cooked the colonels meals but i think carr often cooked for himself he was fond of cooking for eight years he never went outside that house humph that accounts for the gymnasium the bowling alley and the shooting gallery what about his business he did it all my means of letter frith and frith sent down a clerk occasionally carr was a clever man of business and invested his money in good securities so my mother said she used to beard him in his den and the clergyman corn yes he called also to try and reform the colonel but he did not succeed a good fellow corn but weak can hold his tongue though on the contrary he talked a good deal to me so you said muttered stephen i wonder what he meant by that did he know the secret of carrs life not that i know of corn always kept his mouth shut as i said why he should have talked openly to you i cant say it seems to me that there are mysteries on all sides said herrick with a shrug miss bess used to visit carr you say she did once or twice but i shall leave her to tell you of her visits and her opinion of her host marsh said dr jim after a pause have you any idea who murdered carr no not the remotest unless it was frisco on the face of it one would think so why did frisco run away stephen rubbed his chin i think we must ask bess said he thoughtfully if anyone knows what is at the back of all this it is bess endicotte chapter v the theory of mrs marsh for the next week or so herrick had his hands full mrs marsh grew rapidly worse and several times nearly slipped through his fingers but the doctors skill petronellas nursing and above all the indomitable determination of mrs marsh not to die enabled her to turn the corner she became much better but still suffered from racking pains at times herrick gave her morphia but did so sparingly from petronella he learned that she had taken chloral for years past and feared that if she gained a taste for morphia she might take to it instead of the weaker drug for stephens sake jim could not let that happen never had herrick had so unruly a patient he did not wonder that she had quarrelled with all the beorminster doctors the wonder was that she had a friend left her temper was ungovernable and she fought herrick on every point that did not chime in with her inclinations in spite of the fact that he was attending her out of sheer kindness and had intimated to stephen that he expected no fee mrs marsh abused him virulently whenever she felt so inclined but then she abused everyone even petronella who was her slave as to stephen devoted as he was to her she could not find words bad enough for him sometimes he was a fool a ninny a milksop he lived upon her charity etc etc yet there were times when the young man was all that was good in her eyes even herrick came in for his share of praise at odd moments gran dio petronella would say to herrick after some tussel was there ever such a diavola as the padrona the old italian woman had taken a great fancy to dr jim he was good to her mistress whom she idolized he was kind to petronella herself and could speak her language he had once made a tour of europe for three years with a young dipsomaniac and had contrived to pick up three or four tongues which he spoke remarkably correctly spanish french german italian dr jim knew them all and could both read and write them with wonderful accuracy in the eyes of petronella he was a marvellous man and she often talked to him on subjects which she would not discuss with anyone else do not be angry with the padrona signor dottore she said sometimes it is the blood of the michelotto family eh the michelotti were wicked like colonel carr eh petronella signor dottore the colonel was an angel of light to the wicked michelotti the padrona is the last of them and it is not wonder she is angry per bacco added petronella who could swear on occasions see this casaa fitting casa for the last of the grand signori but it is all right now petronella as soon as your signora can be removed we shall take her to the pines that is a fine casa if you like petronella spat and shook her white elflocks it will bring no luck eh signor but that man had the evil eye once i went with the padrona to see him he overlooked me although i made horns and i hurt my foot if my padrona goes to that casa she will die herrick shrugged his shoulders and did not argue there was no means of persuading petronella out of the spite she had taken to the pines it was now the property of stephen marsh the senior partner of frith and frith had come down personally with the will this left stephen the house on condition that he pulled down the tower furthermore the personal property of the late colonel amounting to eight thousand a year well invested was given to the young man on a still more curious condition you are to have a special vault constructed in saxham churchyard said mr frith it is to be built of stone and lined with sheet iron the body of our late client is to be put in there and you alone are to hold the key of the door once a month you are to enter the vault and see that the body is safe if you do this for a year then the property becomes yours absolutely if you miss going once the money goes tofrisco to friscothe colonels servant said stephen in surprise and by that name mr frith yes it is legal enough but the man evidently murdered his master and has gone away to avoid consequences i do not think you will be troubled by him also mr marshor rather mr carr since you have to take the nameyou can avert all chance of this man getting the money by visiting the vault monthly for a year here was another mystery why the money should have been left to frisco no one could guess stephen often talked it over with herrick but could come to no conclusion however he set to work to carry out the terms of the will a body of workmen were employed to take down the tower and mr corn was seen about the construction of a new vault evidently the colonel did not consider that his remains would be safe in the ancestral burialplace in spite of all secrecy the countryside came to know of this strange provision of carrs will and it was said that he wanted to make sure that his body would not be carried off by the devil to whom he had sold himself in fact the general opinion was that some night the remains would be carried off like those of the old woman of berkley the villagers grew confused over the matter and did not distinguish between the body and soul while mrs marsh was slowly getting better and stephen was attending to the carryingout of the will dr jim remained at saxham or rather for the sake of his patient he lived at beorminster paying occasional visits to the village robin had long since returned to london and had left in much anger at jims refusal to accompany him you have found a new friend he said angrily and i must go to the wall i do call it unfair jim my dear robin i cannot be your shadow you are quite well able to look after yourself now i took you for this walking tour to do you good now you are in excellent health i must remain here until mrs marsh is quite well remember if i go she has no doctor to attend her i cant do without you persisted robin you have such an influence over me that i am lost if you are away you must take up your life on your own shoulders replied herrick impatiently it is no use relying on other people but if you feel that i am so indispensable to you why not stay here you have money no ties and can do your work here better than in london i want to go back to town if i stay here i shall not see much of you marsh is your friend now i like marsh he is a good fellow and i can make something of him i suppose robin you think i am after his money but you know me better than that the three hundred a year i have is enough for me i was never a man for luxury i never thought or hinted such a thing said joyce with a blush well if you like to stay here jim ill return to london and we can meet when you return i suppose youll be back some timethat is if miss endicotte will let you go nonsense replied dr jim she has no thought of me i like her very much but in my present state of poverty i could not ask her to be my wife joyce said nothing more but the next week took his leave he was much missed in saxham where his bright talk and merry face had made him a general favourite the biffs especially were sorry bess had foregathered with joyce on the common ground of literature and she lamented when he departed why cant you stay here she said in her blunt way you can work better in the country no miss bess i am like charles lamb london is my home i cannot get enough of the divine fire in this tame locality there is nothing tame about it cried bess fired with indignation joyce laughed not to you perhaps but i prefer london myself however i hope you will let me come down and see you at times and we can correspond and if you have any manuscripts you think well of send them to me i will see what i can do with them this arrangement was made and robin taking a friendly leave of jim went back to his west kensington fiat he wrote frequently at first but after a time his letters became rarer herrick was sorry but on the whole somewhat relieved to be rid of such a burden for robin was one of those people who are delightful to meet and terrible to live with had he been ill or in trouble the conscientious jim would have stayed with him but since he had been particularly well after that attack of nerves when the body was discovered there was no necessity for herrick to martyrise himself further and besides jim had fallen seriously in love with ida endicotte when mrs marsh was fairly on the road to recovery stephen had taken jim over to saxham and introduced him to the biffs they lived in a tumbledown house of considerable size down a deep and leafy lane at one time the endicottes had been great folks but the late mr endicotte who had married the daughter of an earl had squandered the revenues of the family his wife lady arabella had died of sheer worry and mr endicotte had found himself alone with five children and an impoverished estate for a time he did his best to keep things together but ultimately diedas it was saidof a broken heart it seemed probable that the five children would go on the parish what a fall for the haughty endicotte it was at this juncture that lord gartham stepped in he was an irish peer and poor himself but he could not see his sisters children entirely penniless ida the eldest was twentyfour when her father died bess had reached the age of twentythree and sidney the youngest was sixteen the five endicottes were all handsome and had high spirits but poorer than the proverbial church mouse what was to be done well earn our own livings said bess who was the most energetic of the five ida can look after the house frank can manage the farm and sidney can go to school and i shall ask mr arch to take me on to the weekly chronicle but my dear child expostulated the earl what does it matter cried bess we are the endicottes whatever we may do everybody knows who we are and what we are there is nothing disgraceful in earning ones own living uncle gar the earlrather a helpless personwho had never done a stroke of honest work in his life was rather surprised at the energy of bess however her scheme recommended itself to his favour since there was absolutely no other way of settling the matter in one way and another lord gartham paid off the debts by selling some of the land and arranged that the united five should have a small income which they would have to increase as best they could thus it was that the endicottes found themselves with their ancestral home a small farm two hundred a year and the world before them they were all young and hearty so they thought very little of the matter bess obtained a post on the weekly chronicle at beorminster ida looked after the house and frank managed the farm flo was put to a beorminster school whence she returned once a week to saxham and sidney studied under mr corn who expressed a desire to take him the countryside all approved of this independent spirit and made much of the biffs when the colonel died this had been going on for three years ida was still unmarried as she had refused several offers i cannot leave the children she said and people were divided as to the wisdom of this attitude some said it was right but the majority agreed that it was a pity such a beautiful girl should develop into an old maid but the fact is no one knew idas secret she was in love with stephen and although they had never spoken on the subject they understood one another very well hitherto stephens poverty had prevented his speaking openly now the inheritance of eight thousand a year had altered all that and he intended to ask ida to be his wife on the very earliest opportunity it was a pity jim did not know of this he had fallen in love with ida and as she was always pleasant to him it never crossed his mind that her heart was engaged open on most points with his new friend stephen out of delicacy for ida was reticent about his love so jim continued to live in a fools paradise and not even the sharpeyed joyce had been able to able to enlighten him certainly mrs marsh had spoken to jim on the subject she wanted stephen to marry miss endicotte but dr herrick thought that was merely her own desire and did not think there was anything serious between the young people nor could mrs marsh inform him of more than the fact that they liked one another and that it was the desire of her heart to see them married one day when stephen was at saxham mrs marsh had a long talk with the doctor in which he saw more of her stormy character than had ever been shown to him before she could sit up in bed now and wearied of the society of petronella frequently asked herrick to stay beside her you are one of the few sensible men i have met she said drawing her black brows together come and talk i want you to tell me what you think of stephen what can i think but that he is the best of fellows replied jim taking a chair by the beside hm that sounds like the weakest of men stephen i mean you are strong enough in every way that is why i want you to look after stephen how do you mean look after him mrs marsh the widow mused for a time before replying he is a goodhearted fool she said at last and with his sweet nature is likely to be imposed upon in this world now he is rich and scoundrels will prey on him i want you to see he comes to no harm but i have to return to london remonstrated jim rather taken aback by the responsibility thrust upon him i am not a rich man mrs marsh and i must look after my practice i can arrange all that she replied sharply you are a good man dr herrick i can see that and im no fool all your influence over stephen will be for good i can get him to offer you some inducement to stay beside himat all events until he is married until he is married echoed jim puzzled has he any intention of getting married not that i know of he is too much wrapped up in his poetry but i wish him to marry ida endicotte she is a wellborn girl and a good woman i think she will make stephen an excellent wife she likes him jim felt the blood flush in his face liking is not love he said in a rather irritated tone mrs marsh pulled the curtains aside so that the light fell on the face of the young man then after a scrutiny she gave a short laugh so that is it is it she said you are in love with the girl i never said so mrs marsh pshaw you cant blind me i am a woman come you are in love herrick shrugged his broad shoulders i do not see why i should deny it he said coldly i am in love with miss endicotte but so far as i can judge she is not in love with me i dont think she is in love with anyone replied mrs marsh but i have not seen enough of her to judge if i could only see them together i could tell she likes stephen though but here i am chained to this bed and cannot get out to attend to matters of importance humph she eyed herrick steadily so you are in love with her well it has been the desire of my life to see stephen married to ida but for all that i want you to stay stephen shall give you a thousand a year to stay my dear mrs marsh now dont contradict me or you will put me out of temper and you know what that means i ask you to stop to show my regard for you many another woman would get you out of the way rather than see her pet scheme interfered with i am not that sort of narrowminded person you shall have your chance along with stephen if she loves you marry her in gods name and lets have done with the matter if however she prefers my poor stephensweethearted fool that he isyou must promise me not to put any obstacle in the way of the marriage if miss endicotte prefers your stepson i certainly should not think of objecting mrs marsh said herrick stiffly your remark is rather unnecessary i dont think it is retorted the widow you are a gentleman i know but you are also a human being and when love comes into the question there are few things a man will not do or a woman for the matter of that she clenched her thin hand that laid outside the coverlet and her face darkened i know i know she muttered between her teeth who should know but i who have suffered give me something to drink doctor my throat is dry with talking i think i had better leave you said herrick after her thirst was assuaged you are wearying yourself dont go cried mrs marsh abruptly i have much to say of importance i may not be here long to say it nonsense mrs marsh you are getting bettermuch better all the same i may die one never knows said the widow gloomily herrick laughed at these forebodings what said he trying to joke her out of so morbid a mood have you enemies like carr anyone who came into contact with carr was bound to have enemies said mrs marsh bitterly he was a devil if ever there was one however this is not to the point she went on impatiently i want to know if you will stay with stephen for a thousand a year it is a tempting offer to a poor man like myself said herrick with some hesitation but until stephen himself asks me to stay i cannot promise he may not wish oh that is all right dr herrick stephen knows that you are his best friend i want you to take him in hand and make a man of him he is too fond of poring over books too careless of his physical health make him ride and golf and all the rest of it i have been a fool keeping him so much beside me but i love the boy and that was my womans weakness now he is rich teach him how to use his riches and be happy you have most influence over him said herrick still hesitating i have had too much and not for the best was her gloomy reply no you are the teacher he wants besides who knows what may happen to me herrick looked at her uneasily again she had hinted at something of danger to herself i wish you would be plain with me he said what do you mean asked mrs marsh with a frown i think you can guess retorted the doctor you hint at your dying so far as i know there is not the least likelihood of your doing so unless you take an overdose of that chloral which i am always advising you to leave off have you some enemy who is likely to no replied mrs marsh with unnecessary violence i have no enemy but i feeli have a presentimentthat i am not long for this world as an italian you know i am bound to be superstitious i should think the english part of your blood would revolt against such morbid nonsense again i say you are not plain with me i am how dare you talk to me so cried mrs marsh furiously you are the one man i have met in this world of fools other than that dead devil carr if i made a confidant of anyone it would be of you but so far as i personally am concerned there is nothing to say but stephen she hesitated and fell to plucking restlessly at the coverlet well you wish me to be his bearleader if he is willing i am willing a thousand a year is not to be despised moreover my conscience is perfectly clear as regards miss endicotte i understand if she loves you marry her by all means if stephen is her choice you must promise i promise nothing said herrick impatiently walking to and fro there is no necessity to promise i am a man of honour if stephen and miss endicotte love one another i am the last man in the world to step between them you know that if i didnt i should not ask you to stop and look after him said mrs marsh cynically however you complained of my want of confidence i am going to amend that do you know why i want you to stay with stephen to make a man of himso you said that certainly but it is something of an excuse i also want youand this is the main reasonto guard him against whom what are you hinting at asked herrick sharply at frisco was the unexpected reply oh you may look astonished but if you remember the willwell the will repeated dr jim i see what you mean the money goes to frisco if stephen should neglect to visit the vault monthly for a year what of that this much frisco killed colonel carr oh i am sure of it if not why did he fly besides there is no one else i can think of who had an interest in carrs death i do not know what secrets he had but what there were frisco knew that was why carr left the money to him failing stephen nonsense if frisco possessed colonel carrs secrets he could have blackmailed him without the necessity of murder ah you dont know said mrs marsh mysteriously i have heard frisco and carr quarrel it is my beliefif you remember nappers evidence that they quarrelled on the night of the murder they must have fought a duel which is just what two devils like them would do frisco killed his master before he could fire a shot that is why all the chambers of the revolver were found loaded well frisco has had to fly but he will not give up his chance of getting the money no he will here mrs marsh bent forward to whisper he will try and maim or kill stephen so that he may not fulfil the conditions of the willand visit the vault then frisco will claim the money i have thought this all out while lying here it is ingenious replied herrick but you forget that if frisco shows himself he will be arrested that stops his attempting to harm stephen mrs marsh shook her head you do not know frisco i do she said and not another word could herrick extract from her chapter vi the changeling while the tower at the pines was being pulled down stephen paid frequent visits to saxham sometimes dr herrick went with him and together they would go through that wonderful house marsh had never before been inside it and he was amazed at the luxury his life had been so simple so deprived of all beauty that his artistic temperament had been starved from lack of nutriment highly gifted with the imaginative faculty possessed of a keen perception of loveliness stephen revelled in the beautiful things which filled every corner of the house you will have to get a wife to share it all said herrick one day after his conversation with mrs marsh he looked keenly at the young man as he spoke stephen however betrayed no emotion i suppose i shall have to marry some day he said coolly if i were to die without children my cousin would get the property i did not know you had a cousin said herrick rather astonished i believe so a distant cousin although i have never seen him my mother can tell you all about him it seems that colonel carrs father had a younger brother who was turned out by his father he went to america and married there then he died leaving a widow and a daughter the widow died and the daughter married some one in the states i do not know the name but my mother may i believe there is a son but whether he is in america or in england i cannot say humph said jim very interesting i must ask your mother about this if you secure the property by complying with the conditions of the will it will be yours entirely even if you do not marry you will be able to leave it to whomsoever you please i should leave it to my cousin whatever his name is said stephen in a careless tone it seems to me that he has the right to enjoy it after me since he is of the carr blood always provided you do not marry and have children of course but there is time enough to think of marriage i want my mother to be sole mistress of this beautiful place for a time she has had such a dose of poverty that i should like her to taste luxury you are not in love then asked herrick in a jocular tone i dont know this time stephen flushed ill tell you when i am meantime let me enjoy the present ill soon have this tower down and the house put to rights then my mother can come i hope you will stay also herrick he added rather anxiously i dont want to lose my friend you know it all depends replied jim with a flush he was thinking of ida i will remain until your mother is quite well you may be sure of that nothing more was said at the time herrick could not be certain that stephen was in love with ida or that the girl had set her heart on marsh they were excellent friends but in spite of herricks lynx eye he could not learn if they understood one another as a matter of fact they did but neither of them wished to hurry matters both felt that mrs marsh would have to be consulted before anything was settled and therefore waited until she recovered her health and was established at the pines mrs marsh slowly regained her strength and almost dispensed with herricks attendance she never recurred to the subject of ida or of frisco after that one interview although herrick several times tried to make her speak evidently she knew something about the manperhaps had heard the colonel speak of him but whatever it was she kept her own counsel there was no need that she should do otherwise perhaps if frisco had made his appearance she might have been induced to speak out but the exsailor as herrick learned he was had vanished completely he was traced to paddington station and after that all sign of the trail was lost like a rain drop he had disappeared into the mighty sea of london life and in spite of all offers of reward not a hint could be gained of his whereabouts it was generally considered that he was the criminal most people holding that he had shot the colonel unawares nappers evidence went to prove that the two men were on bad terms with one another and probably frisco excited by rum and a sense of his wrongs whatever these might be had returned to the pines with the intention of righting himself no one entertained the idea of a duel having been fought only mrs marsh gave frisco that grace herrick considered her theory a feasible one and felt that it was confirmed by the fact of the revolver found in the dead mans hand being loaded if frisco had fired first the colonel would have fallen with his weapon undischarged and this would account for the six chambers being filled but what it would not account for was the fact of one bullet being different to the remaining three that was a puzzle and dr jim could in nowise arrive at the solution of the problem although he thought over it a great deal bess endicotte was the only person who insisted on friscos innocence she declared that the man was too devoted to his master to kill him and that there could be no reason for the crime this she explained to herrick a week after the interview with mrs marsh both herrick and marsh had come over to biffstead to spend the afternoon intending to return to beorminster by the last bus somewhere about ten oclock it was characteristic of stephens simple habits that he still went to and fro by the public vehicle although he could now have afforded a cart a horse a bicycle or even had he so chosen a motorcar but before taking full advantage of his new position and of his wealth he wanted his mother to be well enough to direct matters she had held him in subjection for so many years that he hesitated to do anything without her approval so herrick and stephen came to saxham by the bus or used their legs for the sake of his health herrick made marsh walk as much as possible the man was visionary and it was necessary to shake him into something like practical life by exercise on arriving at the grange the two young men found the whole family at home there was ida tall and beautiful who welcomed the visitors in her usual placid way she was of the junoesque type stately and maternal moving like a large goddess amongst minor mortals bess who was all alert and vivacious was accustomed to make fun of idas stately ways the sacred white cow said bess folding her hands and when ida remonstrated pointed out that the term meant no disrespect juno was called oxeyed and im sure the cow is a most beautiful animal said she inconsequently why should a comparison to a useful animal be taken as an insult if i said you were like a fawn or a stag or a swan you would be quite pleased but because i call you a lovely snowy cowyou are a beautiful cow broke off bess with a shrug the sacred white cow there really bess you are getting more dreadful every day cried ida helplessly please dont call me this horrid name when stephen and dr herrick come dr herrick would understand he is a scholar however i wont call you anything but junowill that do i should prefer to be called by my proper name bess made a mouth but yielded the point she was devotedly fond of ida and always said that her beauty would raise the family into affluence once more my brains may do something she said but idas looks will attract all the men of wealth and position i do not want any of them protested ida with a blush do let me see after my own future bess darling undeniably bess was the cleverest of the family she was so bright and quick and possessed of such indomitable perseverance that she easily exercised a despotic sway over the weaker vessels ida looked after the house but bess was the real head who paid the bills and bullied the tradesmen and saw that everything was in order even frank gave way before her but frank was rather like ida in the matter of bovine simplicity he was a big handsome fellow never out of temper when he was not looking after the farm he strolled in the fields and searched into the secret workings of nature sometimes he wrote articles for the papers and magazines a gilbert white of the parish of saxham that is what frank endicotte was some of his articles had even been accepted in london and when he could be induced to write he usually made a few guineas but frank was lazy and it needed all the scolding of bess to make him do his duty in the way of literary work so far as the farm went he was never idle as he loved an open airlife and took a genuine interest in stock top drainage and crops florence who was now home on her weekly holiday bounced out on dr jim and stephen as they came up the avenue she was a girl in her teens more like bess than any of the rest and bubbled over with animal spirits this was her last quarter at school and now her hair was turned up and she had arrived at the dignity of long frocks but at heart she was still a schoolgirl and on this especial day had let down her long hair much to the dismay of ida who was nothing if not conventional oh stephen she cried clasping him by the arm i am so glad you have come frank is writing bess is typing and ida is making a new dress i have no one to amuse me where is the changeling asked stephen laughing sidney oh he has a holiday and has gone over to see the pines you know how fond he is of going there he was the only one of us that was not afraid of the colonel i dont think bess was no it would take an army to frighten bess how are you dr herrick i am rude not to have spoken to you before come inside and wake us all up i am sure this place is like the palace of the sleeping beauty suppose we go over to the pines and have afternoon tea in one of the rooms suggested stephen there is no food there but we can take what we want from here and have a picnic jolly cried flo the schoolgirl there are kettles and teapots and all the rest of the things we want at the pines i suppose the house is remarkably well furnished said herrick laughing it is a good idea three oclock we had better go at once the others entered into the scheme with avidity and thus it was that herrick found himself walking beside bess to the pines not without a pang had he relinquished ida to his friend but bearing in mind the confidence reposed in him by mrs marsh he desired to act as fairly as possible besides he was growing fond of bess she was such a bright companion and so clever at first she was disinclined to speak of the colonel and frisco but gradually became more outspoken in his quiet way herrick had a wonderful gift of making people talk i wouldnt say it to any one but you dr jim said bessfor so she now called him but there is something about you that makes me believe in you i think you must have a kind of daemonic influence like goethe i am sympathetic if that is what you mean said jim i took to you immediately i saw you in the inn parlour bess blushed a little through her tanned skin and cast a keen look at the big man somehow herrick was conscious of that look and wondered what it was for perhaps with a womans quickness bess divined that he admired ida and did not approve of it however she was too clever to say anything if such was the case but went on to talk of colonel carr and frisco i liked frisco she said in her quick decisive way he was a bad man and some of the things he told me he had done were really dreadful but somehow he was attractive much better than the colonel i thought you liked the colonel said jim with a side glance well you see it was this way replied the girl laughing i was rather bold in introducing myself to him and he was so kind that i forgave him his bad reputation how was it you met him i wanted some copy for the chronicle and did not know what to write about something had to be done so i kept my ears open for an idea ida happened to mention something about the pines so i thought it would be nice to see all the wonderful furniture that was in the house would you believe it she added lightly i went straight to the pines and asked to see colonel carr at first he refused but i was so persistent that he let me come in i told him frankly what i wanted and how hard up i was for an article he was so taken back by my assurance that he said i could describe the pines provided i did so under a fictitious name then he took me all over the house himself gave me tea in the big drawingroom and sent me off i got a good article out of what he showed me but of course i said that it was a description of a millionaires palace in park lane nobody believed that i think the colonel guessed they wouldnt he just let me write the article to make the peoples mouths water with telling about things he would not let them see a nice christian spirit remarked jim grimly ah but you must remember that he was treated very badly by the country people when he came back from america oh then america was the place of his exile so frisco said mexico and peru the two had many adventures and used to tell me about them i made up several stories out of the material i got from them you called to see the colonel again then why not he was always polite and i wasnt a bit afraid of him oh i know he had a dreadful reputation but he was never rude to me poor man said bess letting her eyes rest pensively on the house which they were now approaching i think he was very weary of living alone were the colonel and frisco good friends the very best frisco adored the colonel who had saved his life both of them seem rather afraid of here bess was silent of what i hardly know but they hinted at some enemy who would kill the pair of them if he discovered their whereabouts that was what frisco meant at the publichouse when he hinted about his master not living long if frisco had given information the enemy would have killed the colonel i wonder if frisco did and then went away to escape the consequences no said bess thoughtfully frisco would have been killed also i think myself that the enemy found out the colonel and murdered him then frisco ran away to save his own life humph that is one way of looking at the matter did you hear if any stranger was seen in the neighbourhood on the night of the murder bess looked quickly at her companion no she said with some hesitation i never heard of anyone besides it would have come out in the evidence you have no idea who killed the man certainly not if i knew i should tell there was somethingill tell you that later tell it to me now i cant do that until i get my facts together said bess firmly look here dr jim i intend to find out the truth about this mystery from something the colonel let drop i believe it is concerned with the money he came back with from south america or from north america replied miss endicotte musingly i am not quite clear but ill ask you to help me when i get my facts together you rouse my curiosity tell me now what you i said no and i mean no retorted bess setting her mouth firmly you will be here for some time yet if you go away i shall write to you i am sure we shall find out who killed the colonel and i am equally sure that frisco is not the man well have it your own way tell me one thing how is it the colonel was so anxious about the preservation of his body ah now you are asking more than i can tell you you know though said jim looking at her sharply i thinki am not sure wait dr jim in good time you shall know all that i know this is a romance in real life a tragedy rather said herrick grimly mind you keep your promise you can be sure i shall keep it said bess nodding and for the time being the matter ended but jim was considerably puzzled how she could have got hold of information of which the police knew nothing was difficult to say all the same he had more confidence in the brains of bess than in those of inspector bridge as it was saturday afternoon the workmen had knocked off for the day by this time the tower was half demolished and curious it looked in its dilapidated state with the pile of dbris round about its base the visitors looked at it for some time then went into the house in the kitchen off the diningroom they found an old woman who agreed to boil the kettle for them after some deliberation they fixed on the library as the best place for the meal on entering they found a boy reading in the corner under the window you here sidney said ida amazed how can you come here without asking stephens permission stephen doesnt mind im sure replied sidney with a smile and stephen assured him that he was welcome while the others were talking and admiring the place dr jim stood looking at the boy who was leaning back on the sofa taken up with his own thoughts there was something peculiar about sidney endicotte which procured him the name of the changeling this was given to him in fun by bess but many people in the village really believed that he was half a fairy if not a whole one this reputation rose from the fact that the lad possessed that gift which in scotland is called the second sight no one in saxham who saw master sidneys large blue eyes fixed upon him or her but turned pale in italy he would have been credited with the evil eye and indeed old petronella always crossed herself when she chanced to meet him once or twice sidney had foretold the death of those who had afterwards died thus he had an uncanny reputation he was a small thin boy looking much older than his years although he was but sixteen yet on occasions he looked quite twenty pale thinfaced with large blue eyes and a curious insistent gaze he sometimes made even his own family feel uncomfortable then he had such peculiar habits at night he was generally wakeful and he slept much in the daytime particularly in cold weather sometimes he would slip out of his bedroom by the window and remain away for hours when questioned where he had been he used vaguely to answer in the wood the doctors who had seen him could make nothing of him he was healthy in his own way his head was clear and corn reported that he learned rapidly but about him hung a glamour not of this world he might have been a male kilmeny who had returned from fairyland bess sometimes called him thomas the rhymer when she did so sidney would nod and laugh in so strange a way that bess herself grew frightened and dropped the name how do you feel today sidney asked jim sitting down beside the boy not very well he replied vaguely i feel that i am not myself i came here to read myself to sleep why did you want to do that because i could go away then i always do when i feel like this like what jim was puzzled the boy was by no means mad yet he talked in a manner quite beyond the comprehension of a sane person jim had never met anyone like him before and was much taken up with the oddity of the case from a medical point of view i cant explain you would not understand said sidney please leave me alone dr herrick at this moment bess called to jim from the other side of the room and he hurried across to her sidney remained vaguely staring into nothingness after a time his eyes closed and he looked as though he were fast asleep the others gathered round the tea table and prepared to eat bess would not allow her brother to be awakened it makes him ill if he is roused suddenly she said he will wake up himself and be all right it doesnt look to me like a natural sleep said jim anxiously how pale he is dont you think no said ida sharply i agree with bess sidney had better be left alone he gets into these states at times let us have tea i am so hungry and its past five a quarter past said stephen glancing at his watch they began to eat and drink laughing and enjoying themselves no one took any notice of sidney and even jims attention was distracted the boy remained on the sofa leaning back white as snow and drawing long deep breaths he looked like a dead person after a time the conversation languished the tea was done the food was finished and they talked about packing up to go poor sidneys tea is quite cold said ida i really think we might wake him now oh he is coming to himself wake up sidney and have some tea it is nearly six and we must be getting home the boys face had now a delicate pink tinge on it and he seemed more himself than he had been when he fell asleep for a moment he was silent then he looked slowly round at those who were present until his blue eyes fixed themselves calmly on stephen mr marsh he said quietly you had better go home your mother is dead ida gave a cry and stephen turned pale bess alone retained sufficient presence of mind to cross over to the boy and shake him sidney what do you mean by saying such a horrible thing it is true replied the boy quietly mrs marsh is dead i have just seen her she died at halfpast five go home stephen without a word marsh rushed from the room he knew of sidneys prophecies and dreaded lest this one should be true he made for beorminster as fast as he could go and was met by petronella my padrona is dead said the old woman chapter vii a nine days wonder petronella made the terrible announcement with ominous calmness then when she saw stephen staring at her openmouthed her wild southern nature could no longer be controlled with a choking sob she flung her apron over her head and began to lament loudly for her dear padrona her voice ascended shrilling in a long wail like that of the corsican vocieri luckily there were few people in the street and the sound was scarcely noticed it was simply thought that the excitable italian woman was in one of her tantrums and beorminster was used to petronellas fits of rage stephen caught her suddenly and dragging her inside by main force closed the door before petronella could recover her breath for another howl she found herself on one of the diningroom chairs with marsh standing over her the young man was so shaken that he could hardly speak the prophecy of sidney the hurried journey to beorminster on a grocers cart which he had met near saxham and now the terrible confirmation of the death these things shook him to the soul he hardly recognised his own voice tell me everything that happened he said slowly do not make any mistake i must know all petronella crossed herself holy virgin she muttered his eyes are like coals then after a muffled wail she burst out into rapid italian which stephen understood easily from his habit of talking to her and to mrs marsh after you left at midday signor stephano the padrona tried to get a little sleep when the postman came at two oclock he brought one letter for her i took it up and woke her then i went out of the room in a quarter of an hour the signora called me she looked white so white the letter was before her she told me to give her the chloral as she wanted to sleep i asked her if she had bad news in the letter she said no but that she felt suddenly sick i gave her the medicine in the little bottle and went away she took some i think for when i went up again an hour later she was asleep i went again and againshe was still asleep then i took up her tea and wanted to waken her gran dioshe was deaddead what time was that petronella at half past five signor the hour when i always take up the signoras tea oh she is dead and i nursed her cursed be it that i live still while the old woman wailed on stephen shuddered the hour was that which sidney had named are you sure she died at that time he asked quite sure signor stephano when i went in before she was only asleep i saw her breathing i was up at a quarter past five and she still breathed and had a colour in her poor cheek when i set down the tray i turned to see that she was quite still her face pale as snow i put my hand to her heart she was dead ah dio mio she must have passed away when i entered the room i heard a sigh at the door said petronella beginning to embellish it was her spirit that passed what could i do but open the window to let the soul go free ah holy virgin and the old woman crossed herself again by this time stephen had somewhat recovered his composure without a word he went up to the room petronella had drawn a sheet over the dead he drew it down gently and saw the waxen face beneath every wrinkle had been smoothed away and there rested a peaceful expression on that once stormy countenance as marsh stood tearlessly looking at the dead he heard a light step enter the room herrick appeared almost as pale as the dead woman after a glance at the corpse he recognised that all was over and looked at marsh with a shudder yes whispered the young man replying to the unspoken thought at half past five oclock herrick shuddered again and drew the sheet over the dead face then he took stephen by the arm and led him downstairs into the study there he left him in a chair and went into the diningroom whence he returned with a decanter and two glasses pouring out two stiff glasses of brandy he forced stephen to drink one and took the other himself both were in need of the stimulant for the event had shaken them considerably by and bye marsh laid down his head on the table and wept quietly he had been devoted to the dead woman and was all unstrung moreover the uncanny way in which the first announcement of the death had been made shocked him deeply herrick went out to see petronella he found her in the death chamber a genuine romanist she had placed candles round the bed and a crucifix on the breast of the dead on her knees she was praying aloud seeing that all had been done that could be done herrick returned to the study stephen was calmer and inclined to talk it was half past five as sidney said he said in a low voice oh herrick what does it mean i do not know said the usually sceptically doctor after you had gone i asked the boy how he knew he said that while asleep he had dreamedso he put itthat he was standing in your mothers bedroom she was dying in a stupor and he saw the breath gradually leave her body he also said that he saw her spirit after she was dead but of course that must be nonsense after what he said i can believe anything said marsh what else well said jim uncomfortably he described the bedroom exactly was he ever in it stephen no certainly not and he described it exactly and as being in the state in which it now is he said that petronella came in at the door with a tray and placed it beside the bed she then put her hand on your mothers heart and found that she was dead afterwards she opened the window whywhatstephen my god cried the young man now ghastly white that is exactly what petronella told me she did oh oh and he fainted herrick scarcely wondered at it he felt deadly sick himself and it needed another glass of brandy before he could recover himself sufficiently to attend to the unconscious man next day the news was known all over beorminster and sidneys prophecy also the endicotte family would fain have kept it to themselves but sidney himself had spread the news for on the way home and before the rumour could have reached saxhamwhich it did not until late that nighthe told several people of mrs marshs death and the hour at which it had occurred so the report spread and that night saxham accustomed to sidneys second sight was in a ferment many believed others doubted and the upshot was that a few enquirers went over to beorminster whence they rushed back with a confirmation of the news mrs marsh was dead and moreover she had passed away at half past five up till a late hour that night nothing was talked about but this wonderful boy and next morning a crowd collected about the grange hoping to catch a glimpse of him ida was very angry at sidneys indiscretion and told him so he took it all placidly why should i not say that mrs marsh was dead he asked she is dead and she died at the time i said but how did you know sidney dear asked the perplexed sister when i was on the sofa in the library i dreamed that i was in her room i saw her die and the white spirit get out of her body the spirit pointed to a bottle on the table beside the bed and then i forgot all till i woke on the sofa and saw stephen looking at me then i told him to go home there is nothing strange about it ida you know i can see things ida shuddered and ran away to tell bess that sidney was a most uncomfortable person to talk to the boy stayed indoors at the request of bess all the morning and then slipped off in the afternoon to go to his favourite haunt in the pine wood when he came into the village the next day he refused to talk of his dream or vision or whatever it might be called and seemed quite cross when it was referred to from that day sidney was shunned as though he had the plague everyone was afraid of being told too much about themselves or their relations this troubled the boy very little he went on living in his usual dreamy way and had no more visions for a time even at biffstead he was regarded as something dangerous but there by tacit consent the subject was dropped what dr jim thought of all this it was difficult to say sidneys prophecy was thrown into the background so far as he was concerned by the discovery that mrs marsh had died from an overdose of chloral he had always warned her that she might make a mistake and apparently she had done so at last but when petronella told him of the letter he changed his mind what if she had committed suicide he recollected her vague allusions to enemies and her persistent declaration that she might not live long at once he set about hunting for the letter petronella helping him but it was not to be discovered although they searched high and low at last herrick spied ashes in the fireless grate and found that some paper had been burnt without doubt the letter mrs marsh had received was there a fire in the grate on the day mrs marsh died he asked no signor dottore the grate was empty of course i need not have asked this flimsy stuff would have been swept away with the ashes humph she must have got up and burnt the letter and thenwell we must wait for the inquest it was herrick who attended to all the details of the funeral as marsh was completely bewildered by the sudden catastrophe the inquest resulted in a verdict that mrs marsh had died from an overdose of chloral but no one hinted at suicide as dr jim gave evidence of her use of the drug to alleviate pain and obtain sleep it was concluded that she had miscalculated the dose even stephen believed that this was the case for herrick said nothing of his suspicions what petronella thought dr jim could not find out she was as secret as the grave mrs marsh was buried in the family vault of the carrs at saxham a large number of people came to the funeral not because the dead woman had been popular but that they wished to attend the rites of a person whose death had been foretold in so curious a manner in the vault the coffin was laid beside that of the late colonel and herrick shuddered as he thought of these enemies lying side by side certainly when the new vault was ready the body of the colonel would be removed to it in accordance with the terms of the will but it would be some time before this was completed and meantime carrs body remained in the old sepulchre pending its removal stephen had had a new iron door put on the old vault and kept the key to himself it was quite safe in his pocket and he never parted from it after the funeral herrick made several attempts to discover something about the letter delivered to mrs marsh on the day of her death although he was careful not to hint that it had any connection with her sudden end but although he questioned the postman and the postal authorities he could gain very little satisfaction it was a plain envelope stampedso far as could be rememberedwith the london postmark humph said dr jim to himself when he acquired this information frisco is in london i wonder if he wrote that letter however it was little use conjecturing mrs marsh was dead and had taken her secret and the secret of colonel carr along with her into the next world herrick put the idea out of his head as he had much to do in considering his future position three or four days after the funeral he was alone with stephen in the beorminster house and there spoke to the young man about his movements i must return to london marsh he said i can do no more good here and i must attend to my practice no replied stephen quickly you must not leave me like this herrick i have grown used to you as a companion i like you more than any man i ever met and without you i should be lost you must stay with me is your practice a large one on the contrary it is very small i have been established in west kensington only for two years if i had not a small income of my own i should starve well you must come to me i hope you will herrick i am rich and i can allow you a good incomesay a thousand a year that is generous of you marsh did your mother speak of this to you no she did not why do you ask because she wanted me to stay with you and proposed the same amount i am glad cried stephen his face lighting up i can do this much at least for her memory so she wished you to remain with me you will of course i cannot do without you herrick smoked in silence for a few minutes a man in my position has no right to turn his back on such good fortune all the same marsh if i did not like you personally if i did not think i could earn my income by helping you i would not take the position then you will do so cried stephen stretching out his hand the doctor grasped it heartily in token of acceptance but i am not without scruples as to taking such a large amount of money said he i make only a couple of hundred a year by my practice you rate me at a high value not too high for the good you will do me said marsh heartily i have been a different man since you came into my life you have shown me how to look at things in a broader spirit i am less morbid than i was no herrick i have eight thousand a year and you shall have the sum i name very good i am delighted but for what period you see marsh some day you will marry and then you will find in your wife the companion necessary to your existence you will not want me i think we had better make an agreement for three years by that time i shall have done you all the good i can you will be used to your position and continued jim looking into the young mans eyes you will be looking for a wife stephen nodded three years then he said if you want a document the lawyers can draw it up as to marrying i dare say i shall marry already i havehere he broke off abruptly there are some things a man cannot talk about even to his best friend let the subject of love and marriage be tabooed between us herrick certainly replied the doctor rather stiffly i have no wish to force your confidence marsh its not that buti have an idea in my head it may come to nothing on the other handwell he dismissed it with a wave of his hand time enough to talk about it when it ripens let us change the subject in the face of this unwillingness on the part of marsh herrick was obliged to do as he was asked he wondered if stephen really loved ida endicotte or whether it was bess who attracted him time alone would reveal the truth so herrick for the moment thought no more about the matter he had engaged himself to look after stephen and at once set to work to earn his income the subject was introduced by marsh i think you and i ought to go abroad for a year or two he said restlessly i feel that both beorminster and saxham are distasteful to me for a time i have arranged to let petronella live here on a small income i thought she would like to return to italy but she begged me to allow her to stay here for a time i asked her to go to the pines but she refused so here she must stay and you and i herrick we will go up to london for a couple of weeks said herrick promptly but i want to go further afield and for a longer time have you forgotten the terms of the will put in dr jim you must pay a monthly visit to that vault or the money goes to frisco stephen nodded somewhat grimly i should have remembered said he yes i cannot travel until the year is at an end but even if it so happened that i did not go to the vault and lost the money i do not think that frisco would return to claim it well i dont know replied herrick musingly after all we cannot be certain that frisco killed his master he may reappear and explain his flight and prove his innocence on the face of it it would seem he is guilty but the evidence is all circumstantial better stick to the terms of the will and not give him the chance of claiming the money very good herrick then we will go up to london and you can take me to tailors and all the other tradesmen whose goods i may need i want you to educate me dr jim you have had a varied experience of the world and i have not i am a country mouse and you the town one at thirtyfive i must have had some experience marsh yes i have travelled in my time i have been round europe with a man i was trying to reclaim from strong drink did you succeed partly replied the doctor with a shrug he is a fairly decent member of society now nothing to boast of well marsh i have also been doctor on a liner to the east finally i went with an expedition into the interior of africa now i am settled in the dull quarter of west kensington and often wish i could be off again on the long trail civilised life is too respectable for me when the year is out we will go on the long trail together well said herrick an exploration of our planet will do you no harm later on you can settle down and be comfortable with a wifei beg your pardon i am trenching on forbidden ground however marsh i am glad things are so arranged it is a bit of good luck for me and for me also herrick you can do me nothing but good i hope so said herrick cheerfully the first thing i intend to do is to take you out into the open air you must hunt and shoot and golf and swim and get yourself into a state of physical perfection your mind is all right i like your poems and you have it in you to do great things marsh but first of all you must attend to the body i have neglected these things said stephen straightening himself but my life was so narrow that i did not look after myself as a man should besides to tell you the truth herrick i am so much of the student that outofdoor life never attracted me that is because you have never had a companion to interest you in the life said herrick smiling now i am devoted to athletic sports of all kinds if i can infect you with my enthusiasm you will soon be able to take the deepest interest in them yourself not that i was fortunate enough to succeed with joyce finished dr jim with a shrug ah your friend who was staying at the carr arms i never met him you will when we go to town he is not a bad little chap but his brain is too large for his body besides which he is neurotic and intensely trying at times i dont suppose i should have cured him altogether but i could have made him twice the man he was had he only taken my advice but robin was always as obstinate as a mule he lives into himself and for himself there is no hope for a man like that i hope you will succeed with me herrick i am certain to succeed with you in the first place your nerves are not diseased in the second you are less selfish and thirdly you are sensible enough to see senseand that last is not given to many men well we have had a long talk marsh so we had better go to bed and begin our new life tomorrow it was three days after this that the two went up to london herrick called at biffstead and told bess about his new relations with stephen she expressed herself greatly pleased you will do him no end of good she said physical exercise is what he needs he in making good use of his money she added emphatically you have too good an opinion of me miss bess the girl laughed and blushed in her heart she liked herrick greatly he was so big so strong so sensibleexactly the sort of man she admired frank her brother resembled him in many ways but he was not so worldlywise nor perhaps so clever however she was too much the woman to make a direct reply to herricks speech and changed the subject when you come back we must have our talk she said meantime i shall give you something to go on with in london do you know anything about cryptographs dr jim no i have looked into the subject once or twice but i never did much good at it why bess went to her desk and fished out a bit of paper i want you to see if you can solve this she said i have done my best and failed it is a piece of paper i picked up in the colonels house when he was alive i am sure it has to do with his secret whatever that might be else why should it be in secret writing herrick took the paper she held out it was a yellow kind of chinese paper tough and wrinkled on it was written in red ink the following sgd kzrs vzqmhf shkk itkx sidn cdzsg tmkdrr this jumble of letters made herrick stare he could make nothing of them yet here no doubt was the secret of colonel carr perhaps if the writing could be read the reason of his death might be explained even the name of the assassin might be given bess watched him eagerly what do you think of it she asked i daresay it may help us herrick said doubtfully if the colonel had a secret if he had cried bess emphatically i know he had then it may be contained in this mixture of letters you have failed you say well miss bess i dont know that i shall succeed however i will try you will let me have this if you will take the very greatest care of it i have a copy to be sure but that is the original ill bring it back to you safe and sound in two weeks you will be back then she asked with a quick flush certainly i shall arrange about my practice and return for good bess looked down i am glad she said in a low tone then thinking she might have said too much she smiled in his face of course i am glad she cried gaily are we not pledged to find out who killed the colonel chapter viii a curious discovery it was now quite two months since the death of colonel carr and all this time robin had been in london he had written to herrick telling him he felt so much better that he would not go abroad i have a new idea for a novel wrote joyce and now that i have the leisure i intend to throw myself heart and soul into it i still keep on my flat herrick therefore determined that his first visit should be to the little man stephen and the doctor took up their abode in the guelph hotel in jermyn street it was the first time the young man had been in london and the novelty and excitement of town life did much to dispel the grief he felt for the death of his stepmother it was not that he regretted her the less but he was sensible enough to see that it was foolish to weep over an irremediable misfortune he therefore took herricks advice and threw himself with ardour into fitting himself out with a complete wardrobe for the first time in his life the doctor took him to the best westend shops instructed him in the topography of the fashionable locality and when stephen was fairly set going found time to attend to his own business he first went to his house in west kensington and saw that it was all right then he called upon the young practitioner who had nursed his practice while he was away and made him an offer to sell it the young doctor who had only lately started in the district was overjoyed at the chance as jim had got together a fair number of patients herrick made the terms of purchase as light as possible and spread the payment over a considerable time dr grant asked two days for consideration as being poor it was necessary he should see his way how to pay the money at once jim consented to this and after finishing this necessary business he went off to robins flat the arrangement and discussion with grant had taken up the best part of the afternoon and it was close upon seven when herrick found time to see his friend at first he hesitated and half made up his mind to put it off until the next day but as he was in the neighbourhood he finally decided to go and sent a wire to marsh that he would not be home until ten oclock he intended to ask joyce for a meal making sure that he would be welcome yet strange to say robin was not so hearty as herrick expected perhaps he had not got over his anger at the desertion of the doctor but after his last letter jim could not think that such was the case in spite of their severance herrick still wished to keep an eye on robin knowing that he was foolish in many ways therefore when joyce showed a disposition not to invite him to stay herrick at once determined that he would remain there was a reason at the back of this confusion and herrick in the interests of a weak man resolved to find out what it might be seeing that he was bent on remaining robin made the best of what he evidently considered a bad job and became more of his old self you are not looking so well as your letter led me to hope robin said herrick when the two were smoking in the study i am in the best of health said robin quickly but of course i have been working hard at my book and that takes it out of a chap read me some of the chapters said herrick who once had been a kind of literary adviser to the author robin shook his head uneasily not until the book is done he said i want you to get an impression as a whole this will be my masterpiece besides he added glancing at the clock we might be interrupted at half past seven a friend of mine is coming to dinner i hope my unexpected coming will not upset your arrangements joyce of course nothow can you think so said robin with an air of constraint that did not escape herrick you are always welcome will you stop the night i can put you up no i must get back to marsh i am his companion and doctor for the time being a very good billet i assure you robin what about your practice asked joyce i am now selling it to grant it is such a small practice that it is not worth my while to stick to it as against an assured income of a thousand a year is that what marsh gives you yes i do not mind telling you robin as you are such an old friend but do not mention this to anyone else i stay with marsh for three years in this way i shall be able to save money and buy a practice in a better part of the town it is a wonderful bit of luck it is indeed and i congratulate you replied robin cheerfully and shaking his friend by the hand marsh must be well off to be able to afford your companionship at that price yes he has been left about eight thousand a year more or less by colonel carr his late uncle but that is his business robin we will not talk about it have they yet found out who killed colonel carr not yet of course it is supposed that frisco killed him but the man has disappeared when he is caught we shall know the truth you read the case robin what do you think it seems as though that man were guilty replied joyce slowly but i am not prepared to offer an opinion the fact is i am so busy with my book that i have put all these horrors out of my head by the way what about your southberry helen miss endicotte oh i have seen a good deal of her and you are still in love not very passionately perhaps but i think a respectable affection is better to marry upon than a wild romantic adoration that will not resist the wear and tear of life i hope some day if miss endicotte will allow me to marry herthat is when i have a good practice but if another man more worthy of her comes along why ardent lover laughed joyce if you really felt any passion you would not contemplate with equanimity the idea of an intruder i believe you like that little journalistic girl better a kind of dull anger stirred in the doctors breast at hearing bess so flippantly alluded to but he saw that joyce did not mean any harm so turned off the remark with a laugh she is a charming young lady robin but she is better as a comrade than she would be as a wife a comrade is what you want said joyce shrewdly your lukewarm affection will not win you the love of a woman perhaps not however we shall see herrick was annoyed for he felt there was some truth in this remark he was glad when a ring came to the door and interrupted a conversation which was rapidly getting unpleasant to him theres your friend who is he a mexican called don manuel santiago humph it it not often one foregathers with that nationality in london where did you meet him at the apollo club johnstone introduced me to him here he is i think you will like him herrick was not so sure he had met with mexicans on their native heath and did not like the breed however as the man was the guest of joyce he felt compelled to behave at least politely all the same knowing robins weakness in picking up doubtful acquaintances he determined to be observant of the mexican dr herrick don manuel santiago and this seor is my very best friend the little dark man clicked his heels together foreign fashion and bowed politely herrick looked at him from head to foot in one swift glance and made up his mind that the man was a rogue an adventurer if nothing worse he was not tall and he was very lean his face was swarthy he had a hook nose a black moustache and a pair of restless shifty dark eyes accurately dressed in an evening suit he wore too much jewellery yet for all this he did not look vulgar there was a somewhat dangerous air about him herrick watching his face intently made up his mind that don manuel was a half caste indian i am pleased to meet you seor said don manuel in good english but with a foreign accent dr herrick ah i know the name indeed said dr jim looking surprised robin also shared his astonishment and expressed it why santiago you did not tell me you knew herrick said he as they took their seats at table did i not replied the don carelessly ah that was no doubt because his name was never mentioned between us but if i am not mistaken said he addressing himself directly to jim you were concerned in that strange case of my friend colonel carr herrick almost bounded from his seat that here of all places and in so unexpected a way he should meet with a stranger who knew carr was like fiction had the incident occurred in a novel he would have put it down as a freak of imagination on the authors part yet the thing had happened in real life and to himself was carr a friend of yours he asked twelve years and more ago replied santiago quietly we knew one another intimately in mexico mexico muttered herrick recalling what bess had said about friscos tales of north and south america not in peru we went to peru togetheron an expedition what sort of an expedition asked joyce eagerly to make our fortunes that is the sort of expedition we all are bound to undertake herrick thought of colonel carrs money was he on the point of learning sufficient of the mans wild life in the americas to reveal what his secret was did you succeed he asked i did notthe colonel did afterwards he returned to england and i lost sight of him when i came over six months ago i heard of him and intended to pay him a visit but i put it off and off and offuntil he made a rapid gesture poor carr his was a sad end an unexpected one said herrick fixing his eyes on the man did you know his servant frisco no replied manuel calmly frisco was after my time or before it i forget which somehow herrick felt instinctively that this was a lie according to bess the exsailor had been with carr throughout his wandering life it was incredible that if such was the case and jim preferred to believe frisco rather than santiagothat frisco should not have gone on to peru he would be needed on an expedition such as manuel spoke of were you treasurehunting asked jim don manuel nodded yes the peruvians buried a lot of gold and jewels at the time of the conquest carr got wind of a hiding place from some onean indian i believe and induced me to go with him to peru i was doing nothing at the time so i went carr found the treasure i believe so colonel carr was rich was he not very rich chimed in joyce do you remember herrick how astonished we were at the magnificence of that house i remember said herrick curtly the interruption did not please him as he wanted particularly to hear what santiago had to say but seor manuel if you started on this search together how was it that you do not know for certain if colonel carr was successful don manuels face grew black and his eyes flashed if you would know the reason seor colonel carr was a devil ha said herrick with a short laugh that is no news we shared the expenses of the expedition we were to share the profits but carr treated me shamefully the treasure was said to be concealed beyond cuzcowhere it does not matter i know but i do not intend to tell i fell ill at the first stage of the journey after we left cuzco and were amongst the mountains what did carr do he left me to the care of the indians and pushed on himself that was the last i saw of the devil for two years i was held captive amongst the indians and barely escaped with my life i hunted for carr when i got to callao but he had disappeared i traced him to mexico he vanished from vera cruz i was worn out and ill i went back to my own family and all these years i thought nothing about the colonel but chance brought me to england and chance led me to hear where colonel carr was settled as i said i would have seen him to reproach him for his treachery but don manuel shruggedhe is dead that is the end a strange story and not creditable to carr said herrick wondering if all this was a lie who was it told you where colonel carr lived i did not said joyce on whose face jims eyes rested for a moment i knew nothing of this until this moment where i heard the name seor can be of little interest to you said the don with a sneer it was in london i tell you no more i do not want you to tell me anything retorted herrick the blood rushing to his face so far i am interested in your story but if you choose to be silent you are at liberty to do so pardon said manuel humbly i did not intend to provoke your anger but as he spoke there was a nasty glitter in his eyes i cannot tell you who gave me the information without breaking confidence with a friend herrick grunted but he said nothing santiago was evidently a dangerous little devil for all he knew the mexican might have had something to do with the murder of all strange circumstances that herrick had stumbled upon this surely was the strangest to find the man who knew of the past of colonel carr in the company of robin joyce as the meal was now at an end the three adjourned to the study where they began to smoke herrick had his pipe joyce a cigarette and manuel produced one of those long lean mexican cigars that only a hardened smoker can enjoy as he bent forward over the spirit lamp jim saw by the touch of grey on his temples and the wrinkles down the side of his neck that the man was much older than he had thought at the first glance santiago lookedif you wanted to be disagreeablesay thirtyfive herrick was now sure he was over fifty but the man was in wonderfully good condition having noticed him at the table jim saw that he was both abstemious and temperate for some reason not apparent manuel desired to ingratiate himself with herrick and tried by picturesque talk to banish the disagreeable impression he had made by his last remark he told the most wonderful stories of his adventures by land and sea according to his own account he had lived a life of hairbreadth escapes south america he knew from quito to the horn and had explored the unknown portions at the risk of his life he had been captive to indians he had been torturedherrick noted that his left ear was missingand he had been almost frozen while ascending chimborazo then he had hunted for treasure fought for it with knives when it was found and by his own confession had more than one death to his account all this he told in vivid picturesque language and with a wonderful command of the english tongue herrick complimented him on his capabilities as a linguist oh i know seven or eight languages said manuel boastfully not to speak of indian dialects i have been all over europe yes seor when i made moneyand i have made a great deali came always to europe to spend it that i did royally oh they know me in every capital of all give me vienna oh seor i am known on the prater and to the police no doubt thought herrick but for his own private reasons did not give vent to this opinion he said aloud i suppose don manuel you were not surprised to hear of colonel carrs death santiago flashed a quick glance at the imperturbable countenance of the doctor oh but i was said he to escape all the dangers of the tropics and then to die in a quiet little english village strange to be sure though added manuel with another glance he brought his murderer with him and frisco was capable of anything oh put in herrick sharply i thought you did not know frisco nor did i seor said santiago covering his mistake with wonderful swiftness but i heard of him he was a devil worse than carr if that can be possible they were attached to one another but quarrelledoh yes seor i assure you they quarrelled once over a game of cards carr slashed frisco across the face oh that was it was it murmured herrick as he recalled the crisscross slash on friscos face which had been described to him a queer couple what was friscos real name i do not know snapped manuel with a surprising curtness considering his late voluble talk shortly he took his leave with a politely expressed hope that he would meet herrick again when the mexican was gone joyce turned eagerly to his friend and asked what he thought of him if you want to know my real opinion he is a thorough little blackguard cut him robin or you will get into trouble i dont see why i should he is a decent fellow his only vice is gambling he would sell his shirt to gamble humph looks a cardsharper where does he gamble principally in a club down in pimlicothe parrot club very few people know about it but the play is very high oh so you met santiago there said herrick lazily but joyce saw the trap and avoided it no i told you i met him at the apollo clubthat is respectable enough i hope and archy johnstone introduced him to me he is decent isnt he oh i have nothing to say replied herrick with a yawn putting on his coat only if that man gets you into trouble dont blame me he will probably induce you to gamble and all your new income of five hundred a year will go once and for all a peculiar expression swept across joyces face and he opened and shut his hands nervously however he held his tongue and having said goodnight herrick went away sorry to see that his friend was in such bad company he regarded don manuel as a rook and joyce as a pigeon but he knew the little man well enough to know that his interference was vain joyce could be as obstinate as a mule at times when he got back to the guelph hotel it was close on eleven all the same stephen was sitting up for him over a meditative pipe the sight of his honest handsome face was quite a relief to herrick after the crafty looks of manuel and truth to tell joyce had fallen also in herricks estimation for as a man he could not compare with marsh not for the first time dr jim began to think there was something sly and evil about robin hitherto he had been too much taken up with the mans nerves to think much of his moral character but after this long absence he saw plainly that joyce was deteriorating rapidly the company he had been in this very night proved it if there were any truth in the saying that birds of a feather flock together hullo stephen said herrick taking off his coat why did you not go to bed man sitting up all alone like a maid on the eve of st agnes i did not want to go to bed until you came home said stephen you know i always like a chat have some whisky thanks shove over the tobaccojar well marsh i have arranged about the sale of my practice its all right i am delighted you are sure you do not mind giving it up not for a thousand a year replied herrick with a laugh i never made so much in all my medical life not to mention the delights of your society what have you been doing shopping mostly then i called in on frith and frith to talk about business i heard of your friend joyce there the deuce you did said jim wheeling round i have just been dining with him and i do not think he is improved frith and frith are his lawyers i know how did his name crop up in the course of my talk about the colonels business herrick stared what do you mean he asked roughly well you will be rather astonished continued marsh lighting his pipe but the fact is colonel carr allowed mrs joyce the mother of your friend an income of five hundred a year no said herrick and thought that this was just the sum robin said he had been left by his mothers will yes why i do not know nor could frith tell me the colonel never called to see mrs joyce he never wrote her a letter but he directed frith to pay her an annuity of five hundred pounds an annuity then it ceased at her death of course the son gets nothing the reason frith mentioned it was that he wished to know if i had found anything amongst my uncles papers likely to show why the annuity had been paid and whether it ought to be continued to the son queer said herrick he remembered that robin had told him that he had interviewed the lawyers and had been informed of his income why had robin told a lie i suppose said the doctor after a pause that frith did not take it upon himself to promise joyce the continuance of this annuity certainly not replied stephen he had no right of course i told him that i knew nothing about the matter and would not pay anything to joyce stillas he is your friend never mind that i dont want you to pay him anything did joyce call to see frith do you know a week after his mothers death he has not been since they told him then that he need not expect any more money a week after his mothers death related the doctor and it was two months later we were on that walking tour did not joyce call to see frith somewhere about the twentyfourth of july no it was towards the end of april he called he has not been near them since you look rather pale herrick its nothing replied the doctor i have had rather a turn thats all chapter ix herrick is suspicious dr jim slept very little that night he was turning over in his mind joyces strange conduct now that he remembered robin had been very particular as to the details of his whereabouts he had gone to town on a tuesday leaving herrick at the southberry railway inn according to his story he had seen frith and frith the same afternoon and again the next morning the intervening night he had slept at the hull hotel in a side street off the strand then on wednesday afternoon he had rejoined dr jim at southberry and on thursday morning had started to cross the heath it was on that same night that the two had discovered the body of colonel carr so far herrick had believed this story but now the fact that he had not called on the lawyers had put a different complexion on the affair also his statement concerning the money left to him was provedby the evidence of the solicitors who paid the annuityto be a lie robin therefore had not been so deeply plunged in grief as he appeared to be when he could call a few days after his mothers death to see if he was to inherit the money herrick considered that probably when alone in the flat he had found some paper stating that the five hundred a year terminated at his mothers death and had gone to frith and frith in order to ascertain if this were true besides his mother might have told him this on her deathbed but what else had she told him colonel carr was not the man to pay out money for nothing mrs joyce must have had some hold over him however the main point and that which vexed dr jim most was the fact that robin had not called on the solicitors as he said he had done at southberry he had received a letter calling him up to town jim had not read the letter but since robin had told him the contents he never doubted that it was from the firm of frith if he had not called on them why was the letter sent and where was he during the two days he was in town herrick reckoned back the dates it was thursday the twentysixth of july when they arrived at saxham robin had gone to town on the twentyfourth and on that same night colonel carr according to the medical evidence had been shot good heavens said jim when this came into his mind can it be possible that joyce killed the man there is no reason why he should i am a suspicious fool he was in london even though he did not call on the solicitors there is no proof that he was at saxham he said himself when he went through the pine wood that he did not know the country then jim recollected that it was robin who had selected the route for the walking tour could it be possible that he knew of the existence of the house in the pine wood and had designedly led herrick that way in order that the murder should be discovered and suspicion averted from himself no no cried jim tossing and turning he could not have contrived so damnable a scheme besides he slept at the hull hotel in this way he kept arguing out the situation but by the morning he had come to no conclusion the evidence against robin was not strong enough but while shaving dr jim made up his mind to call on frith and frith and also to look in at the hull hotel nevertheless whatever he found he resolved to hold his tongue so far as robin was concerned joyce was far too intimate with don manuel to please herrick and don manuel as the doctor remembered professed a hatred of carr he also might have something to do with the matter stephen said herrick at breakfast i want you to look after yourself again today i have business to do all right replied marsh i can amuse myself there is the national gallery to see and the tower and westminster abbey i should only bore you taking you to these places i am never bored in your company said jim absently his thoughts intent on what he had to do but i shall be at your service tomorrow you have to see about your practice i suppose herrick yes also some other business how long do you want to stay in town a week is enough for the present replied marsh we came for two did we not i have got all the clothes i need they will be ready by the end of this week then we can go back you want to return yes i have an idea in my head later on i will tell it to you marsh turned to ask what herrick meant but seeing that his friend was taken up with his own thoughts he said nothing after breakfast jim left marsh to look over the morning paper and went out the first place he sought out was the lawyers office mr frith the junior partner received him all the more readily when he heard the name on the previous day stephen had been enthusiastic on the subject of his new friend frith junior took to jim at once i am glad to see you he said pushing forward a chair mr marshcarr told us all about you i am glad he has had the good sense to select you as a companion he needs shaking up marsh is a good fellow replied jim and anything i can do to make a man of him shall be done but the material is there mr frith yes but that stepmother of his did a great deal to ruin him he could not call his soul his own i do not think her death is much to be regretted finished frith with a dry smile she was rather stormy but i think she really loved her stepson what are you smiling at i was recalling one or two interviews i had with the lady in question said the young lawyer she was as you say stormy even the colonel was afraid of her so he sent her up to us what did she come about an annuity for herself and an income for her son the present owner of the estate colonel carr refused to allow her one penny he said that he had made his will in favour of stephen marsh and that both he and mrs marsh could wait until his death i tried hard to persuade him to allow her something but he refused mrs marsh used to come up and make scenes in this office stormy chuckled frith i should think she was what was your opinion of colonel carr well drawled the lawyer with a quick glance that is rather a leading question the man is dead and he was a good client to us but speaking as man to man and in confidence doctor i think he was the greatest scoundrel in the three kingdoms thats rather strong mr frith yet it falls short of the truth dr herrick however the man is dead so we may leave him at rest he met with a terrible death and his own familiar friend put an end to him the colonel had not much human feeling but when dying he must have felt a pang at the thought that the only creature he had been kind to was putting him out of the way humph said jim using his favourite ejaculation do you believe that frisco did kill him i do not know anyone else who could have done so and if he did not why did he run away why does he keep hidden yes dr herrick i think the crime can be safely put down to his account queer man too added frith reflectively he was slangy and a good bit of a brute yet there was something of the gentleman about him he could speak good english when he chose which was not often the colonel brought him from south america did he now said frith sharply i never knew that before frisco at times came up about carrs business but he was careful to say nothing about himself he seemed fond of his master that is why it is so strange he should have killed him but then we know that the collie which is the most faithful of dogs goes mad at times and attacks his master i expect it was something of the same kind with frisco do you know how the colonel made his money asked herrick no nor does anyone else that i know of i am certain of one thing that it was made in some shady way carr was an out and out bad lot a kind of captain kidd strange that you should mention his name in conjunction with kidd he had a treasure likewise had he not what do you mean by had a treasure likewise herrick considered a minute before replying as a rule he was not a man given to loose speaking and preferred to do his own work without the assistance of any one but he saw that frith was a shrewd and capable man and that in case of need his advice was not to be despised so far as joyce was concerned jim did not intend to say anything at present as he was not yet sure of his ground and even had he been sure he would have hesitated to betray his friend however guilty he might be concerning don manuel he had no such scruples so he then and there told the lawyer all that had passed at the flat frith listened attentively but seemed in no way astonished it is the sort of thing one would expect from carr he said the man was a bad lot and i daresay if we knew all the details of that expedition we should find it less innocent than this mexican has depicted still leaving the man amongst the indians was bad enough so that was how he made his money i always knew it was not made in any respectable way few fortunes are said herrick dryly that is true but some methods may be more damnable than others as in this case carr i know went away many years ago as poor as a rat i have heard my father speak of him he came back ten years ago with no end of money we helped him to invest it as the income is eight thousand a year dr herrick you may guess what the principal amounted to treasurehunting sounds innocent enough even romantic but in carrs hands i can guess what a piece of rascality it was the man could not run straight if there was a possibility of going the wrong way he took that in preference to following the right path still said herrick approaching the main object of his visit the man had some good points for instance he was charitable to mrs joyce of west kensington said frith with a stare how did you know about her joyce is a friend of mine i was with him on a walkingtour when he received your letter asking him to call nonsense we never wrote the man a letter in our lives not on or about the twentythird of july no i am positive i should have known it is true that he called to see us a few days after his mothers death about the annuity which carr ordered to be paid to mrs joyce he wanted to know if he would have it also we communicated with colonel carr who replied in his characteristic way that joyce could go to the devil afterwards joyce called a second time and we told him the message the second time was on the twentyfourth of july no it was towards the end of april we have not seen him since nor as i say have we written him any letter this concise explanation showed herrick that robin for reasons of his own had told a deliberate lie whatever he had come to london about it was not to see the solicitors as he had alleged to herrick dr jim pulled his moustache reflectively why was an annuity paid to mrs joyce i dont know replied frith and even if i did it would be a breach of professional etiquette to tell you a year after the colonel came back to englandabout nine years agohe ordered my father to send a monthly cheque to mrs joyce at an address at hampstead she sent a receipt every time but she never came to see us and we had absolutely nothing to do with her when she changed her address which she did several times she notified the fact and we sent her allowance to the new place that is all i know of the annuity and as i say the colonel stopped it when she died what it was for i dont know the colonel was dark in many ways he was evidently a most dangerous person said herrick rising to take his leave however he has received the reward of his crimes by the way i suppose all the business of marsh is in your hands yes it is all in order the colonel was a most methodical man and left his estate in the best of conditions we are now arranging for letters patent for this change of name our client has arranged to call himself marshcarr i suppose he did not like the idea of carr alone can you wonder at it considering the reputation of the name no not a very nice name to give ones wife laughed frith rising well goodbye dr herrick i am glad to have seen you and still more glad to think that our client has so excellent a friend at his elbow herrick laughed at this praise and departed very pleased that he had been received in so friendly a way he fancied at one time that frith might have looked upon him as an interloper and it was a great compliment to him that these shrewd lawyers should be so satisfied with stephens choice of a friend from the city herrick went to the strand in search of the hull hotel he was now very doubtful of robins honesty if the man had lied in one thing he would in another jim was quite prepared to find that joyce was not known at the strand publichouse but in this instance he proved to be wrong directed by a friendly policeman he soon found the place it was a small pothouse of anything but a reputable appearance herrick stepped inside and was confronted by a stout woman with a squint in answer to his inquiry for the landlord she announced that the house belonged to her and demanded his business herrick seeing the necessity for caution went about his task in an artful way there was a friend of mine who stayed here on the night of the twentyfourth of july last he said he wrote to me from this place on that date and as i have received no letter since i have come to inquire if he is still to be found here what is his name sir mr robin joyce dont know it grunted the landlady robin joyce she rubbed her nose and then shouted tilda do you know a party as stayed here called robin joyce look up the bookstwentyfourth july a smartlooking girl dressed in a tawdry manner made her appearance and requested her mother the stout lady was her mother it appeared not to make such a noise then she addressed herself to herrick i need not look at the books sir i remember mr robin joyce quite well a little man is he notcleanshavenwith rather long hair and big big black eyes nervous manner sir that is him replied herrick thankful to hear that his friend was known at the address he had given he slept here on the night of the twentyfourth of july beg your pardon sir but he did nothing of the sort he came here after midday with a black bag and engaged a room then he went out almost at once promising to be back to dinner it was ordered but he never came no sir i did not see him until midday next morning you are certain he did not sleep here on that night quite certain sir you remember mother he told both of us when he came back that he had been staying with a friend yes i remember now then he paid his bill and went away to catch a train he said the paddington train put in the daughter i heard him tell the cabby to drive to paddington herrick thanked the two women for their information and asked if mr joyce had been there since both were positive he had not i saw him only once sir and he did not sleep here were the last words of the daughter so herrick departed fully convinced that robin had told him a second lie naturally the little man never thought that anything would happen likely to induce herrick to make enquires nor would such have been the case but for stephens remark about the annuity the question now said herrick to himself is whether he was at saxham on that night if i can prove that he shook his head and acknowledged that things were beginning to look black against joyce for the moment he almost made up his mind to go at once to west kensington and tell joyce the whole story demanding at the same time an explanation of theseapparently unnecessary lies but on second thoughts he resolved to wait until he could make certain that joyce had gone down to saxham robin would probably take the afternoon train to beorminster in that case however he would have had to change at southberry junction and as herrick was at the junction he might not risk doing so there was heathcroft of course that was six miles from saxham and could be reached by another line he might have gone that way and walked the six miles but i cannot say anything for certain until i make enquiries thought herrick and so resolved to wait until he returned to the pines with marsh the next two or three days herrick spent with stephen not a word did he say about the business he had been employed upon he did not even speak of joyce tried not to think of him but gave himself up to the enjoyment of the moment owing to his recent bereavement stephen would not go to any theatre but the two managed to find amusement in exploring london with the greatest good humour herrick permitted himself to be dragged to the tower the abbey and to several other places which stephen had already visited also there was much shopping to do clothes to be tried on and all kinds of fascinating things to be bought stephen purchased a selection of presents for the biffs and made herrick help him to choose them they arranged to go back at the weeks end when the pines would be ready to receive them i expect it is all in order by this time said stephen and ida promised to see after the servants for me bess is superintending the whole business i have told her to do exactly as she pleases and there is nothing she likes better we shall find the place in applepie order when we go back why do you not marry miss bess said herrick laughing i like bess very much but she is not the wife for me said stephen seriously ida is better suited to me herrick felt a pang of jealousy what chance had he against this wealthy favourite of fortune then he rebuked himself for the ungrateful feeling and swore if he saw the least love existing between marsh and ida that he would at once crush down his own passion as yet as he had told joyce it was not very strong but in the sunshine of idas beauty and charm it might easily assume gigantic proportions if it did and stephen loved her why then goodbye to his income for herrick felt that under the circumstances the situation would be so unbearable that he would be forced to leave saxham if stephen would only say definitely if he loved the girl herrick would know how to act at present he was quite in the dark still until he could be quite sure he judged it wiser to hold himself well in hand later on it occurred to him that he would see joyce and ask him to come down to saxham if he had really committed the murder and of this there was as yet no proof he would naturally refuse to come on the other hand he might dare as much however on the whole as straws show which way the wind blows and he knew what a nervous man joyce was herrick thought he would be able to decide by his manner if he really had any dislike to saxham he therefore one afternoon went to west kensington by this time he had settled with grant about his practice and arranged the manner of payment his sole business was with robin and he went at once to the mansions the servant said that mr joyce was absent but was expected in soon and that another gentleman was waiting in the drawingroom to see him herrick had his suspicions at once and was not at all surprised to meet the smiling face of don manuel santiago ah you have come to see our friend said the mexican shaking herricks hand in the most hearty manner i also he will be back shortly how are you don manuel said herrick politely well i hope the speech was obvious but the fact is herrick was observing the mexican from under his eyelids when santiago thought himself unobserved he stole glances at his visitor apparently he neither liked nor trusted herrick the doctor wondered what bond bound robin and this scamp together joyce was a scamp also and worse if his visit to saxham could be proved manuel answered the inquiry with a careless speech and a puzzled look evidently wondering why it was made after a time he began to walk restlessly about the room exclaiming that he wanted a cigarette and he had exhausted his own herrick politely offered his case as he wanted to put the mexican at his ease and get him to speak in the hope of learning something from him but don manuel refused the offer i smoke only my own particular kind he said ah now i remember i left some in joyces study i will go and look for them will you come also seor we had better smoke in the study joyce does not like the smoke in this room he cast a look round and shrugged this ugly room said don manuel spitefully herrick followed rather because he wished to keep this shifty creature in sight than because he wanted to smoke manuel went to the writing table and shifted the papers about he searched the mantelpiece and then casting his eyes on a tobacco cabinette walked towards that he had found them and put them in there said manuel and pulled open several drawers the cabinet was at herricks elbow and he could see into all the drawers as the mexican opened them in the lowest drawer was a pistol don manuel took it out a strange place to keep a revolver he said no it is not a revolver what can it beso largeso clumsy seor herrick took the weapon handed to him while manuel continued his search for the cigarettes a frightful suspicion flashed into his mind as he saw the oldfashioned weapon in the mexicans hand he remembered that the death wound had been inflicted by a roughly cast bullet and that at the inquest it was said such had been fired from an antique pistol here was the very thing in his handan old pistol silvermounted and clumsy in the extreme the muzzle was large and could well fire the big bullet that had passed through the heart of carr to bury itself in the opposite wall and this was in joyces house herrick felt sick manuel turned to him with a shrug there are no cigarettes here he said joyce has smoked them seor you look illpale it is nothing replied herrick replacing the weapon in the cabinet i am subject to attacks of faintness i think don manuel that you had better say nothing to joyce about our finding that pistol he might not like us to be prying into his cabinet as you please said santiago with a shrug but joyce would never be angry with me what is the pistol seor oh some oldfashioned weapon that joyce brought in a curiosity shop very probably replied the doctor carelessly it certainly is not the kind of thing one would use no replied don manuel equally carelessly an ugly thing i will say nothing a cigarette seor i will take one of yours ah there is my dear friend joyce while the mexican was lighting the cigarette robin entered and greeted herrick rather stiffly it was all jim could do to bring himself to shake hands with the man he now believed to be a criminal yet in spite of all he had learned in spite of the discovery of the oldfashioned pistol he could not yet bring himself quite to believe in robins guilt he still hoped for the best and talked easily enough how pale you are jim said joyce abruptly what is the matter i am so much a countryman now that london does not agree with me joyce laughed at the joke i prefer london myself that is a pity said herrick for i am returning to saxham tomorrow and i want you to come down for a few days next week i shall be delighted replied robin at once i can put up at the carr arms i do not know marsh you know i daresay when he meets you he will ask you to stay at the pines said herrick but you will come down robin i have seen so little of you and i do not want our friendship to end so abruptly certainly i will come with pleasure replied joyce so warmly that herricks heart smote him for his treachery but when he remembered how joyce had deceived him how he had led him to the very house in which to all appearancehe had committed a crime the doctors heart grew hard and he was quite prepared to play his part and trap this man he was now beginning to regard robin as a little reptile extremely dangerous who needed to be crushed i shall come next week said joyce gaily and if marsh likes me he may as you say ask me to the pines you might come also manuel perhaps if i have a day to spare said the mexican i should like to see the place where my dear friend carr died he glanced at herrick as he spoke but the doctor was not attending to him and did not see the look tea was being brought in and herrick wanted to get away at once he felt that knowing what he did he could never break bread with robin again he fervently hoped that the man was innocent but things looked black i must go now robin said herrick hurriedly remember you must come i promise wont you have tea no thanks marsh expects me goodbye until we meet at saxham don manuel adieu till we meet at saxham said the ready foreigner and herrick hurried out of the room and down the stairs not till he was in the train did he remember that he should have been wise enough to have secured the pistol as evidence but he may not be guilty after all said jim hopefully his heart told him that he was wrong the circumstantial evidence was too strong chapter x the secret writings dr jim could not conceal from himself that he was rather jumping at conclusions with regard to the guilt of joyce the man had deliberately lied about his visit to frith and had not slept at the hull hotel as he had stated herrick could not account for robins movements on the night of the twentyfourth of july and on that same night colonel carr had met with his death then again robin was connected indirectly with carr through his mother although there was nothing to show the relations which had existed between the colonel and mrs joyce finally joyce was in possession of an oldfashioned weapon firing a round bullet of the antiquated sort and carr had been killed with just such a bullet this was all the evidence jim could find which was likely to inculpate robin on the other hand there was no reason why joyce should not be able to defend himself he certainly could not explain away the lies he had told herrick about the visit to the solicitors and the pretended income but he might be able to account for his doings on the night of the twentyfourth and for the possession of the pistol after all he had shown no hesitation in accepting herricks invitation to saxham if he were guilty he would be afraid to venture there lest he should be met by some one who had seen him on the night of the murder in the vicinity of the pines his determination to come to saxham looked like innocence and jim granted as much the most important link to be discovered in the chain of evidence was the way in which robin if guilty had come to saxham owing to the presence of herrick at southberry he would not have risked going by that line seeing that he had to change at the junction the other line branched off from the main trunk before it reached southberry and touched at heathcroft six miles from saxham herrick made up his mind that when he got to saxham he would go to heathcroft to make inquiries if he could prove that robin had alighted at that station there would no longer be any doubt of his guilt no doubt joyce if he had come to heathcroft had disguised himself but he might not think of increasing his stature by artificial means and he was so exceptionally small that even the most casual observer would remark upon it i shall give him every opportunity of defending himself thought herrick if i find that he came to heathcroft he will have to account to me for his doings i must know the truth or else part with him as a friend for ever then the doctor thought with a qualm that if he did learn the truth the parting might be more complete than he imagined if joyce were indeed guilty he would find himself in a dilemma as to whether he should hold his tongue or denounce the man he had been so friendly with it would not be a pleasant position it was when he was in the train that herrick thought of this with stephen he was returning to saxham and the two had provided themselves with newspapers and magazines to beguile the tedium of the journey for some time herrick had been concealed behind the daily telegraph pretending to read but in reality he had been thinking over the case of robin joyce marsh was in good spirits and inclined to talk so dr jim yielded for after all his thoughts were anything but pleasant you are glad to go back to saxham stephen he said marshcarr as he must now be called nodded and smiled very glad he said i find a little of london goes a long way i want to be in my own country amongst my own friends you will have a large circle soon stephen when you are settled at the pines all the county will call they will be delighted that in that beautiful house there will be some one they can know you must make the carr family once more important in the county i am afraid i am not ambitious said stephen my nature is a somewhat retiring one i fancy i shall attend to my estates and write poetry you have no desire to go into parliament not the least books and friends those are what i want of course i shall try and do good in my own way but i do not wish to take part in public life there will be plenty for me to do in a small way herrick i think you are right responded herrick soberly and you have had such a wretched life hitherto that it is but fair you should have a few years of enjoyment but you must travel for a time before you settle down i shall be pleased to but of course as you know i shall not be able to leave saxham until the end of a year i want to be certain of holding the property i wonder why my uncle left instructions that a new vault should be built and should be visited and why for a year i cannot understand myself replied herrick your uncle was a man of mystery but i have learned something of his past stephen and herrick related his meeting with don manuel and what he had been told about the doings of carr in south america stephen looked uneasy and grave i hope this money was obtained in quite a proper way he said otherwise i should be afraid to use it if it is what the gipsies call red moneythat is obtained by bloodshed i would rather give it up for it can bring only a curse i do not think you need trouble on that score replied jim with a shrug heaven knows that carr was not scrupulous but with regard to the fortune he brought home if it was taken from some treasure chamber of those inca monarchs the spoil was legitimate enough if i came across such a treasure i should have no hesitation in taking it the worst feature of the expedition was the leaving of santiago with the indians but as he is still alive no harm has been done do you think i ought to give him some money asked stephen certainly not was herricks emphatic reply in the first place we do not know that the story is true in the second place i am convinced that the mexican is a scoundrel and in the third it is not your place to impoverish yourself for the sake of other people i wish i could find out the story of my uncles life well don manuel is probably coming down to saxham on a sentimental pilgrimage to see the grave of a man he detested he may tell you all he knows if you question him probably he will tell me a very pretty story said stephen dryly but will it be true i do not want the arabian nights herrick shrugged his shoulders i should not care to take santiagos word myself he said still amongst his lies there may be some grain of truth but where the real truth will be found is in that secret writing which bess gave to me bess cried marshcarr with a smile dr jim coloured and apologised a slip of the tongue he said i hear you talk of bess so frequently that i am apt to fall into the same habit but this writing he added hurriedly to avoid further explanation as you know we can make nothing of it yet if we could read it something tangible might be discovered i really do not see why i should trouble at all about my uncles villainies said marshcarr rather impatiently the estate is mine now and i want to enjoy it without worrying my conscience of course i do worry as to the writing there is a cryptogram in the telegraph which resembles the paper you showed me here it is in the agony column herrick took the newspaper and looked at the paragraph indicated by stephen the jumble of letters did indeed resemble that on the piece of chinese paper in print the cryptogram was as followseqhrbn gxcd ozqj bnqmdq nbsnadq rodzj sn aktd bknsgdr vghsd gzs fknur rgndr dzqqr lnmdx dr jim read this over twice then took out the chinese paper and compared the two cryptograms i believe the secret writing is the same he said with some excitement see stephen in each there are figures and in each the figures are the same fifteen i believe that this was inserted by some one who knew carr it may be from frisco communicating with a third person about the murder true enough replied stephen yet it might merely be a coincidence if the figures were not the same i might think so but that in both there should be fifteen is strange to say the least of it perhaps thirty is the key to the cipher it might be so said herrick studying the telegraph but i am hanged if i can see how to apply it oh that edgar allen poe were at hand he could unravel any cipher in ten minutes the man had a marvellous gift in that way i once read a book on cipherwriting said marshcarr after a pause it said that to unravel a line of secret writing it was best to search for the character that represented e since that letter is used more frequently than any other in the english language there you lay a finger on the weak spot said jim quickly this cipher may be written in spanish for all i know why in spanish particularly because if it applied to colonel carr and his doings that is the most likely language he would use other than english he was mostly in mexico and peru if manuel is to be believed and there spanish is spoken as you know stephen this may be a writing in that tongue well herrick you know spanish so you might yes i might interrupted dr jim sarcastically if i were acquainted with secret writing but this is dutch to me and worse for i have some knowledge of dutch and absolutely none of this let us try your e idea stephen and see what we make of it the chinese paper cipher is the shortest we will count the letter that is most frequent and call it e something may come of the attempt herrick counted and stephen checked his reckoning four ds said jim five ks three zs and three rs humph seems to me that k is the predominating letter and once it comes kk which might stand for double e well well call it e but here are two rs together said stephen that might stand also for double e yes but you forget that there are five ks to three rs we agreed to call the letter which predominated e all right fire away and see what you make of it for the next hour the two men with pencil and paper did their best to extort sense from the jumble of letters on this basis at the end of the time they were both out of temper and had not succeeded in obtaining even one reasonable word hang it said stephen throwing his paper to the other end of the carriage i dont believe it makes sense at all nonsense replied herrick wiping his face it is sure to make sense all ciphers do and i daresay this is an easy one the easiest are usually the most difficult to unravel that is an epigram stephen stephen had taken up the paper again and was studying the cipher fifteen itkx he said musingly the figures and the letters run together here so they do in the telegraph cipher said herrick and read out fifteen nbsnadq what of that i thought it might be a date said marshcarr apologetically dr jim laughed it mighton the other hand it might not you forget the figures are concealed the same as the letters said stephen how do we know that retorted the doctor fifteen may be the key to the cipher you may count one or count five or add the two together and count six or subtract the two and count four then again you may have to count from left to right or right to left and after all the cipher may be in spanish or english or in the indian tongue for the matter of that carr was mixed up with the south american indians you know well never discover it stephen but i tell you what added jim struck with a sudden thought this mexican devil may know what it means in that case he must have put it in the paper said stephen he knew carr and the cipher was used by carr what is more likely herrick frowned there is some conspiracy on he muttered i do not see what it all means we must learn what these ciphers mean stephen it is a serious matter do you think the key might be found amongst your uncles papers he left no papers replied stephen i have looked dr jim shook his head the thing was beyond him he replaced the chinese paper in his pocketbook and cut out the notice in the telegraph i say stephen he said while thus employed did your uncle take in the daily telegraph yes he used to pass it on to bess when he had done with it there you see cried jim triumphantly another link this cipher has been put in the newspaper your uncle usually read oh be sure it has to do with his businessperhaps with his death well we shall see nothing more was said about the matter as the two were a trifle exhausted by their efforts to read the ciphers when the train arrived at the beorminster station they were met by frank endicotte who came towards them in a state of excitement usually foreign to his nature glad to see you fellows back said frank shaking hands bess got the wire you sent steve and insisted that i should meet you here i have brought a cart borrowed it from pentland corn he wanted his groom to come too but there was not enough room for four got much luggage no only a couple of portmanteaux the heavy baggage is coming on by a goods train laughed stephen i have been buying up the whole of london i say frank how are the biffs all right replied frank as they put up the portmanteaux on the dogcart up you get steve will you drive or you herrick no replied the doctor grimly you have undertaken the responsibility of that horse if i kill it corn will blame me drive yourself ill stick on behind no no protested stephen get up in front herrick certainly not the lord of the manor of saxham must have the first place he swung himself up to the back seat send her along frank in a few minutes they were rattling home along the southberry road and frank was telling marshcarr all that had been done at the pines it seemed that bess and ida had engaged a moderate staff of servants the most indispensable that is as they left the choice of the others to stephen the house had been cleaned from top to bottom food had been got in and a good dinner awaited the travellers bess ida and i are coming over later on explained frank we want to hear of your adventures i am afraid we have none said marshcarr with a laugh herrick said nothing he was thinking if he told all he had discovered and talked about his suspicions he might create a sensation however the time was not yet ripe to take the biffs into his confidence bess was the one he would consult if necessary frank deposited them at the pines and then drove away to the rectory to restore the cart stephen found the house in admirable order and a good dinner waiting for him and his friend in the diningroom herrick felt rather a qualm as he sat down remembering that ghastly meal which had waited for the dead colonel however he was too healthy a man to give way to such morbid fancies and made an excellent meal afterwards he and stephen had coffee in the library and as the evening was chilly marshcarr ordered a fire to be lighted in a state of comfort they sat in comfortable armchairs smoking luxuriously hitherto stephen had smoked only cigarettes but lately by the advice of his doctor had begun pipesmoking after a time he found it much more satisfying than the cigarettes i suppose they will be here soon said stephen glancing at his watch herrick grunted truth to tell he felt so comfortable that he did not want to be disturbed there was a good deal of the bachelor about herrick however just as stephen replaced his watch one of the new footmen announced the biffs not by that name certainly mr endicotte the misses endicotte said phillips he had been in the service of the bishop of beorminster and prided himself on knowing the manners of good society well said bess when the first greeting was over and they were all seated comfortably round the fire what do you think of the house it is splendid said stephen i have to thank you and ida heartily but i wont stop short at thanks and then the presents were produced they took the form of jewellery and both the girls were delighted oh lovely lovely cried ida looking at the emerald ring which stephen had placed on her finger i do so love jewels as she spoke she caught the eye of marshcarr fixed significantly on her and blushed she knew very well why the ring had been bought although stephen had not placed it on the engagement finger herrick did not notice this byplay which might have enlightened him he was busy talking to frank about the new gun which he was examining frank had always wanted a gun and was in the seventh heaven of delight bess also was pleased with a bangle but she would rather have had books however she did not say so as she did not wish stephen to think she was disappointed i have something for flo and sidney but those can wait said stephen frank was so taken up with his new gun that stephen devoted himself to ida herrick was thus thrown into the society of bess who asked him if he had solved the cryptogram no i have not he replied and here is another of the same sort which appeared in the telegraph of today bess glanced at it with interest i have seen something like that before she said thoughtfully several times a cipher like that has been in the telegraph i never thought it had anything to do with the colonel i am sure it had said herrick eagerly have you the cuttings no i did not think it was necessary to keep them they all appeared within the last year humph said herrick ill send for a file of the newspaper but this cipher i wish we could read it i believe it has some connection with carrs death or at all events with the secret of his life i cant make it out said bess looking at the cutting and the scrap of chinese paper unless she hesitated well unless what i was talking to frisco one day said bess he had been drinking rum as usual and was rather drunk the colonel had sent him to the postoffice for the letters and he held one in his hand the only one which had come that day it was about three months ago shortly after i picked up the piece of chinese paper this one she shook it at herrick i understand go on i noticed that the envelope of the letter frisco carried was of the same paper ha cried the doctor this is interesting yes frisco was shaking the letterwaving it over his head and singing i stopped to tell him he ought to be ashamed of himself being in such a state when he knew perfectly well how to behave one minute interrupted herrick remembering what frith had said was this frisco a gentleman yes and no replied bess he had a refined way of speaking in spite of the frightful american slang he used at times when he was quite sober he would speak to me in the most refined way at other times he was just awful a large fat man was he not yes immensely stout but his face was rather handsome he was about the same age as the colonel there was something attractive about frisco finished bess with a sigh he was his own worst enemy well about this letter he was waving it and singing i met him in the pine wood where i had been to look for sidney i told him that he might lose it since he was so drunk he laughed and said no one could read it he knew the letter by the envelope ha said herrick by the chinese paper it is noticeable well i asked him what he meant he laughed again and went away singing move on one move on one i took no notice of the words at the time but as he had a cipher letter in his hand i have often wondered if he applied the words to the cipher move one on repeated herrick excitedly and glanced at the chinese paper cipher humph stephen thought that fifteen itkx might be a date if this cipher has to do with the murder a date interrupted bess eagerly well colonel carr was murdered in july dr jim in the word july there are four letters and i see what you mean and here are four letters itkx also the number fifteen move on one said bess repeating the cry of frisco that is take the next figures to one and five two six said herrick by heaven that must mean the twentysixth move on one of these four letters i stands or j t for u k for l and x in place of y july cried herrick dashing down the pen here is the solution of the cryptogram the twentysixth of july repeated bess and the colonel was murdered on the twentyfourth i do not see the connection we have not worked out the whole cipher yet said dr jim here take a pen and write down the alphabet bess did this as rapidly as possible as she saw what the doctor meant now place a under b b under c and so on to the end of the alphabet bess did this also i can put z under no letter she said yes you can z goes under a i have heard of this cipher it is written with misleading letters you simply take the next letter for the one that is down come we will apply the result to these ciphers this is what they got in the chinese paper cipher the last warning till july then death unless and in the printed cipher of the daily telegraph frisco hyde park corner october speak to blue clothes white hat gloves shoes carrs money chapter xi settling down the cipher was so simple that herrick wondered that he had not solved it before it merely consisted of the alphabet arranged in two lines as follows abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz zabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy the cipher was written by using the second line as though it were the first all that had to be done was to write out the alphabet as above and use the first line in place of the second nothing could be more ingenious orwhen it was knownmore simple but for all that herrick would not have found the key had he not recollected stephens remark that the number fifteen might be a date and had not bess related friscos apparently meaningless words however here was the reading of the riddle colonel carr had been warned to do a certain thing and was threatened with death if he did not do it he was given up to the twentysixth of july but the punishment vengeance or whatever it was had been executed on the twentyfourth jim could see no reason for this anticipation of the cipher letter as to the cryptogram in the agony column of the daily telegraph it would seem that someone knew that frisco was in london and wished to see him about carrs money this rather bore out herricks belief that there was a conspiracy in progress to rob stephen of his inherited wealth was captain manuel striking in the dark or had robin joyce anything to do with the matter herrick asked himself these questions but he did not seek an answer from bess until he was absolutely sure of robins guilt he did not wish to say a word and if he told bess about santiago he would have to reveal what joyce hadpresumablydone at all events the mere mention of santiagos name and where he met him would invite questions regarding joyce if i were you dr jim said bess the next day when they met to talk over their discovery i should go up to london and wait at hyde park corner it will be easy for you to see a person dressed as noticeably as the man who put in the cipher intends to be i should think a navy blue serge with white hat gloves and boots would attract attention you can then see if the person meets frisco and and and give frisco in charge finished herrick no said miss endicotte decisively i should not do that at present public opinion and circumstantial evidence is so much against frisco that he would not have a fair trial if he did murder colonel carr which i dont believeyou can prove it by watching him see where he and the man who meets him are going follow on and be guided by circumstances how to act have you any idea who put this in dr jim suspected don manuel but he did not think it wise to say so i really cannot be sure said he shirking the question of course we are all in the dark about this business again i notice that no time is mentioned in the cipher oh i can understand that replied bess producing a slip of paper from her pocket when i got home last night i looked through the file of the daily telegraph given to me by colonel carr i thought there might be a third cipher see here it is it appeared about the beginning of august herrick looked at the third cipher it was worded exactly the same as the one that had appeared in the newspaper at the later date save that in it the hour of three oclock was mentioned as the time of meeting humph said dr jim i wonder if frisco obeyed this first request i am sure he did answered bess readily if he had not the time of meeting would be put into the second no dr jim it is because the person who wants to meet frisco met him the first time that he has omitted the hour he knows that frisco will be there at three oclock if he comes at all you go up and see what you can do it is now the twentysecond said herrick after a moment all right ill go up but i should say nothing of all this to stephen nor to anyone replied bess warmly let us work out the thing ourselves and put an end to the conspiracy i am sure it is one she added for you see carrs money is mentioned i hope poor stephen will not be murdered next i hope not said herrick rather gloomily he was recalling what mrs marsh had said to him about frisco and of a possible danger to her stepson at all events i shall look after him carefully but all this seems to show that frisco is not the good man you thought him it does look bad for frisco admitted bess dejectedly still he may be able to explain if he can only summon up courage to take his trial i should not like to be mistaken in frisco there was something i liked about him well ill go up to town and watch said herrick by the way my friend joyce is coming down here next week to stay for a time i am so glad said bess eagerly i saw only a glimpse of him last time he is an author and we shall have so much to talk about herrick was rather annoyed by her enthusiasm he did not like the idea of joyce whom he suspected being too great a friend of this girls yet when he came to think over the matter his annoyance was ridiculous he was jealous of stephen with ida and now irritated at the prospect of bess getting on well with robin i do not love the two of them said herrick to himself with a vexed laugh yet i like both at all events if joyce does come down ill keep them apart as much as possible i must know the truth about joyce before i let him again into my circle of friends in any case he is a liar if no worse this was an unsatisfactory frame of mind in which to renew a friendship but jim had no such intention finding that robin had told him two deliberate falsehoods he made up his mind that all was at an end between them herrick had a very high opinion of the sacredness of friendship and was in addition as dr johnson said a good hater he either liked a man greatly or disliked him immensely with the utmost calmness he went to work to get his quondam friend by his side in order to learn the truth if joyce had murdered carr if he was mixed up with frisco and don manuel in a conspiracy against stephen there was no punishment he did not deserve but although herrick was hard he was also just every chance would be given to joyce to prove his innocence and if in the end he proved to be guilty jim knew in his heart of hearts that he would let him go free much as he might deserve the punishment of the law jim felt that for the sake of their old friendship he could not be the one to hand him over to justice it must not be thought that herrick took his discovery calmly he suffered greatly on learning the worthlessness of the man he had so trusted he had saved robins life by nursing him through a dangerous illness and had been attracted by his ambition to become a great novelist he had also tried to make a man of him by strengthening his will and mending his nerves being sorry for the tortured creature but since the man was so inherently bad herrick sternly cut himself off from him he waited only to be certain of the worst to cast robin out of his life but until he was certain he gave him the benefit of the doubt it was a painful position but jim set his teeth and stuck to it the journey to town was a complete failure herrick watched at hyde park corner all day and thereby incurred the unjust suspicions of the police but he saw neither the eccentricallydressed individual who had described himself in the cipher nor the exsailor whom he hoped to recognise by his monstrous stoutness and if chance offered by the scar on his forehead neither one of them came to the rendezvous so dr jim returned to saxham a sadder but not a wiser man bess consoled him they must have got some suspicion that they were being watched she said sooner or later another of these ciphers will appear in the paper and you will have a chance of catching them humph said jim disbelieving if they are suspicious they will make some other arrangements for you see they must have guessed that in some way i had solved the cipher it is all darkness and mystery said herrick vexedly for the time being at all events i intend to put it out of my head this he did and with considerable success there was much to do at the pines and with its new master the estate had to be put in order more servants had to be engaged with the assistance of ida and the walls and fences had to be put up again also the new vault was rapidly approaching completion and stephen hoped to have his uncles body removed into it before christmas in the meantime he did not neglect to go monthly and even weekly to the family sepulchre to see that all was safe as yet nothing had been disturbed stephen began to think that the necessity of protecting the body of the wicked colonel was all moonshine but herrick knew better he still believed in the existence of a conspiracy and kept his eyes and ears open it was well in these days that marshcarr had so watchful a guardian joyce arrived at the carr arms with don manuel and the two made themselves very agreeable herrick did not approve of their calling at biffstead but he either had to quarrel openly with them or tolerate the acquaintance as a row would have spoilt his plans and perhaps if his suspicions were correct exposed stephen to danger herrick held his peace and made himself agreeable indeed neither robin nor santiago had any idea that he was their enemy so well did he play his part dr jim hated to wear a mask but much could be done by guile and nothing at all could be gained by force so he consented to do violence to his usually open nature meantime he devoted himself to educating stephen outofdoors horses were bought and the two rode daily herrick taught stephen how to swim to fence to box and to golf indeed the biffs also took to golfing for herrick obtained permission to lay out part of the heath as a links then the young men and maidens of the county came to play and saxham became quite busy even the beorminster people contrived to learn the game and the clerical society there curates dean and even the canons played with zest and judgment herrick as the original starter of the game was voted an acquisition to the county and made much of he and stephen were asked everywhere and as the weeks went by marshcarr became a different man he lost his air of shyness became straighter in the back spent less time poring over books and more in the open air needless to say he was warmly attached to the doctor and it was now jim and steve between them and the biffs approved of the friendship since he had lost the friendship of robin herrick paid more attention to ida he never paused to analyse his feelings towards her and foolishly believed that he loved her she knew better and smiled at the attentions paid to her by dr jim herrick was no wiser than his neighbours when it came to a question of sex and because he admired ida thought that she was the only woman in the world for him he had never been in love before and mistook the affection he felt for a beautiful and kindhearted girl for the genuine passion spoken of by poets if it was jim did not think it was so bad as they made out he had not himself felt the wound so he jested at the scars of others ida was amused at the dear large stupid creature and played the rle of omphale to his hercules but she knew quite well when to pull him up when his attentions became too pressing she did so in her own quiet way strange to say stephen did not notice his friends folly or if he did he made no remark one day the biffs took afternoon tea in the pinewood round the mansion stephen and herrick were there the biffs themselves and don manuel with robin the latter was much excited and chattered on in a merry way which amused everyone save herrick who looked at him rather sourly bess was too attentive to joyce to please the doctor come and sit by me mr joyce she said making a place beside her when they sat on the grass for tea you shall feed me ah what a privilege put in santiago and bess frowned she did not like the spaniard i am so hungry announced robin jim you sit over there by miss endicotte and mr marsh can sit beside miss flo santiago placed himself beside sidney who at once got up and walked away to the other side of the circle sidney hated the mexican and openly said as much there was a bad feeling about him said sidney and he sometimes shivered and turned pale when in don manuels company the mexican did not seem annoyed he understood sidney better than did the others or he said he did and explained his reasons to herrick the doctor laughed at him when these were explained and declined to argue such nonsense at this don manuel smiled but did not take offence he had his own reasons for remaining on friendly terms with jim how pleasant it is here said bess looking at the green boughs overhead so solitary one would think we were miles away in the country so we are said robin amidst a general laugh how many more miles do you want us to be miss bess the girl laughed herself you know what i mean perfectly well of course nothing could be more absolutely rural than this but saxham is the same what i meant to say is that no human habitation can be seen hereabouts no the tower has disappeared said stephen gravely it used to be visible from here just over those two pines santiago chimed in ah that is where my poor friend met with his death i wonder you are not afraid to live in the house seor why should he be afraid put in ida rather indignantly ghosts are not pleasant things said the mexican with a shrug do you mean to say that the wicked colonel walks asked robin you are talking nonsense said herrick who was beginning to find the conversation disagreeable and in the presence of stephen not in good taste there are no such things as ghosts and the room in which colonel carr died has been demolished if you talk like this the ignorant country people will be inventing some legend sidney who had been listening to all this very quietly looking first at one speaker and then at the other let his grave blue eyes fall upon the doctor how do you know that there are no such things as ghosts he demanded there are i have seen them myself everybody shuddered and santiago looked at the boy with a curious smile where have you seen a ghost asked herrick quietly in this wood in the village churchyard all kinds of shapes and forms they do not frighten me only bad people are frightened you would be he added looking at santiago yes responded that gentleman you are quite right i am glad i have not your gift of seeing things you laugh at it i suppose pardon me i know too much about it to laugh the tower said sidney suddenly turning to stephen i know you can see it from here often and often i have sat in the darkness under yonder tree and watched the shapes in the light that streamed from the windows all bad shapesall wicked spirits said sidney the colonel was so wicked that nothing good would come near him ida thought that this conversation had gone quite far enough and when herrick glanced at her interposed sidney you are talking nonsense the boy got up in a kind of cold rage always nonsense said he because you are all blind and stupid and he walked away is he mad said robin his mouth open bess was about to contradict him rather indignantly when santiago interposed he is far from mad said he but he has a wonderful gift denied to us who are of common clay of course the doctor does not believe in this he is a materialist no i am not replied herrick rather nettled but i do not believe in things that cannot be proved by the senses i said you were a materialist replied santiago and refused to speak further it was on another occasion and when no one was present that jim renewed the conversation meanwhile the doctor was angry at the attention paid by joyce to bess the little man had now known her some weeks and had taken a violent fancy to her he haunted her like a shadow and she did not seem to dislike it herrick did but as he had no right to interfere he was obliged to look on in silence more than ever he regretted his folly in inducing robin to come down to saxham not for all the schemes in the world would he have bess endicotte lose her heart to joyce until this day such an idea had never entered his head but now he saw more clearly bess was distinctly pleased with robins attentions should she really get to care for him and robin was attractive when he liked herrick knew that he would be forced to interfere even if he had to denounce joyce to the law he would put an end to such a possibility he could not even see the two together without annoyance and rose abruptly to walk away as he went in the direction of the heath and by almost the same path as he and joyce had come on that terrible night he heard a light step behind and turned to see ida she looked more lovely than ever for having followed him rapidly her face was somewhat flushed just as he was on the edge of the heath she laid her hand on his arm a thrill ran through the strong frame of the doctor he thought this was love but indeed any man would have felt as much had ida endicotte touched him she was beautiful and moreover had a magnetic attraction which drew the most sullen under her charm how much more then herrick who frankly acknowledged that she waswhat he rather obviously calledan angel dont follow him dr jim she said breathlessly believe me he is better alone i know his moods are you talking of sidney asked herrick in surprise yes i thought you followed him she cast a look across the moor where the slender figure of the boy could just be seen disappearing on the horizon how fast he walks here there and everywhere like a ghost i did not follow sidney said herrick gravely but i see that i must take the boy in hand his brain is too excitable you dont think he is mad said ida turning pale i assure you that he is very shrewd in many ways and looks after himself thoroughly but he was always a delicate boy with strange habits he is a poet said herrick decisively that is why he sees things as he puts it his imagination and brain power are too strong for his weak body if he went in for exercise and took pleasure in sport he would soon lose these unhealthy phantasies they would pass away in verse do you think he ought to go to a public school certainly not the boy is too peculiar too rare a spirit the other boys would not understand him and he would be as unhappy as coleridge and lamb no he needs looking after privately i like corn but he does not understand the boy let me see to it miss endicotte indeed faltered ida i should be very glad we are all very fond of sidney but he is peculiar as you say and you have done wonders with stephen i can see that i have only induced him to take an interest in healthy things said herrick the rest follows as a matter of course but i am glad you are pleased you know that i am anxious to please youida miss endicotte blushed and drew back with a look of surprise then she seemed to make up her mind and instead of leaving him as seemed to be her original intention she walked on beside him towards the moor you are very kind she said simply you are not angry at my calling you ida not at all i call you dr jim you seem to be a kind of brother to us all i am glad that stephen has so good a friend but i do not want to be a brother said jim in a deep voice trying to take her hand you must understand she drew her hand away quietly i do understand she said in low tones but i beg of you not to go on talking like this but idayou must have seen i love you no you do not love me dr jim she laid her hand on his shoulder and looked gravely into his flushed face if you had really been in love with me i should not have waited you saw how i turned to go and changed my mind that was because i wish to put matters right between us i do not understand ida i know you dont and that is why you speak if you were in love with me dr jim you would know that i am in love with someone else in love with someone else notnot stephen yes stephen and he loves me oh you look astonished i said you did not know what love meant had you really felt the passion you believe you feel you would have guessed you like me because we get on well together because you think i am pretty here she blushed and laughed i am talking foolishly i fear but what i mean to say is that it is only ida endicotte you love not the real woman if you did if your heart was filled with a true passion you would have seen that stephen and i understand one another has he asked you to stammered herrick there was no need that he should ask replied ida i am quite content to wait until he speaks because i know and he knows that i know that is true love dr jim we do not need mere words jim looked down rather shamefaced ida took him by the arm and forced him to face her confess she said with a laughing face you are not quite brokenhearted that i will not marry you no replied jim rather astonished at the calmness of his feelings i cant say i feel suicidal ida shrugged her queenly shoulders you see was her remark what i said was true you do not love the true woman no dr jim she put her hand into his i am glad we have had this talk the moon can never be yours so do not cry for it when you are really and truly in love you will feel very different to what you do now i assure you jim more himself laughed where did you learn all this lore mother nature taught it to me laughed ida i needed no teaching i knew years ago that stephen and i were born for one another yet we have always been merely friends nothing more he has not even said to me as much as you have done we understand both of us that is why i have refused so many good offers other people could not understand not even bess clever as she is but i knew so did stephen it is for this reason i refuse you dr jim not that you have asked me she finished laughing jim laughed too for he was now once more at his ease with her i have been making a fool of myself he said and you are a dear good woman to take me in such a spirit i suppose it was not really love after all my dear dr jim you do not even know the meaning of the word but if i had chosen you would have learned it do you know she added with another laugh you remind me of the cook who was of that appy disposition that she could marry anyone you had better be careful dr jim for any clever woman who let you believe she loved you could become mrs herrick i do not think so said jim grimly i do and i am sure of it well i have been a traitress to my sex and have warned you i could say something more but i shall leave you to find it out find what out ah that is part of the finding you are a great big stupid wise man dr jim and i love you for your folly but some day you will be happy you do not understand what i mean at present dont try to understand it will come upon you unexpectedly and now she held out her hand like a queen we are friends we are brother and sister brother and sister ida said jim kissing that white hand this time he did not feel the slightest thrill you are right he cried rather vexed i do not know what love is but you will some day and soon i see it coming thus spoke ida and refused to explain herself further but jim understood herdimly chapter xii secondsight herrick was much happier now that his relations with ida were properly adjusted he recognised how true was her womans instinct which had gone at once to the root of the matter he had never truly loved her as a woman demands to be loved the very fact that he had been blind to her feeling for stephen showed that what he had mistaken for true passionif it could be so calledwas wholly false he had been attracted by her beauty by her kindly spirit by that sympathy which every genuine woman can give to a man whom she finds pleasant company but of the sacred feeling which is named love yet which has no name he had not felt one thrill with feminine cleverness she had taken his gimcrack passion in the right way and had shown him in the kindest of words how poor a thing it really was there was no ill feeling in his heart now that he had lost her he could regard her as a dear friend and even be glad that she should marry stephen so far herrick was quite content yet there was a vague yearning in his breast for companionship and sympathy certainly he had both from stephen but stephen was a man and could not be to him what a woman could be herrick had lived a life so active and full of interest that he had never found time to think of love or of womankind now that there wasso to speak a pause in his lifethe vacuum thus created required to be filled up in some way for man was woman created and jim was simply yearning although in his materialistic blindness he did not know it for the other part of himself ida had hinted that what he wanted would come to him yet so blind was jim that he could not see the advancing vision he looked to all four points of the horizon and sawnothing it was a wonder to him in after years that it had been so with him but it was but that dense gloom which heralds the dawn and the glory of day was at hand in this unsatisfactory mood wanting something yet not knowing what it was that he wanted jim was anything but a pleasant companion formerly he had been serenely strong never out of temper and always sufficient in himself to himself now he was easily irritated he smoked more than was good for him he looked upon his fellow mortals with jaundiced eyes in vain he rode he boxed he fenced he swam he took long tramps into the country external nature could do nothing for him the secret of his redemption was within him yet he did not know how to learn it poor jim those dark days took much of his pride from him he learned then how poor a thing is man how dependent upon forces which although within himself he is unable through weakness or through ignorance to control one form of herricks unrest took the shape of being almost openly rude to robin the little man was in the habit of haunting biffstead he was by this time desperately in love with bess and took no pains to conceal his feelings manuel encouraged it for the mexican was his confidant robin would have told herrick had the doctor shown any sympathetic disposition to listen but jim avoided him on all occasions perhaps robin guessed the cause for he let sleeping dogs lie and never asked what it was that had come between them he knew that it would be wiser for him to leave saxham yet so deeply was he in love that he could not tear himself away from so dangerous a neighbourhood jim felt that if he spoke to robin he might say too much so he sounded manuel on the subject of their leaving he wished both men to go conspiracy or no conspiracy the mystery of the affair was beginning to exasperate jim and as has been said before he was not in his usual goodtempered frame of mind one day he encountered santiago on the common the mexican was in good spirits and expressed his pleasure at the meeting the doctor nodded grimly but did not return the compliment when are you two going away he asked manuel looked up at the hard tone and saw at once that jim had made up his mind to be disagreeable but the mexican was not lacking in courage and had no thought of retreating i do not quite understand what you mean seor he said with coldness i am talking of you and joyce when are you going when it suits me to leave seor i have every right to stop here if i so choose and i do choose as to joyce you had better ask him yourself jim saw that he had taken the wrong tone with the man and by a great effort of will became more friendly you need not be angry santiago he said i only ask because i see that joyce is attracted by miss bess endicotte that is wrong eh santiago shrugged his shoulders why should it be wrong she is a most charming lady and your friend joyce loves her ridiculous he can never marry her said herrick angrily there is no reason why he should not of course it is none of my business seor and i fail to see why you should speak to me about it see here don manuel i speak to you because i know that robin has come under the power of your will you do what you like with him and i want you to take him away he must not ask miss bess to marry him for the very simple reason that he has no income and no position such a marriage would be a bad one for the girl are you in drop that cried herrick so fiercely that the mexican was cowed i am responsible for joyce and for you also seeing that i asked you both to come here you must go away so far as joyce is concerned i shall use the influence you are pleased to talk about to get him to leave as for myself the rev pentland corn has asked me to stop with him for a week or so i have accepted pentland corn said herrick surprised what can there be in common between the rector and you oh i know that i am a bad man replied the mexican smoothly but perhaps this priest may improve me i believe he did his best with colonel carr but with me he may not fail we are friendsgreat friends i do not understand muttered herrick eyeing the man curiously is there any need you should retorted don manuel working himself into a rage seor i do not understand that you talk to me so thats all right replied jim coolly he did not want to quarrel with the man as yet we need not lose our tempers like schoolboys you can stay a century with corn for all i care but joyce if i have any influence with him he shall go very good i would have spoken to him myself but your influence over him is stronger than mine santiago shrugged his shoulders you ascribe to me more power than i possess said he i do not wish to obtain influence over any one to me joyce is a pleasant friend nothing more when i go back to london probably i shall see little of him and i return to mexico in two months herrick was pleased to hear this if there was any conspiracy and don manuel was mixed up in it the thing would at all events come to a head within eight weeks it was time it did for herrick was weary of fighting with shadows once he had something definite before him he could fight and a vague threat in the mexicans tone assured him that he would not have long to wait as he had no excuse for leaving don manuel the doctor was forced to return to the village with him on the way they passed sidney who was walking towards the moor herrick called to the boy who merely waved his hand and passed on jim noticed that his face was singularly colourless of a hue resembling that which it had assumed when he had slept on the library sofa prior to his announcement of mrs marshs death how ill that boy looks muttered herrick pardon me interposed manuel he is not ill but he is in that frame of mind which will bring him into contact with spiritual intelligences how do you know by his rapt look and his fixed eye that boy dr herrick is clairvoyant herrick was angry at once you are talking the jargon of the spiritualists he said roughly all trickery and fraud believe me nothing of the sort seor i myself have seen the most extraordinary things herrick looked at him with a disdainful smile i know you are not a good man santiago nor do you wish to be thought one but i credited you with more intelligence than to believe in hallucinations don manuel not at all offended laughed true i am not a good man he said and more is the pity i am afraid to go where that lad can gointo the astral plane you do not understand no you are as i said before a materialistic being but i am not a fool dr herrick and i can tell you that i know something of the psychic faculty in mexico i have seen the most wonderful things tell me all about it said jim humouring the man i am a sceptic you know all the spiritualism i have ever seen is humbug this of which i talk is not spiritualism rejoined manuel coldly it is the occult science what is the good of my explaining anything to you you would only laugh you cannot see you never will see the prison of the flesh is too strong for you to break through i am a healthy man if that is what you mean retorted jim but about this boy he is queer i admit ah you can see that said manuel sarcastically i congratulate you eh he foretold the death of mrs marsh is it not so yes but that was a coincidence of course these things are always coincidencesto you but to me it is a proof that the boy can enter the astral plane he does not know what it is he is not instructed but he can go i dont know what it is myself it is another world that is all around us said manuel waving his hand it interweaves itself into our world but having only limited senses we cannot see it that boy has senses finer than ours and he can see if you gave him a crystal a blob of ink any shining surface with depth he would see the most wonderful things have you read zanoni seor bulwer lyttons romance yes of course you call it a romance but there is much truth in it well it is useless for me to explain besides i am not a good man and to tell you all i should be good that boy however you want to make him like yourself well then make him eat plenty of meat and take exercise make him fat place him amongst boys who will laugh at him and he will be like the rest of the world he will not lose his power altogether it will come to him at odd moments but he will not be the dreamer you see him no and he will not be able to see i have thought of that myself said herrick lazily the boy is halfstarved and queera poet in temperament i will take him in hand and and make him like yourself did i not say so manuel paused then laughed tonight if i am not mistaken he will astonish you he said i know the look he had on his face something is in the air he sees it he will tell you about it and you will laugh tell me about what i do not know i am not clairvoyant wait and see and manuel turning on his heel went into the carr arms which they had approached during their conversation herrick looked after him with a smile of contempt a charlatan he muttered and i thought he was only a villain humph i do not think one need be afraid of himnow all the same in spite of his openly expressed scepticism the conversation haunted him he determined to keep sidney in his company and see if anything happened herrick scoffed at the things manuel had been talking about yet he could not deny that the incident of the prophecy of mrs marshs death was very remarkable indeed jim shuddered as he wondered if this uncanny boy was about to prophesy something similar however he put the gruesome thought out of his mind and went to biffstead here he met joyce coming out of the gate the little man looked quite joyous and greeted herrick gaily are you just going in i was coming to you miss endicotte asked me to take a message to you what is it said herrick forcing himself to be civil it was most important that he should not quarrel with robin at present he hated himself because he was obliged to wear this mask but the circumstances of the case and the interests of stephen required it miss endicotte wants you and marshcarr to come to dinner she has asked me also i am going back to dress and to invite don manuel i suppose sneered herrick no replied joyce simply he either did not notice the sneer or wished it to appear that he had not perceived it manuel dines with pentland corn tonight i hear he is going to stay with him yes corn and he have taken to one another curious they should and not creditable to corn said herrick and went inside leaving joyce staring after him the little man frowned and his face assumed a most unpleasant expression i wonder if he knows anything he thought biting his fingers he is quite different to what he used to be i dont care i can hold my own and with this defiant declaration he marched away holding his head in the air certainly dr jim was not wrong in suspecting robin to be other than he seemed then you wont come to dinner said ida when herrick presented himself what a pity bess will be disappointed i think not replied herrick dryly i understand joyce is coming but that is neither here nor there i shall tell stephen that you want him and so shall be left alone in the house will you send over sidney to dine with me i want him particularly but he is only a boy he will bore you on the contrary i find him a very interesting study you know i promised to take him in hand well i want to have a talk with him i am sure it is very good of you to take so much trouble dr jim said ida gratefully certainly i will send him when he returns from the moor he went out for a walk and you will tell stephen to come over yes as soon as i get back he has been writing poetry all the day and needs to be taken out of himself i am very glad you have asked him herrick bowed himself out and returned to the pines of course stephen was delighted at the idea of a dinner with ida but did not want to leave his friend alone thats all right said herrick sidney is coming to keep me company stephen shuddered then i am glad i am going away he said that boy is most uncomfortableso uncanny you will certainly find more pleasure in miss endicottes society laughed herrick stephen laughed too and looked sharply at his friend but true to his reticent nature he said nothing in due time marshcarr departed and sidney arrived the boy had more colour in his cheeks and his eyes had lost the fixed expression noticed by don manuel he and dr jim were on friendly terms and sidney was pleased that he had been asked to dine all the same he made a bad meal the dinner was excellent but the boy restricted himself to the plainest of the dishes and very little of them he did not touch meat but seemed to prefer vegetables herrick noticed this abstinence you will never grow strong if you dont eat beef sidney he said with a smile all english boys should eat beef i never liked it replied the boy abruptly i do not like any meat it is disagreeable to me and you never touch wine i notice no i once drank a glass of beer ugh sidney made a wry face and shuddered at the recollection how can people like such things what do you live on then asked herrick fruit vegetables and plain water i do not often touch tea dont you think that is unhealthy no i feel alright dr jim i am never ill ida is always fussing over me but i am much stronger than i look appearances are deceptive then said herrick dryly and rose to go to the library i suppose you do not smoke sidney you are too young to indulge in that perhaps you do though i never smoke i never will i suppose i am different from other boys but all the things they like to do i dislike herrick thought that this was the queerest lad he had ever met but for the moment he dropped the subject after a time he began to talk sport to see if sidney would take any interest in it the boy answered politely but was obviously bored not even the account of a tiger hunt with which herrick strove to rouse him had any effect the doctor more puzzled than ever and recollecting what santiago had said changed the tone of the conversation he spoke of the fakirs in india of their selfmortifications and the visions they asserted they had this was strange conversation for a boy of sixteen but then sidney was a freak he woke up upon this topic and began to talk brightly his face became animated a look of interest came into his eyes and he talked in a way so far above his years that herrick was astounded i seem to know india said sidney often times i see pictures of in it my mind the bright blue skies the brilliant vegetation the queerlydressed people and the long range of mountains he continued as in a dream peaks of snow against a cold sky those must be the himalaya mountains you have read about india said herrick and so it has impressed itself on your mind no i know more about the country than i have read it is just as if i had once lived there dr jim had a smattering of the theory of reincarnation he did not believe in it but on questioning sidney he really began to believe that the boy must have been in india in some former life else how did this countrybred youth know about the gorgeous east he said things which he could not possibly have read in books for two hours herrick drew him out on the subject and was fairly astounded at the mind which laid itself out before his gaze later on sidney began to grow restless and again his eyes took on that fixed look rising he walked up and down the library dr jim asked what was the matter im going to see something said sidney in a most matter of fact tone the feeling is always the same i feel as if i were not myself as if i did not belong to my body do you want to sleep asked herrick anxiously and with a thrill no i feel particularly wide awake i wish stephen were back dr jim sat up alertly why do you wish that there is something bad going to happen to him i feel that hehe is in danger i dont know sidney passed his thin hand across his eyes there is a dark cloud but badbad herrick felt half inclined to go with sidney to biffstead and walk home with marshcarr but he was ashamed to give way to what seemed a foolish impulse he laughed at the boy and began to question him on other subjects you are fond of wandering about at night he said i go to the pine wood very often replied sidney still uneasy it is so amusing to watch them them whowhat are you talking about i suppose you would call them fairies said the boy they are real people to me little men and women so busy about their work herrick stared this sounded like the ravings of a lunatic there are no such things as fairies he said roughly i have seen them replied sidney obstinately but we will not talk of them dr jim you would not believe me if i told you what i have seen see here sydney said herrick after a pause i believe you do see things in a way you have a most vivid imagination and a strong poetic temperament the way in which you described india shows me that i believe you think of these queer things so much that you make yourself see thema kind of hallucination if you ate meat and took to sport these unhealthy visions would pass away i daresay replied sidney indifferently he apparently did not wish to argue the matter but he held to his own opinion nevertheless there were a few moments of silence then the boy exclaimed it is coming nearerthe danger to stephen dr jim let us go to biffstead i am sure there is danger herrick the materialist however would not give way on this point he thought it would be weak for him to yield to the boys folly nonsense he said roughly you are giving way to your imagination nothing can happen to stephen if there is danger he added in a joking manner to make sidney ashamed of himself why dont you go to sleep and see what it is there is the sofa no i feel wide awake and yet i feeli feel sidney clenched his hand herrick reflected for a moment santiago had said that the boy was clairvoyant and could see visions in any shining surface or in a blob of ink there was a large silver ink pot on the table more as a joke than in earnest herrick pushed this across to sidney look there and see what is the matter he said sidney looked offended if you do not believe me you need not laugh he declared i shall go to biffstead myself it is eleven oclock quite time i was home no no look in the ink first said herrick now much more in earnest he really wished to see if the vivid imagination of the boy would see a picture in the black pool have you ever looked into a crystal sidney no i can see things without looking into anything when you are asleep vivid dreams perhaps said the boy quietly but in the dark i canno matter do not let us talk dr jim you only laugh at me and i want to go home to warn stephen said herrick angrily yes retorted sidney doggedly to warn stephen he is in danger well ill go with you sidney it seems that you must be humoured but to oblige me see if you can discern the arabian nights in the inkpot i am sure you will see stephen seated quietly in your drawingroom talking to your sisters with joyce very unwillingly sidney did what he was asked he knew that herrick was laughing at him and was particularly sensitive to ridicule with a look of reproach which made dr jim feel rather ashamed the boy drew the big silver inkpot towards him and stared into the black oval the chimes of the clock striking eleven had just died away and there was an absolute silence broken only by the faint crackle of the fire all the lights in the room had been turned off early in the evening at the request of sidney himself the boy disliked the full blaze only on the writingtable was a greenshaded lamp and close to thisbut in such a position that the light did not fall into the inkwell stood the silver pot herrick half vexed with himself for encouraging this folly watched the boy quietly from an armchair sidney bent over the ink and stared into it hard after a minute or two herrick saw a quiver pass through the boys frame what is it sidney i see the drawingroom at biffstead said sidney quietly but stephen is not there mr joyce is talking to ida and bess herrick laughed what nonsense stephen is certainly there if he is not had you not better look for him i see him now continued sidney taking no notice of the ridicule he is walking in the churchyard rubbish declared the sceptic in the armchair what should take stephen to the churchyard at this time of the night it is not on his way home he is in the churchyard insisted sidney there he walks amongst the tombstones he is going to the new vault for a time he looks at it how can you see that when the night is dark cried herrick rising there is no moon come away sidney this is bad for you wait wait said the boy hastily the danger the danger stephen has left the new vault he has gone to the old one he is being followed by a man in a dark cloak the man has a big stick he comes behind stephen hehestop stop the boy almost screamed nodont hit him do not hit him stephen help sidney cried herrick catching the boy by the arm and now thoroughly frightened dont go on in this silly fashion i tell you the man has struck stephen said sidney passionately he is lying by the old vault unconscious from a blow on the head the man has gone i dont know where let me go mr herrick stephen is sidney wrenched himself away from herrick and went staggering towards the door with his hands held out dr jim followed him to stop him from leaving the house in this state but the boy gained the hall before he did once there and he seemed to gather strength he caught up his cap and pulling open the massive door passed outside herrick taken by surprise did not wait to put on his own cap he went after the lad bareheaded thinking he had been seized with a fit of madness in spite of the darkness of the night he followed on sidneys heels so closely that he was enabled to keep him in sight jim wondered where he was going being still sceptical of harm to stephen sidney passed swiftly beyond the belt of pines and down the lane which led to biffstead he is going home thought herrick with relief but the lad did not go home he turned off sharp to the left and entered the churchyard through a side lane herrick now awestruck at his strange experience which he did not understand ran after him stumbling over the graves sidney never fell he passed swiftly to the old vault of the carrs beside it was a dark body on the ground stephen stephen cried the lad and then sank exhausted beside the body herrick came up thunderstruck at that cry struck a match and held it close to the ground beside the face of the unconscious man he started back with an irrepressible cry and let the match fall it was stephen marshcarr who was lying there and he was bleeding from a wound on the back of the head and beside him also unconscious lay the lad who had foreseen the accident or crime said herrick aloud in a shaky voice this is the work of frisco chapter xiii the wooing of robin joyce bewildered as herrick was by the strangeness of this discovery he had nerve enough to pull himself together and go for assistance in spite of the lateness of the hour the carr arms was full of labourers drinking and smoking a number of these came at once to the churchyard when they heard of the accidentfor so herrick put itand stephen was carried to his house herrick had ascertained before seeking assistance that his friend still lived meanwhile sidney had revived but was in a drowsy state i want to go home he said herrick after whispering him to say nothing of the vision seen in the inkpot sent him to biffstead in charge of the landlord napper then he accompanied the body of his friend to the pines herrick could not help thinking of it as the body though he knew stephen still lived but it was quite probable that he would be an actual corpse before the dawn mr marshcarr has met with an accident was the explanation of the doctor to his helpers and they went away but they knew very well that it was no accident and moreover the presence of sidney besides the body hinted that another wonderful event had taken place master sidney said that his mother was dead remarked the wiseacres and he has found the dead body of mr marsh himself now he is not dead said others ah but he will die master sidney never makes a mistake and by the next morning a legend had been circulated that the uncanny boy had foretold the death of the new squire when those who called at the pines heard that marshcarr had lived through the night they were quite disappointed it seemed a reflection on master sidney yet the boy had held his tongue and no one knew really what had happened in default of the truth then they took refuge in a fable there was absolutely no authority for what was said but sidney had been found unconscious beside the unconscious squire that was enough material out of which to form a wonderful story and it lost nothing in the telling meanwhile herrick fulfilled his duties of medical attendant to his friend smiling grimly the while that the need should come so comparatively early in their acquaintance he had known marshcarr but a little over five months the meeting had taken place in july and it was now near christmas the doctor examined the wound on the back of the head it was a nasty jagged cut evidently made by some blunt instrument a big stick as the boy said no doubt mused herrick as he plastered and bathed and bound it up stephen is stunned for the time being but i do not think that the brain is injured his head is pretty hard frisco had good intentions but not sufficient judgment to strike hard for of course it was frisco who had done this dr jim remembered what mrs marsh had said and regretted that she had passed away without informing him more fully of what she knew about frisco that the exsailor should dare to come down to the scene of his first crime in order to commit a second for at the moment herrick credited frisco rather than joyce with the carr murder was wonderful enough but his reason must be more wonderful still it was impossible that he should be able to get the fortune even if he put stephen out of the way for he was a proven murderer and if he showed himself would be at once arrested certainly he might explain all suspicions away but that was doubtful in the face of such strong evidence yet apparently he had made up his mind to remove stephen and get the money but he wont if i can help it muttered herrick the beast ill carry stephen to the vault myself so that the terms of the monthly visit may be fulfilled not that i dont think he will be on his feet sooner than frisco expects the job had been badly done he sent in a message to beorminster by a groom telling bridge of the new outrage and advising a search to be made for frisco then the patient having been attended to and the wouldbe assassin recommended to the attention of the police dr jim could do nothing more he sat before the library fire and smoked thinking deeply the while i wonder if joyce attempted this murder he thought there is something queer about this stopping here but that boy said joyce was at biffstead talking to his sisters if i believe one part of that visionand i am bound to do thati must believe the other not joyce then but there is don manuel he is connected with robin in some underhand way besides he professed to hate carr to regret the loss of the treasure it might be he if he has been with corn all the night well and goodif not he will have to account to me for his time i do not believe in the little reptile his meditations were ended by a sleepy servant who announced ida bess and frank with them came joyce wideeyed with wonder but so far as dr jim could see there was no sign of terror or of guilt on his face and robin was not the man to conceal his feelings napper brought home sidney and told us of this dreadful thing said bess who seemed the most collected of the party is heis he no he is not dead nor do i think he will die the blow was badly aimed who could have done it asked frank frowning i have my own opinion but i prefer not to express it at present said the doctor somewhat curtly i want you to take me to him doctor said ida looking at him with imploring eyes let me watch beside him you can do no good miss endicotte replied herrick better let me look after him tomorrow you can come over and watch if you like i think he will recover consciousness before the dawn thank god for that cried ida devoutly and then she wept the strain on her had been very great and she was glad of the relief of tears have you looked for the man who did this asked joyce i have sent a message to the police at beorminster said herrick without looking at him you can do no good joyce better go back to the inn by the way your friend santiago he has been with corn all the night said frank we met them coming here they had just heard the news but bess persuaded them to stay away thinking they would only bother you i think it is best to keep the house as quiet as possible has sidney said anything he asked looking at the sisters ida clasped her hands in terror did sidney say this would happen yes he looked into yonder inkpot and foretold the assault i cannot understand the thing myself but we can talk of it tomorrow in the meantime all of you hold your tongues about sidney this they all promised to do and now being more at rest in their minds about stephen they went away herrick drew bess aside at the door come over with ida tomorrow morning he muttered i want to speak to you she nodded and ran after the rest who were disappearing into the darkness herrick with a frown returned to the library it was not joyce he muttered it was not manuel after all it must be frisco well if the police are clever they will catch him before he can leave the district ha ill send a message to southberry it was that way he escaped last time herrick hastily wrote out an explanation he did not need to add a description of frisco as the handbills had sufficiently described him this he sent off with another groom then went to pass the night beside the bed of his patient all that night stephen lay as still as a corpse it was towards morning when he moved and showed signs of returning consciousness herrick was assiduous in his attendance and success crowned his efforts gradually stephen came to himself with a dull pain in his head weak but quite himself wherewhere am i were his first stammering words in your own house said herrick quickly dont talk my dear chap you have had an accident i remember muttered stephen at the vault a blowyes and be quiet said herrick sternly you must not talk i tell you and after another attempt stephen obeyed shortly he fell asleep herrick drew a long breath the worst was over for once the villany of frisco had failed in its object several people called that morning amongst others mr corn the clergyman did not look well and hurriedly asked after the sufferer i hope he is better he said a terrible affair dr herrick a cowardly crime said herrick sharply however we can talk of that when marsh gets better meantime mr corn will you tell me if don manuel was at your house last night dear me yes replied corn surprised he came to dinner and stayed with me up till midnight i was walking with him to the carr arms when we met the miss endicottes who told us of this terrible business why do you ask me the question dr herrick i have no special reason replied herrick mendaciously save that being in a sense responsible for the visit of santiago to this place i wish to warn you that i know nothing about him have you anything to say against his character asked the rector sharply no i know nothing about him all i can say is that i do not like the man and i think he is a bad lot if you like to tell him this mr corn you are at liberty to do so i am not the man to make mischief said corn hotly so far as i can see don manuel appears to me to be perfectly respectable if he is not i can look after myself dr herrick i beg your pardon said herrick ceremoniously i did not wish to infer that you could not all i have to say is that mr marsh is better and that in a week he will be about pentland corn murmured something about being pleased and took his departure herrick did not quite know what to make of the rector he was a good preacher a kindhearted man and in his own way clever but he seemed to be weak and usually had a haggard look on his face for which there was no apparent reason sometimes he went away to the seaside for his health and invariably returned looking worse than ever altogether the man was a mystery and herrick could not make out what was at the back of his timidity and his restless behaviour i seem to be surrounded with mysteries said herrick to himself i wonder if i shall ever get to the bottom of any one of them if i do the rest will easily be unravelled i suspect the whole lot are of a piece ida came that morning and bess this latter young lady waited in the library while herrick took up ida to the room of stephen she had insisted upon going up to watch beside him it is my right you know she said to dr jim and he silently admitted that it was stephen had just opened his eyes when they entered he tried to speak but ida placed her hand on his mouth and herrick frowned marsh obediently held his tongue and ida sat by his bedside however the patient managed to kiss idas hand then herrick went down to see bess warning ida that stephen was not to speak marsh did make another attempt but miss endicotte would not allow it the doctor says you are to be quiet if you say a word i shall go away the ring murmured stephen looking at her she knew what he meant drawing the emerald ring he had brought her from town off the finger it was on she put it on the engagement finger will that please your lordship said ida gaily but the tears were in her eyes stephen looked again thus was the situation adjusted between them without words they were engaged to be married stephen fell asleep again holding the hand of his promised wife both were happy meantime bess and herrick were in consultation herrick told the girl what mrs marsh had said about frisco and how stephen had been struck down from behind so it looks to me he said as though this man were trying to get the money it does admitted bess reflectively but why should frisco do all these dreadful things to get the fortune if he had colonel carr in his power he need not have killed him nor need he now try and get stephen out of the way i dont understand it however as you have told the police both at beorminster and southberry i am sure the man will be caught i hope so im sure ah then you champion frisco no longer no if it were really he who attempted to murder stephen i hope he will be caught and punished all the same i do not think he killed colonel carr what can be your reason for saying so bess hesitated some time ago i promised to tell you something about the colonel she said i will do so in a week from today why not now she shook her head please do not ask me but as far as this assault on stephen goes i am quite with you about frisco i hope he will be caught and punished you are a strange girl said dr jim and a mystery like the rest who are the rest asked bess smiling well replied jim after a pause mrs marsh was one you are another and pentland corn is a third pentland corn she echoed turning pale you dont suspect him of i dont suspect him of anything but i do not understand why he is so intimate with that mexican bess opened her mouth to make a remark then she changed her mind i can say nothing now she said abruptly later on ida is with stephen oh well i need not wait i must go into beorminster they will be asking for news of this for the paper i might hear something about frisco there if i do i shall let you know goodbye and before herrick could stop her she was off like a swallow evidently bess knew something about corn which she did want to admit at present herrick wondered what it could be surely she did not think the clergyman had liked carr so much that he was working for the discovery of his murderer but she is doing some detective business on her own account thought jim rather vexed she will get into trouble if she does not take care i wish she would let me know what she is up to ill wait a week no longer after that she must speak out but before the week was ended accident brought about a confession from bess which dr jim was far from expecting it arose out of the wooing of robin joyce whether manuel had used his influence or not to induce joyce to leave saxham it is impossible to say if he had one would have thought that robin would have resented the interference of his former friend herrick but several times during the week he met dr jim yet made no sign that santiago had told him of the doctors wish he continued to haunt biffstead and dr jim hardly ever went there without meeting robin coming or going this did not make jim any the more amiable the accident to stephen caused great excitement in the country bridge came over to see the squire and to interview dr jim but nothing came of his talk orsocalled vigilance the police both at southberry and beorminster failed to find any trace of frisco although the railway stations were watched carefully thanks to herricks prompt action it was impossible that the man could have left the district without the knowledge of the police yet he was not even seen bridge went to heathcroft but failed to learn that anyone resembling the exsailor had boarded a train at that station to all appearances frisco had not been in the neighbourhood yet if frisco was not the culprit who was herrick knew that joyce had been at biffstead on the evening of the assault according to the evidence of corn don manuel had been at the rectory till midnight as the assault on stephen took place shortly after eleven both these men must be held guiltless stephen himself could give no help he had left the biffs at a quarter to eleven with the intention of coming straight back to the pines then as the night was fine he thought he would go and have a look at the vault he went into the churchyard and after seeing the new vault went on to the old one while looking at it he received a blow at the back of his head and remembered no more until he found himself in bed with herrick bending over him he had heard no footsteps behind him the blow had been struck in the most unexpected manner and he had been taken completely by surprise all this puzzled herrick greatly however he determined to wait for another week to hear what bess had to say she might tell him something tangible likely to lead to an explanation of these mysteries but even if she did not dr jim made up his mind to move in the matter he would first have a talk with robin and learn if he had anything to do with the death he would have to explain away the evidence of the oldfashioned pistol being in his possession it might not have been the weapon used on the other hand herrick felt convinced in his own mind that it was to unravel the puzzle therefore robin was the man he intended to begin with he was assisted to make a start by the folly of joyce himself and this incidentally brought about the confession of bess one afternoon towards the end of the week herrick went to biffstead ida was at the pines with stephen and bess was alone hearing this herrick volunteered to fetch her and started off as he approached the house he heard the voice of the girl raised in anger she appeared at the french window of the drawingroom which looked out on the front of the house and seemed in a state of alarm the moment she saw him she passed rapidly through the window and caught him by the arm at the same moment robin greatly excited appeared at the window come back come back miss bess i did not mean it he said what is the matter asked dr jim astonished come inside panted bess that man i want you to thrash him oh the coward dr jim took bess by the arm and drew her into the room robin winced and shrank aside as the doctor entered bess had evidently been typing at her worktable for it was drawn near the window and some manuscript lay open on the table before this stood a chair and near it was another chair in which to all appearances robin joyce had been seated now then said herrick when he had placed the girl in her chair what does this mean nothing said robin very pale but trying to speak calmly only that i asked miss endicotte to be my wife and she refused quite right flashed out herrick angrily what right have you to ask her to be your wife before robin could answer not that he showed any inclination to do so bess started to her feet yes she said indignantly he did ask me to be his wife and because i refused to marry him he threatened me threatened you herrick turned on joyce with a dangerous look no no implored robin very white forget what i said i did not mean any harm i shall go away herrick seized him by the wrist you will do nothing of the sort he said quietly you must wait until i have heard all about this robin winced again and looked cowed his lips were dry his face was pale and he cast an imploring look upon bess the girl returned that look with one of defiance and addressed herself to herrick do you know what that little coward has accused me of she cried fiercely he said that i murdered colonel carr dr jim laughed the accusation was so absurd that he could not help laughing of course the man is mad he said briefly i did not say that you had murdered colonel carr cried robin i only said that you were near the house at the time of the murder ah cried herrick turning on the little wretch and how do you know that mr joyce come out with it he said he saw me put in bess i did see you said robin making a clean breast of it you were near the house and for all i know so you did come to saxham on that night interrupted herrick oh you liar you went to see frith and frith you slept at the hull hotel did you and all the time you were down here i believe you killed colonel carr yourself i swear i did not shrieked robin she did if anyone dont you dare to say that again cried bess you are telling a lie were you not on the lawn in front of the house asked robin yes i was and i can account for my presence to dr herricknot to youlittle toad that you are cried the angry girl send him away she added turning to jim and ill tell you all go back to the carr arms said herrick to joyce sternly and wait for me there if you try to run away i shall have you arrested you cannot arrest me blustered robin looking desperately afraid i can i have evidence you know nothing about go robin seemed inclined to dispute the order but when herrick made a step in his direction he caught up his hat and fled through the window he will run away said bess let him try remarked herrick grimly i can have him arrested at once and i will insult you did hethe hound it was my own fault for being so kind to him cried bess excitedly as if i cared for him it was only because he was a writer that i let him come and see me so often but i shall not have anything more to do with him he sent me a manuscript i shall send it back where is it and she began to pull out the drawers in the writingtable dont get excited bess said jim using her christian name in his hurry i will put it alright but bess in a rage kept turning over the papers and scattering them on the floor in her search for the manuscript suddenly she tossed aside a pile of writingpaper in the lefthand drawer underneath was an old fashioned pistol she looked at it in astonishment where did that come from she asked in dismay taking it up herrick took it from her he recognised it at once it was the very pistol that manuel had shown him in joyces flat what does it mean asked bess quite amazed at the discovery it means that joyce is even more of a hound than i thought he was chapter xiv the confession of bess bess endicotte stared at herrick where he stood with a black look on his face and the clumsy weapon in his hand and ill see bridge about it he was saying the bullets still at the police office if it fits this he clicked his tongue against the roof of his mouth what cried bess finding her tongue and asking the question with a shiver is that the pistol with which here her voice died away in her throat it cant be she whispered herrick looked at her in his turn and slipped the pistol into his pocket i know what you are thinking about he said quietly but the pistol will do you no harm i have seen it before you are all right bess all right she echoed and drawing her brows together what do you mean why what should i mean but that joyce slipped this devilish piece of evidence into the table drawer just to accuse you of she bounded to her feet grasping the idea for the first time he did that did he she cried her head flung back her eyes angry oh she stamped what should be done to such a man and you can sit quietly there dr jim because i want to hear your story after this you must tell me all you know all you have heard as for joyce his mouth twisted leave him to me he will not get off easily i promise you to put the pistol there that i she broke off again and looked at him in a scared manner did he kill carr she asked that i cant sayyet to kill the man he must have had some strong motive i have yet to learn the motive strong or weak that would make joyce risk his neck he is careful of his neck too explained dr jim i have a mind to break it and why asked bess roundeyed she had never seen the goodtempered doctor in such a rage i wonder you cant guess remarked herrick cooling down with a gasp bess drew back their eyes met a sudden crimson flushed her face and she turned it away yes said herrick taking her hand and i only knew it myself a moment ago what are you talking about cried the girl snatching her hand away i am talking of you and myself ida said that it would come all of a sudden and she was right here it is and i have been looking in the wrong place for it these many months bess knew perfectly well what he meant but she made a show of not understanding i think we are talking nonsense she said there is much to be done if what you say about the pistol is true yes said herrick again as you say there is much to be done the other thing can stand over for a time you know well enough but it suits you to hold me at arms length womans way i suppose well he brisked up and his voice took a sharper tone let us get to business this rascal tried to inculpate you in the crime he shall have the finest thrashing he ever had the pistol i can explain away i have seen it in his house and i can guess that he slipped it into that drawer so as to make his case against you the stronger he thought if he accused you and could back his accusation with evidence that you would never dare to refuse himthe mean hound indeed it would never have come to that said the girl proudly i am not the woman to be won by threats he did accuse me of the murder and i defied him to do his worst i suppose if you had not come he would have shown me the pistol next the mean scoundrel she clenched her fist beat him well dr jim what a bloodthirsty person it is laughed jim but upon my word you know this is the strangest of wooings never mind that said bess drawing back we can talk later of such things but my position is anything but a pleasant one that little man will make trouble if he does not his mexican friend will they are a proper pair of scamps however i am equal to both of them leave joyce to me i know all about him but about yourself nothing joycei take itaccuses you of being near the pines on the night of the murder and at the hour said bess quickly this is what i have been trying to make up my mind to tell you all the week the necessity of doing so has come earlier than i expected but i shall explain myself now she came to a stop and looked at him questioningly of course you know i had nothing to do with the crime itself i am sure of that said herrick heartily but i think you know who did it come now confess you are mistaken cried bess all i know is that frisco is innocent have you proof of this the proof of my own eyes i saw him at the door of the house when the shots were being fired you heard the shots three of them the fourth i did not hear humph about what hour was this between nine and ten and what were you doing out at that hour bess paused i had better tell you all from the beginning she said slowly then you can judge for yourself i have told no one as yet it was too terrible and she hesitated i had other reasons for silence yet if frisco had been tried for his life i should have come forward in spite of all he is perfectly innocent i can prove it strange muttered herrick taking a seat well let us hear what about that horrid joyce ill attend to him later he will stay at the inn until i come that is if he is really innocent of course if he tries to bolt i shall know he is guilty and have him arrested oh joyce knows me and will act accordingly never mind him go on with your story it is not much of a story said bess you know the habit that sidney has of going to the pine wood to see the fairies yes he told me all about that well on the night of the murder he went away as usual it came on to rain and ida was in a great state she thought he would catch his death of coldhe is so delicate you know i said i would go and look for him and about nine oclock i set out i knew he would be in the pine woods it was raining and i wrapped a long cloak about me he was not in the wood although i searched everywhere with a lantern then i came out of the wood by mistake right on to the colonels lawn the light was burning in the tower and the whole of the house was illuminated just as i saw it muttered herrick yes i crossed the lawn to come home when i heard three shots fired one after the other in the tower i heard them plainly i turned with a start but the colonel had done so many queer things that i thought he was only shooting to amuse himself it never struck you that it was murder no if the colonel had not been so eccentric i might have suspected but nothing ever surprised me in that house i waited for a moment there were no more shots i looked towards the house and there i saw frisco standing in the doorway i saw him quite plainly that was some time after hearing the shots indeed no it was immediately after the first shot when the other two were fired i saw him there i thought that he might see me and as i did not want colonel carr to think i had been spying round his house at so late an hour i ran home as fast as i could sidney had arrived before me i said nothing about the shots and went to bed when i heard how you had discovered the body i knew that i had heard the shots fired by the murderer but i knew also that when frisco was missing he was not guilty so that was why i defended him i could not speak plainer could i well i see no reason why you should not have told the story you tell me now if frisco had been arrested i should have but you know here bess looked down can you not understand dr jim the people round about here are sad scandalmongers because i called on colonel carr to get an article as i told you people said that i was fast the brutes cried herrick firing up well then you can understand that if it had become known that i was near colonel carrs house so late at night there would have been more talk i really dont know what they would have said so i said nothing not even to ida of course i could have told them that i went out to get sidneybut bess shrugged her shoulders you know how spiteful people are no after consideration i thought it best to hold my tongue but you might have told me said herrick i was afraid to faltered bess you foolish child as though i should not have understood well she said with a sigh of relief i am glad i have told you now so am i as it has brought joyce to the ropes end how did he say he saw you on that night he was in the pine wood on the verge of the lawn and for what reason he did not tell me nor did i ask him you see said bess i was so angry that he should accuse me of shooting the colonel that i gave him no time to explain then you came andyou know the rest humph well joyce shall explain to me his reasons for coming to saxham of course i knew that he was here on that night you knew said miss endicotte much astonished how could you know the information came to me by accident more or less replied herrick and forthwith he explained how stephens remark as to robins income had led him to examine into the doings of the little man on that night and continued the doctor i went to heathcroft station there i learned that a little man muffled up in a great coat he had the excuse of the rain but it really was a disguise had arrived at heathcroft by the seven oclock train from london but heathcroft is six miles from this place so joyce knew therefore he was thoughtful enough to bring his bicycle with him oh he came here right enoughto see the colonel i suppose to murder him i really cant be sure of that bess you see carr for some reason we do not know allowed mrs joyce an income of five hundred a year robin wanted this to be continued to him the solicitors told him that carr refused it therefore i can only think that he came down to try and persuade carr to be more generous but added herrick with emphasis i hardly think that for such a reason joyce would commit a murder he hasnt the pluck that may be replied bess thoughtfully but it seems to me that if he did not he took a great deal of unnecessary trouble to conceal his movements from you besides which he led you directly to the house where he knewat all events i think sothat the body would be found it is certainly strange and looks as though his movements had been premeditated it was joyce who selected the country for the walking tour yet so far as i know he was never in these parts before and i am bound to say that it was i who led the way to the pines on that night i daresay he was too clever to take the initiative but he no doubt made suggestions yes he did that well i must get the truth out of the man himself he must account to me for the possession of that pistol and for his being in the pine wood on the night of the murder i wonder he gave himself away like he did bess curled her lip he did not intend it she said he thought that if he frightened me i would consent to marry him to save my own skin and then hold my tongue about his presence at saxham oh all his calculations were carefully made you may be sure dr jim it was only because he mistook my character that they were upset herrick nodded there is don manuel of course he said the mexican what about him well i wonder if he has anything to do with this it is strange that he should be so friendly with joyce or with corn too for the matter of that joyce said that a mutual friend of his and mine introduced him to santiago i took the trouble to write to that frienda man called johnstone and i learned that johnstone had never seen or heard of don manuel nor had the mexican ever been to the apollo club where according to robin the introduction took place where they met and why they met i have yet to find out luckily i have now enough evidence to force my dear friend joyce to be candid and i shall not spare him said herrick with a grim smile he is a liar and a scoundrel i never was so mistaken in a man before i prided myself upon reading character it seems that i am not so clever as i thought no doubt there is something between them since they are so intimate was the reply of miss endicotte but whether it has to do with the murder i do not know did seor santiago know colonel carr in south america and hated him like poison it seems they both went on a treasurehunting expedition in peru treasurehunting peru ah i remember that was the expedition frisco used to talk about was frisco with the colonel there yes he let drop hints that he and the colonel had found treasure in peru and that they had lost themselves of course i do not know the whole story but from what frisco said i know it was in that way colonel carr obtained his wealth what a liar that manuel is said herrick he denied that he had ever seen frisco according to manuel only he and carr were on the expedition santiago fell ill and carr left him amongst the indians he was held in captivity for two years and when he got back to civilisation carr had vanished with the treasure hei am speaking of the mexicanarrived in england six months agoin search of colonel carr no doubt i wonder if he killed him he might have and yet i do not know revenge is a poor thing when no substantial benefit is to be derived santiago wants wealth he would have managed the affair in a different way but remember the warnings three of them yes that is the kind of way santiago would go to work try and frighten carr into parting with a substantial amount but i do not think that he would kill the goose with the golden eggsat all events until he was in possession of some of the eggs no i cant think the mexican is guilty then joyce must have done it perhaps but he is such a coward if not either of those two who is it asked bess not frisco herrick looked at her i am not so sure he said coolly you see the alibi you provide for frisco does not touch the subject you saw the man at the door when three shots were fired well if you remember at the inquest it was provedas much as it could be provedthat those three shots were fired at a dead body therefore when you heard them the man was already dead why should frisco not have done it and then come down leaving his accomplice to do what he liked i see what you mean said bess it was the bullet that killed the colonelthe old fashioned bullet fired from this if i am not mistaken went on herrick producing the pistol you cant be sure of that and admitting that it is so how did the pistol come into possession of joyce if frisco used it i am in the dark there said herrick vexedly i must get the truth out of joyce time to see him now and he glanced at his watch as to the pistol ill see bridge and find out if the bullet fits bess held out her hand let me do that she said while you are watching joyce and the mexican i can attend to that matter do you think you will be able hesitated herrick i am certain i can besides i want to have some part in the discovery of the truth the doctor handed her the pistol he knew that she was a clever girl and would not undertake a thing unless she could execute it thoroughly you and i can do the detective business together he said i will look after joyce and santiago and frisco if i can find him your part will be to trace the pistol and to see if the bullet fits you can manage bridge easily replied bess putting the pistol away he is so conceited that a little flattery goes a long way with him dont let him meddle in this matter he will only spoil it i know what to do leave it to me dr jim took up his hat to go suddenly he recollected a point he had not yet discussed and sat down again about pentland corn said he what do you think of him bess he is a good man she replied promptly but he is weak i am sure there is nothing wrong about him yet why should he make such a friend of santiago i do not know shall i ask him he would not tell you the truth if you did he has his own secrets bess nodded but i do not believe they are bad secrets she said the rector is a man with a pasta sad past did you know he was a soldier before he became a parson no replied dr jim and yet i always thought he had a martial air about him why did he leave the army he said he had a call no added bess hastily seeing the doctors lip curl i do not think he is a hypocrite he is most devout humph i do not believe much in that emotional religion said jim with a shake of his head a call had he and left the army for that i should like to hear a more feasible story he was a friend of colonel carrs yes he was the only person the colonel saw and he used to go very often to the pines but i do not think he did colonel carr much good on the contrary it is probable that the colonel did a weak man like that a good deal of harm herrick stopped then said suddenly he knows something about this murder what makes you think so said bess startled well he did not come to the inquest and seeing that he was the parson of the parish and a great friend of the dead man i think that strange myself also when i met him in the morning after the murder he talked nonsense sheer nonsense and was in a sort of hysterical condition that might have been because of the shock replied bess thoughtfully i know one thing at least about mr corn he will not look upon a corpse why not i dont know nor does anyone else the parishioners are sometimes annoyed because he will not come and see their dead mr corn will pray with a dying person but he will not look on a dead one humph and he was a soldier said herrick i must look into this you have quite enough to do at present i think i will see to the pistol and you can go now to joyce then we can meet and compare notes and bess we understand one another miss endicotte flushed i wish you would not talk nonsense she cried there are other and more important things to think of dr jim would have protested but she reentered the house and left him to his own thoughts these were pleasant in spite of the discovery of robins iniquities jim now saw that he had been in love with bess without knowing it the shock of joyces wooing had brought about the discovery and what a fool i have been not to see it before said dr jim no wonder they say love is blind and he whistled lightheartedly chapter xv robin joyce explains himself whether it was the charm of the girls society based upon his new discovery or the interest of the conversation from a detectives point of view that detained herrick with her for over two hours it is impossible to say probably dr jim could not have given a satisfactory answer himself but as he hurried along the road to the carr arms he acknowledged that he had been dilatory for in two hours robin could have got away from saxham but dr jim did not think he would go robin was a child in many ways and was not quick in making plans besides he would be bewildered by the sudden revelation of his rascality and for the moment he would not be able to think of his own safety or at least if he did think he would be unable to make any plans alsoand of this herrick was certainhe had very little money to come and go on no thought the doctor as he swung into the village green robin knows better than to give me the slip he would be afraid that i would show him no mercy when i caught him up probably he will make out some story and implore me for the sake of our past friendship to be silent if he tells me the whole truth and if he did not actually kill carr i mightbut then he insulted bess and tried to get her into danger the doctor clenched his fist and frowned ill give him a thrashing at all events there is a bad time coming for you robin my man the prognostications of dr jim proved to be correct joyce had not attempted flight he was waiting in his sittingroom for the coming of the doctor and he looked horribly frightened herrick could have found it in his heart to be sorry for the wretched little creature with his white haggard face and staring eyes but he remembered what was at stake and made up his mind to be stern even to the verge of brutality for all he knew this treacherous little scoundrel might have hinted to the outside world that bess was involved in the murder of carr if he had done this herrick considered that nothing would be too bad for him it was in a very stern frame of mind that dr jim sat down opposite his former friend robin winced at the regard of those once kind eyes he felt like a rabbit in the presence of a boaconstrictor well said jim grimly eying the miserable wretch and what have you to say for yourself nothing returned robin sullenly i am afraid i shall not be satisfied with that joyce you will have to tell me the whole of your doings from first to last i have done nothing so very wrong jim one moment interposed herrick i think you had better call me by my last name we are not friends now you know will i call you dr herrick said robin with a small sneer i think it might be bettersir drawled herrick and the contempt in his tone made the selfsatisfied joyce wince if i had done anything wrong i should not have waited to see you thats a lie replied the plainspoken jim you know me better than that had you bolted i should have had the police on your track before nightfall you know me as i said before your only chance is to make a clean breast of this damnable business what do you mean dont bandy words with me joyce it wont do you are in a cleft stick and no amount of wriggling will serve you if you want a lead here is one you told me at southberry that you went up up see frith and frith so i did oh lord cried herrick in a tone of disgust will you never be done with your petty falsehoods i know that you have not seen the solicitors for some monthscertainly not on the twentyfourth of july frith told me how you tried to get your mothers annuity transferred to yourself come now dont play the fool with me you did not sleep at the hull hotel how do you know that because i went there and i know also that you alighted from the seven train at heathcroft station and rode on your bicycle to saxhami dont know for what purpose unless it was to kill the colonel no no this time joyce was really afraid i did not kill him that remains to be proved what about that pistol you slipped into the drawer of bess endicottes writingtablenow you are about to lie again it wont doit wont do the truth you rat of a man dont call names muttered joyce weakly i beg your pardon i will not call you any more names let us conduct this conversation calmly but you have to tell me the whole truth or well said joyce defiantly and if i refuse what then i will hand you over to the beorminster police you have no evidence i have more than you think of you ass said herrick in a cold rage for the sake of our past friendship i have been sparing you all these weeks i got you down here in the hope that you would be man enough to come forward and confess your follies i do not say crimes for you have not pluck enough to commit the smallest but you kept your own counsel and thought you were pulling wool over my eyes i have seen through all these weeks and now you insult the woman i love and robin jumped up in a childish rage you dont love heryou wont marry her he panted i wont have it sit down commanded herrick sternly you have nothing to say in the matter leave miss endicottes name out of it we have had enough of this nonsense confess what you have done i wont joyce set his teeth very good then i shall send for the police you dare not ah you think so herrick rose and walked towards the bell joyce anticipated him and stood in his path with flashing eyes herrick laughed are you about to measure your strength against mine he said before he could speak further the little man had flung himself at his throat like a wild beast strong as herrick was the abnormal nerve force of joyce made him no mean antagonist but the contest was unequal and at last herrick lifted joyce above his head shook him as a terrier does a rat and pitched him headlong into a chair where the creature helpless and overborne sat gnashing his teeth and glaring for the moment herrick thought he was mad have you had enough asked the doctor recovering his breath if not i am quite willing to administer the thrashing you so richly deserve joyce still glared and stamped in impotent rage then he suddenly burst into tears and hid his face in his hands you great brute he wailed you might spare me spare you echoed herrick contemptuously and did you think of sparing that poor girl whom you were trying to blackmail into marriage you may thank your stars joyce that you have to deal with a man who knows you as i do if it had been another man they would have left you half dead on the floor you shall have justice from me never fear robin still continued to sob and huddled up in the big chair looked scarcely as large as a child i feel illillhorribly ill youll feel much worse before ive done with you said the relentless herrick sit up and talk rationally all this wont do with me you have tried all your tricks they are of no avail here are pen ink and paper i intend to take down all you say and you will sign the statement ill see you to the devil first cried joyce sitting up tearstained and dishevelled but with an evil look in his eyes you will do exactly as you are bid replied herrick selecting a pen now begin and tell no lies i have information of which you know nothing and if i catch you trippingwell you know what to expect joyce saw that he was helpless he had tried defiance force tears and was now at the end of his resources herrick pitilessly held to his point seeing that there was no help for it the little scamp dried his eyes arranged his coat and hardened himself into a reasonable frame of mind you have the whip hand he said sullenly so i must give in i think that is very wise of you after all you might have known that such playacting would not impose upon me now you are to tell me all you did at saxham on that night and why you came down i shall probably ask you a few questions to which i shall require truthful answers and remember what i said i know more about your doings than you give me credit for i can tell if you speak the truth or not now go on dr jim squared his elbows and settled himself to write joyce cast one look at the door as though he meditated flight but he knew that such a dash for liberty would result in his incarceration in prison so he abandoned it and sullenly began to talk i did come down to saxham on the twentyfourth he confessed i thought so and your story of seeing frith and frith was a lie yes i did not want you to know not only that but you wished to make use of me i was to prove your alibi eh you chose this country for our walking tour on purpose i planned the whole thing said joyce shamelessly and with something of pleasure in his own cleverness you think yourself clever herrick but i whom you have always despised have made a tool of you up to a point you have no doubt but there is a proverb about playing with edged tools you seem to have forgotten as to your saying that i despise you i never did so until i found outnever mind howthat you had told me a lie about going to london from southberry it was my own business and i was to be your tool as you have just said go on joyce thought for a moment as i have done nothing so very wrong he said there is no reason why i should not tell you everything from the beginning i suppose you will admit that no reason at all go on very good well then until my mother died i had no idea of her positionnor added joyce have i any very clear idea now she left a paper behind her which explained much but not all i will show it to you when you come up to london thank you i will remind you of that promise robin scowled and continued my mother said that between a certain colonel carr and herself there existed a business arrangement that she should receive five hundred a year for her life the arrangement was made by my dead father for services rendered to colonel carr what were those services that is one of the things i do not know the paper said nothing about them the five hundred a year was to be paid to my mother and when she died it was to stop so you see that in place of having an income as i thought i was left a pauper my mother had saved some moneyabout three hundred pounds i am living on that now i was in despair and i went to the solicitors who pay the annuity to ask if colonel carr would continue it they wrote to the colonel and he refused i know that said herrick smoothly frith told me you seem to have meddled a good deal in my business sneered joyce well i was again in despair as i saw nothing before me but a life of hard work i read over the paper again my mother said in it that carr was a dangerous man but that he had enemies who threatened to kill him she advised me to see him but to take all precautions against my visit being known to anyone why asked dr jim i see no reason nor did i responded robin with a shrug he was now quite himself again and seemed to enjoy the telling of the story she hinted however that if colonel carr ever died by violenceand she was sure he wouldi might be accused of the crime if i went to see him she said that it was dangerous to be in his company for that reason it seems to me a very ridiculous reason i thought it was all the same as she knew more about the matter than i did i thought it best to adopt her suggestion i wished to see carr and ask him to continue the annuity but i wished to see him secretly so that if he was murderedas my mother hintedi should not be dragged into the matter for that reason i made the plans you blame and were a fool to do so said dr jim vigorously why in the name of heaven did you not tell me all this i should have come and seen carr with you openly i should not have been afraid of being implicated in a crime though the man were murdered half a dozen times over the secret means you took to avert suspicion falling on you have only resulted in your being suspectedat least by me i thought you did not suspect me said joyce snappishly not of the crime for i know what a coward you are but you know something about it still if the police knew all i do you would find yourself in queer street again i say that in your desire to avert suspicion from yourself you have brought it upon your head however i think the reason given in the paper you speak of ridiculous go on what of your plans how were they carried out i first looked up a map of the country to see where carr lived then as you had proposed a walking tour i induced you to take the route which ran right across carrs place i thought if anything occurred you could prove that i was with you but did you expect the man to be murdered while we were on our tour i did not know what might happen as it was i knew the man was dead when i rejoined you at southberry but my idea was to see him and then to pass afterwards with you through the village when i set out on the walking tour i never thought he would be murdered it was to say the least strange that carr should meet with his death at so critical a moment to you said herrick doubtfully he had lived safely for ten years it was chance i suppose at all events i did not kill him as you seem to suppose i simply wished to see him about the annuity when i left you at southberry and went to london on the plea of seeing frith and frith i left my bag at the hull hotel to provide a second alibi i intended to get down and see carr then be back and sleep at the hull hotel on that night it was the murder that threw me out herrick laughed and it was the murder against which you were taking all these precautions how ironical well i went to my flat and got my bicycle and i wrapped myself up in my greatcoat then i went down to saxham by the heathcroft line i alighted there at seven oclock had something to eat at the railway bar and then rode on my bicycle to saxham i found the house from the map and waited in the pine woods before i could make up my mind to go in and seek for an interview at what time did you hide in the pine woods between eight and nine oclock while there i heard a single shot it frightened me but i did not think that it was murder no said robin to himself with a shiver i did not think it was murder that would be the death shot said herrick seeing that miss bess heard the other three i heard them also but that was after nine and all this time you remained near the house no i went on to the other side of the pine wood keeping the tower in sight i saw a girl with a lantern searching the wood she passed near where i lay and i saw her plainly that is how i recognised her and why did you accuse her i thought she might have had something to do with the crime said joyce sullenly you must confess it was queer to see a girl in the woods at that hour if she was innocent why should she have been about the house so late dont you dare to hint that she is not innocent cried herrick violently she went to look for her brother sidney she heard the shots too did you see frisco at the door of the house no it was some time after i lost sight of miss bess that i heard the shots i thought she might have fired them i waited till ten oclock and then thought i would go and see what was the matter i walked through the wood and entered the house it was all alight and quite deserted just as we found it as i had heard the shots in the tower i climbed up at the top i saw what you and i sawthe dead body of the colonel he was quite dead i was afraid for the very thing i dreaded had come to pass i saw how wise was my mothers advice and being afraid lest someone should come and i should be arrested for the crime i went away i got my bicycle which i had left in the pine wood and rode back to heathcroft i found the last train gone so i could not get back to the hull hotel i feared to sleep in any inn lest the police when the crime was discovered should make search for strangers i passed the night in a wood then rode on at dawn to a station beyond heathcroft where i got a cup of coffee at the bar of the station then i took the train back to london went to the hull hotel and said that i had passed the night with a friend afterwards i caught the southberry train and rejoined you that is all a very pretty story remarked herrick grimly then you were anxious to push on across the moor that we might find the body together not exactly i thought it would be already found when we arrived however when i saw the house blazing i knew that nothing had been disturbed we went in andyou know i know that you took a fit of hysteria said herrick i thought it was fatigue but now i understand it was because you were playing a part this is all very well how do i know you did not kill the man i did not i swear i did not cried joyce with a shiver what about that pistol that has nothing to do with the murder was it not the weapon that was used not that i know of where did you get it joyce hesitated and wriggled i do not see why you should ask me dont you indeed said herrick grimly i see a very good reason carr was shot through the heart with a bullet that might very well fit that ancient weapon how do you know that i put it into the drawer at the grange are you going to lie about that it wont do joyce i saw that pistol at your flatin your tobacco cabinet joyce turned white he had been quite prepared to lie but this information showed him how futile that would be how did you find it in there he asked oh i wasnt poking and prying manuel hunting for cigarettes showed it to me he dropped across it by accident joyce sprang to his feet the liar oh the liar he cried manuel why he knew it was in the cabinet and he placed it there eh i never said so muttered robin passing his tongue over his dry lips oh but i can see it it your face evidently manuel played upon you the same trick you intended to play upon bess a nice pair upon my soul herrick paused for a moment what has manuel to do with this nothing that i know of retorted joyce sullenly he brought me the pistol but refused to say where he got it he knows something of this matter i think i am very certain he does however ill speak to him where is he he went over to beorminster this afternoon very good ill see him when he comes back by the way you told me a lie about him johnstone did not introduce you at the apollo club joyce shrugged his shoulders since you know so much you might as well know more he said coolly i met manuel at the pimlico gambling club we played together and became friends oddly enough he knew all about carr that drew us together we talked a good deal about the business and i told him what i told you but he is a scoundrel said joyce gritting his teeth he wants to make out that i shot carr with that pistol and showed it to you in my flat to inculpate me which was what you proposed to do with that girl i did said robin sullenly i wanted to marry her and i made my plans so that she should not dare to refuse herrick rose to his feet joyce said he calmly i had intended to give you a thrashing but you are such a miserable wretch that if i manhandled you i should probably kill you you can go free for me but you shall leave this place by the five oclock train from beorminster ill see to it myself i thought you would sneered joyce so i have packed my clothes and what are you going to do next keep an eye on you go back to your flat if you try to run ill have you arrested do not think because i send you to london that you will be beyond the reach of my arm you and manuel are plotting to get this money of stephen marsh i am not whatever santiago may be doing he got everything out of me and told me nothing in return save that he knew carr and hated him i do not know anything i dont believe that the pistol is the one used in the murder santiago probably read about an oldfashioned weapon being used and knowing that i was down here on the night put that pistol yes yes i see all that you see what a scoundrel you have taken up with upon my word joyce you had better have stuck to me it is too late now said robin with something of a sob youll never trust me again never replied herrick calmly i have not yet got to the bottom of this business but i believe you are the tool rather than the accomplice of this mexican however i will deal with him you go to london and hold yourself in readiness for my orders ill be even with santiago yet for his treachery said robin rising that you can settle between yourselves hullo dont go yet sign this paper i have written down all you told me i wont sign you will and at once i will be the witness if you dont i will not protect you in any way you wont let me get into trouble said joyce taking the pen not if what you have told me is true sign so joyce signed and herrick witnessed the document the doctor placed it in his pocket and then ordered a trap from napper after joyce had paid his bill the doctor drove him to beorminster the five oclock train was on the point of departure but he just managed to catch it as he flung himself into a carriage he held out his hand to herrick no replied jim coldly we have done with all that and no tricks or youll get the worst of it ill go straight to my flat said joyce sulkily and as the train steamed out of the station he cursed his former friend he would have cursed him still more if he had seen what he did next the doctor went to the telegraph office and wrote out a wire describing joyces face clothes figure and all also set down the train by which he would arrive at paddington this he sent to a firm of private detectives with whom he had already done business there said herrick with a grim smile when the wire was despatched joyce will be watched from the moment he gets to town any tricks and the doctor laughed apparently he did not yet trust the little man in spite of his confession chapter xvi bess the detective in this way saxham was purged of one undesirable person herrick was pleased that he had acted with such promptitude bess would no longer be vexed by the odious attentions of the little scamp who had tormented her dr jim smiled to think how much of the jealous rival there was about his dealings with his quondam friend he now recognised that bess was the woman he desired for his wife nor did he think she would refuse to become mrs herrick when he could give her a home worthy of her had she disliked his attentions she would not have permitted even the strange hours wooing which was all they had of love since jim had found his heart he laughed at the recollection to talk of love between intervals of detective analysis he thought as he walked back to saxham having sent on nappers cart by the groom is a strange way of wooing ones wife and the last kind i expected to indulge in but bess enjoyed it i fancy i must recompense myself in a more leisurely way when this business is at an end on arriving at saxham the doctor called in at the carr arms to see don manuel he wanted to hear from the man himself if he had really given the pistol to joyce and if so how it had come into his possession it might be that he had bought it in order to incriminate robinalthough at present herrick could see no very good reason for such incriminationon the other hand the pistol might be the veritable weapon used to shoot carr but that could be proved only by the test of the bullet and he would have to wait until bess saw bridge about that in some way herrick felt convinced that santiago was connected with the crime he had known and hated carr he was far too intimate with joyce for mere friendship and he showed too great a desire to remain in the parish that he should have in some way gained possession of the real pistol was not unlikely and it might be that he used it himself said dr jim as he entered the inn although i should think he would have used a more modern weapon for choice on speaking to napper about the mexican a shock awaited him the landlord expressed the broadest surprise that mr joyce had not told dr herrick of santiagos departure the mexican had gone to london by an early train herrick swore beneath his breath feeling that he had been outwitted when mr joyce came back here this afternoon did he see don manuel aye sir that he did the foreigner was waiting for him and they talked for an hour after that don manuel came down with his trunkhe had but one doctor and drove in to catch an earlier train to beorminster asked herrick no sir to heathcroft he paid his bill alright though but i was astonished mr joyce left us so suddenly there is nothing wrong i hope by no means replied herrick with a carelessness he was far from feeling i believe don manuel had to go up on business and asked mr joyce to join him later will they be coming here again sir asked napper and on receiving a reply in the negative expressed his regret they didnt pay much but they was sure said the worthy landlord did you hear seor santiago say where he was going asked herrick but this the landlord could not tell him dr jim walked away annoyed that he had been taken in he felt that robin had been tutored to play his part by the cleverer scoundrel no doubt robin had told the mexican of his intrusion into the case and santiago had taken alarm he knew well enough that dr jim would recognise the pistol and that he would force robin to say where he had obtained it evidently don manuel thought it would be better for him to disappear than to face an examination yet he could have told joyce to make up some story about the pistol so that he might not be brought into it the whole business was part of the conspiracy don manuel was in it robin also and herrick felt that the firm of joyce and santiago had been one too many for him all the same he remembered that he had set a watch on joyce if the scamp tried to hide or went to any place to meet manuel he would be followed i shall go up to town tomorrow said herrick on his way to the pines wherever joyce has gone there manuel will be i shall run both to earth and learn what all this means by questioning them in each others company they wont trick me a second time well i have done enough detective work for the day ill think of something else stephen was now so far on the road to recovery that he was able to leave his room he had seen little of jim lately but he did not miss him thanks to the constant attendance of ida marshcarr was as devoted a friend as ever to herrick he still believed him the cleverest and best of men but now his whole heart was filled with the image of ida the two were constantly together and the girl had had no small share in nursing back her promised husband to health the wound in the head had mended and the blow had left no effect behind it beyond an occasional headache stephen never gave his assailant a thought he quite forgot carrs tragic death and all the strange circumstances which had brought about his change of fortune at times he even ceased to remember his stepmother much as he had loved her all his thoughts were for ida and with her he passed hours planning their future they never talked of the past and noticing this herrick forebore to tell his friend that he was still working to discover the murderer of colonel carr and striving to baffle a possible conspiracy that had for its aim the loss to stephen not only of the carr fortune but possibly also of his life jim felt quite competent to deal with the matter himself and did not think it necessary to spoil marshcarrs lovemaking with such commonplace things therefore he remained in ignorance of herricks doings how late you are said stephen who was already dressed for dinner i have been anxiously expecting you this last hour i had to go into beorminster said herrick carelessly joyce has been called up to town and i went to see the last of him i am glad he has gone stephen said gravely i dont like him i think he is false as for the mexican he shrugged his shoulders herrick who was pouring himself a glass of sherry as an appetizer turned with a laugh the mexican is a bad lot sure enough he said as to joyce he is more of a fool than a knave i forgot that he was your friend you do quite right to use the past tense steve he was my friend but he is so no longer herrick laughed again and sipped his sherry i have taken you for a change you know well that i will never fail you said stephen warmly no i suppose we shall remain good friends till you marry then you will forget me and think only of your wife you know better than that jim besides ida is fond of you i know i was fond of ida too at one timethat was before she was engaged to you but i have not played you false steve you are telling me old news replied marshcarr smiling i saw that you were in love with ida no i was never in love i thought i was but my love was a snare and a delusion but you thought so did you were you not jealous not at all i knew that ida was mine and i trusted heryou too wonderful man said herrick looking into the fire well you did right to trust us both we are merely friends now indeed i know we never were anything else i was blind but she was not however i am glad that you two are engaged you will be happy and when am i to congratulate you at this very minute if you like is it bess you are talking of stephen sat up on the sofa looking astonished yes he said ida saw that she was in love with you ida is a clever woman she prophesied my love would come suddenly bess has not yet formally consented to be my wife but i think it will be all right i am more than delighted we shall be brothersinlaw and you will always stay here jim living on you my dear fellow no i shall start practice again in town when i have got together sufficient money then when i am doing fairly well bess shall come to me and supplement my income by writing novels in the intervals of looking after the house herrick you must not go away you promised until you were married but be of good cheer steve i wont leave you until everything is right dr jim said these last words with a significance which was lost on his listener i thought that your friend joyce oh he never had a chance i was a fool to let him hang after bess however i found out today what she was to me so it is all right now bess and ida are coming over this evening with frank all the better i can make my proposal in due form by the way steve i am going up town tomorrow if you can spare me certainly but it is not to make arrangements to leave me is it i should think not i shall never go till you tell me steve no i am going to see about some business of my own well i must dress i hope you have a good dinner for me i am very hungry you think of nothing but eating said stephen with a laugh the dinner gave every satisfaction even to herrick who was somewhat fastidious but ida had seen that a good cook was engaged and the two men had nothing to complain of dinner over herrick supported stephen into the library and placed him on the sofa then he sat beside him and they smoked over their coffee and cognac but you must go to bed at half past ten said herrick sternly what a tyrant you are jim hark there are the girls they came in looking charming and in the best of spirits it needed but a glance for dr jim to see that bess had said nothing about joyce to her brother or sister what a wise little woman she was when ida and frank had seated themselves beside stephen jim drew her into a remote corner of the room you said nothing about our adventure of today he whispered no she replied in the same tone i thought it best not to and mr joyce you will not be troubled with him again he has gone to town i do not think he will come back santiago has gone also what about his threat against me that is alright i have his confession in my pocket did he kill colonel carr no i have not yet solved that problem but do not let us talk of these unpleasant things any more bess tomorrow you shall know all in the meantime make yourself agreeable to me and tell me how much you love me come now after this afternoon you cannot deny i neither deny nor affirm said bess her face one glow of scarletbut that might have been the fireyou were not in earnest today indeed i was cant you see that i love you with my whole heart and soul i never knew until today how much i did love you i thought it was ida faltered bess i thought so too for a period of madness but i know now that i was mistaken we are the best of friends as you can see but you have not replied to my question what do you want me to say that i am the dearest man in the world and that you have loved me for ever so long come now it is true said bess sinking her voice i have loved you i do love you and i am thankful to be your wife i am a poor doctor remember i love you for yourself not for any money you may have faith said herrick that is lucky for me come here behind this screenthere now oh dr jimnovery well jim without the doctor do not go on like this we are not alone will you come into another room teased jim certainly not jim what are you doing leading you into the world said herrick laughing bess laughed also and blushed when jim led her before the three astonished people who looked at them in amazement lady and gentlemen said dr jim do you know who this is bess i suppose said the stupid brother and more than that cried ida rising to take her sister in her arms oh bess darling i am so glad hurrah cried stephen and pinched franks arm that youth was still dense although the truth was staring him in the face he looked at the two girls almost weeping with pleasure in one anothers arms at the laughing faces of herrick and stephen still he did not understand not having yet experienced the love of woman you are stupid frank cried ida cant you see cant you see said herrick gripping franks arm what a blind brotherinlaw i shall have oh franks eyes opened wide are you to marry bess herrick nodded and stephen takes ida the engaged couple laughed well said frank that is two of them gone and who is to look after biffstead flo of course said stephen as if she could bess is the top tail and bottom of the house that she is cried ida hugging her sister and i am jealous of jim taking her away from us then she gave herrick a roguish glance was i not right she asked perfectly right he replied and drew bess down on the seat beside him ida went as by instinct to stephen only the miserable frank was left out in the cold and said so the quartette laughed heartlessly there was not a happier party in the whole three kingdoms than that seated before the fire in the house of wicked colonel carr if the shade of the old man had been present in the room he mustor rather it must have sighed enviously at the sight of such happiness not during his reign had such truth and honour and clean delight prevailed in the old house it was a merry evening memory of the golden age said jim the next morning dr herrick reentered the workaday world he walked over to biffstead and found bess just setting out for beorminster on her bicycle you can leave that he said after a kiss had been exchanged i will drive you over to beorminster in the cart i told the groom to put in the horse and bring it round here you are going to town asked bess yes on the track of those two scamps you are going to see bridge about that bullet yes i have the pistol in my pocket she replied showing it very good can you drive the cart back of course i can drive who ever heard of asking a country girl such a question you do not know my accomplishments jim i know that you are the dearest and sweetest and most sensible girl in the whole wide world but i say we wont take the groom in the first place i want you all to myself in the second i must tell you all that took place when i interviewed joyce yesterday bess needless to say thought this a capital plan so when the groom brought round the cart he was sent away he saw the pair drive towards the village and there was a broad grin on his face he knew very well what they were to one another in some mysterious way the news had got to the servants hall and had been well discussed that very morning the lovers drove into beorminster and talked in the most matter of fact way about the conspiracy their heads were so close together that one would have thought they were exchanging the tenderest confidences in place of that the detective fever was raging in both their breasts and they were like a couple of scotland yard officials then herrick took a last farewell promised to return in the course of a few days and caught the express when the train disappeared round the curve bess went back to the cart and drove it to some stables where she put it up afterwards she went into the lower part of beorminster where mr inspector bridge had his office he happened to be in and brightened up when he saw her bridge had a great opinion of the younger miss endicotte what good wind brings you here miss he asked ah said bess solemnly that requires some telling mr inspector it is about this pistol and she produced it from her pocket pistol echoed bridge puzzled ah it is the pistol of the carr case that is what i want to find out said miss endicotte who had her story all ready to tell and had discussed its details with dr jim during the drive i found this the other day in the pine wood near colonel carrs house it is a clumsy oldfashioned thing but i remembered what was said about the bullet being oldfashioned also now i want you to see if the bullet fits the muzzle of this hm said bridge with his most important air and looking down the muzzle so you found this pistol in the grassand near the house perhapsi say perhaps mind you miss bessthis might be the weapon we have been looking for so long is there a name on the butt no said bess promptly you only find that in novels there is not so much as a scratch on the handle an old weapon observed bridge wagging his head ponderously and irritating bess to a frenzy with his platitudes well we must see if the bulletha yes the bullet now where is it bridge went hunting over some shelves and then he took to excavating in drawersopened a safe dug under dusty piles of papers and suddenly produced bess never saw from where a small box in which something rattled when he opened this there were three conical bullets and one fat round one ah cried bess there it is try please try mr inspector all in good time miss said the aggravating bridge and dropped the bullet into the muzzle it disappeared and he nodded solemnly it is the pistol he said you have made a valuable discovery miss if there was only a name or initials on the handle he sighed bess was not attending to him she took the pistol and dropped out the bullet then rammed it home again and nodded in her turn there is no doubt of it she said this the pistol that shot colonel carr will you leave it with me miss asked bridge i might find out something likely to lead to the detection of the assassin bess laughed delightedly from that last phrase she knew that inspector bridge had been reading detective fiction of the worst she knew also that the pistol would afford no clue to the truth until it was in capable hands therefore as she thought it would be safer in the beorminster police office than in the untidy house of biffstead where everybody was always turning over everybody elses drawers she consented that bridge should take charge of it the inspector with an important air put away the pistol in his safe he was about to replace the box when he noticed that bess had the round bullet in her hand come miss give it back he said belongs to the crown that does a queer bullet murmured bess made in a mould here is the seam i do not believe it is lead it is too hard for lead have you a penknife mr inspector ah she seized one lying on the desk this will do i dont believe this is lead nonsense said bridge crossly all bullets are made of lead this is not cried bess who was scratching away vigorously see how hard it is and the scratches shine inspector bridge she said in a solemn tone i believe this is silver it cant be the inspector took it up and examined it in his turn what bess said was true the bullet was hard not soft as lead should be and moreover it was hard to scratch and the little scraping she had given it glittered in parts just like silver it might be murmured bridge there is a silversmith just round the corner said bess in great excitement do come and let him see it i want to know for certain that it is silver i do not know what good that will do miss bess if it is silver that will not help us to catch frisco any the sooner no but you cant think what discoveries you might make if you knew it was silver for certain i know how you can put things together and a piece of evidence like thisoh i am sure you could do a lot with it bridge in his own heart did not very well see what he could do but he was not proof against flattery as the artful bess well knew so he went round the corner with her to a convenient jewellers and offered him the bullet will you please to tell me what this is he said in his most official tone do not destroy it mr blinks or deform it in any way it is the property of the crown all the crown wants to know is the metal of which this is formed mr blinks was much impressed with this speech promising to be careful he took the bullet into the next roominto his workshop and there performed some trick of the trade when he returned he handed the bullet to bridge very little altered it is of silver mr bridge he said all of silver asked bridge while bess tried to suppress her excitement all of silver mr bridge it has been cast in a mould probably a cup or a silver plate has been melted down what is it mr inspector the property of the crown replied bridge solemnly and departed when in the office he locked up the bullet and looked at bess i really do not see how this discovery can help me he said think over it mr inspector you will be certain to hit upon some link but bess herself was as far away from the truth as the inspector as she drove back to saxham she wondered how it came about that the bullet which had killed carr was cast in silver and to this she could find no answer chapter xvii unexpected evidence the surprising discovery that the bullet was of silver elevated the crime from the commonplace to the romantic that an oldfashioned weapon should have been used in these days when firearms have reached such a pitch of perfection was remarkable enough but that the assassin should have reverted to the superstitions of the middle ages for his missile was almost beyond belief in spite of her quick brain bess could not come to any decision failing a discussion with dr jim she resolved to leave the vexed question at rest all the same she did not pause in her detective work having followed up one clue until it endedfor the time beingin nothing she hunted about for another so far she had made two discoveries the pistol which joyce declared he had received from don manuel was certainly the weapon with which the murder had been committed and the bullet was of silver but this knowledge resulted in nothing certainly it cast a strong suspicion on the mexican but that part of the puzzle bess felt she could safely leave to herrick so far as her particular business was concerned she could do no more until she heard her colleagues report pending this she began to work in a different direction it occurred to her that she had never questioned sidney about his doings in the pine wood on the night of the murder possibly he might be able to supply some clue to the mystery he was in the habit of watching the tower said bess to herself he said as much on that day when we had the picnic i wonder if he saw anything suspicious on that night then he might have seen that horrid little joyce or perhaps frisco ill see what he knows sidney was not an easy person to question his fantasies of thought had been laughed at so frequently the truth of his statements so often denied that he had grown reticent what he saw what he heard he kept to himself and not even his own family could get him to explain himself on occasions when they really desired information the boy mooned about in a dreamy state of mind saying little beyond the merest common places and for the most part lived in that world of fantasy which was anathemamaranatha to the people around him he was like a wild animal shy timid and intensely suspicious bess thought that he might be more open with her when he wasso to speakin his native wilds she therefore watched her opportunity and followed him to one of his favourite haunts in the pine wood where it fringed the moor here one afternoon she found him seated in a secluded glade beside one of those remarkable circles which the country people call fairy rings so steadily was he gazing at this in the halflight which filtered through the overhead boughs that he did not notice her approach to be sure she trod softly and used the same precaution as she would have done when approaching the haunt of some timid animal sidney had always been a puzzle to everyone but bess understood him better than most people besides she had discussed him frequently with santiago and was inclined to take the mexicans view of the boys peculiarities remembering the oftquoted saying of hamlet bess was less sceptical than those around her she could not see why sidney should not possess the power of seeingwhat in the generally accepted sense is called the unseen considering what the lad had foretold with regard to the death of mrs marsh and the accident to her stepson it was impossible to say that sidney was either a fool or a madman there was some reason for his fantasiessocalled and bess regarded him with a certain amount of awe she could not understand him but she granted that he was a rare spirit far removed from the commonplace mortal well thomas the rhymer said bess gaily when her shadow fell on the fairyring are you looking for the queen of elfland it was characteristic of sidney that he was never taken by surprise at the sound of her voice he neither started nor expressed any anger all he did was to raise his serious eyes to her face and observe quietly i knew you were coming bess dear she threw herself down beside him and nodded towards the fairyring did they tell you she asked in low tone and in all good faith no bess this is not the time for the little people to be abroad i was only looking at their dancingground have you seen them here often replied sidney with conviction small naked folk who dance and sing and play on queer instruments they know that i see them but they are not angry i believe you are a fairy yourself sidney no i have a soulwhat you call a souland the fairies have none they are only the creatures who attend to the works of nature her servants i can see them because here sidney broke off it is no use my telling you bess you would not understand bess quite admitted this she could not understand all the same she did not tell her brother that he was a fool as many people would have done she simply nodded and passed the subject by her errand was to find out what sidney had seen in the actual world after the manner of her sex she approached the matter by a sideissue sidney dear said she do you know that mr joyce has gone away to london no i did not replied sidney gravely but i am very glad he has gone a bad man bess and he would have done you harm how what do you mean sidney passed his hand across his face i cannot explain he said in a troubled voice you see bess bad people carry about with them a bad atmosphere that mexican was very wicked joyce not so bad both of them made me feel quite ill did you never see how i refused to sit beside them well that was because they gave me such pain not physical pain but a kind of uncomfortable feeling which i cant put into words in what an oldfashioned way you talk sidney said bess puzzled one would think you were a hundred i know more than i say corn did not teach me everything i know tell me sidney do you like mr corn i doin a way he is not bad but he is weak with good people he is good with bad people he is bad i am glad that don manuel has gone to town he was doing mr corn a lot of harm but if i told you what i know of these things you would only laugh at me no i would not sidney said his sister earnestly i am sure that you are so sensitive that you feel these influences you talk about sensitive echoed sidney yes i suppose that is what you would call it you have come here to ask me a question he said abruptly how do you know that she demanded then seeing him shrug his thin shoulders she admitted the truth of what he said i want to ask you who you saw in the pine wood on the night when colonel carr was killed sidney thought for a moment then raised his eyes towards the gap in the trees formerly blocked by the tower i saw a lot of red mist about the tower he said that was anger i saw too he shook his head impatiently it is not these things you wish to know bess i want to know who killed colonel carr i cant tell you bess if i knew i should tell but i dont on that night i came here looking for things said sidney with a sideglance to see if she were laughing and although i felt that there was a bad influence about the house i never went near it i kept away and wandered on to the moor that is why you missed me when you came to look for me i did not mind the rain but i saw your lantern and thought you would be anxious so i returned home then you came back yourself yes that is all true but tell me sidney did you see mr joyce in the wood or on the moor no i did not see him stephen was the only person i saw bess started violently stephen she said surely you must be mistaken no replied the boy indifferently why should i be mistaken you know i can see in the dark like a cat before i saw your lantern i had seen stephen on the lawn looking at the tower i do not know what time it was so dont ask me you are always so particular about time said sidney peevishly as though it mattered bess reflected it was strange that stephen should have been in the vicinity of the house on that night and yet have escaped her notice but she remembered that being intent upon looking for her brother that she had not even seen joyce although he was lurking in the bushes at her elbow true she had caught a glimpse of frisco but that was when she consciously looked at the door it was possible that sidney might have come across stephen did you speak to him she asked no why should i have spoken to him did he go into the house not that i saw bess he was looking up at the tower standing on the lawn by the trees i went away to the other side of the wood and out on to the moor that is all i know but sidney did you see frisco crossing the moor i did not when i saw your lantern i went home i wish you would stop asking me questions he cried irritably you make my head ache after this speech he relapsed into one of his silent fits and bess could not get him to speak knowing from experience that sidney was hopeless when in this mood she left him still by the fairy ring and took her way back to biffstead the house was empty as ida had gone to beorminster to see flo and frank was attending to the farm bess sat down and wondered what could be the meaning of stephens presence at the pines on that night she knew that he had come over from beorminster to escort his mother home but then mrs marsh had been with mr corn the whole evening and there was no reason why stephen should have gone out of his way to visit the pines it was in the afternoon that mrs marsh had seen the colonel and stephen must have known that she would not be at the great house after nine oclock this bess calculating by her own movements was the hour at which sidney had seen him he was looking up at the tower too so sidney said but he cant have had anything to do with it she thought restlessly he disliked the colonel but he didntno i wont even think of it such a thing if true would kill ida yet i must find out from stephen himself why he was in the wood on that night she reflected at this hour stephen would be alone why should she not go over and see him in one way or another she could tell him about the pistol and the silver bullet and see from the expression of his face if he knew anything about either it was incredible that stephen should have fired the shot he was the colonels heir but even to gain the money he certainly was too good a man to commit a crime yet if what sidney said was true stephen had been on the lawn about the time colonel carr was shot he must know something about the matter ill see him said bess putting on her hat again i shall not be able to sleep a wink until i know what he has to say in another half hour she was in the library where stephen was established on the sofa he looked thin and rather worried but his face brightened when he saw her this is good of you bess he said stretching out his hand i am all alone herrick is in town ida at beorminster not a soul to speak to draw that chair close to the fire shall i ring for tea it is too early yet she said reassured by this bright talk it was incredible that a man who spoke so lightly should have a black crime on his soul i just want to chatter for a bit i am so tired of my own company so am i well you talk about jim and ill discourse about ida we shall be quite happy by the way when will ida be back about dinner time she will come over and see you afterwards i wish she would come to dinner here said stephen you also and frank and sidney i miss jim horribly and it is no fun eating a long solemn meal alone upon my word bess i sometimes long for the days when petronellas macaroni could be eaten hurriedly and without this formality i would rather have a book than a footman about the table what a mixed way of talking said bess pensively you have a book on the table as a rule i suppose you are glad all the same that you have the colonels money of course i am said stephen frankly it enables me to marry ida i was so afraid lest she should marry someone else before i came into my kingdom but i could not ask her to be my wife when i was a pauper could i bess shes a rare jewel that requires a rich setting i dont think ida values money so much as all that said bess gravely she would have married you without a sixpence but i am glad all the same that the money came to you so soon it is nice to be rich so it is admitted stephen gladly i can buy whatever books i like bess laughed at this speech i am afraid you will grow into a bookworm no jim has got me out of bad habits in that respect at one time i did nothing but read now i ride and swim and box and fence and shoot bess started at the last word it gave her the opening she desired are you a good shot she asked i was always a good shot said stephen coolly that is with a pistol i never handled a gun until i came here i did not know you had ever handled a pistol either oh yes i did young capron gave me permission to shoot rabbits on his estate ages ago i could not afford to buy a gun but i did manage to get enough money to screw out a revolverand a very good one i believe it was brought here from beorminster unless petronella overlooked it but i have not used it for over a year rabbit shooting with a pistol is not much fun especially when one is alone i should like to see the pistol said bess after a pause go over then to the box behind that screen said stephen if it is anywhere it will be in there there are all sorts of odds and ends rag tag and bobtail of my former existence bess did as she was told and walked slowly over and behind the large gilded screen which stood in a far corner of the library here pushed to one side was a moderately sized box the lid of which was open she found in it a few books many manuscripts pens an inkstand and all the paraphernalia of a writing table these she enumerated aloud i know said stephen from the sofa those are the the contents of my study i expect petronella threw all the things into that trunk the pistol is bound to be therein a small mahoganybox i always kept it on the mantelpiece of my study be careful if you find it bess all six chambers are loaded after some search bess came across just such a box and opened it to find a neat little revolver of the most modern pattern she carried this box and all to a table near the sofa again stephen warned her that the weapon was loaded i kept it loaded because my mother was always afraid of thieves poor soul he said though heaven knows there was little enough to steal in that dismal house of ours what is it bess there are only three chambers loaded said bess thickly in a flash she remembered the three shots fired into the dead bodyand the conical shape of the bullets those in the weapon she held were conical in shape nonsense said stephen nervously i always kept the whole six loaded you must be making a mistake he took the revolver from her and examined it closely you are right he said with a long breath three of them are empty as he spoke he looked up apparently with indifference when his eye caught hers he saw something in her expression which made him start and flush crimson for a moment they looked at one another then stephen swung himself up to a sitting position and laid the pistol on the side table why do you look at me like that bess he asked in a hurried tone for a minute she did not reply but she felt that she must know the truth and burst out hurriedly stephen you were on the lawn on the night your uncle was killed the young man started to his feet and then fell back again on the sofa white and amazed how do know he stuttered sidney saw you he told me oh stephenthree chambers of your revolver emptythree shots at she felt suffocated and could not continue wait wait stephen put his hand to his head it felt confused his face was of a deep purple bess thought that he would have a fit and blamed herself for having blurted out her suspicions wait wait muttered marshcarr again as she moved towards the bell to summon assistance he sat down on the sofa his face in his hands rocking himself to and fro then he heaved a deep sigh and looked up at her white haggard face you will not tell ida he said with her hands twisted in her hair bess stepped back she suppressed a shriek stephen she cried hoarsely you did notyou i did not murder him no replied the young man harshly he was already dead when i fired those three shots then it was you who it was i cried stephen rising to his feet with a fierce look and you are going to denounce me i suppose no no how can you think i would do such a thing but ida poor ida you must not tell her cried stephen grasping her wrist until she winced with the pain do what you like but say nothing to ida i would rather break off our engagement on another plea than that she should know the pain of the twist he gave her arm brought bess back to a more normal state of mind she pulled herself together and sat down stephen she said slowly no one but you and i will share this secret can you swear to me that colonel carr was already dead when you fired those shots i want the truth he was already dead said marshcarr sitting down quietly did you not hear the medical evidence at the inquest it was the bullet which killed him my shots were fired at a carcase why did you do such a horrible thing wailed bess because i was mad for the time being said stephen gloomily i will tell you all if you are strong enough to hear it after what i know i am strong enough to hear anything oh to think that you should have behaved in so barbarous a manner stephen winced it was barbarous i confess said he but i was mad for the time being after all you must not be too hard on me i did not kill my respected uncle he sneered bess shivered she had never before seen this side of stephens character and the new experience was unpleasant it even stirred her into unconsidered indignation since you went up that tower with a revolver you must have intended to kill the man she said perhaps i did perhaps i did not he answered in a most brazen manner but the plain truth is that i wanted to frighten him and did you think a revolver would frighten a man who had faced death fifty and a hundred times said bess with scorn she recalled to her memory several episodes carr had told her of his american doings she well knew the daredevilry latent in the man carr was old and had lost his nerve i counted upon that i never intended to kill him when i went up the tower the work had been done for me already and who did it i do not know said stephen earnestly upon my soul bess i do not knowthe man was dead when i saw him it was sheer rage that made me fire those three shots the brute that is in me as it is in every man came to the surface but of the real murderer i saw no trace i did not see frisco whom i take to be the man it was not frisco flashed out bess however she continued sick at heart you had better tell me how it came about partly through my love for ida partly through my mother said marshcarr gloomily it came to my mothers ears that the colonel intended to disinherit me i suppose frisco got the upper hand and induced him to alter his willthat is if he did alter it which i doubt of course he did not stephen if he had left the money to anyone else you would not be here i am not so sure about that replied the young man savagely frisco might have taken the second will from the corpse at all events i know that frith and frith drafted no new will if it was drawn the colonel must have drawn it himself however frisco let out in one of his drunken fits at beorminster that carr intended to cut me off my mother heard the news and came home in a frenzy of rage it was for that reason she called on carr on the afternoon you know of the twentyfourth was it not she intended to argue him into a better frame of mind he only laughed at her and said he would leave his money as pleased him she told me the next day but carr was dead then what made you decide to frighten him am i not telling you said stephen impatiently when my mother went to saxham i knew she would fail a woman could not deal with a devil like my beloved uncle i determined to see what i could do with a revolver i would have fought a duel with him to keep my rights said the young man fiercely but i would not have killed him in cold blood no indeed well go on said bess i want to know all there is little to tell said marshcarr i was going to saxham to fetch home my mother who was at the rectory i thought i would visit the pines and see the colonel i did so some time before nine ah it was about that hour sidney saw you i daresay i stood on the lawn looking at the tower and could not make up my mind to enter the house it was all ablaze with lights and quite deserted no said bess recalling her own experience i heard you fire the shots and saw frisco at the door he was drunk and hanging on to the post you heard me fire the shots i did not know you were about i was then i had gone to look for sidney but you see frisco it was frisco said stephen vehemently i tell you carr was dead when i went up lying face downward if frisco was at the door he was just clearing out after killing the man he knew that he would be arrested but he must have heard the shots then he knew that someone had discovered the body which would make him run for it all the more quickly however to make a long story short i fired the three shots you know of and then returned to my mother at the rectory i said nothing about the matter as i had not killed carr if frisco is not the murderer i do not know who is that is all i can tell you bess you see i am not such a guilty wretch as you thought i know that said bess impetuously if you were i should insist upon your leaving ida to fire at the dead was savage but as i know the man must have been dead at the timethe medical evidence proves that i will say nothing why did you not tell me of this before what use would it have been said stephen raising his eyebrows i cannot tell you anything likely to lead to the capture of the assassin and beside it is not a pleasant thing to tell about myself i should not have told you now but that you have been one too many for me i should have reloaded the three chambers of that revolver but i forgot and put it away thinking all six were loaded i should be ashamed to let jim or ida know that i had been such a beast i shall say nothing to them said bess coldly but i am disappointed in you stephen i know said the young man humbly i should have had more selfcontrol but you will not turn your back on me for this bess no all the same i cant feel as i did towards you let me go away and think stephen andput away that revolver marshcarr nodded and slipped the weapon into his pocket but he made no attempt to detain bess she went away with a sore heart chapter xviii part of the truth while bess was thus employed her colleague had his hands full in london on arriving at paddington herrick drove directly to the west kensington flat it was closed and the porter explained that mr joyce had been away for some weeks ah that is a pity said dr jim with a grim smile i wished to see him most particularly i expect him back shortly sir said the man ah has he written to fix the date of his return not yet sir but mr joyce never remains away more than a month or two he may change his habits this time i dont think so sir shall i tell him you called sir no you need not go so far as that when he comes home just send a wire to that address and this for yourself the porter a venal creature in uniform looked at the half sovereign and the address of the guelph hotel in jermyn street he promised faithfully to send a wire the moment mr joyce returned and dr jim went away very well satisfied that he had done right in having robin watched damned little scoundrel growled herrick what is the use of sparing him but that he is in the hands of a stronger villain i would lay him by the heels straight off but i shall deal with santiago this time i expect he and joyce are plotting together in some hole in another hour herrick was climbing a flight of dingy stairs in the neighbourhood of the strand he stopped at the second landing and before a door which bore the name of kidd belcher co private inquiry office on entering he was confronted by a dirty undersized boy kidd was absent on business but belcher was in and on giving his card dr jim was shown into the next room here at a table near the window sat a man that is he stood on two legs he was neatly dressed and he talked in a prim precise voice but going by his face he was a ferret the long face and nose the broad forehead and small receding chin and above all the redrimmed eyes without eyebrows or eyelashes all this made him look very much like a ferret and his nature was also of the beast he was a sly silent cunning tracker relentless when once he had hunted down his prey a dangerous man a deadly man who had elected to place himself on the side of the law as offering the better price had he chosen to be one of the great criminal profession mr belcher would have been a dangerous opponent to the police luckily he found that honesty paid better than roguery therefore he was at the disposal of dr jim for the watching of santiago and joyce he talked freely on this point its all right sir he said in his whispering voice and arranging his neat white tie kidd caught him at the paddington station and followed him to pimlico oh he is in pimlico is he watched by three boys and kidd himself four kids i call them said mr belcher with a silent laugh you see sir that mexican gent prefers to live at pimlico because it is near the gambling club we need not mention names sir as i have an interest in that club and dont want the police to know of it i hunt with the hounds and run with the fox you see and belcher gave another of his silent laughs humph said jim taking no notice of the joke so joyce is at santiagos lodgings is he drove straight therefrom paddington and has not been out of doors since the don has been sir he never thinks you are after him i fancy he has rather a contempt for my brains said jim however we shall see about that ill go to those lodgings would you mind telling me what the mexican has done sir i would mind very much mr belcher when i want to tell you my business you wont have to help me it is a private matter but later on there may be something in it likely to pay you at present all i want you to do is to keep an eye on joyce and santiago i will pay you well for it yes sir thank you sir excuse my curiosity quite professional no doubt but you will make more money by asking no questions if things are as i suspect with these two it will put a lot of cash into your pockets meanwhile hold your tongue very good dr herrick said the ferret meekly so long as you know your business i dont need to teach it to you but you know our firm we are straight so long as you are paid otherwise you prefer to keep gambling saloons unknown to the police oh never fear man i shall say nothing by the way lend me a revolver ha said the ferret with sudden interest is it as bad as that i think so one at least of the two will show fight and it wont be the man you followed from paddington you had better come with me belcher i want to know if the coast is clear if the two catch sight of me from the window they may clear out while i am talking to them you and kidd can remain outside if you hear a shot rush up with the nearest policeman but i wont fire unless i am driven to it going to shoot one of them dr herrick said belcher producing a very serviceable weapon which jim slipped into his breast pocket not unless either one draws on me it is the mexican i fear but it is the more likely i shall only fire the revolver by way of a signal you know what you have to do yes sir said the ferret with something of admiration in his whisper you ought to have been in our profession doctor you provide against every chance except sudden death laughed jim as they went down the dingy stairs i have a tough article to deal with in that santiago do you know anything about him belcher the ferret shook his head and waved a neat umbrella to a passing hansom not much sir he replied hes been in england over six months and always in the same lodgings he has money but not too much of it i got to know him at the club and he gambled so high and won so much that i made it my business to look after him but i could find out nothing to get the whip hand of him sir mr joyce goes to your club also yes sir i told you so when you called to see me first i knew the name at once kidd knows him too but he doesnt know kidd that was why i sent kidd to paddington hes a fool sir true enough replied herrick dryly but even a fool can become dangerous in the hands of an unscrupulous scoundrel like santiago oh i do not know anything against him added herrick seeing the ferrets eyes twinkle i am only going by the little i do know not enough to jail him i suppose sir not yet but there might be soon replied jim glancing sideways at his neat companion he well knew that belcher and kidd liked to know secrets in order to extort blackmail a dangerous pair but jim knew how to deal with them they were rather afraid of jim he knew too much herrick had become acquainted with the ferret through having saved the life of his small daughter and as this child was the apple of the mans eye he adored jim and was in the habit of speaking to him more freely than he otherwise would have done therefore jim got to know more about the private inquiry firm than was altogether wise however he could keep his mouth shut and as at present he sometimes found the pair useful but the connection was not a pleasant one even so and herrick was wont to comfort himself with the reflection that when dirty work has to be done no man can be nice in the choice of his instruments directed by the ferret the cab stopped at the corner of a pimlico street in a quiet neighbourhood there he left the doctor in the cab and went along to reconnoitre in ten minutes he came back the mexican has gone out said belcher he has been away an hour but joyce is in the sittingroom kidd saw his face two or three times at the window if you creep along the street under the house he wont be able to see you right you are said dr jim climbing down and paying off the cablavishly because he did not want a disturbance you wait outside both of you and keep an eye on the policeman when you hear a shot you neednt tell me twice dr herrick said belcher his professional pride wounded off you go sir ill stop hereabouts and whistle if the mexican comes along he doesnt know my real business jim nodded and walked along to number fortythree whereas belcher told him santiago had rooms on the first floor on the opposite side of the street he saw kidd with a green shade and picturesquely attired in rags playing the part of a pavement artist at the end of the street three or four boys were playing marbles no one would suspect that either man or boys were spies jim fingered his revolver and rang the bell i want to see mr joyce he said to the slattern who opened the door my name is nuttall and i come from don manuel santiago the slattern suspecting nothing from this calm address conducted jim up the stairs she opened a door and gave the message to robin herrick heard his voice telling her to show in mr nuttall and he guessed from the sound of it that joyce was uneasy the slattern pushed jim to the door and then dropped down stairs rapidly she wanted to get back to her novel for her mistress was away for the afternoon well joyce and how are you robin gave a kind of squeal like that of a trapped animal and fell back into the chair from which he had risen to welcome mr nuttall his face grew white his jaw dropped and he collapsed into a limp heap fright so paralysed his tongue that he could not speak jim smiled politely and closed the door then he took a chair opposite to the wretched creature you are a proper little scoundrel he said in withering tones i am sorry to see you brought so low as this joyce what do you want cried robin flaming into sudden fury have you not humiliated me enough but that you must come after me to find you in hiding with don manuel go easy joyce and keep a civil tongue in your head id like to kill you he muttered his face distorted with fury i have no doubt you would and i have also small doubt but that your friend santiago will try do you want to see him and you yes you told me such lies at saxham coached by don manuel i suppose that i wish to talk to the two of you together if you dont leave this place i will call the police do so by all means i shall give you in charge when they appear come joyce dont be a fool you have to sit down and do what i tell you joyce resumed his seat and bit his fingers santiago will kill you he muttered viciously i hope he will thank you i see pity is wasted on a reptile like you but see here said jim with sudden fierceness i am prepared for you and for the mexican also i have only to fire this he showed the revolver and the detectives who are waiting will come up detectives cried joyce white as snow and trembling yes you fool i gave you every chance to clear yourself you abused my leniency and plotted with santiago to cheat me this time you will not get off so easy i wonder how you will like being in the dock on a charge of conspiracy itsitsits a lie its the truth and you know it you and santiago wish to get the money left by colonel carr you tried to murder stephen in the churchyard it was not i gasped robin shaking with fright i was with the miss endicottes all the time oh i know that your accomplice is the bolder villain it was he here herrick made a shot in the dark it was santiago who struck marsh i know he did sobbed joyce falling into the trap but i never mind about yourself said jim exulting in having extorted this piece of information tell me what there is between santiago and corn that made him force the parson to tell a lie in order to prove his alibi corn said that manuel was with him all the evening you know that is false manuel went out and struck stephen marsh i dont know what power santiago has over corn said robin wiping his eyes he never told me but he has some he treats me like a dog and i cant call my soul my own you poor little rat said herrick with a certain pity then the best thing you can do is to come back to me and tell me all you know about this scoundrel no no whimpered joyce he would kill me not he i shall know how to save you and if you do not tell said dr jim in a sharp tone ill have you arrested as being concerned in this murder of colonel carr i am innocent you know i am innocent i know nothing of the sort replied herrick unexpectedly i have your word for it and your confession of your doings on that night but there is quite enough in that confessionsigned by yourself mindto justify your being arrested on suspicion of having committed the crime do you think a jury would believe in your story especially as i can prove that the pistol with whichas i verily believethe crime was committed was in your possession i got it from santiago so you said and yet at the time you told me it was out of my power to question the man you knew that he had gone up to town by the heathcroft line and you did not tell me i was afraid he forced me to hold my tongue you had better be a little more afraid of me i can do you more mischief than don manuel is likely to do he will have sufficient to do to look after himself but i knew what a slippery little devil you were joyce and so i had you watched from the moment you disembarked at the paddington station you cant move a step now without my knowledge so you need not try to give me the slip again by this time joyce was in a state of collapse he saw that herrick had been too clever for him between his fear of santiago and his fear of herrick he was in a pitiable state of mind dr jim felt sorry for the miserable creature in spite of the contempt which his conduct righteously provoked ill tell you what i can said joyce after a pause i think you are wise you expect santiago back soon at five oclock it is a quarter past four now said herrick glancing at his watch i will wait for him he is dangerous said joyce alarmed and rising from his chair so am i it is not a man like me who is afraid of a mexican greaser mr joyce dont go near that window youll be making signals to your friend i dont trust you on my honour began joyce returning to his seat you havent got any now then why did santiago try to get marsh killed he did not want to kill him he only desired that he should be disabled and prevented from going to the vault herrick whistled ah he has been looking up the will at doctors commons well and what does he expect to gain by the money going to frisco the man is in communication with him i suppose no said joyce sulkily he is in communication with me the devil herrick sprang to his feet so you put that cipher in the paper asking frisco to meet you at hyde park corner yes i did i put in the first and the second who taught you the cipher it was one that colonel carr knew santiago taught it to me ah now we are getting at the truth said herrick and where did you meet santiago may i ask no lie this time please i met him at the gambling club in this district oh you did i never knew that gambling was a vice of yours it seems one never does know a man i thought better of you well and for what reason did santiago tell you about this cipher i knew him before i went on the walking tour with you when i came back to london i went to the club and saw him there he talked about the murder of carr and had seen my name as one of the men who found the body in one way and another he got everything out of me the story you told me yes he made me tell everything clever man said herrick with a nod but of course you are so weak poor soul that you would tell everything i now see how this man got you into his power well and why did he teach you the cipher it seems he knew frisco oh he denied that i knew that was a lie but no matter i said that frisco was in london and that i should like to find him i wanted to know if frisco had really killed colonel carr oh herrick shrugged his shoulders and were on simple enough to think that frisco would tell you he did tell me that he was innocent of course yes that he was innocent but if he had told me that he was guilty i could not have betrayed him humph said dr jim with a sharp glance you are getting more mysterious every moment well so you put in that cipherthe firstby the direction of the mexican yes and met frisco at hyde park corner i also put in the second when i wanted to see frisco again he wouldnt give me his address but said if i wanted to see him i was to communicate by the cipher i did not meet him the second time because i saw you waiting to catch us ah that was clever of you of you too said joyce how did you learn the cipher that is my business be civil said dr jim sharply go on you saw this man you say and he told you he was innocent which is a lie i suppose santiago saw him also yes we were all three in my flat nice party said dr jim sarcastically and you made up this conspiracy between the lot of you yes we wanted marsh to lose the money i do not see where the advantage would come in said dr jim reflectively the money would go to frisco certainly but he could not benefit without running the risk of arrest he was not to appear at all in the matter explained joyce when the money came to him he was to feign death and make a will leaving the fortune to me i was to share it with him and santiago herrick stared the conspiracy was more complete than he had thought and very cunning too upon my word that is clever he said in a tone half of jest and half admiration although i do not exactly see how the law would look at the matter frisco wanted for murderto feign deathfortune left to youmoney to be shared between the presumed corpse and the two plotters left alive why its like a melodrama you would have had some difficulty in proving the death of frisco though oh santiago was going to manage that said joyce with confidence i am sure he would even to going the length of making a real corpse of the man after the will was signed joyce jumped up and began to walk up and down much agitated no he said bad as you think me herrick i should never have consented to frisco being put out of the way the death would have been proved without that frisco would have received his share of the money he would have gone free i would rather die myself than that anything should happen to frisco yes you may look i would dr jim shrugged his shoulders your conscience has grown very tender all of a sudden that you should desire to shield a scoundrel is frisco a relative of yours that you should be so careful of his skin joyce dropped into his seat and looked straight at the doctor frisco is my father he said deliberately dr jim jumped up in his turn and stared down at the pinched white face he could scarcely believe his ears your father he gasped is this another part of your conspiracy it is the truth said joyce simply so simply that herrick was convinced that for once he was telling no lie when he met me and came to my flat he told me he was my father i did not believe him but he soon convinced me by showing me my mothers letters addressed to him where colonel carrs oh herrick dropped back into his chair so this accounts for the annuity what is your fathers real name joyce the same as mine he was colonel carrs cousin herrick was amazed and remembered what he had heard about the uncle of the wicked colonel carrs father turned a son out of doors he muttered the son went to america and married he had one daughter my mother she was the carrs cousin not my fathers i am getting confused murmured joyce feeling his head in that case you are cousin to stephen marsh yes and i should have the money since my grandfather was the brother of colonel carr that was why i conspired as you call it that was why my father and santiago tried to help me to get my rights what do you think of it now herrick i think that you went the wrong way to work said jim that is if you are telling me the truthwhich i doubt it is the truth cried joyce clenching his fist if you do not believe me he added listening for a moment here is one who will tell you santiago said herrick rising to be ready for emergencies yes he is coming up the stair now at that moment there was a shrill whistle outside belchers signal chapter xix don manuels recollections santiago entered the room quite unsuspiciously his step was light his eyes were bright and he had evidently been successfully plotting some new and lucrative villainy in a moment his astonished eyes lighted upon herrick standing tall and smiling on the hearthrug a spanish oath of the coarsest slipped from his mouth and he looked about as evil as a man can look who knows that the game is up however he was plucky enough to show fight he even attempted bluff what are you doing in my rooms seor he demanded in spanish if you dont you think we had better keep to english said herrick blandly i know you speak it so well and of course we have our mutual friend joyce to consider you are surprised to see me natural very natural joyce sat in his chair silent and white he was too frightened to open his mouth for he knew something of don manuels rages and dreaded the tornado which would ensue when the mexican learned how herrick had been told everything by his weakkneed coadjutor for a moment santiago still in ignorance as to the true state of affairs ground his teeth then by an effort of will he recovered his smile and to all appearances his usual temper you will excuse me if i spoke rudely seor he said with a polite how it is not my custom but i am rather taken aback at meeting you here i do not remember having asked you to come thats all right replied jim cheerfully he did not sit down for santiago was still on his feet and one can use a revolver better when standing i heard that you had been suddenly called to town yesterday i therefore made it my business to follow very kind of you said santiago slipping his hand into his breast pocket an action which was imitated by herrick but how did you find out my address i never gave it to you an oversight on your part my dear don manuel replied jim politely but watchful of the mans slightest action but the fact is my friend joyce left beorminster yesterday as you knowthat was after his talk with you i believe i thought that it was possible you might ask him to stop with you for a day or so in place of returning to his own home therefore i telegraphed to town asking certain friends of mine to keep a watch on him andyou what am i to understood from all this seor this much that your game is up joyce has told me much i have waited to see if you will tell me more don manuel cast a black look at robin who began to whimper i could not help it he said its all over i had to tell him you told him what demanded the mexican livid with rage all about the conspiracyfrisco and a few otherah would youfor don manuel had whipped out his revolver herrick was just as quick and the two men faced one another robin gave a shriek like a frightened woman the sight was an unpleasant one for gods sake cried joyce wringing his hands one moment before you fire seor said herrick coolly i would have you know that the firing of a single shot will bring up the police santiago dropped his revolver with a start the police he muttered then after a pause he returned his weapon to his pocket you can do the same seor he said calmly i dont think we shall have much use for them said herrick putting away his weapon and sitting down i think we may talk now that these preliminaries are ended will you not be seated seor manuel in my own house exclaimed the spaniard between his teeth but sat nevertheless quite so i have to ask you pardon for that but you see my friend i must stand if you do and i am tired you might use that pretty little weapon in your pocket i may do so yet said santiago with an ugly look possibly all the same i would point out that your intention has its disadvantages in the first place i am a good and a quick shot in the second as my shot or yours would summon the police you might get into trouble the police can do nothing to me if you attempt to kill me i think they can do a lot we are not in mexico now seor santiago come let us talk sensibly i am sure you must see that i am in a position to dictate my own terms you will not find them hard i assure you always provided provided what that you did not murder colonel carr if you did i feari fear i shall be obliged to hand you over to the police we have a prejudice against people being killed in this country don manuel oh curse your fine speeches growled the don i did not kill carr if that is what you are driving at he paused and cast a look at joyce i see that you have got the better of me if that whitelivered cur had held his tonguehowever i must make the best of a bad job come if i answer your questions freely and frankly will you promise not to inform the police of what i tell you no i cant promise that if you know where frisco is you must tell me i want to have that man hanged joyce started up with a cry i am sorry robin if he is your father but as he is a murderer also he must one moment interposed santiago coolly frisco is no murderer indeed then as you were in possession of the pistol with which colonel carr was shot perhaps you can tell me who used it that is said herrick significantly if you did not use it yourself i dont use weapons of that sort said santiago scornfully besides it was my game to frighten carr not to kill him i see it was you who sent those warnings in cipher you know that do you yes it was i and to make carr afraid he had few good nights after he got those warnings i know they were all bluff so far as i was concerned replied santiago easily but had i chosen they could have been sent in deadly earnest i do not understand i do not think you will until i explain but first i must be assured of my own safety before i speak well said dr jim pulling out his pipe its this way you see i want to get to the bottom of this conspiracy also to learn who killed carr i could have you arrested on a charge of trying to kill marsh here the mexican muttered a curse on robins head and the little man winced but if you will prove to me that you did not kill carr and tell me the whole truth why i will let you go back to mexico unharmed and if i refuse demanded don manuel in that case ill call up the police and give you and joyce in charge for conspiracy and assault with intent to kill i did not wish to kill him protested manuel i only wanted to prevent him going to the vault and so allow the money to pass to frisco put in herrick very clever i know all about that tell me something new if i had only been here before you intimidated this you would have done as he has done said herrick then changing his tone he spoke sharply we are wasting time tell me all i want to know answer my questions and you shall go free save that i shall have you watched until the true murderer of colonel carr has been found if you refuse you shall be arrested forthwith and if i were to shoot you cried santiago savagely half rising you would be hanged or else you would have to end your own life dont i tell you the sound of the shot will bring up the men i have had posted santiago reflected for a moment then he took out his revolver and tossed it carelessly on to the table you are the stronger seor i give in allow me to roll a cigarette and i will answer all your questions i am not afraid for i can swear by the holy mother that i did not kill carr and added santiago with a gay laugh i rather regret i did not come said herrick lighting his pipe the story in the first place where did you meet colonel carr in mexico about twenty years ago you would not think it to look at me but i am not young seor herrick did you meet frisco at the same time joyces father i did wait a moment said robin i wanted to tell herrick the precise relationship between myself and colonel carr but i grew confused was not my mother his niece i forget i am so muddled no it is this way the uncle of colonel carr a younger brother of his father was turned out of doors by the grandfather he went to the states and married he died leaving a widow and daughter the widow died and the daughter married an american your father was the son and he married your mother you are their son therefore you were a kind of third or fourth cousin to carr your father frisco was a second cousin i think it is this way but santiago shrugged his shoulders your english relationships are so very confusing cousins will do said herrick did carr know that friscowe will continue to call him so as it is rather confusingdid carr i say know that frisco was his second cousin yes for that reason he allowed mrs joyce an annuity of five hundred a year why was it not continued to our friend here don manuel laughed i think the colonel and frisco had quarrelled by then and carr had told him to look after his own brat how dare you cried robin jumping up my friend i repeat what the colonel said that is all herrick interposed did mrs joyce know that frisco was with carr oh dear me no she thought she was a widow that is true said robin gloomily my mother always said that my father had died in america i could not believe that frisco was my father until he convinced me i think we both convinced you said the mexican with a laugh but it strikes me dr herrick that we are beginning the story at the wrong end let me tell it in my own way it will be much clearer i hope it will be true oh as to that i have no reason to conceal anything now said don manuel with a shrug you may as well know all the money is lost and i shall return to mexico as poor as i set out well tell the story in your own way growled herrick disliking the coolness of the man yet half admiring his nerve well then said santiago placing a cigarette in his mouth and crossing his legs it is this way twenty years ago i met colonel carr he was in the war between chili and peru and a brave soldier he was a brute also there was nothing he would not do to get money he had left his home a pauper and he swore he would go back a millionaire but when the war was at an end he had not got the fortune he wanted it was about that time that frisco fell in with carr and frisco introduced himself as a cousin just that said santiago briskly they soon found out the relationship joycei am speaking of your father my friend this in an aside to robin joyce came from san francisco so the colonel one day being drunk called him friscothe name stuck to him after that they were what you english call pals and hung round lima trying to make money i was in the army then and saw much of them frisco was as anxious as carr to be rich he said he had left a wife and son in california that was you robin put in herrick much interested yes that was robin said don manuel with a sour glance at the little man whom he had not yet forgiven for his cowardly confession well seor the two tried to make money and could not then they heard of the treasures buried by the indians when pizarro conquered peru they went off to cuzco afterwards up into the mountains for some months they were gone one day they came back to lima to see me ragged and poor they had caught an indian who knew of a large treasure in gold and jewels he told them where it was hidden and gave them a plan but i thought the indians would not tell said herrick who knew something of the country of which santiago was speaking this one did said the mexican with a smile they tortured him with a redhot gun barrel dont look so astonished seor indians are not much above the beasts and i told you carr was a devil they tortured him till he gave them the plan carr was afraid of losing it so he made frisco tattoo it on his breast and then burnt the original plan ah herrick started to his feet i see now why carr wanted his body watched for a year at the end of that time the plan would not be recognisable finished santiago quietly exactly so seor carr knew from the ciphers i sent him that i was in the country and would in some way try to get a sight of that plan for that he shut himself up in the tower and wait a bit said herrick he built that tower when he came home ten years ago your coming did not make him build it he knew that someone would come and try to kill him said don manuel coolly but i am telling the end before the beginning let me go on well dr herrick as i said colonel carr had that plan tattooed on his breast he would not show it to me but wanted me to join in an expedition to get the treasure i got the money and fitted out the expedition we started off to cuzco then up the apurimac and on the mountains i told you something of this before seor on the way they betrayed me into the hands of some indians and went on themselves i cursed my fate when i learned their treachery i was held captive for two three years to revenge myself on carr i told the indians how he had found the treasure they were furious and sent out men to protect it but carr fought them and got away to the coast with a quantity of jewels and gold he went to the states and afterwards came on to england where he settled down at the pines but at lima he was twice nearly assassinated and knew that the indians had appointed some of their more civilised countrymen to follow and kill him and to cut the plan of the hidingplace out of his flesh he knew also that these appointed would follow him across the water to the ends of the earth but he managed to give them the slip and never thought that in an obscure country village he would be in danger all the same he built the tower that he might keep himself safe while asleep and are you one of these emissaries asked herrick santiago shook his head i might have been had i so chosen said he but i wanted a share of the money myself or at all events a plan of the hidingplace that i might search for it how did you hear all this when you were a captive i did notthen it was when i got back to lima that i heard i could not learn where carr had gone i did not know even if carr was his real name i hunted for him both in north and south america but he had so cleverly concealed his trail that i could not trace him then i was ill for a long time after the privations i had suffered amongst the indians it was only within the last year that i discovered the whereabouts of carr i then came to england to frighten him so i sent those cipher warnings i wanted a share of the money or the plan carr refused to give me either ah you saw him then no he wrote me a letter defying me to do my worst of course he thought that i was one of those appointed to kill him that was why he lived in the tower and arranged that his body should be watched after his death dead or alive you see he was determined that i should get nothing you came down to saxham to break into the vault suggested herrick no i should have done so had i not hit upon this other planwhat you call the conspiracy but i thought that through this little fool i might get the money i deserve it more than stephen marsh there was silence for a few minutes santiago was regretting the downfall of his hopes robin was wondering about his own future and dr jim reflected on the strange story which had been told to him did you never go down to saxham he asked oh yes seor replied the mexican airily on the night when colonel carr was murdered i was at the rectory with pentland corn said herrick then you knew him before i know him better than anyone in his parish knows him said santiago he is a gambler often he leaves his church to come to the pimlico club and gamble it was there that i met him he was the friend i spoke of when i first saw you seor herrickthe friend who told me about colonel carr as i had the secret of this padre i used him as an intermediator between myself and carr herrick was surprised to hear this about corn and could easily see how the unfortunate man had been kept under the thumb of this adventurer you are certainly skilful in finding tools said he dryly and with a glance at the silent joyce so you were at the rectory on that night how can i be sure that you were not at the pines oh you want to accuse me of the murder said don manuel rather amused i assure you i did not kill carr it was not my aim to do so i wished to get the money without danger from your laws to be plain seor i went to pentland corn to see if he could bribe or force frisco into betraying carr into my hands i came to beorminster by a late train and went to saxham by the public coach about nine i came to the rectory the reverend corn was out but i waited for him he could not have been out said herrick mrs marsh was with him and her son had come to fetch her you are right except as to the time seor mrs marsh had gone by nine and her son also corn came back and said that he had taken them to the public conveyance he was pale and looked haggard i told him he lied he lost his nerve and threw on the table a pistol ha the pistol you gave to joyce the same replied santiago coolly the weapon with which carr was murdered do you mean to say that corn killed the colonel cried herrick starting to his feet it is a lie i do not believe it then why ask me to tell you the truth it was corn who killed carr he was a gambler and deeply in the colonels debt those visits he paid to the pines were not to convert carr as he alleged but to gamble with him he lost much money to carr the colonel threatened if he did not pay to denounce him corn knew that he would lose his position if this was done he knew also that carr was a threatened man i had told him it then occurred to him to kill carr and he thought that the suspicion might be shifted on to those who had lost the treasure thus his secret and himself would be safe it is incredible said herrick and even joyce looked amazed it is true replied the mexican of course if you will not believe me i really cannot help it i know that corn is guilty he told me so himself and i took from him the pistol by way of proof being thus in my power i forced him to do my bidding you can see now how he declared that i had not left him on the night seor marsh was assaulted it was i who struck him and corn by my directions proved the alibi that is the whole story seor is there anything else you want to know the whereabouts of frisco ah i cant tell you that frisco trusts no one not even me when joyce or myself want to see him we have to put a cipher into the telegraph then you must do so now i want to see the man why he is innocent so you say but i have yet to be convinced of pentland corns guilt joyce jumped to his feet i am sure my father is innocent he cried but i will get him to see you if you like i think it would be better said herrick dryly and took up his hat one moment seor said santiago quietly how do we stand i shall do nothing until i see corn and learn if he really killed carr as you say in the meantime joyce can go back to his flat and you can remain here don manuel you are perfectly safe from the police but you will have us watched certainly said herrick with a nod you see i cannot trust you besides i want you to write down all you have told me and sign it i have joyces confession i want yours i will do so with pleasure replied the mexican after a pause i have done nothing against your law nothing except try to kill marsh oh you have promised to hold me guiltless of that true enough you are safe so far as that is concerned there is honour amongst thieves seor manuel i have come lately so much into contact with people like you and joyce that i feel rather a bad lot myself the mexican drew himself up and his eyes glittered seor you shall answer me for those words i am a gentleman and i challenge you to a duel you dare not refuse well see about that when this matter of carrs death is settled don manuel meantime remember that every move you make i shall know of and baffle santiago shrugged his shoulders the fine scheme is ended he said this little fool has spoilt all i will do what you wish seor since you are too strong for me very good and joyce you must get your father to see me if i can muttered robin with a glance of hatred you must answered herrick going to the door goodbye gentlemen i shall leave you to settle your own affairs now and he went out laughing chapter xx the revd pentland corn herrick did not take all that santiago had said for gospel truth the mexican was too clever and too bold a man to give in so tamely seeing what was at stake for the moment he had recognised that he was powerless and had surrendered until such time as he could recover his position dr jim could have stopped all his machinations by having him arrested for the assault on stephen but he did not wish to bring the police into the matter at present in the first place so many lies had been told about the case there were so many things to be explained that he was not sure of his ground and for the sake of stephen he did not wish to create a scandal colonel carrs reputation was quite bad enough without making it worse therefore the only thing that jim could do was to have the two scamps watched certainly they might warn frisco to clear out but whatever santiago did herrick felt sure that joyce would not counsel such a course the little man knew well enough that his safety depended upon herrick and would do nothing which might jeopardise his safety the mexican might plot and plan but joyce would certainly obey orders also they could do little if closely watched herrick then gave his orders to kidd and belcher and returned the next day to saxham if anything important occurs he said to the ferret you can wire me but we are in the dark protested belcher if you would only no belcher interrupted jim sharply we settled all that before all you have to do is to see if either of these men tries to leave the country or if they meet a man who looks like a sailor then you can wire me i shall come up to town at once and deal with the matter myself what might be the sailors name it might be anything replied herrick dryly it wont do belcher you are not to know my aims until i choose to let you know if you will not work for me on these terms just say so and ill get some one else ill do whatever you like dr herrick said the ferret submissively and went away to fulfil his duties devoured with curiosity in spite of his regard for dr jim the man wanted to make money out of him he therefore determined to learn all he could about joyce and the mexican and treat with them on his own account if he gained any knowledge likely to be useful from a blackmailing point of view the ferret and his partner were rogues in grain they did not even keep faithful to their employer or to each other for the matter of that honour amongst thieves was not a proverb practised in the strand office herrick had another talk with joyce before he returned to saxham the little man had gone back to his flat having him all to himself and the yoke of don manuel being to some extent broken dr jim was able to deal more easily with him he promised the poor fool that if he remained faithful and did not intrigue any more with his father or the mexican that he should be given a new chance of leading a clean existence indeed herrick spoke so seriously that he reduced joyce to tears and to many protestations that henceforward he would be all that was good it was not improbable that he would mend he had had a severe lesson and had narrowly escaped getting into the clutches of the law with a less kindly man than herrick his position would indeed would have been a serious one he therefore appreciated the kindness accorded to himor said he didand jim departed satisfied that so far as robin was concerned he had nullified the schemes of santiago in this way he hoped to take the heart out of the conspiracy against stephen and stephens money the next person to deal with is corn he said to himself as he got into the train he is another fool if not worse as manuel told me i seem to have dealt with nothing but fools and scoundrels ever since i started out on that unhappy walking tour colonel carr was evil in his life and he has left an evil influence behind him later on dr jim reproached himself for blaming the walkingtour if it had brought him into trouble it had also given him a promise of future happiness but for that walk he would never have met bess after all his anxiety in london herrick wanted to have a quiet hour with the girl who was the light of his eyes jim did not call her this for he was not a romantic person but he felt he would like to be with her and he was anxious to know what she had discovered about the pistol bess had not sent him a report as she had promised and herrick concluded that she had discovered nothing worth the sending all the same he wished to see her at once but he put off the happy hour there was business to be done before pleasure could be taken it was after nine oclock before herrick arrived at the beorminster station he had not sent for the cart as he did not wish stephen to know of his arrival at present dr jim had made up his mind to call in and get the truth out of the clergyman before returning to the pines therefore determined to get his plans into thorough order jim left his portmanteau at beorminster to be sent on the next morning and himself walked to saxham in due time he arrived at the rectory and was shown into the rectors study where he found the man himself the revd pentland looked nervous at this untimely visit and more so as he saw that dr jim was not in evening dress and must therefore have come straight from town corns conscience was uneasy and every untoward event fluttered his nerves however he composed himself with a strong effort and asked herrick to be seated you have just come from town i see he observed with a nervous glance yes and i want particularly to have a chat with you before going to the pines and on a painful subject mr corn the rector shivered and turned even paler than usual is there anything wrong he asked faintly let me know the worst at once why should you expect any worst mr corn the man shook his head and passed a handkerchief across his dry lips i want to know the worst he said again without heeding the question i can see by your face that there is something wrong which concerns me herrick gave a short laugh upon my word you are a singularly indiscreet man mr corn he said you give yourself away right and left when i met you first of all you behaved in a foolish manner now you are very little better you are a clergyman and a gentleman with an assured position why dont you assume the defensive and ask what i mean by such speeches as i have madeas i am now making because i would have to tell you all about myself sooner or later said corn in a low voice you are a strong man and i want to confide in someone like yourself i am not strong i wasoncebut something happened he sighed and nodded a terrible thing happened herrick wondered if he was about to confess to the murder however he did not wish to hurry the confession which he saw corn was on the point of making he wondered that such a smart and soldierlylooking man should own himself to be so weak i am quite at your service he said coldly and for my own part mr corn i do not think you have used either myself or mr marsh over well in what way this time corn really did look amazed you told a lie to shield don manuel it was the mexican who struck that blow at my friend and you knew it how could you a gentleman and a clergyman stoop to shield a wouldbe murderer corn rose to his feet and braced himself to a great effort you are right he said frankly but i was compelled to such a course herrick nodded i know i have heard all from santiago corn recoiled he told you he grasped sitting down yes he told me how he had you in his power how he forced you to lie for him i made him tell me the truth now i wished to hear the confirmation of this story from you it is true it is true cried corn desperately if he told you that i was a gambler that i owed moneyit is true i don t mean that so much said herrick sharply as to the accusation he makes against you of having murdered colonel carr the clergyman who had been leaning his head on his arms in an agony of grief looked up suddenly with a bewildered stare santiago said that about me he demanded it is not true it is the foulest lie he ever spoke cried corn with indignation i am bad in many ways dr herrickyet i have my excuses as you shall hear but as to murdering carr i did nothing of the sort how was it then that don manuel obtained from you the pistol with which the crime was committed corn looked round the room and went to the door opening this he looked out for a moment to see that the coast was clear then he shut it locked it and came back to the fireplace looking more like a ghost than ever i picked it up he said in a whisper yes on the lawn of the pines i knew that colonel carr had been shot with it but i dare not tell why not were you afraid of being inculpated no corn hesitated and wiped his face i must tell you he said with a gasp there is no help for it this secret has weighed on my soul until i can bear it no longer it was a woman who shot carr herrick rose slowly hardly believing his ears a woman he echoed corn nodded and whispered again mrs marsh he said that said herrick is a lie it is the truth i swear it is the truth she shot carr because he was about to disinherit her son if you will sit down i will tell you all i know i am glad that it has come to this panted corn wiping his forehead i am glad that i can tell you the secret has nearly killed me did you tell santiago asked dr jim seated again and much bewildered no i told no one santiago on the evidence of that pistol really believed that i was guilty but it is a liea lie and he used it to force me to hide his wickedness i protested my innocence but he would never believe me and that because i refused to say who was guilty herrick placed his hands on the shoulders of the agitated man and forced him into the chair come said he in a more friendly tone you are not so weak or so bad as i thought corn you took the blame on yourself oh i know you protested your innocence to santiago still he would always think you guilty he is not the man to believe that any human being would shield another why did you shield mrs marsh for her sons sake said corn and for the sake of ida endicotte herrick stared what has she got to do with it i love her said corn in a low voice shading his eyes with the palm of his hand but she told me that her whole life was wrapped up in stephens if he knew that his mother had killed carr he is quixotic enough to throw up the whole fortune out of shame then he would not be able to marry ida and her heart would be broken it is for this reason that i held my peace yet you let stephen be assaulted said herrick his death would have ruined the life of ida just the same i did not know about the assault until after it was committed said corn quickly then santiagobut i cannot tell you the story in scraps like this better let me tell you all about myself and what led to my present weakness then you will appreciate what i have gone through herrick nodded it is best so go on you can safely confide in me corn i only retain the right to use such information as may clear up the mystery of this murder corn seized his arm you will not tell about mrs marsh he panted not without consulting you be certain corn that i am too true a friend to stephen to do anything harmful to him but there is much at stake and i must be allowed to use my own judgment you can rely on me i am sure of that said the clergyman in admiration you are a strongwilled man i was strong myself oncein a way but my crime crime i thought you had not killed carr no said corn in a low voice but i have the blood of a fellow creature on my hands for all that and he buried his face in his hands i judge no man said herrick after a pause but do not tell me anything that may render it difficult for me to keep sacred your confidence oh there is nothing you need fear from that replied corn drearily it was an accident wait till i recover myself the man took a turn up and down the room after five minutes he resumed his seat and spoke composedly my name is not corn he began langham is my namefrancis langham i was in the army so bess endicotte said nodded herrick corn smiled faintly yes i let that slip one day when she was talking of my looking like a soldier but she does not know my real name no one does save the bishop who gave me this living ah he was a good man he is dead now but i have to thank him for saving my reason and my life how was that asked herrick settling himself i was quartered in the west indies said corn after a pause and i there had a friend who joined about the same time as i did i need not tell you his name or the number of my regiment all you need know is the simple story of my misery my friend and i were always together they called us david and jonathan in the regiment well here corn nerved himself to a tremendous effort we were out shooting ducks we were parted amongst the reeds on the borders of the lake i thought i saw the brown back of a duck through some reeds without thinking i fired andi killed my friend oh my god when the mans head went down on the table herrick clasped him by the shoulder he was profoundly moved by the miserable story and could well understand how a once strong man had been changed by this tragic deed into a weak tremulous creature he did not say a word of comfort it would have been useless after a time corn recovered himself and continued in a dull hard voice there was an inquiry i was exonerated from all blame but i knew that i had killed my friend that i had the blood of a fellow creature on my hands i left my regiment and sent in my papers under another name i returned to england all my relations were dead save my uncle the bishop he tried to calm me i would not be calm i would have committed suicide but that i felt that it was my duty to suffer for my crime not a crime interposed herrick gently an accident yes it was yet i cant helpbut no matter i took to gambling to drown my remorse and grief i had never touched cards before they became a passion with me other men take to drinki to cards but all in vain when the excitement of the game was overin the morning then my misery came back i went to my uncle he implored me to find peace in the bosom of the church for he did not look upon me as the guilty wretch i was i consented as pentland corn i studied for the church i became a priesta curate and worked in the slums of the east end i left off gambling and felt more at ease thinking i was expiating my folly in an evil hourafter years of hard workmy uncle gave me this living i took it shortly afterwards he died then i realised the folly of accepting a charge where i had time to brood the past came back to me andi took to gambling again that was weak corn said herrick decisively i know it wasbut i was in a manner driven to it there was little work to do here society had no attractions for me so then i had longlong hours of agony i wanted to forget the past and you should have gone back to the east end corn nodded i should have done many things said he bitterly but that accident had taken all the manhood out of me i drifteddrifted well to make a long story short i took to going away to london at times to indulge in gambling and forget my sorrow i know and you went to that club in pimlico i did santiago told you that i suppose i met him there in an incautious moment i told him about colonel carr then i heard of the grudge he bore against him do you know the story of that expedition most of it i warned colonel carr against his enemy he laughed feeling safe in his tower then learning that i was fond of cards carr made me play with him it was said that i went to the pines to convert the man it was to gambleso low had i sunk herrick shook his head but he was so sorry for the man that he could not blame him for his folly corn resumed night after night i gambled there also i went to london and met don manuel at the pimlico club so the life went on and now for the story of that night here corn drew his chair closer to that of his listener and continued his revelation in a whisper i knew mrs marsh very well and saw much of her he said she was a very violent and terrible woman i know that said herrick remembering his own experiences oftentimes i tried to check her wrath she would call and see carr and they always fought when they met i think carr enjoyed tormenting her for he never forbade her visits he was a wicked man herrick one of the worst judging from his reputation yet he had his good points he helped me with money to pay my gambling debts not twice but thrice did he know your story no i could not tell it to him he would only have laughed at my remorse it would have seemed foolish to him he thought that i was simply a profligate clergyman and liked me for that very reason oh i do not defend myself herrick i sank low very low but my excuse must be the sorrow of my life it took all the courage and self respect out of me but after this i shall give up this charge and return to the eastend there i will work hard and forget my folly my sorrow the gambling will lose its hold over me then i think you will be wise go on well on that day of the murder mrs march came to me in a rage she had heard through friscohe had spoken in one of his drunken fitsthat carr was going to disinherit her son she went to see him from this house i tried to stop her but she would go they had a furious quarrel in the afternoon and mrs marsh swore that she would kill carr if he disinherited stephen she did not kill him in the afternoon no because he was alive after five oclock someone saw him at the window of the tower well mrs marsh dined with me after dinner she worked herself into a rage carr had laughed at her on that afternoon and had said that he would do what he liked with his money in fact from all she told me he treated her like a brute he was one you know herrick and jim nodded remembering the torture of the indian stephen was to come for her said the rector wearily the telling of this story fatigued him somewhere about nine oclock she was to meet him at the carr arms and take the bus back to beorminster after eight she went out it was so early that i wanted her to stop she refused at nine stephen arrived he could not find his mother she was not at the carr arms i then guessed that she had gone to see carr again in my fear lest she might do something dreadful i blurted out my suspicions at once stephen understood what i meant he went himself to the pines i waited for some time then i was in such a state that i followed the house was all ablaze but i heard nothing this was about half past nine or a quarter to ten i went up as far as the door on the steps i picked up that pistolwhich i guessed had been used by mrs marsh i slipped it into my pocket then i returned home i went also to the carr arms and learned that stephen and his mother had caught the bus some time after nine oclock i tried to think that mrs marsh had not shot the man i returned here to think it out santiago was waiting for me he had come by the last bus from beorminster and had been waiting since nine in fact he came just after i went after stephen it was really a quarter past nine when he came do you think he had been to the pines asked herrick keenly i do not know but you can learn that from the busman who drove him here i did not inquire myself he had come to get me to take him to see carr i refused and without thinking i threw the pistol on the table i was much agitated and he saw that he got out of me that i had been to the pines after looking at the pistol he said he would go to the pines himself i refused to let him go after a time i gave him some money and persuaded him to go i drove him to heathcroft station in my cart he took the pistol with him i did not notice that he had done so in a day or two when the murder became known he wrote and accused me of being the criminal i denied it but he had read the report of the death and how the wound had been inflicted by an oldfashioned weapon when he came here with joyce he insisted that i was guilty i said that i was not but would say nothing about mrs marsh it was this knowledge that he used to make me hold my tongue about the assault on stephen what could i do herrick said corn piteously appearances were against me santiago could prove that i had the pistol i had been to the pines and i owed colonel carr money also there was my own story had i been arrested all would have come out no i had to do what santiago told me humph said jim i can see your dilemma and what about mrs marsh did stephen suspect her no he told me that he had gone to the pines and looked at the house he saw nothing and heard nothing he therefore returned to the carr arms and found his mother waiting for him she said that he had missed her and evidently invented a story which satisfied him no herrick i do not think stephen suspected his stepmother but she shot the colonel i am sure she left my house in a rage and she several times threatened to kill him then she was not at the carr arms after nine the man was shot herrick nodded did you ask mrs marsh to explain no she fell ill if you remember and took to her bed i could not bring myself to see her i therefore held my tongue and i should have continued to do so but that don manuel threatened me therefore i determined to tell you all when i could what you heard from him is in the main true but i did not kill carr the blood of one human being on my hands is enough do you despise me herrick dr jim rose and took the hand of the unhappy man my friend i pity you from the bottom of my soul if you had only found some one to advise you all this trouble would not have occurred that is true but my uncle who knew the story of my misery was dead i shrank from telling anyone but when i got to know you and saw how strong and selfreliant you were and recognised also the goodness of your heart i felt that i could safely confide in you you will not tell anyone what i have told you need you ask me that said herrick with a hearty shake of the hand of course your secret is safe with me and about mrs marsh i shall see into that said herrick gravely remember santiago is a dangerous man i do not know what trouble he may yet cause if necessary i must use what you have told me about the crime but you may be sure that for stephens sake and for yours i shall be circumspect in my dealings with the matter as for you my friend wait here until this mystery is quite solved then go back to the east end or to the wild lands as a missionary yes said corn with a sigh i know only in that way shall i find rest the two men shook hands and parted very good friends corn returned to his study intensely relieved by the sympathy and by the fact that he had some one to share his secret herrick walked home to the pines wondering at the perplexity of the case he thought less of corn than of mrs marsh suddenly he stopped i see he said to himself this was why mrs marsh poisoned herself with an overdose of chloral poor woman chapter xxi another mystery the first thing that struck dr jim the next day was an alteration in the demeanour of his friend when herrick arrived at the pines after his visit to corn the squire had already retired to bed and was asleep so the servant said not wishing to disturb him jim had supper all to himself and went to his own room after a brisk walk on the terrace it struck him as curious that stephen did not come down to breakfast the next morning as he was now comparatively well on asking for the squire he was informed that marshcarr had gone out for a walk herrick therefore had another lonely meal wondering the while what had taken stephen out so early the young man did not return till late in the afternoon and then excused himself by stating that he had been to see petronella at beorminster she is still in that dull house said marshcarr gloomily although i think she is tired of it and wants to go to her own country but she refuses to go all the same what is her reason asked herrick sharply i cant get it out of her she says my mother left a message with her for you i suppose well why doesnt she deliver it and get away the message is for you herrick dr jim stared for me he cried why what possible message can your poor mother have left for me i really do not know replied stephen indifferently you had better see petronella and ask her she is looking very ill and if she stays much longer in that damp house she will die all right replied herrick coolly ill look her up some time i daresay the message is only one asking me to look after you so dr jim said but in his heart he was wondering if the dead woman had left behind her any confession of her crime she might have done so yet if she had poisoned herself to escape the consequences it would have been foolish of her to incriminate herself herrick resolved to see petronella at the first opportunity and learn what it was that she had to tell him if there were any really important message it was strange that the old italian had not delivered it long ago he had seen her frequently and there had been ample opportunity for her to fulfil her mistress dying wish however herrick put this out of his mind for the moment and turned his attention to stephen you are not looking well steve he said gravely your face is white you have dark rings round your eyes and a haggard look as though you had not slept all night i am not yet quite myself said marshcarr in a far more irritable tone than herrick had ever heard him use before i can see that and being someone else has not improved your temper i hope i have not offended you by going to town steve certainly not how can you think so well said dr jim looking at him it struck me that you have been trying to avoid me lately if you are tired of me steve you need only say so and ill pack up and go no im hanged if you will said the squire vigorously i cant do without you i have been worried a trifle and it has told on my present state of health ill be all right in a day or so is there anything i can help you with no it is a private matter and concerns myself only in the face of this intimation herrick could not press his inquiries and began to speak on other subjects stephen replying more or less absently as soon as he could he withdrew to his own room saying he wanted to lie down herrick did not seek to detain him but shook his head something is wrong and he wont tell me what it is he thought i wonder if santiago has been tampering with him in any way perhaps bess may know the reason for this change ill see her at once but the extraordinary thing was that he found bess changed also he had left her bright and merry anxious to probe the secret of colonel carrs death he returned to find her nervous ill at ease and disinclined to continue her detective investigations i dont think we shall arrive at anything she said when herrick pressed her i spoke to inspector bridge and he can do nothing he is a professional and if he fails how can we hope to succeed inspector bridge is a conceited ass replied dr jim gravely he knows absolutely nothing i know more than he does did you see the mexican and mr joyce asked bess i saw them and i spoke to them and i have found out something which i need not tell you just now it would be useless to do so i must search out the matter for myself and when i succeed you shall know bess sighed i do not mind in the least she said mournfully i have ceased to take an interest in the matter if frisco did not kill colonel carr i do not know who did humph you are changeable like all women said dr jim rather puzzled by her attitude yet never guessing its cause by the way did you find out anything about that pistol yes bess thought she might as well tell him as he would certainly learn the truth sooner or later from bridge the bullet fits the barrel i thought so said jim it is the weapon which was used yes answered bess then after a pause i made another discovery oh you did and about what my dear the bullet which was used it is of silver of silver what do you mean isnt it lead bess laughed rather irritably if it was of lead how could it be silver she asked and then went on to tell how the jeweller had examined the missile isnt it curious she said herrick nodded absently his eyes were fixed on the ground and he was trying to think of the reason mrs marsh could have had for using so expensive a bullet certainly the weapon was oldfashioned and she would have to manufacture the bullets for herself but why use silver in preference to lead or pewter in an ordinary household the supply of the last two metals was likely to be more plentiful than the first this was a problem but one of so trifling a nature that herrick dismissed it almost immediately he turned his attention to bess what have you and stephen been doing with yourselves he asked bess started violently and changed colour at once nothing jim she said stiffly why do you ask well you both look ill stephen is avoiding me and you are as silent as an owl not so stupid i hope said bess with a laugh at this moment ida entered the room and nothing more was said but ida also complained of stephens health i wish you would make him stay in bed dr jim she said i am certain that he has got up too soon and is not strong enough to go about look how pale he is and silent i cant get a word out of him herrick nodded i am not pleased myself ida this comes of my running away to town ill exert my authority he spoke to stephen and urged him to lie up for a few days the young man obeyed meekly enough and this very meekness made herrick uneasy he would rather that stephen had shown fight but the squire remained in bed took what was given him and hardly ever opened his mouth ida was in despair herrick was puzzled and the two met to discuss the situation when did he change like this asked dr jim i think it was the day after you left replied ida tearfully i went to beorminster to see flo and left him quite bright when i met him again he was dull and quiet and white yet bess was with him while i was away so he should not have missed me so much oh said jim with sudden interest so bess was with him was she hm it strikes me that bess herself is not so bright as she might be indeed you are right there said miss endicotte she is sad and silent just like stephen or else she is so gay that i think she is too excited she cries for the least thing and laughs without any cause humph sounds like hysteria to me yet bess is not given that way of course not said ida repelling the suggestion hastily she is a strong healthy sensible girl and above such weakness but as you say she and stephen have both changed i think here ida hesitated and looked down it amazed herrick when she looked up to see that her eyes were filled with tears he could not understand it all my dear girl what is the matter he exclaimed irritably are you ill also the devil has broken loose here since my departure iicanthelp it sobbed ida i thought that bess and stephen mightmight like one another of course they do ida why shouldnt they you dont understand what i mean i wonder if they were in love with one another and regret their engagements herrick burst into such a hearty fit of laughter that she was cheered i never heard such nonsense in my life he said where is your womens wit ida why bess loves me devotedly i am certain as for stephen he adores the very ground you walk on no its not that my dear girl then what can it be asked ida drying her tears i shall question bess until i find out said herrick grimly you have no idea how i can torture people with cross examination true to his idea dr jim sought out bess he came across her in the pine wood beside the fairy circle her eyes were cast on the ground and she looked despondent when she saw herrick she made as if to go away dr jim felt wounded bess dont you want to see me of course i do she said brightly only im not very well neither is stephen said dr jim and he saw by her start that the remark made her nervous have you two quarrelled no we have not we are great friends are you in love with one another then bess grew crimson and stamped how dare you say such a thing as that even in jest she said what would ida say if she heard it it was idas own idea replied herrick with a smile seeing you two so glum she fancied that you regretted your engagements and wanted to marry one another just say if this is the case bess and ida and i will console each other that would be only fair you know the first smile that herrick had seen on her face since his return dimpled the cheek of bess i never heard such nonsense i like stephen but you are the man i love you stupid jim you know that i am not quite sure if i do said jim gravely in love there should be complete confidence surely there is between us said bess nervously you cant look me in the face and repeat that bess made the attempt and failed it is nothing she said obstinately there is something however said dr jim sternly you and stephen have some secret between you which is making you both ill what is it i cant tell you jim then there is a secret i wont be questioned like this cried bess with angry evasion herrick took her by the arm and forced her to look into his face my dear girl he said i am to be your husband and you must obey and consult me in all things if you are playing with fire i must know do you not trust me bess yes but the secret is not my own in that case i wont press you for an explanation he said relaxing his grip you are a foolish girl to have any secrets from one who loves you but i suppose you have given your word not to tell yes i cannot break my word herrick nodded i do not ask you to the secret of stephen shall be respected i do not even ask you if it has to do with the murder of his uncle there is no need to ask bess looked at him irresolutely her face scarlet then without a word she went slowly away herrick looked after her and nodded to himself i believe she has found out something about mrs marsh and has told stephen that would account for their melancholy and for the secret which she says exists between them i shall ask stephen that same afternoon herrick went back to the pines and into the bedroom of marshcarr the young man was lying staring at the ceiling he seemed listless and wornout when jim entered he turned his face towards the wall so as to avoid his friends eyes herrick pretended to take no notice although he was cut to the heart by the avoidance of his gaze he was very fond of stephen and mourned over this thing which had come between them however it was necessary to take extreme measures if the situation was to be improved steve said herrick formulating a plan i cant eat alone any longer you must come down to dinner tonight i cant said stephen in a muffled tone i am too ill i know you are life and brightness and my society are what you need i was wrong to send you to bed as your doctor i now order you to get up stephen turned sulky i dont want to you do not know what is good for you my friend said herrick coolly i shall expect to find you dressed and down to dinner at eight after a good meal you will be more like your old self in this way after much coaxing scolding ordering and threatening jim got the young man to get up and dress marshcarr did so reluctantly enough for he was desperately afraid of betraying the secret he had told bess to the sharp eyes of herrick however he was really tired himself of being alone this seclusion could not be kept up for ever and it was as well to make a beginning and get back into the old routine he therefore dressed with some care after a bath and came down into the drawingroom looking much better herrick was standing on the hearthrug big and masterful here you are at last he said just in time for a glass of sherry stephen protested but herrick insisted you want something to make you eat after being in bed all day this sherry and bitters will do for a medicine i want you to eat and drink well tonight steve you must get colour into your cheek and fire into your eye what will ida say if i attend to you so badly stephen drank the sherry and felt better then they went to eat a capital dinner and dr jim saw that his friend tasted every dish he also made him drink champagne and talked the whole time in a lively way that was infectious by the time dinner was over stephen felt positively happy then came cigars coffee and cognac in the library now steve dont you feel better said herrick when they were seated visvis beside a blazing fire yes replied the squire and looking round the gorgeouslycoloured room at the evidence of wealth and luxury spread out on every hand i feel immensely better i suppose i shall pick up soon if you follow the advice i shall leave with you i think you will said herrick with intention and stared at the fire what do you mean jim you dont intend to ah but i do though steve i cannot stay with anyone who does not trust me wholly i want to be your friend your stepmother asked me to look after you i promised to do what i could but unless you give me your unreserved confidence it is useless for me to remain stephen rose agitated and began to pace the room i trust you in every way jim you know i do i know nothing of the sort steve you trust bess though ah she has told you cried marshcarr angrily no she has told me nothing but i am not a fool steve and i have eyes in my head i saw that she was as sad as you and by putting two and two together i became certain that there was something between you to make both sad bess would not tell me anything nor did i ask her she is a loyal little woman still from her manner i guessed there was a secret i am certain added herrick looking steadily at his friend that such a secret can only have to do with the death of your uncle now as i am looking after this case you must tell me what you know if you do not i shall throw up the matter and leave you i must be trusted all in all or not at all my friend while herrick was speaking stephen had sat down he changed from red to white from white to red again and his breathing became short and hard he saw that herrick was in earnest and that he would either have to tell or lose his friend in a tumult of anxiety he rose again and began to pace the room you put me to a hard test he cried perhaps i do replied dr jim calmly but it is to prove your friendship and your manhood tell me the truth you will despise me if i do said marshcarr thoughtlessly and regretted the words almost as soon as they had left his mouth herrick appeared unmoved although he was inwardly surprised i do not think anything you could say or do would make me despise you he said in his calmest tone i know you too well to think you would do anything dishonourable come what is it but stephen still remained silent his eyes on the ground he was debating whether he would go on or not herrick saw his hesitation and guessed its cause you have got over the worst now he said soothingly come along steve sit down and tell me no replied stephen hoarsely i prefer to stand up then suddenly it was i who fired those three shots into the body of my uncle was it said herrick quietly and why did you do that because i was mad at the time had you not better tell me the whole affair then i shall be in a position to judge of your madness stephen was amazed at the calm way in which his friend took the intelligence however he had gone so far that there was nothing left to do but to confess all as he had confessed to bess in a hurried manner the young man repeated the tale and informed herrick how bess had found out the truth by means of the revolver and now you must despise me was his final remark he sunk into his chair with a groan herrick paused for a moment to think then he carefully lighted his pipe i do not despise you by any manner of means he said calmly but i must admit that i think you are quixotic the wordto stephens mind was so inapplicable to the situation that he looked up astonished scarcely believing his ears quixotic he repeated i do not quite see well said herrick nodding you see mrs marsh is dead so no harm can be done to her it is good of you to screen her memory stop stop what do you mean herrick cried the squire much agitated i mean that you have taken this guilt on your head to screen your stepmothers memory stephen paused then he looked up resolutely yes he said i may tell you if i tell no one else it was my mother who fired those shots bess found out about my pistol which my mother used so i took the blame on myself you chivalrous ass said herrick with a growl and youve been fretting over this why didnt you save time by telling me before i thoughti thought never mind what you thought after you came to seek your mother at the rectory and did not find her what did you do stephen stared how do you know that i did not find her there he asked i know more than you think tell me all that you saw i saw nothing replied stephen corn said that my mother had gone to the carr arms i could not find her there i fancied in one of her rages she might have gone up to the pines i went there but saw nothing then i came back to the carr arms and found my mother she said i had missed her i thought she spoke the truth i never questioned her even after i heard of carrs death it never entered my head that she had killed the man then how did you guess it came into my head like a flash when bess said that my revolver was empty in three chambers i was certain that when i put it away the whole six were loaded even as bess spoke it entered my mind that my mother must have taken the revolver and have gone up after she left the rectory a second time to threaten the colonel she must have found him dead and then have fired the three shots into his body then she replaced the revolver i never thought of looking at it it was brought here along with some other things and it was only when bess i see nodded dr jim now look here steve had your mother another pistolan oldfashioned horse pistol no i am sure she had not at least i never saw her with one it was with such a pistol that carr was shot good heavens herrick you do not mean to say that my mother killed the man well i have heard your account and i have heard the account of corn i do not know how to reconcile the two corncorn the rector what has he to do with it a good deal so have joyce and santiago and others see here steve i have been searching for evidence in this case for a long time to spare you i said nothing but now that your stepmother has been brought into the matter it is but right you should know sit down i will tell you a long and interesting story rather dazed stephen did as he was told then dr jim related all that he had learned bringing the narrative down to the end of his interview with the revd pentland corn now what do you think he asked when the whole story was told i do not know what to think my motheri cant believe that she wouldwould it does seem strange said herrick but i tell you what it is my opinion that this message petronella will deliver will tell the truth chapter xxii a message from the dead the old italian woman looked very ill her form was shrunken her face thin and white her eyes unnaturally large evidently the misty climate of the midlands chilled her to the bone she had developed a hacking cough and shook with ague when the east wind tormented beorminster herrick was shocked at the change which had taken place in her appearance during these few short weeks apparently petronella was not long for this world but the near approach of death did not appal her she was terribly lonely now that her mistress was gone signor dottore she croaked when herrick made his appearance you have come to see me that is good but you will not cure me no i am dead signor dio mio what does it matter and she ended with a characteristic shrug punctuated with a cough indeed you do look ill petronella said dr jim sympathetically i must ask the squire to send over someone to look after you no replied the old woman obstinately i am well here and it will not be for long signor soon shall i be in my beautiful italy at least come over to the pines petronella you will be better attended to there and it is warmer but petronella crossed herself with pious horror go to that devil casa signor not me he had the evil eye that man who died si signor i went one day with the padrona and he swore at me i had an accident the next day cospetto a jettatura that signor but come in come in signor dottore this is the best room she led herrick into what had once been the drawingroom un bicchire de chianti signor signor stefan sent me some chianti no thank you petronella replied herrick sitting down on a dusty seat i want to have a chat with you we will talk in your own language if you like ah no signor i speak the english well thanks be to the saints my padrona was fond of speaking the english so we will talk signor dottore herrick acquiesced with a shrug he was quite prepared to talk any language she chose provided he got what he wanted he was not very certain how to go about the matter petronella was a shy bird and inclined to be obstinate he felt his way in a roundabout fashion so as to take her by surprise you will be glad to get back to italy petronella si si to the little town by the adriatic there i was born signor and there will i dieif i die not here ah dio you are in pain i fear petronella shrugged her lean shoulders i am always in pain she said my legs and bodyall pain but the padrona left me something to take thanks be to her povera signora and the pain goes not chloral i hope si signor a little bottle of chloral i take not much only when i am bad so bad then the pain goes be careful what you do petronella remember your mistress died from taking too much i shall be careful muttered the old woman eh dio mio what does it matter if i die all alone in this big house and signor stefano away you saw him the other day he told me said dr jim carefully approaching his business he told me you had some message for me petronella nodded and screwed up her thin lips only when he is in danger signor not now he is too well what do you mean petronella asked herrick puzzled by her nods signor dottore said petronella standing very straight my padrona before she died called to me she gave me a large letter and told me to give it to the signor dottore when signor stefano was in danger oh herricks eyes flashed he had always wondered how it was that mrs marsh had died without making any sign after the conversation she had had with him he quite expected that she would have left him a farewell message it appeared that she had done so but that the letter had been withheld by petronella according to instructions when did she write this petronella you said nothing about it at the time no i did what i was told to do signor ecco signor dottore it was in this way after my padrona got the letter from the postman in the middle of the day she was very angry and afraid afraid why was she afraid chi lo sa shrugged petronella she said nothing to me but she told me to bring pen and ink and paper all the afternoon she was writing eh how she did write then she put all the writing into an envelope signor and wrote our name on it she told me to give it to the signor dottore when signor stefano was in danger she said the signor dottore was a good man i give it to you signor but not now no and petronella closing her mouth firmly shook her aged head i think you had better give it to me this very minute petronella said herrick rising for signor stefano is in very great danger indeed as how signor dottore he may be accused of murdering his uncle colonel carr eh dio mio crowed the old women did i not say that the dead man had the evil eye did i not tell the signora that evil would come to the young signor from this death she caught herricks arm and fixed her glittering eyes on his face you swear to me that this is true what you say signor stefano is in danger eh eh i swear he is petronella replied herrick earnestly and this packet you talk of may save him ah si well do i know signor dottore that is so my padrona said that it told how the danger could be set aside you understand in this letter signor there is a strange story do you now what it is petronella no signor dottore the padrona did not tell me but she said it was a strange story and to be read when my young signor was in danger i will go and bring it la la la it is danger dio mio that wicked signor who is deadbirbantiladroni the evil eyethe evil eye coughing as she went the old woman hobbled out of the room dr jim sat still wondering if he was about to learn the truth at last if pentland corn was to be believed mrs marsh had been at the pines about the hour when the crime had been committed herrick did not now believe that she had killed the man herself as she had been possessed of the modern revolver with which the three shots had been fired it was impossible to imagine that she had fired one shot with an oldfashioned weapon and had then reverted to the use of the new revolver no the first shotthe death shot had been fired by some one else possibly by frisco mrs marsh had met the assassin in the house but for reasons of her own had not divulged the name also judging from her conversation she had known a great deal about carr and frisco especially about the latter seeing that she had warned jim that frisco might attempt to kill stephen as a matter of fact although the man had not struck the blow himself he had guided the hand of santiago to strike it herrick wondered if mrs marsh would say anything about the mexican at all events i shall know the truth at last he said after reading this letter the mystery will be one no longer but why did mrs marsh delay such important information all this time this was a question he could not answer he was still puzzling over it when petronella entered the room carrying a large blue envelope sealed with the carr crest this she handed to herrick with much ceremony there is my trust signor she croaked bear witness by all the saints that i gave it only when the young signor was in danger that is all right petronella i shall read it here will you stay no signor dottore i do not want to hear the secrets of my padrona i go to make myself a meal signor you stay here and read a glass of wine signor dottore eh pour lamor di dio un bicchire de chianti herrick politely refused the attention and petronella went grumbling out of the room she was a hospitable old soul and liked the doctor when he was alone in that dismal deserted apartment he drew up his chair close to the window and opened the envelope five or six sheets of closelywritten paper fell out also a typewritten letter after a glance at this last dr jim smoothed out the paper and began to read the storyas it might be calledcommenced abruptly this impetuosity was extremely characteristic of mrs marsh after a glance round the room dr jim settled to read the manuscript was as follows i am a wicked woman and an evil woman there you see mr herrick i place my character before you in the first line i know you are no fool or i should not make such a confession but when you read these pages i shall be in my grave so what you say or think does not matter if these pages are made public there will be blame enough from other people to save my boy they must be made public i can foresee that he will be accused of the murder of that beast carr i swear that he is innocent he knows nothing from the grave i send out my voice to defend him and you are a clever man herrick the defence of my poor boy i confide to you if you do not do your best i swear to haunt you if it be possible for the dead to return but after all you are too sensible to be frightened by this talk let me get to the facts of the case those will interest you more than the ravings of a dying woman so i begin i have said that colonel carr was a beast i repeat it he was a cruel tiger rolling in wealth he refused to give me any money yet he knew that i was accustomed to luxury and that stephen was his nephew no wonder i hated the man again and again i implored him almost on my knees to allow me sufficient to live on he always refused with his sneering laugh often i wonder that i did not kill him yet he had one good point he had loved his sister and out of love for her memory he made stephen his heir he also caused him to be educated but when that was done he refused to allow him an income to live like a gentleman i hated carr for that even if he had not allowed me money still his own sisters child should not have felt the pinch of poverty i love stephen he is a kind good boy and has put up with my vile temper all these years now that he is rich i hope he will marry ida if she does not prefer you and i do not think that is likely and live the happy life of a country gentleman my blessings on them both to come to the point which i know you want to reach on the night of carrs murder i was at the rectory it came to my ears through some words dropped by frisco when he was intoxicated that carr intended to disinherit my son whom he intended to favour i do not know nor do i care but i could not stand meekly by and see the lad robbed of what was righteously his own i went into saxham that afternoon to see carr and to remonstrate against his committing the monstrous injustice he contemplated he saw me with the greatest coolness and behaved quite in accordance with his character in vain did i point out that stephen was the sole living representative of his blood and was entitled by law to the property carr said that he had another relative living a cousin descended from an uncle of his who had been turned out of doors by his grandfather this uncle had married in america and had died leaving a daughter who married a yankee it was the son of this daughter to whom carr referred as his cousin furthermore he declared that his cousin had a son about the age of my stephen i asked him if he intended to leave the property to this cousin and his brat but this he denied he said that he had made the money himself and would leave it to whomsoever he pleased in a word he defied me i was helpless i could do nothing and that afternoon i left the pines mad with rage after a threat to kill carr needless to say he laughed at my threat why did i not kill him then you will ask because i wanted to give the man one last chance i warned him that i would shoot him if he persisted in his injustice i said that i would return that evening for my answer then i went to the rectory and had dinner with pentland corn here my dear herrick i may state that i had brought a pistol with meor rather a revolver it belonged to stephen who at one time had a craze for shooting the revolver was put away in its case which was on the mantelpiece of his study i remembered that it was there and on looking i found that all six chambers were loaded i knew that stephen never troubled about the weapon so i took it with me to the pines but on that afternoon i did not use it carr i said to myself should have his chance stephen was to come to the rectory for me about nine some time before that i told corn that i would go to the carr arms to meet stephen but i intended to go to the pines corn never suspected my intention i went quickly up to the pines shortly before nine i found no one in the lower part of the house frisco i suppose was sleeping off his drunken fit as i heard from napper that he had been drinking in the afternoon and had uttered threats against his master i knew that if anywhere carr would be in the tower the table was laid out for dinner but he was not in the diningroom i went upstairs and found him in the tower chamber he was in evening dress lying dead with his face downward i turned him over and saw that he had been shot through the heart at once i guessed that frisco had carried out his threat and had murdered the colonel but i thought carr might have altered his will before dying i was quite mad with rage thinking he had cheated me then i did what you will consider a terrible and a barbarous thing i fired three shots into his dead body i suppose it was wicked of me seeing that the man was dead but i am italian as you know and i was mad with fury at the thought of how this he had treated me the only revenge i could take was to have my share in his death so i fired three times it did me good and i came away much calmer i see you raise your eyebrows in horror my virtuous herrick ah bah you are english and coldblooded as a frog i am italian and i did what i did i have no other excuse to make i was only a few minutes in the tower chamber then i came down to get away lest i should be accused of the crime at the door below i met frisco he had his hat and coat on and a small bundle in his hand i said you have killed him he lies dead upstairs frisco denied that he was guilty and referred to my three shots i explained and told him he could call up the whole countryside to hear what i had done at the same time i warned him that as i had found the colonel dead i would accuse him of the murder frisco repeated that he had not killed him but said he might have done so later on carr had treated him so badly he was entitled to the money he was a relative of carrs i saw at once that this was the cousin and said so frisco did not deny it he told me he would have to go away as he might be accused of the murder and could not afford to remain and face the matter out but he warned me that if stephen took the property he would find means to get rid of stephen i laughed at him but i was afraid frisco was almost as big a brute as his master and cousin then seized with a sudden panic he ran out of the house and into the pine wood i left also and got down to the carr arms where afterwards stephen came for me i told him that i had been there all the time but that he must have missed me that is the truth as regards the events of that night i found carr dead and in anger i fired those three shots who killed the man i do not know i am inclined to believe it was frisco in spite of his protestations of innocence but you know how he ran away he went to london and from london he wrote to me i enclose his letter the next few days and the murder was known i said nothing i replaced the revolver in its case i persuaded stephen that i had not been to the pines on that night and he believed me then he became possessed of the property on certain conditions i breathed freely carr had not had the time to make a new will and my boy was safe so far so good then came the bolt from the blue i received the enclosed letter from frisco in which he threatened to write to the police and denounce me if he does this i am lost it will be difficult for me to defend myself the evidence against me if the matter is looked into will be too strong but you can see that for yourself herrick so i need not be more explicit under these circumstances and to save stephen i have made up my mind to die if the truth about my visit came to light even although i were proved guiltless of the murder stephen is quite foolish enough to give up the money he is a good boy but weakquixotic the only way i can save himand myself also for that matteris to die i am not afraid i have had such a wretched life that i do not think things will be worse in the next world besides the chloral against the abuse of which you are always warning me affords me a chance of slipping quietly and painlessly out of a world that is much too hard for me if i die stephen will be safe for frisco can do nothing his threats will fall harmless on the dead the man is dangerous though he might try to murder stephen i gave you a hint of that herrick but i know you are clever and so long as you are with my boy i do not fear for him in that way yet as regards the rest it is possible that frisco may denounce stephen as guilty of murder stephen told me he went to the pines that night to see if i had gone up there some one may have seen him then i used his revolver that would also be evidence against him and even if i destroyed the weapon that would still be evidence against him while i live i dare not tell the whole truth therefore i make this confession and i shall give it to petronella she will deliver it to you when danger threatens stephen from the contents of this you will know how to act so as to thwart frisco stephen is innocent and i verily believe that frisco is guilty in spite of his denial i can die in peace now for i know when this confession is in your hands that stephen will be safe i trust to your head and to your heart herrick i am sure you will not fail me no doubt you think i am going to extremes in dying that may be but i am sick of this life even if i lived i should have nothing but trouble besides my poor stephen has had quite enough of me i hope he will marry ida and be happy were i to live and remain with them i should spoil their happiness what would a sour old woman do with two such lovers well herrick i am about to seal this up and then i shall take a dose of chloralan overdose thus my death will appear to be an accident the world will think so i wonder if you will you also may be deceived but i think you will be clever enough to doubt the accident for you know i am not the woman to be careless do not show this to stephen unless you are absolutely compelled i love the boy and i want him to think the best of the woman who is gone so no more goodbye to you my dear herrick you have been a good friend to me continue to be so to my boy and also if you have any religion which i doubt pray for the soul of bianca marsh and here i sign my name for the last time bianca marsh when herrick finished this extraordinary document he laid it down with a sigh for the memory of the wrongheaded impulsive woman who had written it she had acted foolishly but for the best and since the poor soul had gone to her account herrick could not find it in his heart to blame her after a pause he took up the typewritten letter it was typed in purple ink was without date or address and even the signature of frisco was in print it ran as follows if you do not make your son do justice to me and to my son i will write and tell the police that you murdered colonel carr i must have half the money left by carr allowed to me by arrangement you can answer my letter by an advertisement in the daily telegraph then i will write to you and make arrangements all i want to know now is whether you will insist upon your son giving the money or face the disgrace of being arrested for the murder i have a witness who can prove your presence in the house if necessary i will come forward and give myself up i can save myself and condemn you choose i shall look every morning in the paper frisco herrick read this precious letter over twice he wondered that it was typed instead of written not that he did not see the reason for this but that he wondered how a hunted fugitive like frisco could procure a machine then the truth flashed into his mind robin said herrick rolling up the papers frisco met him went to his chambers and disclosed the fact that he was his father ha between the two of them they wrote this letter so as to frighten mrs marsh into giving them the money through her influence over stephen robin typed the letter and sent it the little scamp he did not tell me that humph i shall go again to town and see him then frisco must be produced from his hidingplace robin can and shall do that this was all very well but still the mystery of carrs death was unsolved mrs marsh was innocent she declared frisco to be guilty on the face of it he was but herrick had his doubts the case was getting more difficult at every fresh discovery for the first time he mistrusted his own powers of dealing with the matter i must consult stephen and bess said dr jim and left the house in his pocket was the confession of the late mrs marsh chapter xxiii the unexpected happens for the next twentyfour hours dr jim kept his counsel he said sufficient to set stephens mind at rest about his mother but did not tell the whole story or show the confession which he had obtained from petronella he wanted to turn matters over in his own mind before doing this the fact is jim was getting a little weary of the whole affair every new piece of evidence that came to light seemed only to complicate it he had felt sure that the paper left by mrs marsh would solve the mystery but although it told much it did not reveal all she declared in a halfhearted sort of way that frisco was guilty but she gave no proofs the man in that hurried conversation at the door had denied the charge and beyond the fact of his flight there was no evidence against him it occurred to jim that the best thing to do would be to drop the matter altogether it seemed useless to follow such a willothewisp still i do not like to do this on my own responsibility he thought after much consideration it will be best for me to lay all the facts before bess and stephen and go by what they say if they want to go on with it well and good if not i shall end it at once with this idea a most sensible one under the circumstances herrick called a council of war bess came over from biffstead and met stephen and jim in the library by appointment there herrick again told the whole story of his dealings with the matter and ended up by placing mrs marshs letter and its enclosure before them when the squire and bess had read the documents and were in possession of all the facts connected with the murder of colonel carr herrick made a speech to them on that basis it seems to me he said that it is foolish going on with this matter from all that i can see frisco is the guilty man but he has disappeared and i do not think it is worth while hunting him down to hang him for the murder of a scoundrel like carri beg your pardon steve but your late uncle was a scoundrelwill be no gratification to any of us moreover if he were caught and tried this letter might have to be produced i think it best to stop short at this point before stephen could give his opinion bess interrupted him to dwell after the custom of a woman on a minor point you foolish boy she said in reproachful tones i see that you took the blame of your mothers doings on yourself that was stupid you might have trusted me my dear bess i could not blacken her memory even to you perhaps not but i should have understood now that i think of it she added i wonder that i was so foolish as to believe you it was entirely opposed to your nature to fire at a dead man stephen winced do not say anything more about it bess he said she did that let the matter rest there and now about continuing the search i agree with jimit is best to do nothing more i am not so sure of that replied bess obstinately you see santiago may still try and get the money no said jim positively i do not think so he has been found out his conspiracy is at an end he knows that any further move on his part will meet with failure believe me he will return to mexico and give up fighting the wisest thing he can do what about joyce asked marshcarr he is worse than useless take away don manuel and joyce is lost he has neither the pluck nor the intelligence to carry through a plot on his own account but his father frisco may use him as an instrument frisco has to clear himself first joyce knows if he does anything with his father that i can have him arrested rather than that should happen i believe he would give up frisco to justice bess shuddered his own father she exclaimed oh as to that you can hardly blame joyce if he does not feel particularly filial his father has done nothing for him besides joyce senior deserted his wife and robin was devoted to his mother it is one of the best traits in his otherwise poor character no bess i think if robin came to chose between his own skin and that of frisco his father would be the one to suffer robin believes in everyone for himself he is a wicked little wretch he is and he is not weak rather than wicked his scheme to mix you up in the murder by means of that pistol was invented by the mexican joyce only did as he was told but in that case said stephen looking up i do not see what santiago had to gain robin wanted bess to marry him he wanted to inveigle her into the case so that she might not refuse out of fear but what would that matter to santiago her marriage with joyce would not have helped on his schemes true enough said herrick musingly but i daresay it was frisco who suggested the marriage he wanted to get the money through his son and perhaps thought he would get more if he put off robin with bess miss endicotte reddened thank you for nothing jim she said indignantly i was evidently to be a pawn in the game it seems to me that we have all been pawns said jim grimly just consider the mistakes that have been made while we have been searching for the true assassin of colonel carr bess laughed first of all i was suspected she said oh no that was only a halfhearted attempt on the part of frisco and his precious son there was no real evidence to implicate you bess i thinkspeaking for myselfthat i first suspected robin joyce it was your remark about his income stephen that aroused my suspicions well the chain runs as follows and herrick ticked off on his fingers joyce first on the authoritymainlyof the pistol he said he got it from the don so i suspected manuel he proved his innocence and accused pentland corn i saw him and he told me he had picked up the pistol on the lawn of this house it was his belief that mrs marsh was guilty and myself said stephen with a smile no you were like bess and came into the matter on your own account i never believed you had anything to do with the affair but your stepmother is the last whom i believed might have something to do with it certainly she had but from her letter we know she didnt kill the man and here we come to a dead stop what about frisco said marshcarr i believe he is the guilty person said dr jim positively are you going to defend him bess the girl looked troubled i admit that matters look black against him she said slowly he threatened the colonel he was alone in the house with him and mrs marsh found him ready to fly on the other hand there is something to be said in his favour evidently he should have had a share in this treasure for some reason the colonel would not give it to him during his life and only afforded him a chance of getting it after stephens death not even then interrupted herrick for if stephen had fulfilled the conditions of the will the fortune would become his absolutely and he would be able to will it away then i cant understand it said bess unless frisco knew of this unjust willfor that it is if he helped to get the treasureand murdered the colonel out of revenge i believe he did said stephen no put in dr jim briskly i do not agree with you it is my opinion that what mrs marsh said to me before she died was the right view what was that frisco and the colonel fought a duel i believe that frisco came back from the inn drunk and filled with fury against the colonel it might have been that through the visit to mrs marsh in the afternoon he had found out all about the will the colonel probably defied him and then frisco would suggest a duel he fired first and the colonel fell with his still loaded weapon in his hand that is all theory said bess still defending the exsailor but you seem to forget jim that the death shot was fired with that clumsy pistol if there had been a duel frisco would have had at least as good a weapon as the colonel there are plenty of revolvers of the new pattern in the gunroom i am sure frisco would not have placed himself at such a disadvantage and again the silver bullet why should frisco have used that dr jim rubbed his head with a vexed air i am afraid you are right bess he said a duel is out of the question i cant see anything ahead so far as i am concerned i give up trying to solve the riddle so do i said marshcarr i know now that my poor mother did not kill the man so that is all i care about let the matter rest herrick you can send santiago to mexico i suppose yes but i think he will want some money give him what he wants and let him go i think that will be best and as for joyce ill see that he keeps quiet bess struck in what about frisco he must look after himself said dr jim innocent or guilty we can do nothing with him so long as he remains in hiding but you can find him through joyce yes i can but on the whole i prefer to let sleeping dogs lie no bess the whole thing is ended now come the peaceful times it is necessary to cultivate our garden as says voltaire stephen laughed i think so too said he for my part i intend to put the whole matter out of my head and arrange with ida as to the date of our marriage as my poor mother has died so lately we can have a quiet wedding but married i shall be and as soon as i can why asked bess in the first place i want ida to be my wife because i love her dearly and in the second i want to marry her and make my will after the marriage in her favour why cant you make it now it would not be legal marriage invalidates a will herrick who had been thinking looked up with bright eyes stephen he said you are afraid of frisco yes i am he may try and murder me to get the money so by marrying ida and leaving it to her i shall put the matter out of his power once he gets to know that the money has gone from him for ever he may leave me alone he tried through santiago to kill me once and failed he may not fail the second time there is something in that said herrick and then the council of waras bess called itbroke up the final decision of the three was to let the case stand where it was they washed their hands of the whole affair for the next fortnight there was absolute peace stephen and ida arranged to be married in two months and dr jim began to talk of his future with bess jim did not want to live with stephen after the marriage and yet he could not leave him without forfeiting his income of course stephen insisted that herrick should take a certain sum a year until he got on his feet but jim would not consent to this i cant take money i do not work for he said decisively if you will lend me a small sum ill go back to london and start a practice in a new place i expect it will be a long time before i am able to marry bess but she will wait for me bess expressed herself favourably on this point she would wait for jim till her hair grew gray and meantime she could manage biffstead for frank after ida was settled at the pines neither stephen nor ida could do anything with this obstinate couple and they gave up the attempt in despair but i think it is an infernal shame your leaving me in the lurch said stephen remember what my mother said oh i intend to see you through the year in case frisco should attempt to stop your visits to the vault replied jim but after that i must go and carve out my own fortune well who knows what may happen by then said marshcarr he was determined in some way to benefit jim ill have to force the money on the fellow he grumbled to ida bess is just as obstinate she sighed however they will be with us for some months yet wait and see stephen herrick meanwhile was priding himself that all was at an end he wrote to joyce stating that he intended to do nothing and also let santiago know his decision from neither did he receive an answer but this he did not mind they are powerless to do harm he said to bess and indeed he never expected to hear of the pair again but one morning bess came to him with the daily telegraph and pointed out in silence a cipher message in the agony column it was worded similarly to that put in before and asked frisco to meet the inserter at hyde park corner at three oclock in two days humph said jim meditatively robin wants to see his father again what will you do jim asked bess anxiously nothing why should i if robin meets his father they will plot against stephen they cant do anything but physical harm and i am always with him but bess was not to be put off in this way i really think you should write to mr joyce about it jim he will not answer perhaps not but he will see that you have your eye on him true enough ill see to it bess jim fully intended to do so but foolishly put off the matter for a few hours he wrote to joyce only on the day before the appointed meeting and on the next day received a telegram to the effect that it was not joyce who had inserted the cipher nor so said the wire had don manuel what the devil does this mean said jim to himself is it a lie or a truth if a lie manuel and joyce are plotting if true someone else is taking a hand in the game ill see bess the advice of bess was that jim should go up to town without delay i am sure there is some mischief brewing she said you had better go up by this afternoons train no said jim after a pause ill see steve first he must know all about this before i go in fact i think ill take him with me but he has gone away for the day said bess you know he went out cycling with ida he wont be back all day you have no time to lose ill wait until he comes back said herrick i tell you what bess this may be a scheme to get me away from stephen in order that they may try and hurt him during my absence after that assault of manuels im never easy in my mind away from the boy i cant leave him here if i go up to town he must come with me bess was struck by this view of the matter there might be something in it she thought the consequence was that herrick waited the return of stephen and arranged to go up to town with him the next morning all the same stephen laughed at dr jim you are a a perfect old woman about me he said i can look after myself i am sure you can deal with honourable foes said jim but here there is every probability you may be struck in the dark stephen shrugged his shoulders very well jim you know best we can go to town by the midday express tomorrow but before they left the pines they received a surprise in the times newspaper which usually arrived shortly after eleven stephen found some news which surprised him he went at once in search of dr jim and found him buttoning his gloves on the doorstep waiting for the cart to come round what do you think of that herrick said the squire the devil said dr jim and well he might there was a paragraph in the paper to the effect that the man called frisco who was wanted for the murder of colonel carr of saxham had been captured on the preceding day no further details were given but what herrick read was quite sufficient he dropped the paper and stared at stephen shall we need go up to town now asked the squire yes we must catch this train here comes the cart i shall go and see joyce at his flat he may know what this means what about bess asked stephen we have no time to talk over the matter with her now she will see the news in the telegraph we can send her a wire from beorminster station not to worry herself jump in steve in a few minutes they were driving hard for the cathedral city at the station herrick sent the proposed wire to biffstead and they caught the express we shall be in town for a few days over this said herrick when they were comfortably settled i think i can see see what asked marshcarr what it means this is the revenge of that blackguard santiago for losing the money do you think he put in the cipher i am sure he did and gave information to the police meantime no doubt when frisco arrived at the rendezvous thinking to meet his son he was arrested by officers in plain clothes i have not much sympathy for frisco who i fear is a bad lot all the same it is hard that he should be tripped up in his stride by that brute of a greaser it might be so i wonder if don manuel has stayed to see the matter out it is the kind of thing he would like to do oh i am sure of that steve all the same he wants to look after his own skin when frisco is tried he will tell all he knows about the mexicans doings out of revenge santiago cant face an inquiry as you know his assault on you is enough to get him into serious trouble no my friend don manuel has done his mischief and cleared out by this time he is on his way to the new world beast muttered herrick between his teeth i should like to make it hot for him on arriving in town herrick sent stephen with the luggage to the hotel in jermyn street and himself drove off to west kensington he learned from the porter that joyce was in and ran upstairs in a few minutes he was seated in the little mans drawingroom listening to his reproaches i did not think you would sell me like this herrick said robin wringing his hands in his usual womanish way whatever i may have done to you you should have kept faith with me you always pretended to be so superior ah did i said herrick calmly but a trifle bewildered at these accusations and now perhaps you will tell me what i have done you know well enough you put that cipher in the paper and betrayed my unfortunate father i did not think it of you he was arrested at hyde park corner yes at three oclock yesterday of course he thought that i put the cipher in and came to meet me but why do i tell you all this you are perfectly well aware of the success of your treachery herrick shrugged his shoulders at the present moment he did not think it necessary to correct the man how about your friend santiago i wish he was here to punish you cried joyce venomously he was quite as clever as you herrick but you waited till he sailed before plotting to capture my father so the don has sailed when did he go four days since replied robin dropping into a chair as if you didnt know why do you come here to exult over me because i wish to tell you that you are wrong in thinking i put that cipher in the paper as i wrote to you from saxham i decided to let the matter rest whether your father was guilty or innocent i did not care so long as you and he left marsh alone the man who put that into the paper was santiago i do not believe it herrick shrugged his shoulders as you please but it is true for all that i know the cipher but i give you my word i did not insert it you knew the cipher and i am sure you did not use it to betray your father the only other person who knew it was the don and he has left this last sting behind him out of revenge for losing the money robin shook his head i might believe that he said if i did not know it was you but i tell you it was not cried jim impatiently it was it was those private detectives who worked for you told me all about it you told them to have my father arrested belcher and kidd cried herrick jumping up ah you know the name yes they gave notice to the police and had my poor father taken i guessed it was their work and through you dr jim stood for a moment in a brown study he saw well enough what had occurred the ferret had made use of santiago to find out the business and knowing of the reward had made use of the information extorted from santiago i expect they let him leave england on condition that he told them the business and helped them to trap frisco by means of the cipher the scoundrels well said robin what are you going to do now i am going to see belcher and kidd said herrick and i tell you robin that your friend santiago has done all this i have had no hand in it but why should santiago you had better ask your father that said herrick i suspect he has no cause to love that mexican you can believe me or not robin but the truth is the truth i have not played you false robin shook his head he still doubted dr jim tried no longer to convince him but left the flat to have it out with the treacherous firm he had employed chapter xxiv the story of frisco it was not until herrick was well on his way back to the centre of the town that he remembered his omission to ask robin about the typewritten letter but after all it did not matter he knew perfectly well that joyce had typed it at his fathers dictation and the denial or admission of the little man would make no difference things had got past that point i must see belcher and kidd said herrick to himself and learn exactly how santiago managed the business then ill give frith a look in i must find some way of speaking to frisco now that he is driven into a corner he may tell the truththat is if it is not likely to hang him when he arrived at the strand office of the private inquiry firm he was received by kidd belcher it appeared had gone out for the day on business kidd was a heavy man with a red face and a pair of leering grey eyes dr jim could put up with the ferret but kidd he detested however as kidd was the only representative of the firm present he tackled him and with no light hand for jim was in a royal rage at the way he had been tricked by this cunning pair of rascals what is this i hear about the arrest of the man frisco he asked just this doctor replied kidd in his heavy voice but civilly enough don manuel santiago gave belcher the tip how frisco could be trapped and as me and him wanted to earn the reward we fixed the matter up against my wish retorted dr jim did i not say that you were not to meddle in the matter and why shouldnt we get the reward if we could sir i had my own reasons that frisco should be left at large you have spoilt a plan of mine and likely as not have caught the wrong man as to that sir said kidd doggedly i dont know but right or wrong weve caught the man and claim the reward it is offered by mr stephen marshcarr said herrick coolly and the matter is in my hands it is just as likely as not that i may stop mr marshcarr from paying you one penny you had better have done my business properly kidd we did do it properly said kidd in a surly tone i dont think so it was my wish that the mexican should be watched you have let him leave the country i didnt protested kidd who would have been insolent but that he was afraid of losing the reward that was belchers game belchers price for receiving instructions how to trap frisco scoffed herrick do you think i dont know that santiago taught the cipher to your damned partner you might be civil dr herrick i shall be what i please you were engaged by me to do certain business and you have done it badly had i wanted frisco caught i should have told you now just you let me know how it all came about what about the reward sir ill see to that you foolsto go against me like this i can do your business considerable damage by telling the way you have tricked me oh sir you wont do that growled kidd now thoroughly frightened it all depends upon how you conduct yourself the harm is done but i must know how santiago managed the business it was this way sir replied the cowed kidd belcher watched the foreign cove sir and kept out of sight but the don knew him from going to the gambling club ah thats another matter i can spoil for you kidd i know too much of your shady business for you to play the fool with me go on man it took kidd all he knew to keep his temper under this speech but he knew that dr herrick would do what he had threatened if he was not implicitly obeyed had jim been a smaller man kidd might have tried conclusion with his fists but he knew herrick too well to attempt such folly once upon a time kidd had seen the doctor thrash a larger and much heavier man from that day he resolved never to have a fight with a man so versed in the noble art as this hightempered gentleman well sir he continued in a sulky growl it was this way santiago spotted belcher and asked him what he was up to belcher would not tell but in the end the don got the truth out of him then he said that if belcher and me could catch frisco we could get a bigger sum of money than by watching him belcher was always anxious to know what was at the back of all this when he heard it was the carr murder case he saw it was a big thing for him and me so he said he would let the don go if he helped him to catch frisco then the don showed us the cipherhe wrote it out himself and put it in the newspaper frisco came to the place and me and belcher had a detective and a warrant we caught him easy he is now in quod sir and santiago is on the high seas on his way to mexico you are a precious pair of scoundrels kidd why did you tell mr joyce that i had managed all this business it was the don as asked us to do that sir to make trouble i suppose said herrick rising you send belcher to see me at the guelph hotel this evening i have something to say to him take care sir the ferret aint an easy man to tackle herrick paused at the door and looked the big man up and down confound your insolence he said do you think you or that rat can stand up against me i can ruin you both if i choose and stop your getting that reward as for belcher if he is impudent ill wring his neck i am sorry we did it sir you may well be was herricks grim reply but i aint going to be bullied by anyone said kidd with sudden anger that is quite enough my man replied dr jim opening the door and speaking quietly if you try that game youll get the worst of it kidd looked dangerous for a moment but after a glance into the eyes of his proposed antagonist he cooled down considerably he knew perfectly well that herrick could smash him moreover the calm courage of herrick quelled his brute passion dr jim waited for a time then departed leaving kidd growling and cursing in impotent rage a dangerous ruffian thought herrick as he went into the strand but i think he and belcher know me too well to play the fool for the moment he intended to go back to the guelph hotel and see stephen but on reflection drove to the solicitors it was necessary that he should interview frisco and frith would be the man most likely to obtain for him the permission to do so the lawyer was in and expressed his pleasure at the capture of colonel carrs assassin as to that i am not certain said herrick lightly i want to hear what he has to say frith and you must get me permission to see the man dont you think he killed carr asked frith on the face of it i do replied herrick all the same there have been so many surprises in this case that i am prepared for more besides i am rather mad over the business and he told frith how he had been tricked by belcher and his partner couple of scoundrels said frith nodding its not the first dirty trick they have played dont you engage them again dr herrick ill find men who are more to be trusted i hope to heaven that i wont have occasion to employ any more private detectives i tell you what frith ever since i have engaged in this affair i feel as though i had been bathing in dirty water but that i promised mrs marsh to protect her son i should not have done it you seem to have gone pretty exhaustively into the business said frith after he had heard the whole story for an amateur you have managed remarkably well herrick laughed i have made mistakes i admit but then as you say i am only an amateur and not the detective of fiction he never makes mistakes i wish he had had this case to deal with however the thing is nearly at an end thank goodness it will end with the hanging of frisco who knows he may have some other story to tell you may be sure he will swear that he is innocent said frith very likely responded herrick and the queer thing is frith that he may really be innocent it looks to me from what you have told me as though he were guilty oh as to that ive thought several people guilty and have always found out that i am wrong when they came to explain however i want to see this man and hear what he has to say can you manage it ill see what i can do you are at the guelph hotel aint you very good ill see to it i might come along and call on marshcarr i should if i were you replied dr jim with a laugh always be attentive to your clients frith leaving the solicitor to arrange matters herrick went back to the hotel and dinner with stephen he told him all that he had done and the squire was much interested i hope it is coming to an end though he said i have had about enough of this sort of thing think of me said jim with a shrug oh you have behaved like a brick jim i do not know how to thank you bosh my dear chap there is no question of thanks between you and myself i promised your mother to see you through and i intend to keep my word and you wont let me make things right for you grumbled stephen wait till everything is squared up then we will see i may ask you to be my banker after all well steve santiago has gone away so you are relieved of at least one of your enemies joyce can do nothing without his father and that gentleman is in gaol will you want me to go with you tomorrow no prefer to see him alone ill get more out of him in that way i wonder what ill hear this time however let us think no more of the matter just now we might take a turn down to see the earls court exhibition theres always something going on there its not exactly like a theatre steve or i should not ask you to go but you must be cheered up somehow we cant stay in this dismal hotel all the evening talking about a criminal stephen assented as he always did to whatever herrick proposed they went to the exhibition and spent a pleasant evening when they returned dr jim retired straightway to bed i shall have a lot of talking to do tomorrow so i must get as much rest as i possibly can said he in some mysterious way frith obtained the required permission and herrick found himself introduced into a small cell where frisco sat on his bed in a gloomy frame of mind after exchanging a few words with the warder frith got the man to go away leaving herrick and frisco alone so you are dr herrick remarked frisco calmly i am glad to meet you he spoke in a rather refined voice and did not at all look like the truculent ruffian herrick had expected to meet he was no longer fat but had quite a shapely figure also his face had lost the redness of incessant drinking misfortune had sobered and improved the man he was plainly dressed in a suit of black serge which as he afterwards informed herrick had been supplied by his son but even if he had been still more changed dr jim would have recognised him from the criescross scar on his forehead frisco saw him looking at it and smiled the colonels handiwork said he quietly he marked me with a bowie in los angelos one drunken evening but i gave him as good as he gave me dr herrick he lost a finger and frisco fell to whistling at the pleasing recollection there was no doubt about the man being a scoundrel herrick felt his way carefully how did you know me he asked abruptly frisco smiled i heard the man who came with you call you by your name as for the rest of course robin has told me all about you you are a clever man dr herrick and i think a kind one if you had not been you would not have burdened yourself with that miserable rat i have the misfortune to call my son all the same added frisco with a scowl you trapped me in rather a shabby way ah that is one reason why i came to see you said herrick coolly i did not trap you at all no one was more surprised than i at the news of your arrest it was santiago who put that cipher in the paper and told the police about you and santiago is beyond your reach on the high seas so you see that i am not so mean as you thought me thats it said frisco you always fought fair and i could not understand your playing low down like this so it was the greaser was it by heaven when i catch him frisco doubled his arm its time he was out of the world said frisco a beatings too easy ill go west for him how do you mean youll go west asked herrick thinking of the mans position which wasapparentlyconsiderably within the shadow of the gallows frisco looked at him with a careless laugh he understood oh ive been in worse holes than this he said why once in california the rope was round my neck for horsestealing carr got me out of that mess you were a great friend of carrs why said the man slowly he was my cousin you know and we had the same blood in usthe bad carr blood how i ever came to have such a brat of a methodist parson for a son i cant make out got it from his mother i suppose she was always a whimpering devil i didnt come here to discuss your son and wife joyce friscos my name for the time being said the man coolly when i get across the pond again ill take to a more christian one humph you wont have an easy time getting out of this scrape well no youre about right there herrick you dont mind me dropping the mister i hope i feel friendly to you youre about the only man of the whole lot stephen isnt a bad chap but if he hadnt had you beside him id have got that money well im to be tried for my life what are you going to do herrick something quixotic replied the doctor robin has no money neither have you so i am going to supply you with a solicitor and see you through if you are guilty i wish to see you hanged if innocent free all the same said herrick frankly i tell you candidly frisco that i dont think it fair to hang you for the killing of a brute like carr frisco stared at dr jim in a hard unwinking manner but he was visibly moved youre a white man doc said he and im a bad lot all the same if you dont mind he held out his hand ill take that only on one condition said herrick that you tell me you are innocent of murder frisco drew back his hand and recovered his hard manner you bet im not he said that is where carr had the pull over me there are two towns in south america i darent go near he burst out laughing so you wont shake hands said he well i dont blame you i am a bad lotbut carr was a damned sight worse sonny you can take that from me we are wasting time i think said herrick coldly i want to help you if i can you shall have a lawyer to defend you but i want to ask you as man to mandid you shoot carr frisco thought for a moment stroking his chin well theres not many men id tell my mind to but you are one i did not kill carr then who did ill tell you in a few minutes but you let me reel out my yarn first i know most of it from robin and santiago you dont know all replied frisco quietly ive been with carr these twenty years and more he was a devil and treated me like a dog i helped him to get that treasure and he cheated me of my share of it i shouldnt think you were the man to be cheated not in an ordinary way you bet but the colonel had the bulge on me i guess he could have handed me over to the authorities in san francisco for a murder oh dont look scared herrick im not going to own up to all my crimes i have committed heaps though oh damn your beastly talk said herrick angrily for the shamelessness of the man made him sick just tell me about that night all in good time sonny said the unmoved frisco i stayed with the colonel and let him keep my money because i did not want my wife to know i was alive she was a good woman and i treated her like a brute that was one reason the second was because of my own skin i did not want to be hanged and carr could have hanged me any day the third reason and here frisco looked curiously at herrick youll hardly believe the third reason but it was a kind of tenderness for carr somehow devil as he was i liked him never met a man i cottoned to more he saved my life i saved his we fought with knives and with fists and played the devil with one another all round yet somehow we stuck together and never went back on one another rum thing wasnt it herrick honour amongst thieves said dr jim with a shrug you bet thats it retorted frisco so you can see herrick that i was not the sort of man to put carr out of the way i got drunk so did he but we held together in that blamed house always waiting for death ah the indians i suppose santiago told you that i guess said the man yes there was some half spanish half indian greasers in lima that would have followed us to the end of the world had they spotted our whereabouts santiago was one but he wished for the money on his own hook and didnt split well carr is dead so he is safe enough but if im not hanged i guess santiago will let out on me then ill have a time getting away was it on account of this fear that carr built the tower frisco nodded youve hit it queer chap carr a mixture of bravado and fear he threw down all the fences and walls and left the doors of the house open every night just to show he was not afraid all the same he never slept but in that tower i didnt if any of the greasers had come theyd have knifed me easy enough well carr went under before his time but by the hand he least expected who was it asked herrick impatiently well drawled the ruffian it wasnt mrs marsh we had a talk i know all about that i also saw the letter you wrote her oh you did she kept that as an ace robin typed it on his blamed machine for me i wanted to get the money quietly but the old lady went under in time and spoilt my game there she killed herself said herrick curtly did she now said frisco in admiration she was a screamer of a womannot like my wife killed herself lord he chuckled go on with your story it is a story isnt it well i guess it was this way i let carr keep the money when he was alive on the understanding that it was all left to me he made a will in my favour and then the devil made a later one giving the money to stephen with a reversion to me if his bones werent looked after i know said herrick coolly and you tried to have stephen disabled right you are and the blamed santiago bungled the affair if i had been on the spotwell thats all done with about the will mrs marsh came and kicked up a row about the will in favour of her son saying the colonel was going to alter it she picked up something of that from me when i had a cargo aboard but i never knew till after she came how carr was tricking me when she wentand she did curse himi had a row with carr he told me the kind of will hed made we had almost a stand up fight he brought in the murder business about me as usual and i knuckled under as usual then i went off to drink rum at the carr arms yes and to threaten the colonel oh that wasnt on my own account all i meant was that if i gave the tip to the lima greasers carr would be knifed that fool napper thought i meant to do the job myself well sir i came back and lay down to sleep off the rum carr got his own dinner and then dressed himself up as he always did blamed foolishness i always called it cooking your dinner and then wearing a starched shirt to eat it pah frisco spat he wanted to keep his selfrespect i suppose he had no occasion for an article of that sort herrick selfrespect and carrwell i should smile however i was asleep when i was pulling round sober and thinking of getting up to eat i heard a shot oh i am too used to the sound of shooting not to know it when i hear it i wondered if carr was in the shooting gallery after a timetwenty minutes maybe i got up and went into the gallery no one there i went up to the tower after visiting the diningroom i found the colonel dead i was in a fright i can tell you in a flash i saw that my neck was in the rope i had threatened the colonel and theyd think id killed him also i was wanted in frisco and south america and half a hundred places my name would come out maybe but i am not afraid of that now herrick and i would be turned off as sure as a gun i went downstairs and drank some wine in the houseand coming down from a room under the one in which carr lay shoti saw someone as he came down the tower steps it is my opinion he shot the colonel if it wasnt him i dont know who could have done it and who was it you say why dont jump herrick it was sidney endicotte herrick stared that lad never killed the colonel he said then who did asked frisco impatiently that boy just hated carr i never could make out why and he was halfwitted besides then there was the pistol i read about in the papers it is just the kind of weapon a boy of that sort might pick up cheap in a shop of sorts a man like me would have used a derringer no im sure that boy shot him he came right upon me as cool as you like and says hes quite dead did he say that i swear he did hes quite dead says sidney then before i could get my breath he went out into the night and i lost him why did you not follow i had to think of my own safety it was no use my accusing a boy and a half idiot you see no one would believe hed killed carr when i was in the houseand with my blamed past i just went to the back to make up a bundle and clear out while i was packing i heard three shots and jumped for the door lord i was in a fright it was mrs marsh yes she came down looking like a tigress and said id killed carr i was at the door with my bundle i denied it and said id make it hot for her she said id better look after myself and cleared i didnt wait you may be sure for in spite of her firing the shots i didnt know but what shed rouse the village so i went straight across the moor and caught the train at southberry here ive been hidden in london ever since i had money when that ran out i dropped across that cipher in the paper and met my fool of a son thenwell you know the rest its a strange story said herrick much distressed it did not seem at all unlikely but that sidney had killed the colonel its a true one well what are you going to do i shall see this boy and find out if what you say is true oh i expect hes such an idiot that hell think hes done something fine and own up but that my neck is in danger i would not split on sidney but theyll only shut him up in an asylum they would hang me so of two evils i choose the least are you off herrick yes ill see if this is true and get you a lawyer thanks old man youre a good sort solong and frisco quite calm waved his hand as dr jim left the cell he did not seem to be in the least afraid and evidently thought his release was a foregone conclusion a dangerous coolheaded ruffian was frisco chapter xxv sidney speaks out after that interview with frisco dr jim took stephen straight off to saxham there was nothing left for him to do in town frisco was in prison and safe enough joyce shut himself up in his flat and would not even reply to the note herrick wrote him belcherfor obvious reasons had not called at the guelph hoteland with his partner was keeping out of the doctors way jim saw frith for a brief few minutes instructed him to see after the defence of frisco and then drove to paddington where marshcarr awaited him by favour of the guard and five shillings they secured a smoking carriage to themselves when the train was fairly out of the town and whizzed through a desolate winter country dr herrick looked at stephen what do you think of it all he asked lighting his pipe this story of friscos yes its a living truth i can see by your face that you wish to believe the man a liar he is but not in this instance what he says is absolutely true i saw his eyes when he spoke the tongue may lie but a mans eyes jim shook his head but it cant be true cried stephen looking white and worried good heavens jim if sidney really shot carr think of the disgrace to ida and bess ourselves i dont mind that but these poor girls well said jim after a pause you see its not so bad as it might be i am sure you must know of the estimation sidney is held in round about saxham if it comes out that he shot the colonel no one will express any surprise its no slur on the girls steve sidney is looked upon as something beyond the pale of humanity what will they do with him asked stephen anxiously if he really did commit the crime he will be placed in an asylum the boy is too queer to be judged by ordinary standards frisco cleared out although he knew sidney had killed carr because he thought no one would believe the boy had done it the suspicion certainly would have rested on frisco he would have been wiser to have given himself up but for the reasons i told you ofthe same reasons that kept him quiet under the colonels unjust appropriation of his propertyfrisco preferred to cut he is wiser now that he has had time to reflect over the matter his devilries in the americas were done under other names and as joyce he will not be wanted in san francisco i daresay if he had not been caught he would have given himself up in the long run it was the don he was afraid of now the don is away frisco is convinced he will be set free he must stand his trial certainly i have told frith to see after him but his defence will be that sidney killed the man there is no way of averting that the question in my mind said herrick looking at marshcarr is whether the boy really did do so have you any doubt on the subject asked stephen eagerly i have a great many doubts replied jim dryly and until the person who really murdered carr confesses i shall continue to doubt you see steve ever since i took up this matter i have been following up false trails every person i have stumbled upon and to whose guilt the evidence at the time procurable pointed has laid the blame on some one else who in turn has passed on the guilt to another party i suspected joyce he accused santiago the don said pentland corn was guilty corn declared that mrs marsh had fired the shot now we know from accurate evidence that all these persons are innocent frisco was suspected from the very first he is caught and swearstruly enough according to his own belief that the boy murdered the colonel how do i know but what sidney may be able to prove his innocence and accuse someone else the chain may go on endlessly so far as i can see i understand the difficulty replied stephen wearily but i cannot for the life of me see why sidney should kill the man there comes in the queer character of the boy said herrick he detested the colonelsaid he was a bad man he might have got into his head in some way or another that such a man was better out of the world if so he would make no more account of killing carr than he would of putting a fly out of existence indeed he would rather spare the fly for i have noticed that he is tender to all that breathes but would he keep quiet over the matter i think so sidney was never the boy to talk then there is the pistol stephen that is an oldfashioned weapon that a boy might buy in beorminster for a few pence or he might have found it in the lumber room of the grangethere are many of these ancient firearms to be found in the houses of old families if sidney dropped across such a weapon he might have then concluded to kill carr you see from the account of frisco that he came down the tower stairs and said quite calmly that the colonel was dead he may just as calmly admit to me or to you that he killed the man mad mad groaned marshcarr he must be mad no that does not follow the boy is strange there are things about him which i cannot explain so far as i can see sidney does not come within the range of science that foretelling of your mothers death and his extraordinary statement that you were in danger puzzled me beyond words i must believe because i am convinced by the evidence of my own senses all the same i cannot explain or understand there are laws of nature with which we are unacquainted i believe that this boy comes under some unknown laws you cannot account for the actions of such a person the boy would do things which we should call wrong yet he would see no harm in doing them if he is guilty he will be put away in an asylum at the same time i am sure he is perfectly sane i am puzzled myself about him admitted stephen and he is a most uncomfortable boy to have about one still i have always found him upright and honourable i have never known him to tell a lie but he must know all about this case and how frisco has been accused im not so sure of that sidney lives with his head in the clouds he perhaps has heard that frisco has been accused but as the man does not now come across his path he never thinks of any possible danger to him again stephen that silver bullet is queer how do you mean queer well you know the medival superstition that a warlock can be killed only by a silver bullet a thing of that sort is exactly what would appeal to the dreamy nature of sidney he is something of a mystic himself remember he might have taken it into his head that carr was a warlock who had dealings with the devil i am sure he would have every reason to think so said marshcarr if any man was hand in glove with satan my uncle was that man you see what you say yourself then sidney thinking in a less sane fashion on the same subject might have considered it his duty to deliver the world from such a wizard he would certainly then use a silver bullet thinking according to the medival superstition that the man could not be killed by ordinary lead its all theory said stephen gloomily and fantastic at that as you sayall theory and fantastic admitted herrick but you must remember that we are dealing with a fantastic nature but we must see this boy and question him when we get home he will deny everything on the contrary if i know anything of the boy he will calmly admit what he has done you will not tell bess or ida that would be unwise we must be certain of sidney first we shall say nothing tonight but get sidney to come over to the pines on the morrow and ask him frankly if he killed carr bess is sure to ask you about frisco said stephen oh i can baffle her curiosity replied herrick i shall tell her nothing about my visit to the man all about his arrest she can know i think it will be better to hold our tongues altogether jim ida is getting worried by this incessant mystery although she knows very little im sure i dont wonder im worried myself however we must learn what we can from sidney i hope to heaven the lad is innocent but if he is not i dont look upon him in the light of an ordinary criminal he is a freak of nature were i put into the witnessbox i could not say on my oath that he is mad let us drop the subject said stephen who looked haggard i am getting nervous and anxious jim acquiesced in this sensible view and the two betook themselves to the magazines and newspapers until they arrived at beorminster they said little to one another and even then werefor themtaciturn a groom and cart awaited them and they drove to saxham in silence it did not do to talk of sidney with a servant at their elbows but curiously enough the groom had news for stephen which brought in the name of sidney please sir that italian woman whats the matter with her asked herrick who was driving she is very ill sir and it is said she will die die echoed stephen in surprise she was not bad enough for that when i saw her last what do you think herrick she looked very sick certainly but so far as i can judge was in no immediate danger of death who says this parry the groom sunk his voice to a whisper and seemed nervous master sidney he said both men looked round at this then at each other herrick was the first to break the silence when did master sidney say that parry yesterday sir mr napper he met him in beorminster in the cathedral square about four oclock he asked him jokinglike where he was going master sidney said just as quiet as he does speak sir that he was going to see the italian woman die napper was that taken aback you could have knocked him down with a feather sir then master sidney said she would die in two days which i take to mean sir that shell go off tomorrow and im sure she will sir added parry with conviction is this story known parry asked his master rather vexed no sir napper went at once to see miss endicotte when he came back to saxham she asked him to say nothing about it but he had already told phelps the gardener sir then phelps told us all sir but we have said nothing outside about it see you dont then said stephen sharply the first of my servants who says a word will be discharged mind that parry the groom touched his hat and relapsed into silence where is master sidney now parry asked herrick after a pause at the house in beorminster sir he has been there all night miss endicotte went over but she could not get him away he says he must stay there until the italian woman dies sir humph you need say no more parry and the doctor drove on in silence but marshcarr knew from the way he urged the mare how perturbed he was over this information stephen was upset himself there was something disquieting about everything in connection with sidney after dinner at the pines herrick made stephen lie down as he was yet far from strong and walked across to biffstead here he saw the two girls and frank who were very much troubled by this latest freak of their brother i dont know what to do with him said frank i went over and insisted he should come home i took him by the shoulder to force him out of the house but he got in such a passion that i thought he would have a fit so i left him until you came back you go over and get him away jim implored ida you have more influence over him than anyone else i have gone and bess also but he will not come we cant carry him back by main force and make a scandal ill go said herrick but i did not know that i had any influence with him he is a lad one can do nothing with how does the old woman take his telling her she is about to die she is quite calm evidently she thinks sidney is a kind of prophet he is telling her not to be afraid and talking the queerest things to her i am sure sidney is mad sobbed ida he will be shut up in an asylum someday herrick said nothing the poor girl little knew how truly she spoke if sidney had indeed killed carr he would certainly be shut up considering his extraordinary character perhaps this would be all the better for his friends and relatives if not for himself i will go over in the morning said herrick on reflection he may be more reasonable in the morning i am beginning to understand him a little im sure i dont said ida and frank echoed her opinion this was natural enough no man is a hero to his relatives all this time bess said nothing while jim was away she had worried much over her brothers freak but now that the doctor had returned she was satisfied that all would be well herrick exercised over bess the same influence he did over most people he came into contact with stephen and the girls were both more than ordinarily intelligent but they deferred to jim in a most remarkable manner if any one could manage sidney bess felt that herrick was the man jim was not so certain himself the boy had never come under his influence and in his own calm way held his own against everyone what about frisco asked bess who had followed herrick down the avenue has he really been arrested dr jim nodded santiago betrayed him to some private inquiry agents i employed he said a mean shabby piece of work bess joyce put it down to me i assured him that i had nothing to do with the matter but he refused to believe me he is so mean himself that he cannot believe any good of other people said bess scornfully what is to be done now about frisco i am thinking replied her lover evasively when i have come to a conclusion ill tell you bess but i fancy the end is in sight i hope so sighed the girl i am so tired of this anxiety shortly you will have no more dear and jim took her in his arms to kiss her goodbye the night is dark but the dawn is breaking next morning dr herrick walked over to beorminster he left stephen at home although the squire wanted to come also no said jim it is best for me to speak to the boy alone ill get more out of him and stephen recognised that this was the more sensible course it was eleven oclock when herrick rapped at the door of the beorminster house it was opened by sidney who looked calm and complacent as usual i heard you had come back dr jim he said did your prophetic instinct tell you that asked herrick testily the boy was so difficult to understand that he could not help feeling annoyed a man over thirty does not like treating a lad of sixteen as his equal yet sidney somehow compelled that respect no replied he sweetly i am very stupid about some things when a thought comes to me it comes i cannot call it then the thought came to you that petronella would die she will die dr jim two days ago i felt that she would die so i came over to see her she was afraid of death till i talked to her now she is quite peaceful she does not fear are you afraid of death sidney why should i be i know you know what that there is nothing to be afraid of the boy spoke quite serenely and without any suggestion of pose he had conducted herrick to the diningroom and the two were seated opposite one another on the table were the remains of sidneys breakfasta glass of milk some fruit and a loaf of bread i had to get these myself he said petronella is in bed in mrs marshs room she is very ill i knew she was ill some time ago replied herrick trying to assert himself but i think i can cure her she will not live said sidney staring in the most unwinking manner at dr jim she will die before sunset i know can you explain how you do know asked the doctor roughly this time it was the boy who was puzzled i cant he said i feel that petronella will die i can say no more than that herrick groaned it was useless to try and understand this extraordinary lad evidently he did not understand himself yet his former prophecies had come to pass so absolutely that dr jim could not help thinking that this last would come true also however this was not the business about which he had come sidney he said after a pause do you know that frisco who used to be with colonel carr has been arrested i heard bess say so what do you think of it i never thought of it at all he is in no danger dr jim it was not frisco who killed colonel carr how do you know that asked herrick startled was the boy about to confess that he was guilty i was in the house just after colonel carr was killed oh then you did not shoot him yourself sidney frowned but appeared very little disturbed why should i have killed him he said calmly colonel carr was a wicked man i told him he would die by violence some day but he only laughed at me he thought i was mad or a fool you do also dr jim i dont know what to think said jim angrily i never met anyone like you before sidney if i had not some knowledge that the things you say come true i should think you were pretending a boy like you ought to be whipped that is what the colonel said replied sidney quietly but tell me dr jim did you really think i had killed him i did not but frisco says you did if he believed that he would not have run away said sidney shrewdly well come to the point who murdered the colonel petronella said sidney herrick rose up with a look of surprise astonished as he was he could hardly help laughing this statement bore out his speech to stephen he had said that sidney would accuse someone else now it only remained for petronella to shift the blame on to the shoulders of a third party i do not believe that said herrick why should petronella kill carr you had better come up and hear what she has to say dr jim in a moment but tell me how you knowthrough your instinct sidney shook his head no that feeling only comes at times he said i do not pretend to know everything i said so before i dont know why you should look on me as queer dr jim he continued plaintively it is not my fault if things come into my head when they do i sometimes tell people but not always i dont like being laughed at youre a queer fish muttered dr jim annoyed by this human problem he could not understand i should like you to be examined by a committee of doctors they would not understand dr jim and i cant explain but you want to hear how i knew well on the night colonel carr was killed i went to the pine wood after seven oclock had you any premonition that he would be murdered no i had no feeling of any kind i was in the wood for some time at half past seven i felt hungry but i did not want to go to biffstead as i knew ida would try and keep me in it was raining but i did not mind that i like the open air where i can breathe a house makes me choke i understand go on as i was hungry i thought i would go and get something from colonel carr i sometimes went to see him though i did not like him he was always kind to me although i think he was afraid well i went into the house just before eight you said half past seven just now i did not go in at once said the boy with a gesture of irritation do not interrupt me dr jim i went to the diningroom and found the dinner on the table but the colonel was not there i took a piece of bread and some water while i was eating i heard a shot i wondered what it was you did not feel that murder was been committed no why should i have felt i just wondered what the shot might be after a bit i went out into the hall to see if the colonel had come in i thought he might be out i saw petronella run through the hall and out into the night i wondered what she was doing there and followed her but i lost her as she went through the woods then i walked about for a time up till nine i thought again about the shot and went back to the house i went up the tower and saw colonel carr lying dead so i knew petronella had killed him i came down the how was it you did not meet frisco who had gone up to see the colonel i heard someone coming and went into a lower room i thought it might be petronella coming back i saw it was frisco and saw him come down again then i came and said to him he is quite dead and went out after that i went on the moor then some time afterwards i heard three more shots i saw bess and her lantern and went home why did you say nothing of all this before asked herrick there was no reason if frisco had been caught before i should have told you but he had got away and i did not think it was right to tell about petronella colonel carr was a wicked man and he deserved to be killed he did a lot of harm said sidney with a shudder how comes it you tell me now sidney because bess told me frisco had been arrested he is wicked too but i did not want him to be hanged for shooting carr as i knew that he was innocent i came over to see petronella for i had a feeling that she would die and i wanted to know from herself before she died if she was guilty she denied it at first but i said i would not go away until she told me all that was why i stayed all night she tried to run away i said i would tell the police that was unlike you sidney no it wasnt replied the boy positively i knew that petronella was the one who shot carr if she did not confess frisco would be hanged you never thought you might be accused no i did not do it replied sidney calmly why should i be accused herrick sighed impatiently the boy could not or would not understand i suppose then petronella confessed in the end yes i made her write it down that she killed carr it is in italian but i do not know the language you must see that it is all right dr jim i did that because i thought she might die before you arrived but now that you are here come up and see her i will go for inspector bridge dr jim was aghast here was sidney in a new character why for bridge he must hear her confession said sidney putting on his hat perhaps she has written down something different in the italian i will give you the paper when i come back but i must go for bridge and sidney before herrick could say a word was out of the room dr jim heard the front door close behind the boy there is not much insanity about this act muttered herrick to himself i shall see petronella at once he smiled grimly i wonder who she will accuse he said chapter xxvi the truth in the room where mrs marsh had died and in the same bed lay the old italian woman dying also she was sitting up with a red woollen shawl wrapped round her bony shoulders and her lean hands told her rosary whatever views sidney might have instilled into her regarding life beyond the grave petronella still remained within the fold of peter she was muttering prayer after prayer with feverish haste and the black beads slipped quickly from between her fingers the room was dusty dark and untidy near the bed was a bottle of chianti and some bread but the flask was full and the loaf untouched petronella was past earthly food herrick saw the mark of death on her yellow face she seemed pleased to see him and not at all afraid receiving him with a chuckle she interpreted the look in his eyes so he has told you that young signor she said in her own tongue ah i thought he would it was timebut too late signor dottoretoo late for the prison i go into purgatory ten pounds for masses signor you will see that they are said then i may get into paradise to rest i need rest all my life i have worked hard the good god will not be hard on poor old petronella dr jim took a chair by the bedside and felt her pulse you need nourishing food petronella he said soothingly a cup of soup now eh eh signor dottore that will not help me i am dying you do not know i have never told you cancer signora bad cancer i shall die i may be able to no i do not want that they would put me in prison let me die the young signor said i would die it is foolish to live i will go to my padrona and explain then you did shoot the colonel petronella si si the old woman coughed he was a devilman he was cruel to my padrona to the young signor also he had the evil eye hard to kill oh yes she chuckled but the silver bulletah yes the silver bullet dr jim looked at her in silence he wondered that he had not suspected petronella before after bess had told him about the bullet he had been certain that the person who had fired the shot was of a superstitious nature mrs marsh being italian might have thought of the same thing but she was educated and above such folly petronella a woman of the people with feudal instincts had clung to that wild belief of the middle ages she was the one person of dr jims acquaintances who would have dreamed of such a thing and her he had not suspected why did you use a silver bullet petronella eh the man was a diavoloa witch creaturehe had the evil eye did i not meet with an accident after he had overlooked me it was better he should die rather than live to ruin the signora a silver bullet only in that way signor can those aided by the devil perish i am not sorry no it was a good deed the young signor said so all the same petronella i must tell you that frisco is accused of this murder he is in prison it is unfair that he should suffer for what you have done so you must make confession i have done so signor dottore i wrote with my own hand in my own language that i petronella had slain this devilman with a silver bullet even so said herrick but i want to write down your confession myself you can sign it and the police officer can witness it thus will the man who is in prison for your crime be saved the police echoed petronella ah i knew they would come but they will not put me in prison signor i die i die and that soon eh as you will you have been good to me i will do what you want yonder in the corner signorthe padronas ink and penalso the paper write down what i say and i will sign what does it matter now i die dr jim found the materials and placing them on the little round table looked at petronella she nodded and muttered a prayer then began to speak in her usual rapid manner she spoke in italian but dr jim for the benefit of bridge translated it into english luckily herrick was an excellent linguist and found no difficulty in doing this signor began petronella it happened in this way i was at the house of that devilman with the signoraoh a long time ago the padrona went to ask him for money he refused the cursed robberand we were so poorso poor my signora the last of a great race poor gran dio it was evil that she should be poor but the devilman would give not one lira ah no he kept all i was angered because of my padrona i saw on the table a cup of silver and that i took you stole the cup why not my padrona was poor that devilman saw me he struck meyes even me petronella a free italian and he overlooked me with his evil eye i shuddered i knew that i would have an accident and the next day i hurt myself ah the wicked wretch i gave back the cup as he made me but when we went down the stairs i took another of silver this time he saw me not and i carried it here under my shawl what did mrs marsh say my padrona was angry but i did not care i did not sell the silver cup as she was angered but i kept it yes for the silver bullet herrick looked up from his writing had you made up your mind then to kill colonel carr he asked no not then i should have liked to because he cast on me the evil eye ah dio mio i made horns but it was no use i had an accident no signor dottore i did not wish to kill him thenvery much later on when the willthe will did you know about the will si si it was that frisco told me i was in the market he also and he had the wine in him he talked foolishly and said that his signor would make another will leaving all the money to him i saw that my poor padrona and the young signor stefano would be ruined i came back and told the signora she was angered then she said she would go to see this devilman signor here petronella clutched herrick by the wrist i knew that my padrona had a temper she could rage i feared what she might do i watchedeh yes i watched she was to dine with the padre at saxham and then see the wicked signor did you not know she would see him in the afternoon no she said she would go about nine and see him that after his dinner he would be in a good temper and might not do this wrong signor i saw that she took with her a pistol the revolver of mr marsh si si she took it from the case in the room of the young signor stefano i saw her i knew that if the devilman laughed at her she would kill him yes she would no petronella said dr jim soothingly she only meant to frighten him so she said in the letter you gave me no signor replied the old woman indignantly the daughter of the micholotti would not be so weak she would have killed him upon my soul muttered herrick i believe she would i was in great alarm signor went on petronella i thought if she did so that she would be put in prison it was terrible to think so i was angered against the devilman he had struck me he had looked upon me with the evil eye now he would tempt my signora to kill him and so be put in prison i saw that all would be lost then i said to myself to me petronella that i would kill him alone the old woman drew herself up in bed and looked majestic as she spoke herrick was profoundly sorry for her she had carried her feudal instinct to excess and so had jeopardised her life for the sake of her mistress he understood well how she had been urged to this the blow the evil eye the possibility of her young master being ruined by another will and above all the chance that her signora might kill the man herselfa fiery faithful creature like petronella could not let such things be as she said she made up her mind to kill carr before mrs marsh could see him where she made the mistake was that she thought her mistress would see the man at night as a matter of fact she did but already had seen him in the day perhaps mrs marsh guessed what petronella might do and she had told a falsehood about the time of calling at the pines when the signora departed said petronella rocking to and fro for she was in pain i got my pistol si signor it was the pistol of my husband he fought for the king when we freed italy i too was in the war i shot manyoh many he showed me i was not afraid to shoot this piece of information showed herrick how it was carr had been shot through the heart petronella having been in the italian war of liberation knew how to handle firearms probably she was an excellent markswoman the shooting of carr proved her to be so i had bullets said petronella but they were of lead i knew that the devil man protected by the wicked one could not be slain by only a leaden bullet i wanted a silver one ah gran dio there was no silver in this house then i thought of the cup i had taken i got it and melted it down over a big fire i made three bullets in the mould of my husband i took his powder flask but it was empty the young signor stefano had powder in his roomi stole it then i loaded the pistol and set it aside till the night where was mr marsh all this time asked herrick he was in the house in the afternoon and went to eat with a friend of his signor barker the newspaper editor said dr jim he remembered that this was the man who looked after the beorminster chronicle and took an interest in stephens poetry he dined with him si signor and said he would not be back till late he was to bring home the signora from saxham i was all alone and i saw what i could do and what did you do petronella i hid the pistol in my shawl and walked to saxham i got there before eight i went to the big house i found it empty i climbed the stair where i knew the devil man would be in the tower he was standing by his bed dressed to eat he took up a pistol but let it down when he saw it was only old petronella you mean he still held the pistol yes i waited for a moment as he stared at me and then shot him i aimed for the heart said petronella hugging her knees the silver bullet went through the heart oh my husband showed me how to shoot signor what did you do then i made sure the devilman was dead he fell on his face then i went down the stairs i saw someone i did not know who it was but the young signor told me he was there i ran through the pine wood and he followed i hid behind a tree and then after a time i got home no one knew that i had been out and when the signora and the young signor stefano came back i said nothing the signora looked white she said nothing to me but i knew that she had seen the devilman what did i care she could not kill him again that is all signor you lost the pistol i lost my husbands pistol said petronella precisely it dropped from my pocket when i ran i did not care no one would know that it belonged to me then i heard frisco had gone i was glad they would not think i had killed the devil man didnt mrs marsh suspect my signora no she said nothing i was certain she had fired the other three shots for i know my signora also i looked at the revolver in the case when she put it back if frisco had been arrested at once would you have spoken out no frisco was a bad man too i would be glad if they put him in prison why do you tell now then the young signor made me tell ah he is a terrible young signor he makes me afraid he said i would die and that i must tell at once or he would speak to the police well i have told and i die have you all down signor i will sign ah dio mio she started up in bed the police it was indeed bridge who entered with a red face and astonished eyes he was followed by sidney looking calm just as though the inspector had not been scolding him all the way because he had not told about petronella before but it took someone stronger than inspector bridge to frighten sidney for a moment the inspector stared at the bed and at his prisoner as he regarded the old woman then he spoke to dr jim this is an extraordinary thing sir he said slowly very assented herrick i only knew of it myself an hour ago i thought this young gentleman was telling me a lie it is the truth said petronella pointing to herrick the signor has written all down here see me sign my name and you can say i signed it inspector bridge wanted to talk but dr jim made him a sign to be silent the old woman was sinking fast and there was no time to be lost with great difficulty she signed her name herrick and bridge appended their signatures and all was over this will set frisco free said bridge and now i must see about getting a warrant out for this woman it is too late said dr jim she is dying she wont die said bridge with a disdainful smile all this is done to cheat the law i have a policeman downstairs he shall come up and watch her while i go for a warrant of arrest she will die before sunset said sidney calmly and went to the old women he took her hand good bye petronella you will be happy soon you know what is to be done si si i know i am happy i will go to my husband said petronella then she looked at dr jim with a worn smile i did it for my signora she said you can go you can do me no good now herrick saw that well enough however he went to see if he could get a nurse to heat some soup and revive the woman to be sure it was little use bringing her back to health and strength just to hang her but dr jim acted for the best he went out with sidney and the inspector leaving two policemen in charge bridge had the confession in his pocket and intended to go up to town to deliver it into the hands of the proper authorities frisco had to be released seeing that he was innocent and i always thought he was said bridge lying in the most shameless manner sidney looked after the man with a queer smile when he went away he is only wasting time said the boy we may keep the old woman alive till tomorrow said herrick sidney shook his head she will die before sunset he said out of sheer perversity dr jim wanted to thwart this prophecy he saw that bad as petronella was she could be kept alive by stimulants and this he intended to do if only to baffle this extraordinary boy for once in a way he wished to prove sidney in the wrong the boy perhaps guessed his intentions for he smiled again and then said abruptly that he was going back to saxham will you tell them what has happened asked herrick no replied sidney after a pause i am not fond of talking you can tell them if you like very good said dr jim coolly then you ask ida frank and bess to be at the pines about five oclock i shall return by that time and then everything can be explained thank heaven we know the truth at last it is about time the matter came to an end will you be at the pines also i am going to have a long sleep said sidney i feel very tired he turned away with a nod and herrick stared after him jim was a doctor of the most advanced school he had studied much he was quick in seeing things and on the whole prided himself on his knowledge but he could make nothing of sidney the boy and his ways were beyond him altogether sidney would have baffled a committee of doctors herrick searched for a nurse and found one speedily for he knew where to go he brought her back to the house and set her to heat some soup then he gave various directions sent out for certain medicine and did what he could to revive the strength of the old woman bridge allowed petronella to have the bedroom to herself but he kept the two policemen in the house and got out his warrant nothing was known in the town about the matter as bridge wished to wait until all was in order before telling the public he foresaw that glory would accrue to him by the story he intended to tell he had resolved to give sidney and herrick no more credit than he could help dr jim guessed as much when he heard bridge talking but he was rather pleased than otherwise he did not want this latest freak of the uncanny changeling to be talked about besides bridge amused him he was so very human in his love of praise his philanthropic work being ended herrick walked back to saxham he reached the pines some time after five and already found the assembled party impatiently expecting his arrival sidney it appeared had just said sufficient to pique the curiosity of his family he hinted that some untoward event had occurred with which herrick was connected but refused to say what it was then he had retired to bed in full daylight and announced that he was going to sleep for twentyfour hours what was to be done with such a boy he grows more eccentric every day sighed ida stephen laughed oh his eccentricities are harmless enough that is if here he caught herricks eye and hesitated he did not know but what sidney might have confessed the crime of which frisco accused him oh thats all right said jim cheerily what is asked bess wondering at the sudden relief expressed on stephens face jim you have something to tell us yes something very importantabout the murder the murder of carr cried frank astonished oh i thought that was done with long ago on the contrary said dr jim i have been working at it all these months trying to learn the truth stephen and bess have been helping me well said ida looking from her lover to the doctor i do call it mean i should have been told it would only have worried you dear said the squire but what is the difficulty cried frank puzzled frisco killed the colonel there was no secret about that frisco did not kill carr said herrick the jury were wrong so were we all it was petronella who shot the man stephen jumped up as bess uttered a cry of amazement petronella he stammered thank god sidney did not do it sidney cried bess and ida in a breath herrick hurriedly explained frisco accused sidney because he was in the house at the time of the murder that was when you were looking for him bess do you remember i should think so she cried no wonder i could not find him but petronella was the pistol hers and the silver bullet what are you talking about bess dear let me explain said dr jim before bess could answer ida it is a long story and i think you will find it interesting and then herrick told the whole complicated case from the time he and joyce found the dead body of colonel carr in the tower which now no longer existed he was frequently interrupted with exclamations of horror from ida and of rage from frank when he ended the latter jumped up if i meet that little wretch joyce again said frank ill break every bone in his body the idea of trying to mix up bess in the matter he has received a worse punishment than a thrashing said stephen i think you can leave him to the punishment of destiny frank a babel of voices ensued everyone was talking at once and for fully an hour they discussed the case in all its bearings i suppose frisco will be released now said bess triumphantly i knew that he was innocent i said so all along all the same he is a bad lot remarked herrick the less we have to do with him the better i dont think hell come down here again in a hurry said marshcarr thankfully and santiago has sailed for mexico thus we are rid of the whole gang hullo whats that it was a violent ringing at the door and herrick started to his feet looking perturbed i hope nothing is wrong now he said i am getting so nervous with all this that i am always expecting the worst of tidings as he spoke the footman ushered in inspector bridge in a state of excitement the man could hardly speak and was scarlet in the face with suppressed rage and alarm i beg your pardon he said to the company but this womanpetronella what is the matter asked dr jim she is dead all looked at one another and before sunset remarked herrick thinking of sidney how did it happen bridge she had a bottle of chloral under her pillow and while the nurses back was turned she drank it i was called too late she is as dead as a doornail and has spoilt a most beautiful case leaving the others to discuss the matter with bridge herrick hastily excused himself he ran across to biffstead and up into sidneys bedroom the boy was sleeping quietly but dr jim woke him promptly i say he cried shaking the boys shoulder she is dead petronella said sidney drowsily i know she is i said she would die before sunset you told her to take that chloral no said sidney in a sleepy manner she wanted to take it before she confessed but i stopped her but she was bound to die i said she might get out of the world more easily if she took it i daresay she died quietlyin a sleep you have behaved shamefully cried herrick wrathfully no she was bound to die in any case why should she not die as she pleased go away dr jim i want to sleep and sidney closed his eyes herrick in the face of this calmness was helpless so he departed the boy had baffled him to the very end chapter xxvii a final surprise in this way the trouble left as a legacy by the wicked colonel came to an end frisco was duly tried and on the confession of petronella he was acquitted a very meagre report of the proceedings appeared in the newspapers in taking down the confession herrick had not inserted the fact of mrs marshs connection with the matter frisco said nothing to his counsel about the three shots fired after the colonel was dead therefore the name of stephens stepmother was spared the disgrace of her mad impulsive act for obvious reasons the most interesting part of the case was left untold and the public never knew the complications that had ensued in searching for the assassin frisco was tried briefly was acquitted and when set free he disappeared where he went no one knew and no one cared by the advice of dr jim stephen paid to belcher and kidd the reward that he had promised for the capture of frisco herrick was afraid that if it was not paid that the two might search into the matter more particularly than would be agreeable to the feelings of marshcarr stephen saw this danger himself and gladly sent a cheque for the money but belcher and kidd will get no more business from dr herrick and i hope ill never come into connection with detective business again said herrick earnestly it is all very well to read about but in real life it is not so pleasant however we have done with it all certainly he was done with the case but not entirely with frisco one day the exsailor arrived at saxham and asked to see mr marshcarr at the time stephen was indoors and luckily for him dr herrick had not gone out when the name of frisco was given the two looked at one another in surprise they had hoped never to hear it again shall i see him jim asked stephen doubtfully certainly i shall see him also replied herrick he can have come here for no good purpose but i would rather have him as an open enemy than striking in the dark the consequence of this speech was that frisco was shown into the library he was glad to see marshcarr and visibly annoyed to find that the doctor was present my business is private said frisco you must tell it to me in the presence of dr herrick said stephen scenting trouble i do nothing without his advice worse luck growled frisco and sat down with a scowl herrick laughed you do not seem pleased that you have escaped the gallows frisco he said or perhaps you are sorry the criminal did not turn out to be sidney endicotte i dont care a fig who it was so long as it wasnt me replied the exsailor huh fancy carr being shot by an old hag after going through all the dangers he did i always thought hed have a mean end this is beside the point said stephen as i suppose you did not not come here to criticise my uncle you had better tell me your business its not pleasant business said frisco coolly so i should expect seeing that you have come about it said the squire however i shall be pleased to hear what it is frisco took a paper out of his pocket i dont think you will said he i have here mr marshcarr the last will of the colonel stephen started to his feet and turned pale herrick who had been listening intently struck in i suppose it leaves all the money to you mr joycefrisco no growled frisco and you neednt seor its a good will for you if its true what robin says and what does robin say that you are to marry miss bess that is perfectly true replied herrick coolly but i do not see what she has to do with your business you will soon dr herrick the money is left to her what cried stephen loudly carr has left his money to bess you bet heres the will and frisco threw it across the table he said she was the only man amongst the lot of you see how honest i am herrick i want to make you a rich man cause you stood by me in trouble i never forget a pal not me meantime stephen and jim were looking over the paper why cried herrick bursting into a laugh its not worth the paper its written on here is the colonels signature but there are no witnesses ah you see that do you said frisco with a chuckle thats so but i tell you that if my milksop had married the girlmy foolson robin i meanthere would have been witnesses and the will would have been proved in law i daresay said stephen who sat down again with a recovered colour well even if this will had have been genuine i should not have minded there is no one i would give the money to sooner than dr herrick stuff and nonsense cried jim although he reddened with pleasure at this tribute of friendship as if i or bess would have taken a penny of it oh i see what your game was frisco you wanted robin to marry bess and then you would have got witnesses to this will and taken the money from stephen is that so that is so rejoined frisco leaning back as the fool could not get the girl i tried the other plan of stopping marsh going to the vault that failed because of you dr herrick if it had not been for you id have had that money you confess your villainies very coolly said marshcarr sharply do you know that i can lay you by the heels for that assault oh no you cant twas santiago struck you you cant prove that i had anything to do with it and said frisco impudently you would not if you could remember i held my tongue about yes yes said stephen hastily it was good of you to say nothing about my unhappy mother i am so far indebted to you ah thats just what ive come about what do you mean asked jim sharply lord doc you aint half sharp enough i want the squire here to give me a thousand pounds to start afresh i and robin are going back to the states and we want something to begin life on that is only fair put in stephen eagerly i am wait a bit said jim let us hear on what grounds frisco asks you to do this frisco was quite ready to show grounds well in the first place i held my tongue about mrs marsh firing at the dead body yes i owe you something for that said stephen flushing and wincing in the second said frisco raising his finger i brought you that will unwitnessed so that you can still keep the money if robin had got the girl i shouldnt have done that my name as one witness and santiago as another and where would you be santiago was never in this house said herrick and a will has to be signed when the testator and the witnesses are together oh id have arranged all that my own signature you could not dispute as i was carrs righthand man id have paid santiago half a years income to sign hed have done it like a shot and the will would have stood any test then that is true enough said herrick reflectively so long as the colonels signature was right the rest was easy where did you get this will it was on his table he must have been fooling with it when the old woman petronella shot him it was about this will that mrs marsh made such a fuss only she thought the money was to be left to me ah you let that out yourself being drunk said frisco with a laugh well i took away the will and afterwards thought to use it by marrying robin to bess endicotte but you see mr marsh he added turning to stephen i did not have the witnesses names put so you keep the money instead of handing it over to miss bess whether he had done so or not cried dr jim hotly bess would not have taken it the money is rightfully stephens ah that brings me to the third point said frisco unmoved i worked for that money i went through hot and cold and danger to get it half of it should have been mine but carr had the whip hand of me so im out of it now gentlemen i know where that cche is if youll give me a thousand to fit out an expedition well cry quits i and robin are going to get more treasure carr didnt take away the lot but remember that the indians are warned said herrick they have very likely removed the rest of the jewels thats what ive got to find out said frisco and robin is coming along with me to be made a man of well these three points mr marsh are clear enough i ought to have half the money but as you have the upper hand i ask a thousand poundsas my right i certainly think you are entitled to that much said stephen what do you say herrick im with you steve give him the money frisco chuckled while stephen wrote out a cheque for the amount when the exsailor placed it in his pocket he stood up to go well gentlemen he said with some sort of emotion i thank you for this treatment you are both white men i have behaved badly but this makes all square i can tell you one thing mr marsh that you will have no further trouble about the money even if the indians knew they would do nothing to you now that carr has gone as to the plan i daresay his body by this time iswell no matter i go out of your life gentlemen so does robinto be made a man of there remains santiago he wont trouble you im going to shoot him when i drop across him in mexico you can do what you like there frisco i daresay another crime wont matter much to you it wouldnt be a crime but an act of justice he played me a dirty trick dr herrick however im off you wont shake hands so i dont offer so long gentlemen both said frisco walking towards the door and may you live long and be happy as to that devil carr frisco spat and then departed they never saw him again a year later information came through a newspaper stating the fate of an expedition that had gone into the interior of peru the indians of the cordilleras had attacked the camp and the three white men who led the expedition were killed their names were joyce alias frisco his son robin and a mexican called santiago poor robin said herrick when he read this to his wife he was a mean little scoundrel but im sorry that he came to such an end as to santiago frisco must have made it up with him and taken him to look after the treasure well the whole three are dead let us forget them but this is anticipating on the evening of the day when frisco appeared stephen announced to the assembled biffs that dr herrick intended to accept half the income of the wicked colonel with the permission of bess jim was on his feet at once come he cried very red i intend to do nothing of the sort what rubbish are you talking steve i only ask bess to read this paper said stephen and gave bess the incomplete will ah true replied herrick it is only fair that she should decide for herself but ill have no part in the matter the colonel going to leave his money to me cried bess well i never heard such nonsense stephen as if i would take a penny from you or ida i told you so cried dr jim triumphantly i knew bess would think the same as i hurrah bess kiss me is this a proper will steve asked ida looking at the paper no frisco brought it here today to cause trouble but as you see there are no witnesses so it is not valid and yet you want to offer me half the money take it bess cried ida i am sure stephen and i can live well on four thousand a year i wont said bess these were the colonels intentionsvery kind im sure but even if the will were legal i should not accept jim am i not right perfectly right darling you and i will make our own way its all nonsense said stephen you must take some money it is only fair that the colonels intentions should be respected in some way there was a great deal of argument finally bess and dr herrick agreed to take one thousand a year for life there said ida kissing her sister i hope that is all right and now jim will go away said stephen gloomily not until the years end and until the money is firmly in your possession was the reply of the doctor remember you have some months visits to pay to that vault even though frisco has gone we must carry out the will and at the end of the year ill establish myself in practice somewhere said dr herrick perhaps in beorminster so as to be near you bess can then go on writing for the weekly chronicle indeed i shall write a novel cried bess i want a london fame and so it was settled for a year herrick remained at the pines with the squire then there was a double wedding ida and stephen came back to live in the wicked colonels house and dr herrick and his bride established himself in a comfortable mansion in beorminster he became immensely popular and also having married into a county family he was much sought after by the county invalids frank and sidney were left at biffstead and flo came home to keep house for them the rev pentland corn gave up his charge of the parish and went out to the east as a missionary no one could understand the reason for this follyas they called itsave herrick he understood only too well and his was the last hand pentland corn clasped when he left england for india his place was taken by a young and amiable rector who will probably marry flo endicotte then frank will have to keep the house himself or marry in selfdefence as to sidney the queer boy herrick took that young gentleman in hand and tried to make him a healthy man he made him ride shoot swim and indulge in all manner of outofdoor sports at first sidney rebelled but as he was really fond of herrick he began to take kindly to the regime the consequence was he became more of a boy in a few months and actually began to eat meat herrick watched over him with the greatest care and gradually sidney lost his unpleasant faculty of seeing things he went to college and there he now is becoming rapidly more of a normal person once he met with a theosophist who told him after hearing his story that he had sunk the spirit in the flesh and blamed herrick severely in fact this gentleman took a journey to saxham to see and expostulate with herrick on the wickedness of debasing the psychic gifts of the boy i would rather see him a healthy man said the doctor impatiently in what you say there may be a good deal but the boy is now in better health and easier to live with ah you do not deserve to have such a person in the family said the theosophist but your work will not endure for ever you have made mr endicotte eat meat and materialised him but in a few years he will recover his gift it will be stronger than ever then i hope he wont come here said herrick i have every respect for persons so gifted but i dont like them to have one at your elbow who sees into the future and foretells death and is always seeing creatures of the air is horrible you are a sceptic dr herrick no i think there are many things of which we know nothingi mean in regard to what we talk about but for my part i want to do my duty in this life and leave all these occult things to people who like them i should like my brotherinlaw to act likewise however he is in good health now and i should be sorry to see him relapse into the state he was when i first met him thereupon the theosophist sighed and departed all the same he is keeping a watch over sidney and should the boy again develope the clairvoyant faculty he will be made better use of by those who understand and then a happy day came when in stephens arms was placed a boy bess herrick placed him therein do you know who this is she asked my son and heir replied stephen bending over the infant what else or who else should he be the first the very first really innocent creature who has been in this house for close upon a century that is complimentary to us all bess said her husband who had entered the room but what if he is bess looked solemn i think he is the guardian angel of ida and steve to keep away the evil spirit of colonel carr come now bess you are not like sidney you have not seen i have seen nothing jim but the village people are already making a legend about the wicked colonel they say he walks i hope now that this innocent child is here that they will leave off inventing such horrid things i dont want the pines to have the reputation of being haunted and you know how stories grow jim i know this replied dr herrick that carr was murdered in a room which has vanished into thin air if his ghost walks anywhere it must be in the pine wood there is no call for him to haunt this place some one repeated this saying of herricks and what he had said in jest was spoken of in earnest in a few months it was commonly reported that the wicked colonel had been seen in the pine wood surrounded with a red glow significant of the habitation his spirit for its sins dwelt in in vain more sensible people laughed at this tale it came to be firmly believed in and it was said that when any misfortune was about to befall the marshcarr family that the shade of the colonel appeared it is the penalty of greatness said dr jim to stephen a county family is not really respectable until it has its private ghost and in this way wicked colonel carr became a tradition the end
