dillingham company publishers new york copyright by g w dillingham company issued march lady jim of curzon street lady jim of curzon street chapter i were on the rocks this time leah smashin for all were worth how we can win clear beats me with hands which had never earned a shilling thrust into pockets empty even of that coin jim kaimes stretched out his long legs and surveyed his neat boots as he made this cryptic speech his habit of expressing himself in a parabolic fashion was confusing to his friends but five years of marital squabbling had schooled his wife into ready comprehension and she usually responded without comment on this occasion however the subject under discussion irritated even her healthy nerves and she replied irrelevantly really jim i wish you would talk english huh never knew i was talking choctaw you might be for all the sense an ordinary person can make of it ahaa said jim with the clumsy affection of a bear but youre not an ordinary person leah im the common or garden ass that cant straighten things now you can for want of a husband i suppose i must come now leah am i not your husband oh yes she answered with a flick of her handkerchief across a pair of scornful lips my husband not a husband whats the difference as if i could waste time in explaining we have more serious matters to talk about than your want of brains serious enough assented the man sulkily but you know how to deal with trouble leah i ought to retorted his wife with a shrug considering the experience i have had since marrying you i wish i hadnt so do i confessed jim then mended his speech with a dim sense of having overstepped the mark no by jupiter i dont mean that you an i get on very well considerin each swings on a private hook you are not a bad sort leah and im aaawell you know what i am not a diplomatist certainly isnt this praise a trifle obvious you dont mean it do you she looked at him wistfully but her candid husband soon stopped any sentimental illusions she may have momentarily entertained oh yes i mean it in a sort of way an good temper on both sides will help us to push through the business quicker you mean the bankruptcy court snapped his wife perhaps i mean the divorce court was his tart reply but she was quite ready with an answer on your own part then you cant say a word against me who said i could youve got the one virtue that gives its name to the rest and think yourself an angel i had your assurance that i was an angelonce no doubt its the sort of thing a man has to say to the woman he is engaged to and never says to the woman he is married to marriage isnt all honey leah and heavens lady jim addressed the ceiling as if i required telling but compared with other women jim i am not i never said you were interrupted kaimes crossly id screw your neck if you went on like other women upon my word jim i would admire you more if you did attempt something of that sort sorry i cant oblige you but im a gentleman and bear an honoured name an honoured name sneerin wont alter facts leah the name of kaimes has always been honoured till you dragged it through the mud interrupted leah in her turn the old duke is all right and friths a kind man if somewhat dull but youoh heavens to think that such a saul should be amongst the prophets jim not understanding the scriptural allusion thought he was being chaffed a liberty which his bovine pride resented by two minutes of sulky silence moreover he dreaded his wifes formidable tongue the lash of which could cut through even his tough hide how are we goin to get through the business at this rate was his next contribution to the conversation you dont remember that ive to meet a fellow at the club to see about a bet an i havent got one shillin to rattle against another declared jim pathetically well was the sharp reply i have to shop this afternoon with but one miserable sovereign in my purse lord jim opened his sleepy blue eyes i say you couldnt no said his wife decisively i couldnt and i wouldnt and i cant and i shant perhaps youll read the paper and let me think all right said kaimes reaching for the sporting times i want to see the bettin on podaskas betting will be your ruin has been corrected jim chuckling then reverted to his early metaphor were on the rocks this time leah and no mistake his wife cast a look of scorn on the pinkandwhite face she had once thought handsome and indeed kaimes was goodlooking in a heavy saxon way tall and muscular with the strength of a bull and the manners of a bear he was precisely the sort of brutal athlete to attract women they flocked round him like bees and gave him more honey than was good for him he accepted their endearments with the complacent vanity of an egotist and took little trouble to please even the prettiest whereupon he was adored the more leah with her elbows on the breakfasttable stared at jims wellbrushed head bending over the pink sheets and asked herself for the hundredth time why she had married him physically he resembled a splendid hercules but in another sense the likeness was not a speaking one he satisfied her eyes and in no other way gave her pleasure when he talked he babbled vainly about himself and his doings to the exclusion of any topic likely to interest other people possessed of that easy goodnature which refuses nothing which costs nothing jim kaimes was looked upon as a good fellow a title which covers a multitude of the minor sins jim would have been meritorious as a caveman and prehistorically perfect as a civilised being he left very much to be desired the subject was neither agreeable nor inexhaustible and leah rose with a shrug of her shapely shoulders jim looked up well he asked encouragingly nothing said his wife curtly and moved to the window here she leaned against the sash and looked at the narrow grey street which was such a good address to impress tradesmen and so expensive to live in not that the question of rent troubled the pair they paid none and would have been as much insulted if visited on quarterday as an irish tenant the duke of pentland at the time of their marriage had presented them with the furnished curzon street but hampered with certain restrictions they could not sell it or even mortgage it nor could money be raised on the furniture the duke paid all rates and taxes and saw to all repairs beyond dwelling in this very desirable residence and calling it publicly their home lord and lady jim had no interest in it whatsoever both thought it was ridiculous that they could not turn the curzon street house into money when they needed ready cash so badly and life was so hard to people of their standing and tastes leah came of a bankrupt family and had brought nothing to jim but her own clever beautiful self she considered the two thousand a year which the duke allowed his second son opulence until she learned what delightful things money could buy then jim used a large amount of the quarterly payments on his own account and tradesmen would not give her the delightful things without money she certainly had bills in nearly every shop in bond street and out of it but even bills had to be paid in the long run the post brought a good many and brought also lawyers letters not pleasant to read between them this happy pair had mortgaged their income and the money they had obtained was all gone now they had no income and many bills what was to be done this problem jim had set leah to solve but clever as she knew herself to be the solution was beyond her cant you borrow jim she asked turning gloomily from the window perhaps a fiver was the prompt response every ones as mean as mean ive tried em all and you leah shook her head twenty pounds for all my asking theres your godmother old lady canvey suggested jim shes as rich as dives and like dives wont give a penny to this lazarus she smiles and talks epigrams and preaches but as to helping leah shrugged her shoulders again the action drew her husbands attention to a very magnificent figure which was loudly admired jim had admired it himself before he had got used to seeing it in the breakfastroom now it struck him that this attraction might be turned into money youre a ripping woman in the way of looks he said throwing down the newspaper if you went on the stageeh as the fairy queen inquired his wife scornfully thats about all im suited for i know the things i cant do jim and acting is one besides think of what the duke would say jim yawned and lighted a cigarette he cant say more than he has said he remarked lazily sides i never go to hear him preach now no you send me why not the duke loves a pretty woman you can twist him round your little finger i cant twist any money out of him said lady jim irritably mores the pity were on the rocks youve said that twice already an ill say it again and again and again snapped jim you dont seem to realise the hole were in dont i she queried with an emotion she would never have shown in society i realise that i have one sovereign and you only a fiver i intend to borrow from a sure man said jim but i say whats to be done we must go through the court whats the use of that itll only settle our debts we want ready money i dont care a straw about the tradesmen cant we let this house no the duke says we can live in it as long as we like but if we leave hell take it back again its like giving a boy half a crown and telling him not to spend it said kaimes looking round if we only could its a jolly sort of room this and wed get a good rent for the house the room was indeed pretty being decorated in a pompadour manner its walls were adorned with white paper sprinkled with bunches of roses tied with fluttering blue ribbons and the carpet bore the same dainty design the furniture was of white wood upholstered in brocade also diversified with roses and azure streamers there were many delicate watercolour pictures a grate and fireirons of polished brass and electric lights in rosetinted globes even the grey december light streaming in through the two windows could not make the apartment look anything but clean and delicate and dainty and delightful it was an ideal nest for a young couple but this one had outlived the honeymoon and cared very little for the ideal a very pretty room said jim again and youre the prettiest thing in it leah she looked at him scornfully and then glanced around i hate all this frippery she said contemptuously something more massive would suit me better well you are a kind of cleopatra y know if jims historical knowledge had been more accurate he would have made a better comparison cleopatra according to the latest discoveries was small foxyhaired and dainty she would have suited this watteaulike room to perfection but lady jim was as tall as any daughter of the gods and bore herself after the imperial style of juno queen of olympus her hair was of a deep red and she had a great quantity as those who saw her pose in charity tableaux knew very well leah possessed the creamy complexion which usually goes with such hair and a pair of large blue eyes out of which her soul had never peered they were hard eyes shallow as those of a bird and surveyed the world and its denizens with the inquiring expression of a cat on the lookout for titbits her lips were thin and covered admirably white and regular teeth it was a clever face and beautiful in its serene immobility those who did not like lady jim called her a cat but she was more like a sleek dangerous pantheress and woe to the victim who came under her claws yet she could purr very prettily on occasions well jim she said more graciously for she was sufficiently a woman to be pleased with her husbands grudging compliments now that you have finished saying sweet things what next this business were on the jim if you say that again ill leave you to get out of the trouble yourself youre my husband think of something i cantunless its the insurance the insurance said leah thoughtfully twenty thousand pounds isnt it jim her husband nodded old jarvey peel my godfather had my life insured when i was a child and arranged that his heirs should pay up the money every year to keep it in force then theres accumulations of sorts i dont understand these stale things myself leah but i know that theres over twenty thousand cant you raise money on it no the old man arranged that i should lose it if i tried that game lord said jim with disgust if i could have raised money i should have got rid of it ages ago but how does it benefit you asked his wife curiously if the money is paid when you are dead you wont have any fun but iher eyes gleamed oh no you dont snapped jim not at all pleased at this hint youd like to turn me into cash in that way i know but it so happens that the twenty thousand and whatever additions may have come will be paid to me when im sixty much fun in that when i shant have teeth to crack nuts youre over thirty now jim thirtyfive and youre only five years younger so when we get the cash at sixty there wont be any enjoyment left for either of us thirtyfive from sixty murmured lady jim leaves how much jim twentyfive replied kaimes after wrinkling his brow and communing with his none too quick brain beastly long time to wait leah nodded theres no chance of your getting it sooner not the slightest i cant get a cent on it and i cant sell it and i cant use it in any way jarvey peel was a silly old ass died worth no end of coin and didnt leave me a penny but if you died jim drop it retorted kaimes who did not at all relish the suggestion well but supposing you did insisted leah then i spose the money would be paid to you said jim kicking the hearthrug with a gloomy face but dont you make any mistake leah im goin to live right on to sixty and handle the money i cant do much at that age but ill try hard to get through the lot before i slip off and what about me oh you must look after yourself said jim heartlessly but if you can think of some scheme to get the cash now ill give you halfthere now theres nothing mean about me whats the use of talking rubbish said lady jim crossly you wont die not to oblige you my dear so dont think it then dont let us talk any more of the impossible is it impossible asked kaimes cunningly leah looked at him with wide bright eyes what is it she asked i might pretend to die you know said jim looking at her very directly then the cash ud be paid to you and we could share but its ridiculous cried leah raising her eyebrows you would have to give up your position and disappear who cares you know i never stop longer in england than i can help as to my position its all debts and duns and squabbling with you oh id give up the whole thing for the money you never think of me got enough to do to think of myself grumbled kaimes sides you dont care for me as a widow you could have lots of fun onon sayfive thousand thats right jim take the lions share to yourself well shouldnt i be paying the largest price for getting the cash leah shrugged her shoulders again there would be very little sacrifice in it so far as you are concerned she said youve been three times to south america since we were married and i presume with this money you would go there again id go out of your life for ever oh well she said coolly i could show my respect to your memory by wearing a widows dress i expect i should look rather nice in a cap lord jim was rather disgusted little as he loved his wife he expected her to be devotedly attached to him and her ready acquiescence in his disappearance annoyed him greatly youve got no heart how clever of you to guess that i gave it to you five years ago and took it back before the honeymoon was over well you see jim you are so careless a man that i could not think of leaving the only heart i possess in your hands besides so many women have given you their hearts that i thought you might confuse the lot lord jim did not like this banter and said so in a few forcible words then he moved to the door casting a disgusted look at a pile of bills on leahs side of the table what about this truck oh well pay them out of your insurance laughed lady jim not much im not going to disappear and give up everything for the benefit of a lot of measly tradesmen i wish you wouldnt dangle grapes out of my reach said his wife pettishly you know its not to be done jim plunged forward and gathering up the mass of papers threw them into the fire pay them in this way then said he enraged i wish i could sighed leah wearily and looked at herself in the mirror do stop worrying me jim im getting to look quite old are you going out yes weve wasted an hour in talking about nothing were on the rocks i tell you and so said lady jim calmly you end where you began jim looked up to heaven and this is a wife said he plaintively and this she mocked laying her hand on his shoulder is a probable bankrupt not me ill clear out first to south america leave the insurance money to me jim called leah as he banged the door twenty thousand pounds she soliloquisedits worth trying for but i might as well cry for the moon and she sighed the sigh of selfishness unexpectedly thwarted chapter ii lord and lady jim kaimes were regarded as a most agreeable couple and utilised this reputation to live on their friends the husband was an admirable shot a daring and judicious poloplayer and his skill at cards was as notable as his dexterity in golfing consequently he was much in request and benefited largely in free board and lodging he was goodlooking which pleased the women and goodnatured which satisfied the men in wrestling and boxing jim could more than hold his own and always paid his gambling debts even at the cost of allowing tradesmen to threaten legal proceedings thus according to modern ideas he was an honourable man and a good allround sportsman a credit to the british aristocracy and a pleasure to his numerous friends these be thy gods o israel a clergyman once preached on this text in jims accidental hearing but jim did not know what he meant the wife was a general favourite with the men but women fought rather shy of her she thought too much of herself they said and dressed altogether too well and moreover never gave even the most bittertongued female a chance of talking scandal in connection with the honoured name to which jim had called her attention however feminine artfulness led one and all to conceal this dislike and lady jim received as much kissing and as many sweet words and invitations as her vain hungry soul desired she saw through the wiles of her own sex clearly and knew that in nine cases out of ten the woman who kissed would have preferred to bite but they knew that lady jim knew and lady jim knew that they knew she knew so everything went well as to what was said behind her back lady jim cared not a snap of her fingers and if any rival dared to attack her openly she was quite able to use a particularly venomous tongue the safeguard against calumny which nature had given her and it must be said that she never went out of her way to harm any one her position was that of a passive resister as she pathetically observed she was a contented woman if only permitted to have her own way certainly the women had cause to complain of lady jims gowns which were far beyond the ordinary female intellect in cut and fashion in new material and uptodate trimmings she added her own ingenuity and taste to the creations of the dressmaker and the result was always such a triumph as to lead the rest of her sex to doubt if providence existed it would have been even more aggravating than it was had it been known that lady jim paid next to nothing for her gowns and advertised the dressmaker instead of settling the bill but leah did not make this fact public she was content to use her magnificent figure and good looks and her popularity in society to save a lean purse and therefore was daily and nightly clad in the purple and fine linen which wrung envious tears from other womens eyes sometimes lady jim fascinating a societypaper editor would utilise his columns and circulation to advertise deserving tradesmen while from these in return she exacted tangible gratitude in the welcome shape of gloves handkerchiefs scents and similar needful if expensive commodities lady jim never signed her name to these literary efforts but they drew custom to the shop and filled her wardrobe with what she wanted at the moment so she was not ambitious to be known as an authoress even jim never knew how his wife as he put it contrived the tiptop and privately thought that the age of miracles was not yet past when leah could make something out of nothing for five years more or less lady jim had been clothed as the lilies of the field and had been supplied with nutriment by the lineal descendants of elijahs ravens but now things were coming to a crisis the long lane down which she had marched as solomoninallhisglory was about to take a turning and lady jim did not relish the new route it led to secondrate lodgings at home or abroad to the lack of frocks and a diminution of other womens envy to the loss of a thousand and one luxuries which had become necessaries and to a selfdenying ordinance of which she did not approve something must be done to prevent the necessity of turning down this penurious alley but when lady jim set out on her shopping excursion she did not very well see how she could avoid the almost inevitable needless to say leah had a trifle more in her purse than the one sovereign she had admitted the existence of to jim to be precise she possessed ten pounds and that had to last a week as pocketmoney she felt very hard up as she stepped into her motorcar and whirled down the street had she possessed the lamp of aladdin she would have made its slave bankrupt and to think that seven days of desiring pretty things should be supported on ten pounds the beggar at the gate of dives could not have been poorer but there was no sign of penury on the surface the unpaid sables lady jim wore were the best that the animal could give the fur rug over her feet had cost enough to keep a poor family for six months in food and fire though she or rather jim was being dunned for the payment of that the motorcar was one of the best and newest and lady jim drove it with the reckless speed of a woman who thinks the world was created so that she should play juggernaut having plenty of courage and a love for playing with death leah was a daring and skilful driver before now she had swept round a corner with two wheels beating the air but she had not as yet crushed any one under the said wheels and she ascribed this luck to her peacocks feather like all who have small belief in the deity lady jim was superstitious in a small way her fetish was a peacocks feather and so long as she had one about her nothing so she averred could possibly go wrong there was one now thrust into the lefthand lamp of the car and the panels were painted with the same feathers until they resembled the tail of junos favourite bird lady jim might forget to go to church or to say her prayers or to thank god but she never forgot the necessary peacocks feather which was to ensure prosperity and safety she was reported to make genuflections before a shrine of this sort but the report was probably exaggerated no one knew what kind of a baal she worshipped but it is ridiculous to say that she did not adore at least one for she was in her way a very religious woman lady jim raced her car out of curzon street down park lane and into piccadilly where she amused herself with dodging nervous people and shaving the wheels of vehicles drawn by humble quadrupeds the chauffeur sat grimly silent expecting an almost certain spill with the calm of a fatalist he knew it would come some day in spite of his mistresss skilful driving but he neither worried nor remonstrated he was paid for a silent tongue and healthy nerves and if his life was insured rather heavily considering his profession that was no ones business but his wifes and she had already decided how to spend the insurance money but the woman need not have been so sure of such good fortune lady jim did not mind hurting other people but she had an uncommonly good notion of how to preserve the only neck she possessed when the car reached bond street lady jim who was as calm as though she had finished a donkeyride stepped down and entered a jewellers shop lately she had paid a trifle off his bill and thought herself entitled to double the gross amount the jeweller knowing the duke of pentland had fifty thousand a year and that lady jim was too pretty a daughterinlaw not to get her own way with so gay an old nobleman did not object to his customers purchases if lady jim could not pay the duke would so she was permitted to take away several objects for which she had no use then she went to select some new hats and look at the latest thing in frocks a call at certain other establishments resulted in the car being heaped with expensive trifles for christmas presents afterwards the car whirled into oxford street returned to piccadilly and stopped every now and then like a bird of prey at some shops she was received with sickly smiles at others which she favoured for the first time with her custom with rejoicing grins but out of every place lady jim walked calmly with a shopman in the rear bringing parcels to increase the baggage on the car she achieved the whole afternoons work without once opening her purse could rothschild have financed things better at five oclock with lighted lamps and unabated speed lady jim drove her machine to berkeley square and leaving the chauffeur to choke and shiver in the damp fog walked into a dulllooking house to see her godmother lady canvey she wished to ask the advice of that kindly shrewd old pagan and was not at all pleased when she found the rev lionel kaimes trying to lead lady canvey in the right way he had been trying to guide her heavenward for the last year but the brighteyed old dame still danced along the primrose path with nimble feet and an appreciation of the agreeable people who were dancing along with her to perdition well my dear said lady canvey submitting her withered cheek to a conventional kiss lionel here has been speaking of the devil and you appear theres some truth in proverbs it seems oh lady canvey sighed a soft voice at the old pagans elbow i forgot leah this is my philip youarebutmortal companion you have not met her before and i dont think youll seek her company again shes not quite your sort my dear not quite your sort joan come and show yourself in response to this order a slim tall girl with a serious face came forward shyly and put out a timid hand she was plainly dressed in a black stuff gown without colour or ornament her hands and feet were slim and small she had wavy brown hair twisted into a loose knot at the nape of her neck and the features of her somewhat pale face were delicately shaped on the whole an uncommonly pretty girl lady jim decided after taking in all this at a glance but less seriousness and brighter smiles would improve her looks she was like pygmalions statue before the goddess had flushed its cold whiteness with rosy blood how are you asked leah nodding in a friendly way but without shaking hands you are one of lady canveys discoveries i suppose my discovery put in lionel cheerfully and with a proud glance at the whiterose beauty of the girl lady canvey wanted a companion and i brought her one of fra angelicos saints finished lady jim who was honest enough to confess inwardly that this ethereal loveliness was most attractive quite so chuckled lady canvey arranging many costly rings on a pair of knuckly hands lionel knows how i enjoy the company of a saint you must put up with a sinner for the time being said lady jim goodhumouredly i have come to talk business that means you intend to worry me grumbled lady canvey with a sharp glance from under her bushy eyebrows i hate being worried and bored oh i shant bore you yes you will other peoples affairs always bore me i am not like his reverence here and she waved her ebony cane towards the young curate who laughed cheerfully i admit there is some lack of resemblance assented lady jim dryly then she looked from the young man to the old woman lionel was her husbands cousin and should death make a clean sweep of the duke and frith and jim he would inherit the title and the fifty thousand a year which lady jim coveted this possibility which it must be admitted was sufficiently remote did not make leah love the young man any the more besides he was what she called goodygoody which meant that he had entered the service of his master for use and not for show as the curate of an exacting vicar in a lambeth parish he grubbed amongst the dirty poor and dispensed soup soap shelter and salvation rarely did lionel come to the west end as his task lay amongst the poor and lowly but when he did venture into high places he always called on lady canvey who had an odd kind of affection for him hes misguided but genuine my love said the pagan and moreover he amuses me which last statement amply accounted for the favour with which the old lady regarded him lionel was rather like jim tall and muscular and handsome but his face had an intelligent look which leah had never beheld in the dull visage of her husband and his blue eyes had the bright calm gaze of one whose faith is certain he affected the usual clerical garb but being only twentyfive and boyish at that his face wore a genial cheerful unworried expression which made most people open their hearts like a doctor a clergyman must have a good bedside manner and this lionel possessed moreover his heart was kindly and he was quick to observe the snubbed and neglected this feeling drew him towards joan who had retreated colouring painfully when lady jim substituted a nod for a handshake the girl was busy with a silver teapot eggshell china and hot cakes and presently handed a cup to the visitor lady jim took it somewhat absently and having satisfied herself with lionels looks and personality turned her eyes on lady canvey outwardly the old dame resembled the godmother of a fairy story and would have been admirably suited to the pointed cap and scarlet cloak of a professed witch yet the remains of beauty lingered about her wrinkled face recalling exciting crimean days when she had been a belle she was small and shrunken and bent and sometimes her grey head shook with palsy but her spirit was still vigorous and her brain clear as could be seen by the steadiness of her piercing black eyes diamondbright and clear she wore a lace cap a dress of silvery grey satin and many jewels costly but oldfashioned add to these a white chinacrape shawl and an ebony cane and behold the portrait of the lady known as the cleverest old harridan in town but that description was given by an enemy lady canvey had a quick brain and a sharp tongue yet her heart was as kindly as that of lionel perhaps it was this which drew the young and old together the room was comfortable and luxuriously furnished but with the ugly taste of the early victorian epoch lady canvey now over eighty clung to the decorations and colours which had been fashionable when she was young and on stepping into the room lady jim felt as though she had slipped back to the time of the great exhibition the motorcar outside and the old lady in the red velvet armchair represented widelysevered eras and even joan the saint and lionel the curate seemed alien to the world lady jim inhabited for that world closely resembled the one noah had fled from into the ark when the denizens were eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriagethough to be sure marriage nowadays save as a visible sign of respectability was not much considered well godmother said lady jim thinking to curry favour with this shecroesus by using an approved if somewhat obsolete address you are looking well then im a living lie retorted lady canvey grimly how can you expect me to look well when lionel here has been quoting texts for want of originality i wanted you to hear the scripture protested lionel thats your business replied lady canvey stirring her tea but i can hear the scriptures read when i please by joan who has a much sweeter voice than you young man as i suppose you think and she gave one of her dry chuckles the curate reddened and joan looked confused lady jim glancing from one serious face to the other drew her own conclusions and murmured something about a sealed fountain lady canvey not being versed in biblical imagery did not understand but lionel comprehended on the instant i am glad to hear that you read your bible lady james he said quickly leah hated to be addressed in this stiff manner yet it seemed appropriate to the outofdate room but she had no desire to quarrel with her godmothers pet in the presence of that opulent lady so she turned the tables on lionel by looking shocked of course i do i am not a pagan then i must be one snapped lady canvey for i wouldnt be you leah kaimes for the heaven i dont expect to go to hush hush said lionel pained by this flippancy coming from those withered lips lady jim glanced at her opulent beauty in a dim mirror framed in tarnished gold and laughed softly her godmother saw the look and was swift to interpret its meaning i was like that once she said in rather a quavering voice and youll come to be such as i am only youll never wear so well oh what an arm i had and she began to weep silently over her lost beauty while lionel and joan comforted the poor soul leah looked sympathetic but gave no assistance she decided that lady canvey was in her dotage and would be the more easily dealt with on that account her one desire therefore was to get rid of the two unnecessary people and begin operations at once she hoped by skilful management to come away with a considerable cheque in lady canveys shaky handwriting those drivelling tears meant a weak will and that to one of leahs determination meant money about this business she began when the old woman was again her cheerful cynical self could you spare me ten minutes godmother certainly my dear its all i can spare you this was not a promising beginning but lady jim knew she would not walk off with the spoils without a sharp brush for their gaining she looked at lionel and then at the girl whom she was sure in her own heart the curate loved have you ever heard mr kaimes talk chinese metaphysics miss tallentire she asked joan having possessed herself of the companions surname no said joan opening her violet eyes widely i am not clever enough to understand ask mr kaimes if he doesnt think you are clever enough really lady james lionel interrupted lady canvey sharply go into the conservatory with joan she will show you a new dwarf oak which i lately bought leah will entertain me and im pretty sure chuckled she that i shall entertain leah shes going to be nasty thought lady jim with a charming smile and continued to smile until the curate and his unsuspecting companion went to see the dwarf oak and to talk chinese metaphysics which leah was certain they would do lionel with a defiant glance at his cousin and with a colour which made him look unexpectedly handsome followed joan out of the stuffy room when the door was closed and the fire was unnecessarily poked up and lady canvey was comfortably settled in her chair after a word or two about the draughts which no one but herself could feel in that close atmosphere lady jim waited patiently for her godmother to begin the battle she had not long to wait lady canveys eyes were bright and lady canveys spirit reared like a warhorse to plunge down on leah she sniffed once or twice and looked sharply at the beautiful smiling face then she delivered herself of a speech which put lady jims late behaviour in a nutshell leah said lady canvey youre a born cat chapter iii lady jim was not at all offended she made every allowance for the querulous temper of old age and still smiled i rather like cats myself she observed casually they know what they want but they dont always get it my dear snapped lady canvey adding inconsequently when the cats in the dairy shes after the cream i dont think thats an original remark said leah languidly and loosening her furs for the room really was heated like the conservatory in which the lovers talked chinese metaphysics didnt george eliot say something of the sort i never knew him retorted lady canvey wilfully dense you and your chinese metaphysics indeed i wont have it have them corrected leah gently and unable to resist the opportunity lady canvey scowled like the fairy caraboss and continued without heeding the impertinence joan is the daughter of lionels vicar i see and he intends to be the vicars soninlaw what is that to you news expressed lady jim serenely i never knew such a prig as lionel could fall in love his love is the love of an honest man declared the old dame striking her crutch on the carpet i hope so for the sake of his cloth chinese metaphysics indeed grumbled lady canvey the poor child did not know what you meant she certainly seems to be somewhat dull dull yourself leah shes a sweettempered good thoughtful girl oh i didnt mean to say she was so dull as all those qualities imply said lady jim sweetly lady canvey looked wrathfully round for something to throw at her visitors head but the teatable was too far away and the old woman prized her cups and saucers finally she took refuge in a spiteful speech shes an honest girl i sincerely hope so seeing she is your companion replied leah not caring to take up so ridiculous a challenge when did you start her leah lady canvey thumped the ground again dont talk slang if you wish to know although i dont think it is any of your business joan tallentire came to me two months ago during which time you have not come to see me i was abroad apologised lady jim stifling a yawn gambling at monte carlo ill be bound i did meet jim there he lost heavily on the red i won and came home with enough to see me through the last month who were you living on abroad asked the old woman contemptuously lady jim leaned back and placed her muffchain between two very red lips let me think she murmured not put out in the least oh that little dowdy australian woman who is trying to get into society on her husbands money asked me to stop at their villa and you did for four weeks and borrowed money ill be bound lady jim nodded blandly you cant expect me to live with pigs for nothing she said with the greatest coolness youd live with the devil and borrow from him i believe cried the exasperated lady canvey glaring i do live with one assented her goddaughter but hes a stonybroke devil more modern flowers of speech i didnt create the language you can help using it no people wouldnt understand if i talked like lady jane grey or elizabeth fry they were good women but so dull objected lady jim why is it good women are always dull and dowdy they are getting ready for the next world mumbled lady canvey solemnly their outfit cant cost much then declared leah flippantly but arent we going to talk business think of that poor french sitting in the motorcar all this time youre sorry for him im sure said the old woman ironically horribly replied lady jim calmly but at least the poor creature is cooler than i am this room is stifling dont call your fellowsinner a creature leah ah even had i not seen lionel i could guess he had been with you godmother he loves the dirty and disreputable and you love the rich and disreputable that obvious speech is hardly worthy of your reputation was lady jims reply then she crossed her legs rested her muff on her knee and protested i cant wait here much longer on account of french no but im going to dine at the cecil tonight with a boy in the lancers hes a nice boy and a rich boy of course i dont like boys without money but this business she went on hurriedly jim and i are in a hole you ought to be in gaol was the angry reply that would be a hole said leah goodhumouredly but you dont want to see jim and me in the bankruptcy court why should i bother its nothing to do with me im your goddaughter youre a heartless cat said lady canvey angrily and with her eyes scintillating like jewels its no use leah ive helped you and that rascal jim over and over again apply to the duke oh weve done that he wont give us a penny then ask some of those nice boys you talk of lady jim sat very upright in her chair and a becoming colour heightened her beauty i dont ask any men for money she declared you know perfectly well lady canvey that i am any honest woman and how dull that sounds chuckled lady canvey turning the tables you should be more original leah i dont mind going out to dinner with a man cried lady jim feeling herself much aggrieved nor do i mind a box at the theatre or some gloves or things of that sort so long as jim doesnt object pooh much you care for jim i do jims got a temper he told me this very morning hed screw my neck if i broke loose then i respect him for saying it said lady canvey energetically and id respect him still more if he did it thats what i said to him retorted leah grimly all the same i am straight enough no one can say a word against me im glad to hear it you have your good points leah observed lady canvey in a more kindly tone but you show your worst side to the world why not turn over a new leaf im just about to do so and theres bankruptcy on the other side unless you help us dear godmother she ended coaxingly i wont was the firm response its like pouring water into a sieve ive given you and jim at least five thousand pounds where is it i askwhere we must pay our bills you ought to but you dont money will go in ways it shouldnt go snapped the old woman feeling herself mistress of the situation dont talk nonsense to me leah you and that rascal are a couple of spendthrifts the duke bless him started you both with a good home and a good income and now now were on the rocks as jim cleverly puts it said leah who could not help seeing the humour of the dilemma you didnt think jim was so original did you godmother leah youre impossible im sure i dont know why you should say that remonstrated lady jim i must keep up my position its not as if you had been expensively brought up went on lady canvey unheeding your father was a wasteful pauper for he got precious little off that estate of his in buckinghamshire and what he did get went into his own pocket said lady jim supplementing the family history but as my mother was dead and i was his only daughter he might have treated me better geoffrey wain was like yourself leaha hardhearted selfish oh spare me these adjectives interrupted lady jim rising my father is dead so theres nothing more to say if you cant help me at least you neednt call me names i beg your pardon said lady canvey very politely as i dont intend to give you a shilling i have no right to tell you what i think of your doings will you ring the bell please i want joan when lady canvey took this tone leah knew well that the case was hopeless in spite of senile weeping it appeared that the old woman was not so easily beguiled as might have been expected there seemed nothing for it but to leave in silence but remembering how desperate was the position lady jim refrained from ringing the bell and made a last appealthis time on business grounds if you will give me a thousand pounds for six months she proposed my husband and i will pay it back with interest and the security my dear our joint names said leah with dignity ring the bell was all the answer that lady canvey vouchsafed to this proposal and goodnight my dear lady jim recognised that she was beaten and nothing remained but to retire with dignity pressing the button of the bell she crossed to lady canvey and kissed her withered cheek with a caressing smile i am so pleased to see you looking so well she said gently but i see signs of failing in your conversation you wont see any signs of lending was the grim response oh here you are joan as that young lady entered the room with lionel at her heels send these people away and read me a chapter out of that new novel which came yesterday goodnight said lionel bending over the old lady and kissing her hand with the tenderness of a son she twitched it away theretheregoodnight take leah to that miserable creature who is perishing in her motorcar and dont make love to her she is one of those women who are a crown to their husbands lady jim did not wait to hear the old womans chuckle as she fired this last shot but swept out of the room smiling kindly on miss tallentire the curate followed her and leah began to consider what use she could make of him to farther her plans let me drive you to lambeth she said while arranging her sables at the door lionel laughed lambeth would be shocked to see me arrive at my lodgings in such an uptodate style said he pulling up the collar of his coat no thank you lady james ill walk for a time and then take a westminster bridge bus no you wont she contradicted in an imperious tone i wish to talk to you come get in french you can go home but the car my lady ill look to that do as youre told looking rather apprehensively at the machine which was humming and shaking in the bitter cold french touched his cap and moved away leah stepped lightly in and beckoned to lionel with one hand while she gripped the steeringwheel with the other come along the curate did not display much eagerness to come is it safe he asked youve sent the man away because i want to talk privately with you safe she echoed in a tone of impatient scorn id drive a car against edge himself oh very well said kaimes carelessly and placed himself beside her he was utterly devoid of fear and if there was to be a smash he was not unprepared to enter the next world lady jim gave the wheel a twirl and the car glided through the square under the grey muffling of the fog reckless as she was lady jim had to steer carefully and move slowly lest she should run into something for the fog was a trifle thicker than it had been during the afternoon all the same her keen eyes could see clearly enough and she was not at all afraid cool under all circumstances lady jim would have hummed a ditty on the streaming bridge of a plunging bucking trampsteamer going down in the bitter north atlantic weather lionel marvelled at her composure and wondered if even her dear intellect could grasp the meaning of death and its hereafter but lady jim was thinking of this world rather than of the next and talked of her troubles while steering the car down piccadilly jim and i are in a hole about money she announced abruptly for there was no need to be diplomatic with this simpleton that is not unusual murmured lionel she laughed and nodded no we have both a wonderful capacity for getting through cash now weve got down to what an american girl called the bedrock and we want help i never knew you when you did not want help said the curate wondering what was best to say and in some ways your want is very dire dont preach lionel money is better than sermons to such as you and jim no doubt but setting aside the spiritual need a sermon on your extravagance would do you good im afraid not rejoined lady jim putting on the brake for the st jamess street incline it would only go in at one ear and out of the other when i want sermons ill come and hear you preach in that dirty little church of yours meantime you must help to get jim and me out of this scrape lionel was annoyed by her reference to his church but from experience he knew it was worse than useless to argue with lady jim i cannot help you he said stiffly you know my small means bless the man i dont mean you to put your hand in your pocket i am quite aware that the clergy are better at asking than at giving you have no right to say that remonstrated kaimes warmly we help the poor and needy in that case you have now a chance of practising what you preach lady jim negotiated cockspur street and felt her way along trafalgar square in the hope of hitting whitehall only when the car was buzzing down that thoroughfare did lionel speak i am sitting in a most expensive machine he said indignantly swathed in a costly rug and beside a woman with a fortune on her back in the way of clothes then you ought to be very happy said leah calmly but ill drop you at lambeth soon and then you can get back to the mud and rags which you seem to prefer my meaning is that if you were poor you could not afford these luxuries nonsense it is only poor people who can afford them the rich make their money by selfdenial and wearing clothes which dont fit in houses furnished with the riffraff of auctionrooms jim and i have been brought up to better things to better worldly things corrected lionel bitterly and very pleasant they are my dear man it is people such as you and your husband who make the poor discontented insisted the curate im sure i dont see why the poor should be murmured lady jim vaguely there are lots of shelters and soupkitchens and workhouses and i always put ten shillings into the plate on hospital sunday not to speak of the way in which ive danced and sung at performancesgot up to help people who dont need the money so much as i do nero fiddling while rome burned well and what else could the poor man have done retorted leah there were no firebrigades in those days were there lionel felt helpless you dont understand oh yes i do you mean to be nasty if i were a vindictive woman i would drop you into the river car and allthey were crossing westminster bridge by this timebut i always like to be nice being nasty brings wrinkles and makes one so old but about our trouble she went on determined to have her own way lady canvey wont help us and no one else either theres the duke he has done enough for you not at all lady jim assured him coolly hes kept us on bread and waterthats all oh lionel was shocked at this ungrateful speech and you prefer pt de foie gras and champagne naturally not that i like pt de foie gras they torture the geese to get it i believe and it seems cruel to eat it you have a tender heart said kaimes sarcastically it has been my ruin but this trouble she harked back again to the one subject which occupied her thoughts will you see the duke and ask him to give ussayererwell two thousand pounds no i wont youll only waste it thats so like you parsons said lady jim snappishly we ask for bread and you give us a stone two thousand pounds worth of bread is a trifle too much to ask for not at all i always ask for twice what i hope to get but here we are on the other side of the water i cant take the machine into your dirty little slums get down lionel did so and stepped on to the pavement thank you for the drive said he lifting his soft hat lady jim nodded vaguely wont you speak to the duke kaimes hesitated he did not wish to appear churlish yet it seemed useless to interfere the duke is very independent he explained i dont think hell listen to me oh yes he will youre a parson and he is old enough to be afraid of the next world tell him were cleaned out and get jim and me a thousand and i tell you what added leah generously if you do ill give you a tenpound note for your charities though i dont believe in helping paupers myself yet you ask help on that ground oh i mean the unwashed paupers youre so fond of lionel ruminated do you and jim go down to firmingham for christmas yes it will be horribly dull the duke is so fond of that oldfashioned dickens christmas with its holly and mistletoe rubbish but we must keep in with him what of it why not explain your position and oh weve explained it a dozen times but the duke doesnt seem to understand now you can put the thing to him nicely well said the curate slowly i go to firmingham at christmas to preach so ill speak to the duke youre a brick cried lady jim holding out her hand ill come and hear you preach when were in firmingham i hope it will do you good said lionel shaking hands you think me a prig lady james but i assure you i know you do said leah dreading further sermons but i must get home to dress goodnight goodnight echoed lionel hopelessly and saw the car glide away into the fog between the lines of blurred lights poor woman he thought turning towards his lodgings how terribly sad her spiritual position is i trust she will get home safely seeing she is so worldly he need not have troubled lady jim reached curzon street in safety and in very good spirits did not a peacocks feather adorn one of the motorcar lamps chapter iv firmingham was the smallest of the duke of pentlands country seats and so cosy that he invariably held his christmas revels there in preference to dispensing yuletide hospitality in more splendid mansions situated in a woody and elevated part of essexthat county presumed to be a fogtormented puddlethe quaint georgian house was ideal in itself and in the repose and charm of its surroundings ugly it probably was when erected but time had mellowed its glaring walls of red brick and nature had draped them with hangings of dark green ivy the square lofty house with its freestone ornamentation its many windows and gigantic porch stood on a slight rise a position which enhanced its noble proportions on three sides level with the ground floor extended broad greystone terraces with shallow steps leading downward to smooth lawns these stretching for a considerable distance terminated in flowerbeds now devoid of blossom and colour and lawns house and flowergardens were girdled by pines and oaks sycamoretrees and elms with noble examples of the birch the beech and cedars proud and tall a wide straight avenue ran for a quarter of a mile through grim firs to ornate iron gates swinging between massive stone pillars surmounted by the ducal arms and these same gates gave entrance to a spacious and wild park as delightful as that wood near athens where oberon tricked titania the charming country outside this sacred enclosure appealed to artists in search of the picturesque certainly the landscape was domestic and tame for here nature yielded to the controlling hand of man but the pleasant walks the deep lanes the ancient villages and the comfortable farmhouses sprinkled thickly for miles made in conjunction a pretty picture of rural peace and contentment and the contentment was genuine for no better or more considerate landlord than the duke existed he was popular in the neighbourhood and his sway almost imperiala true king of the castle jim and his wife drove from the station in quite a darby and joan style and through fear of the duke rather than in compliment to the season were prepared to enact the parts of man and wife to perfection it was rather hard for leah to say pretty things to jim in public and for jim to hover anxiously round leah as a loverlike husband but the duke expected such behaviour and they were astute enough not to disappoint him in his rough tweeds with jovial looks and hearty words jim was quite the english squire of the storybook and shook hands with some of his fathers tenants who haunted the local station in quite the allmenarebrothers style leah also dispensed smiles and nods to marvelling villagers who stared openmouthed at her beauty but in the comfortable brougham jim folded his arms and lapsed into sulky silence and leah yawned and looked out of the window for want of something better to do they were off the stage now and could take their ease very wintry looked the landscape through which they passed the meadowlands were deep in snow and gaunt leafless trees started like black spectres from the milky ground ponds and ditches wore masks of darklygreen ice and the frozen road rang like iron under the hoofs of the horses a yellowish sky with the promise of almost immediate snow lowered over the starving world and for lack of foliage the landscape widened to the observing eye a dull crimson in the west showed that the sun was sinking in foggy splendour the shrill voices of children singing musichall songs instead of carols saluted their ears quite like a christmas card isnt it jim if it wasnt for the musichall songs assented her husband looking out of his window wonder if therell be skatin i daresay i hope so i love skating cause you can show off we have each our little vanities jim said lady jim whom hope made goodhumoured theres the churchwhat a pretty old building and how well the snow contrasts with the red roof and the ivy we have to go there on christmas day gloomed kaimes we must show an example to the lower orders explained leah in her britishmatron tone besides lionel preaches how awful why has the duke put him in the bill mr dane the vicar is ill and asked lionel to fill the pulpit the duke has nothing to do with it wish i had grumbled jim id have the sermon cut out youd have the church turned into a musichall i daresay retorted his wife contemptuously but you must be as nice as you know how to lionel remember he promised to speak to the duke ill keep awake during his sermon but i shant promise to do more leah youre runnin this show quite so but i dont want you to spoil it lionel has great influence with the duke frightens the old man to death with texts and tophet i expect said jim crossly i know these parsons i was not aware that your circle of friends included such respectable acquaintances oh i can hold a candle to a certain person as well as you leah who do we meet at firmingham the usual dull lot said lady jim with a yawn frith and his stupid little wife who seems to model herself on david copperfields dora then lady canvey with her new companion is sure to be present fancy havin that deathshead at a christmas feast who else leah that little russian doctor demetrius we met him at the embassy if you remember not the russian embassy but the french hes out of favour with the czar and dare not leave england in case he should be sent to siberia he can practise for it here said jim shivering beastly cold isnt it leah whats demetrius doin here looking after the dukes health he says he can cure his gout i hope he will muttered kaimes devoutly for if frith comes along we shant get a shillin im half afraid we shant get one now sighed lady jim heres the avenue what a charming place id let it out on buildin leases if i had it remarked the prosaic jim an cut the timber lot of money in those trees dont look into jewellers windows jim youre not rich enough to buy the stock rich it was as much as i could do to scrape enough together for our tickets ah well said leah reassuringly as the wheels scrunched the frozen snow before the great porch we neednt spend anything here except half a crown for the plate catch me wastin money in that way snapped kaimes swinging himself out to help his wife to alight halloa heres old colley lookin like a dean as usual and jim again assuming his hearty manner and jovial leer shook hands with the butler whom he had known since etonian days the houseparty was composed of hostile elements consequently every one was compelled to adopt a forced air of christmas peace and goodwill which rather tried jumpy nerves the duke dug up fossilised cousins to participate in the festive season and these did not suit with some fashionable folk who for various reasons as they put it had to be nice to the dear old duke mr jaffray and his poetic sister of fifty who quarrelled incessantly hardly suited the tastes of mrs penworthy as a daughter of the horseleech and intensely uptodate nor did graham the little england politician enjoy the company of lord sargon a tory and a believer in the divine right of the last legal descendant of the stuarts also the various young women and men who were really nobodies and fancied themselves somebodies found the parts they were expected to take in an oldfashioned christmas rather a bore the season of peace and goodwill explained the duke after dinner when this collection of smartness and do wellness embellished the great drawingroom we must all love one another the company assented conventionally and every one smiled violently on every one to the amusement of lady canvey if this was the palace of truth she announced there would be trouble but the mellowing influence of the time just so duke but some people are like certain pears they wont mellowthey only become sleepy and that reminds me she added looking round for joan ill go to bed soon not on christmas eve urged the duke bending over her chair we intend to keep yuletide as our ancestors didsnapdragon the mummers the christmastree the carolsingers and the ghoststories not one of them clever enough to tell a real ghost story snapped lady canvey cynically examining faces old and young made up and natural oh i know a lovely lovely tale said miss jaffray who was gowned girlishly in white trimmed oddly with ivy and who looked like a ruin that will last till tomorrow morning chimed in her brother seeing an opportunity of being nasty snapdragon is more fun eh lady frithyou used to enjoy that once i do so nowdear snapdragon said the marchioness who was sentimental and adored her tall lean husband but the christmastreeoh that is too sweet bunny and i met for the first time under a christmastree and he fell in love with me didnt you bunny it was rather hard on lord frith that he should be addressed by this most inappropriate name he was as stiff as a spaniard sad in his looks and spoke little although eminently wellbred and clever in a political way he was not a genial personage in this he differed from his father for the duke was stout and kindly looking beaming with goodhumour and quite the style of host who would have figured in sir roger de coverleys time report said that he had been much too gay in his youth and that the late duchess had put up with a great deal lady canvey could have related stories about the duke likely to be much more entertaining than the proposed ghosttales but she was fond of her host who like herself was a link with the remote past and never told stories out of school when she and the duke got together they wagged their old heads over dead and donewith scandals and lamented these days of vulgar and blatant sin but whatever their pasts may have been they were an ideal couple in the way of venerable looks and sweet old age quite a philemon and baucis of modern times meantime bunny scowled on his frivolous little wife and then gave her a sentimental smile he was always torn between love and propriety for lady frith imitating dora as lady jim averred said the most exasperating things in a sweet treble he used to lecture her in private and explain what she should say but these corrections always ended in tears on the part of the childwife and in complete surrender on the part of her doting husband lady frith certainly could play her part in society excellently well on occasions and was more shrewd than would have been guessed from her baby face and infantile manners but she wanted to be original and therefore plagiarised from dickens novel this assumption of an imaginary character she called possessing a personality mrs penworthy was old wine in a new bottle that is she looked twentyfive and acted like an experienced coquette of double the age married to a modern job called freddy whose meekness was proverbial she led him about like a pet lamb and taught him a few parlor tricks so that people might say what an attached couple which they did tongue in cheek a sweet look from mrs penworthy warmed freddys heart for four and twenty hours even though the cost of the merest glance sometimes ran into double figures in his hours of leisure which were few he frequently told her that she was an angel but the expression did not sound so agreeable on freddys lips as on those of the half dozen nice boys who constituted her court she went everywhere and knew everyone and did the things she ought not to have done with discretion freddy thought her a playful kitten quite blind to the fact that she had grown rapidly into a cat but with smiling looks and sheathed claws and freddys diamonds on her neck she was a very pretty cat and blinked sleepily at those who admired her so long as freddy gave her a silken cushion to rest on and plenty of cream to drink moreover she only scratched those who could not scratch back i really think its awful fun said mrs penworthy to her courtall this sort of thing you knowholly and snow and and mistletoe suggested one of the nice boys now if you talk like that algy you shant be spoken to for a week a look is enough for me whispered the adoring algy naughty what would freddy say lady canveys sharp ears overheard the banter were i freddy i know what id say she murmured grimly then aloud to spoil sport is your husband here mrs penworthy freddy oh dear me no hes gone to paris or peru ori forget exactly wherebut its something beginning with a p dear freddy she laid an entirely useless fan on her lips pensively he works so very very hard and quite right too said lady canvey bluntly seeing what a devoted wife he has ah you dont know how freddy tries me dear lady canvey i am devotedthat i am but you see i took freddy for better or worse oh no corrected the old woman tartly you took the better and freddy took the worse mrs penworthy not being ready with an answer murmured something about jealous old thing and moved away with her court to where lord sargon was holding forth on his pet craze if only our ancient kings were back he said but not too loud as the duke might have disapproved of the disloyalty christmas would be christmas in the good old times of the blessed martyr charles the bad old times contradicted mr graham it was then that our beloved country began to annex places which are useless let us give up everything beyond the channel and attend to our own country then indeed christmas will be christmas and the parish pump will pour forth beer said mr jaffray referring to the badge of the little englander ah the conduits ran wine in those sweet old days sighed his sister in her poetic vein and people never washed said a truculent old gentleman given to sanitation what i say is let every house have a bathroom i say jim is this going to last for ever asked leah considerably bored by these intellectual fireworks a week anyhow replied jim who was feeling happy after a large dinner but if you will come to the zoo leah you mustnt find fault with th animals they are scarcely so interesting oh animals dont talk i spose you mean you do retorted lady jim calmly theres demetrius and she left her husband in the clutches of mrs penworthy with a whispered caution dont let her go too far jim this week were the respectable middleclass pair who live in slateroofed houses jim did not quite understand but he vaguely guessed that he was to keep mrs penworthy at a distance for some minutes he did this but she soon overcame his scruples and begged him to take her to the picture gallery the discreet court did not follow constantine demetrius was a small dark neat man with an ivory complexion black hair a waxed moustache and a stereotyped smile he was dressed perfectly in a foreign fashion and placed his small feet together when he made his bow to lady jim his english was much better than his morals and perhaps this was why lady jim beckoned him to her side demetrius was one of her most ardent admirers and she had a vague idea of making use of him at present she did not see how to utilise his services but if ever she required a thoroughly unscrupulous man she knew that she would need him besides he was really a clever doctor and when lady jim was ill she felt it would hasten the cure to think she was being attended to for nothing what do you think of all this she asked him when they were snugly bestowed in a cosy corner it is very english said the russian with a shrug that means very dull demetrius clicked his heels together and made a bow from the middle of his body at present i cannot say so said he gallantly and you wouldnt if you thought so madam the truth to a ravishing woman is like sunshine to a coalminer we get it so rarely by the way how is mademoiselle aksakoff she is well and as pretty as ever i see nothing of beauty but what is before me all the same you will leave me and marry mademoiselle aksakoff demetrius looked at lady jim with such fire in his dark eyes that she felt slightly uncomfortable in spite of her courageous nature it was easy to play with the hearts of phlegmatic englishmen but to amuse herself with this fiery slav was like trifling with a tiger nevertheless lady jim with a view to future contingencies allured him with sweet looks and tantalised him with halfgranted favours katinka aksakoff the daughter of a russian official attached to the embassy loved demetrius even to the extent of helping him to escape the lures of the secret police which would have drawn him to the continent en route for siberia therefore she hated lady jim because that astute diplomatist kept demetrius dangling at her skirts in the bonds of a nevertoberequited love on the chance that some day she might require him and the russian knew that leah kaimes was a woman who wanted all for nothing but if possible he intended to make his own bargain with her lady jim was clever but demetrius thought he could entangle her monsieur demetrius she said after a pause during which the fire died out of the russians eyes if you wanted money i would get it said he determinedly but if you saw no way of getting it i would make the way you cant make bricks without straw clever people can replied demetrius dryly lady jim looked down at her rings are you clever she asked to benefit some people i might be he said in a low voice she stared straight before her and noted that lionel was chatting with miss tallentire as yet the curate had not spoken with the duke so that was a quarter yet to be tried nevertheless lady jim had a shrewd idea in spite of the comedy being played by herself and jim and of lionels pleading that the duke would be adamant it behoved her to have another string to her bow and this she could find in demetrius but she did not know yet to what use she could put him it was impossible to ask him to sway the duke strong as his influence was with that gouty nobleman lady jim had a good deal of what she called pride and did not intend to let demetrius know her true position if she could help it before she could say anything and really she did not know what to say the duke gave the signal for the commencement of the christmas festivities these were strong in intention but weak in execution the company burnt their fingers over snapdragon capered in sir roger de coverley tempted the fates with roasting chestnuts and finally adjourned to a large hall where glittered a splendid christmastree then danced in the mummers villagers all tricked out as robin hood and maid marian as the terrible turk santa claus st george and the dragona most meek beastand with hordes of merry laughing children the christmastree dropped its costly manycoloured fruits into expectant laps and a chorus of praise hymned the munificence of the gratified duke even lady jim thanked him for the dainty goldnet purse which she received and if she did peep in slyly to see whether it was lined with a cheque or a banknote that was only out of compliment to her fatherinlaws known generosity santa claus has not got a banking account she murmured to her husband jim who was scowling at his gifta set of sleevelinks enamelled with the four viceswomen cards drink and racinggrowled hes got a dashed lot of impertinence as if id wear these things no said leah tickled by the implied rebuke it doesnt do to wear your heart on your sleevelinks a witticism which was entirely lost on jim he was one of the many obtuse swine who trampled on leahs pearls what with eating and drinking and professing seasonable sentiments which certainly did not come from the heart everyone became bored and bilious and fractious leah surveyed the yawning revellers with a feeling that christmas old style was a failure you cant arrange an orgy was her comment to lady canvey it must come by chance to be successful i dont think pentland intended anything so disreputable retorted the old dame consequently you are disappointed bored lady jim assured her i suppose its eating plum pudding which always makes me dull but not goodnatured my digestion has its limits good night godmother i suppose its time for you to be taken to pieces and having stricken lady canvey dumb with rage she slipped away to bed wondering what would happen before next christmas something must be done she thought wearily climbing the stairs if lionel fails with the duke demetrius might might what she did not know but she really did feel that something might be done with demetrius chapter v a congregation drawn to the church of all angels by various inducements filled it to overflowing the next morning some came because it was christmas day others to hear lionel kaimes preach many desired to see the ducal party and one or two presented themselves in gods house to thank him for the gift of his son sent to save a dying world knowing the dukes old age impeccability nearly all his guests were present and filled three large pews to the wondering awe of the villagers and their wives these last especially were distracted by the splendour of the ladies dresses and the variety of the new fashions many laudable imitations of those marvellous frocks were visible in country lane and village street before easter lady jim and her husband discreetly sat in the body of the church some distance from the pulpit as leah did not wish to come under the curates eye she thought he was quite capable of preaching at her in which case a natural resentment would have led to a quarrel prejudicial to the exercise of lionels good offices with the duke moreover leah occupied with her own thoughts did not want to be distracted by a sermon of religious platitudes she stood up and sat down mechanically looking too flamboyant to be in harmony with the simplicity of the building tucked into the opening of her incroyable coat claretcoloured and with strikingly large buttons she wore a cupshaped nosegay of white and pink orchids her hat was large with many feathers of the new titian red and resembled nothing in nature she did not wear jewellery but the vivid colours of her dress made up for the absence of gems there was something tropical about leah and in that chill grey church she glowed like a gorgeous flower all splendour and perfume and radiant vitality her exuberant beauty and colour attracted even the attention of jim he bent forward when the prayer for the kings majesty was being said i believe youre enjoyin it muttered jim resentfully hshsss breathed leah devoutly and knelt in a saintly attitude which was far from expressing her real feelings for the moment she did not pray herself or think of the prayer that was being offered her thoughts were busy with bills and duns and jims defects and the chances that demetrius might prove useful and when she did murmur a prayer it was one of those which are rarely answered or if answered turn to the confusion of the suppliant plenty of money no trouble much enjoyment and the destruction of her enemies were the elements which composed this remarkable petition lady jim was not very clear as to whom she was asking but she had a vague feeling which she mistook for religion that there might be some one who could give her what she required moreover it was just as well to be on the safe side yet even as she tried the experiment the earthly superstition asserted itself and she carefully fingered a peacocks feather inside her muff this serving of god and a fetish may seem ridiculous in a woman of leahs capacity nevertheless she devoutly believed that if the unseen deity did not help her the seen baal would and after all was there not a cat of heines acquaintance who made genuflections before a pinkribboned flageolet but cats as the poet remarks are so superstitious and leah the pantheress was of the feline tribe having made herself safe with the unknown lady jim joined in the ensuing hymn bravely she thought the words dreary and the tune barbarous but the fervour of her deep contralto voice reached the dukes ears and he gave her an approving glance so that was something gained leah would have gone through the whole collection of ancient and modern to learn the precise meaning of that look but she was satisfied with guessing and sat down cheerfully to be bored with the sermon it occurred to her that the prayer had been heard and would probably be granted but whether by the peacocks feather or the deity of whom lionel now began to speak she could not determine and his name shall be called wonderfulthis was the curates text and he discoursed on it in a simple and impressive way speaking of the birth of christ of his teaching and plan of salvation of his selfdenying life and unwearying kindness the young mans grave and tender periods shamed the most inattentive into thoughtfulness lionel was not a born orator but he was very much in earnest and preached with an emphasis which carried undeniable conviction mrs penworthy felt suddenly virtuous and resolved to repeat as much of the sermon as she could remember to freddy so that he might not grumble so much over what the silly thing called her extravagance even lady canvey wagged her aged head and thought that she might help a few deserving paupers if their needs could be supplied in moderation leah herself was impressed to the extent of hoping that the duke would see that it behoved him to fill the empty pockets of a deserving and pretty daughterinlaw jim would have approved of this sentiment but all the time he was fast asleep and woke up cross when she pinched him to rise for the doxology beyond a stray sentence here and there leah had not paid much attention she had heard it all before though some of the sentiments were new and as she thought ridiculous when the preacher was fairly started she relapsed into her own thoughts these being unpleasant she permitted her hard eyes to wander round the church after a wondering gaze at the extraordinary fashions of the women and a patronising examination of the decorations she caught sight of a face belonging to a young man on the other side of the aisle he was so like jim that she involuntarily turned to see if her husband still slumbered placidly by her side the double was dressed in grey tweeds and looked almost like a gentleman he stooped a trifle in spite of his square shoulders and stalwart figure and every now and then coughed painfully apparently he was ill with some pulmonary complaint which the freezing atmosphere of the church accentuated leah wondered at the resemblance and thought of certain traditionary stories concerning the youthful days of the duke but after a second glance she decided that perhaps there was nothing in it jim was of a pinkandwhite bovine commonplace type and there were hundreds like him in manners and morals and looks moreover she was so weary of seeing jims inane face over the breakfastcups that she did not care to gaze at the imitation nevertheless being a woman with the orthodox share of eves curiosity she resolved to ask questions about this consumptive double mrs arthur the firmingham housekeeper could doubtless tell some story as she knew much more about the duke than had ever appeared even in the most scurrilous society paper and lady jim knew how to make her talk when the plate circled leah quadrupled jims halfcrown and he did not approve when the piece of gold jingled amongst the silver youve been borrowin jim accused her in an angry whisper praise god from whom all blessings flow sang leah without replying and put her whole heart and voice into the hymn in the hope that some of the blessings might trickle her way and why not seeing that she had baited her hook with a sprat to catch the muchneeded mackerel but it was useless to explain this to jim he would not have understood such lavish fishing it was really too lovely mrs penworthy assured the duke at luncheon mr kaimes spoke just the things i feel and the decorationsoh reallyso very tasteful but the mistletoe duke i dont think there should have been mistletoe round the pulpit such an immoral plant chimed in lady canvey with sharp twinkling eyes and so useless to some people who can dispense with it as an excuse i daresay the druids were no better than they should have been they were before my time said mrs penworthy very prettily and you must have been quite a child then dear lady canvey the sermon affected lady frith in another fashion oh dear bunny she said to her saturnine husband what a lovely way lionel puts things do let us help people theres leah you know exactly assented frith dryly i do know and for that reason i dont intend to waste money in that direction but lionel talked of aiding the poor and needy that doesnt include the extravagant and ungrateful retorted her lord you are an unsophisticated child hilda oh bunny how could you call poor leah and her husband names we must love every one at this season oh ill love them as much as you please but not to the extent of supporting them plainly there was nothing to be got out of frith as lady jim decided when the marchioness reported a part of this conversation later in the day but she attempted to soften the marquis by saying things which she knew the childwife would babble again to her hardhearted husband jim and i dont want money dear she said kissing lady frith so long as frith is nice to us we dont care you have your position to keep up and we are nothing but it was sweet of you to speak oh no prattled hilda in her childish way i want every one to love me ever so much i am sure they do isnt frith jealous as nearly jealous as a perfect man can be i thought perfect men had no imperfection retorted lady jim ironically but its all right dear another kisswe must bear our cross as lionel said this morning now i must go to see old mrs arthur one must be good to ones inferiors the result of this conversation was that lady frith told her husband of leahs pointedly correct humbleness whereat the marquis laughed shortly he quite understood lady jims tactics and was resolved that they should not succeed frith was one of the few men lady jim had never fascinated and she hated to be under his clearsighted gaze if hilda could have heard leahs inward remarks as she proceeded to the housekeepers room she would scarcely have given so favourable a report good day mrs arthur said lady jim to the oldfashioned dame in the black silk and lace cap who rose to drop a prim curtsey i have come to wish you the compliments of the season thank you my lady wont you be seated lady jim selected the most comfortable chair in the quaint small room and graciously requested the housekeeper to resume her seat then she asked about mrs arthurs cough and her sailor son and her married daughter and after various other things in which she did not feel the least interest the old woman much impressed with leahs condescension and not sufficiently clever to see through her arts expanded like a winter rose in this aristocratic sunshine in a few minutes she was chatting quite at her ease and with the discursive garrulousness of old age this was the unguarded mood leah desired for the satisfaction of her curiosity and having created it by an appearance of the deepest interest in mrs arthurs domestic smallbeer chronicles she proceeded to take advantage of the opportunity the service was delightful this morning she observed the decorations were charming and the congregation so attentive i suppose you know every one in the village mrs arthur i ought to my lady i am firmingham bred and born and a very good representative of the place said leah kindly the villagers are really quite nicelookingespecially the men if you saw my son was he in church this morning asked lady jim who knew very well that the young man was with his ship in chinese waters i saw rather a handsome young fellow in one of the pews but he looked ill of course i thought him handsome she went on carelessly and with a soft laugh he was the image of my husband mrs arthur looked rather nervous there is only one young man hereabouts who resembles lord james she observed and i do not wonder you saw the likeness my lady harold garth is like lord james now and is such as his grace was in his youth oh leahs eyes opened do you mean to say nothing my ladynothing and mrs arthurs hands fiddled nervously with the gold chain she wore round her neck then womanlike she went on to contradict herself harold garth has lately returned from canada where he went to farm garth i seem to know the name i dont know who can have mentioned it to you my lady he is the only garth in the district and i daresay you never saw him before well no i must admit that i never have why canada explained mrs arthur vaguely he has been there for the last twenty years he went out to make money at the age of fifteen and has apparently returned with consumption yes poor lad but the duke is very kind to him lady jim laughed meaningly oh the duke is very kind to him is he thats so like the duke always thoughtful fifteen and twentyhe is about thirtyfive more or less my lady my husbands age said lady jim pointedly yes my lady assented mrs arthur closing her lips firmly leah tried another question why doesnt this young mans family keep him instead of letting the duke support him harold garth has no family my lady his mother is dead and his father mrs arthur looked down i know nothing about his father she said in low tones harold is a lonely man poor soul he lives at the pentland arms and mrs kibby the landlady is as kind to him as though he were her own son and his gracebless himdoes all he can to smooth harolds way to the grave he sent that foreign doctor to demetrius said lady jim quickly oh so demetrius knows him yes my lady he thinks he can cure him of this consumption i do not think so myself proceeded mrs arthur garrulously for harold is booked for death you can see it in his face i believe his grace wants him to go to a warmer climate what a deep interest the duke takes in this man mrs arthur looked up suddenly and a flush dyed her withered cheek the eyes of the two women met and the situation was adjusted without words after that interchange of glances leah knew as well as if mrs arthur had explained at length that harold had ducal blood in his veins and that is why he is so like jim she thought rising to go i hope the poor fellow will get well she said aloud but really he was foolish to venture into that cold church i dont think he minds if he is dead or alive my lady he has no friends oh yes the duke certainly his grace who is a friend to all said mrs arthur loyally lady jim laughed and went away she had learned all she wished to learn but beyond satisfying a passing curiosity had no desire to pursue the subject still she thought it would amuse her to ask demetrius a few questions concerning this patient and went in search of him somehow the subject of harold garth and his resemblance to jim took hold of her imagination and she could not put it out of her head while she was thinking of other matters the thought of the strange likenessnow fully accounted forwould slip in and she would find herself pondering afterwards she declared that this insistence of a passing thought was the work of providence for so she called the peacockfeather baal she served demetrius was not in the house having been called out to see some one who was ill in the village so lionel assured her and moreover supplied her with the name of the patient its a young fellow called harold garth he said gravely he foolishly came to church this morning and being already ill is worse from having ventured out i never heard a parson call going to church foolishness before said lady jim surprised that the subject should crop up again in so unexpected a manner who is harold garth a protge of the dukes he has just returned from canada said the curate simply and curiously enough he is rather like the kaimes family perhaps that is why the duke is so kind to him perhaps it is said leah wondering how much lionel guessed i dont think i ever saw him she added mendaciously if you did you would mistake him for your husband how awful shuddered leah as though one jim wasnt enough to be bothered with but cant we talk of something more interestingyour sermon for instance i trust you found that interesting said lionel smiling oh yesit wasnt too long i seedrylyyou judge the interest of a sermon by its length oh noreally i quite enjoyed your preaching i dont preach that people may enjoy but that they may think seriously of what they are im sure i think seriously enough lionel have you spoken to the duke no i wish you would tomorrow this is christmas day remember as if i could forget with all the nonsense thats going on here retorted lady jim glancing superciliously round at the decorations every one is overdoing the brotherly business i quite expected my maid to tell me that she loved me and i dont see why you shouldnt ask the duke today youll squeeze the money out of him the more easily while hes got this christmassy emotion on i dont squeeze money out of people said kaimes stiffly what a large income you must have then i live within it thats nothing to boast of id live within mine if i had ten thousand a year i doubt it replied lionel who could not help laughing at her coolness youd spend fifty thousand if you had it ratherif i were the duchess of pentland but theres no chance of such luck friths too healthy do smile again lionelyouve got such nice teeth and look quite a good sort when you let yourself go what am i to smile at asked the curate with deliberate austerity at me and on me i put ten shillings into the plate this morning lionel was a thoroughly good young man and had a great sense of the dignity of his cloth and the responsibility of his position but he also possessed humour and could not help retorting after the style of a certain witty bishop thats the smallest fire insurance i ever heard of said he genially and moved away leaving lady jim amused i didnt think he had so much fun in him she thought making for the library but the speech is too clever to be originalwhich showed that leah suspected the existence of the witty bishop but the word insurance put her mind on jims mad idea to pretend death and cheat the company out of twenty thousand pounds with accumulations leah devoutly wished that the trick could be managed its success meant a clearance of debt and of jim when the millennium would come and as mrs nicklebys admirer put it all would be gas and gaiters she resolved to have another chat with jim on the subject and meantime went to seek for a novel after boring herself with mrs arthur and lionel she wished to read away a wellearned hour of peace but this for the moment she was not destined to enjoy the library was empty save for the presence of the last person whom lady jim wished to encounter when miss jaffray looked up from a gigantic volume with an almost toothless smile leah turned to fly but the old maid arrested her flight with a joyful shout she usually did shout as her brother was slightly deaf which deceived her into thinking the entire human race was likewise afflicted so sweet of you to come here shouted miss jaffray i am just dying for some one to talk to if the decision had been left to lady jim she would have gladly avoided the talk to bring about this result but it occurred to her scheming mind that this dull spinster was wealthy and might be cajoled or frightened into lending money leah did not specify the sum even in her own mind as she did not know how much more this virgin soil would yield if properly worked sitting down promptly she began to chat on the first subject that came into her head what are you reading so earnestly she asked sweetly the morte darthur said the spinster fondling the ponderous tome which her weak knees could hardly support heavens thought lady jim with a charming smile meaning nothing am i to be bored with another arthur the blackletter edition went on miss jaffray in a loud and oratorical voice most interesting so sweet to think of those dear dead days when knights went about as troubadours with guitars in steel armour dying for queens of beauty delightful assented lady jim yawning at the dullness of the picture butwith a disparaging glance at the letteringisnt it rather like reading a german newspaper i prefer novels myself so do i when not in a poetic humour shouted her companion all the old old masters of fiction dickens bulwerlytton wilkie collins i love them allevery one i seem to know those names ventured leah carefully what did they write miss jaffray the spinster gasped brought up in a library she could not understand this fashionable ignorance which truth to say was partially assumed leah was by no means the ignoramus she made herself out to be but for the sake of business she thought it judicious to foster miss jaffrays vanity by assuming an inferior position do you ever read asked miss jaffray in the voice of goliath challenging the army of saul oh yes society newspapers and french novels but they are so improper nothing amusing is improper to my mind said lady jim calmly and i really did skim through a page or two of dickens horribly dull i thought him oh miss jaffray gasped again he did so much good perhaps that is why his books are dull thoroughly good people are invariably here she discreetly pulled the reins as miss jaffray considering herself good might not relish the malicious witticism presuming she could understand it ill take you as my instructor dear miss jaffray added leah stifling another yawn do tell me what to read theres wilkie collinss armadale said the old maid delighted at being put into the pulpit but you may think me rude for recommending that why should i theres a character in it so like you in appearance apologised miss jaffray in appearance only you will understand i should be sorry indeed to think that in morals you resembled miss gwilt misshow much gwilt gwilt spelt the spinsterthe strange name of a strange woman shes the character i spoke of no really you mightnt like her she waswellererdisreputable better begin with the woman in white oh i have heard of that what is it about a striking resemblance between two women one is passed off by her wicked husband as the other and buriedto get money you understanda kind of fraud leah turned cold and hot it sounded as though this simple woman was explaining the contemplated deceit of herself and jim i dont think i should like that book at all she said diplomatically cunning it sounds dull i would rather read about the naughty womanmisswhatshername its in yonder bookshelf said miss jaffray pointing a lean finger to the end of the room along with the rest of the masters novels but please dont think that i fancy you resemble miss gwilts moral character you certainly have her auburn hair red hair corrected lady jim rising im rather proud of it you ought to be said the old maid with simple admiration and rising to put away her tome i can imagine you a queen of beauty in the dear old tournaments with knights at your feet oh many are there now without tournaments said leah with superb selfconfidence but i prefer men of higher rank than knights though i will say she added generously that men who have won knighthood are cleverer than those donkeys who inherit all this was greek to miss jaffray and after putting away her volume she departed with a final recommendation about miss gwilt lady jim walked to where wilkie collinss novels lined the shelf andneedless to sayselected the woman in white i wonder if i can make fact out of fiction she asked herself chapter vi it was jims custom to saunter into his wifes bedroom before descending to make a hearty meal and complain that he had rested badly this was a pleasing fiction as he slept like a dormouse and snored steadily through the hours he allotted to sleep without even a dream but on entering for his morning grumble he was so surprised to find leah in her dressinggown before a brisk fire with a breakfast at her elbow and a book open on her lap that he forgot his egotism jim could scarcely believe his lazy eyes for he knew well that leah was no student whats up he asked after pausing at the door to say by jupiter with every appearance of surprise got a headache if i had should i cure it with a novel asked his wife disdainfully dont know im sure replied jim with the matutinal goodhumour of a healthy animal doctors recommend such rum things nowadays but it doesnt matter im off to feed wait for ten minutes jim i have something to say youre not goin to read are you i cant stand readin on a empty stomwell on nothin have you ever heard of the woman in white asked leah irrelevantly no who is she its a novel dont read em real lifes much more fun lady jim looked at him steadily we might turn thisshe touched the book lightlyinto real life goin to make a play of it questioned jim obtusely well you might call it a comedy she answered i certainly do not want it to be a tragedythough it might come to that she ended in a lower tone jim opened his puzzled blue eyes want of breakfast i spose he ruminated but i dont know what youre talkin about ive passed a white night announced his wife abruptly whats that the french expression for a wakeful night but you say it in english and how can its useless wasting french on a man who understands only the argot of the trottoir youre wastin it now a wakeful nighteh why didnt you try that new sedative demetrius gave you i didnt want to sleep this book was too interesting i wish you to read it and she extended the novel to her husband what if she had offered poison jim could not have betrayed more abhorrence read youwantmetoread well you know words of two syllables dont you she retorted impatiently take it jim handled the book as though it were a scorpion turning over a hundred leaves rapidly love an diaries andoh bosh not at all unless bosh is your word for common sense i see a chance of getting that money what money leah made an impatient movement how dense you are the insurance money of coursethe twenty thousand pounds suppose you died stop it i told you i wouldnt and you told me that you might pretend to die oh i was only talkin you dont want me to be buried alive it wouldnt be much good said his wife with a shrug we must have a genuine corpselike you an inkling of her meaning stole into jims dull brain and he sat down suddenly go on said he hoarsely harold garth is like you where thewhat theyou saw him in church yesterday hes ill with consumption dying they say demetrius attends him supposingsupposingher imagination made her cheeks flushsupposingoh you understand the sluggish comprehension of the man grasped her hinted scheme suddenly and his eyes lighted up supposing he died and was buried in place of me you mean you dont suppose i mean murder do you she cried rising to the height of her tall figure and speaking irritably you would if there was money in it said jim grimly it would be a natural death went on leah rapidly and pacing the room to relieve the strain on her nerves the poor fellow cant live long if he died and was buried as no go contradicted jim rising in his turn every one about here knows of the likeness for which he added slowly theres a reason so i learned yesterday from mrs arthur jim was indignant do you mean to tell me i mean to tell you that i gathered the truth from what she left unsaid you dont suppose that i require words to explain things i dont see how its to be managed said kaimes reflectively if it could be would you surrender everything and yes i would for a quarter of the money then id go out of your life an to lima lima said lady jim stopping suddenly why to lima youve been there three times since we married no end of a place lima muttered jim feebly his wife looked at his colouring face attentively and laughed in a short rasping manner an idea had occurred to her which she did not think it necessary to impart to jim when youre legally dead she said sharply i shall have no control over your life or movements all i want to know is if this business can be managed will you do your share by disappearing yes but i dont see how read that book jim and youll understand better it gave me the idea though our plot will be different in many ways well said jim tucking the novel under his arm ill dip into it dont let any one see you reading and replace it in the library without any one knowing why should i you fool snarled leah viciously if this thing is to be carried through safely no suspicion must rest on either of us do you suppose that i have spoken to this double of yours or have let any one know that i have read the book i dont think it really matters much as people are too stupid to see things but it is just as well to be on the safe side but i dont see how began kaimes again and again she cut him short i doi do demetrius attends this young fellow oh and hedemetrius i mean leave me to deal with him she said confidently jim flung the book on the floor and looked at her with clenched hands what is this demetrius to you he asked violently a puppet i can pull the strings of she retorted and be good enough to remember that you are not in a trainingstable if that beastly little tartar my dear jim said his wife coolly if you ask me about demetrius i shall certainly ask you about lima kaimes was taken aback lima he stammered flushing to the roots of his fair hair what do you mean i mean that you can trust me to ask no questions if you will mind your own business as you are my wife demetrius is my business think of me as your widow then she mocked and that i cant be without the aid of demetrius why cant you speak plainly i might ask you the same question butshe picked up the novel and thrust it into jims unwilling handsi fancy you and i understand one another pretty well i wont have any man making love to you very good said leah calmly then you must remain a pauper and my husband im not going to all this trouble to share you with well with whomout with it i think you can answer that question best jim upon my honour pah she said with disgust hadnt we better leave honour out of this shady business we are about to embark in you really mean to i really mean to get that twenty thousand pounds youll lose me jim reminded her uneasily leah made a grimace my loss is anothers gain she said significantly now go away jim i have to dress in my best frock in order to fascinate demetrius and she vanished into her dressingroom with a provoking laugh lord jim said something about demetrius that involved the use of unprintable language then he slipped the book into the pocket of his shootingjacket and lumbered downstairs in spite of his squabbling with leah and the existence of some one in lima he was furiously jealous of demetrius and scowled at the russian when they met demetrius rather liked that scowl as he guessed the reason and took it as a tribute to his fascinations if he had known lady jims real intentions and that she intended to convert english rather than french fiction into everyday facts he might not have smiled so victoriously over his coffee but demetrius made the fatal mistake of so many clever men he knew he was clever and thereby was not what he fancied himself to be the true secret of success lies not in knowing how clever oneself is but how stupid other people are while jim was growling over his provender miss tallentire who had finished her breakfast slipped out of the room she felt strange in the company of the frumps and fashionables which formed the houseparty certainly the frumps were eating in private and would not appear till the world was wellaired and they had been madeup sufficiently well to prevent the younger generation being shocked but the fashionable people came to breakfast in public and joan found the talk far above her comprehension these languid creatures who ate so little and talked so much were like inhabitants of a strange planet and it was with great relief that the girl found herself passed over of course nobody thought of noticing cinderella in her rags as lady canvey was being rehabilitated by a skilful maid and would not be seen as the world knew her for at least two hours joan had this time to herself the brightness of the day tempted her to assume hat and jacket for a morning walk and she was shortly tripping over the crisp snow of the avenue the glorious sunshine the keen air the dazzling whiteness of the snow and the generally invigorating influence of this ideal winter morning stirred the current of her blood to nimbleness joan began to sing softly and could hardly keep from dancing so rapidly did her spirits mount skyward at length the place being solitary and she being recklessly young a sudden impulse sent her flying like an arrow between the grim firs near the gates she shot directly into the arms of a man and uttered an ejaculation this was hardly to be wondered at seeing that the arms closed tightly round her and a pair of warm lips deepened the colour which exercise had brought to her cheeks lionel cried joan and darling replied lionel which sufficiently explains the feeling which existed between lady canveys companion and lady canveys pet these two babies as the old lady called them had been engaged for six months but the fact was not generally known the clerical parent of joan had given his consent on the understanding that lionel was to possess a better income and the best vicarage obtainable before he made joan mrs kaimes the young man had agreed readily enough as he did not want to inflict his comparative penury and poor lodgings on the girl he so dearly loved joan and he had decided to wait for two years and during that time lionel was to reform lambeth he was attempting to do this with all the vigour of his energetic nature and between times made love to joan lady canvey knew of the engagement and would have had the couple married at once since she could easily have given lionel a living and wished to do so but the curate was anxious to become the vicar of firmingham the present incumbent was seriously ill and in the event of death the duke had promised that lionel should fill the pulpit therefore the lovers waited very happily and if firmingham did not come to them within the decreed two years they were quite prepared to marry on the bread and cheese of a hard london life meantime joan was seeing a trifle of west end life under lady canveys wing and her earnings as lady canveys companion were most acceptable to the hardworked mr tallentire and his wife thus it was that joan returned lionels kiss and only released herself from his loving arms when she remembered they were within sight of the lodge lionel how can you she said setting her hat straight how cant i you mean he replied smiling do you think i am as cold as the snow i dont know if youre as nice pouted joan or you would have asked me to walk with you this morning no dear he said gravely i could not have taken you to see harold garth the poor fellow is too ill but we can walk now i have nothing to do andjoan where are you going back to the house i wont be taken for a walk on nothingtodo terms you silly child you cruel boy then they kissed and made it up in full view of a redbreast who cocked his head on one side and wondered why these human beings looked so pleased joan said shoo and he flew away to tell his wife while the couple walked sedately through the gates and into a world which their love created for themselves alone all the same their conversation was a trifle prosaic they read a letter which joan had received from her mother about trouble over the christmas gifts to the poor of the parish and discussed this old woman who lived in a chilly garret and that old man who dwelt like a troglodyte in a damp cellar till the conversation became as sober as the looks of the village sexton whom they met and he was a teetotaller but however enthusiastic human nature may be in the talking and doing of good works love after all takes precedence of philanthropy and shortly they began discussing themselves and their happiness what they said does not matter much although foolish it was sweet to them and joans eyes sparkled like the icicles on the bleak hedgerows at the looks her lover gave her they walked in the pleasant land of tenderness and down the bylane of first love joan had never seen the old french chart of that country with its quaint names and odd geography but neither lionel nor herself needed its guidance they had skimmed through the country before and knew the lie of it extremely well the pair soared pretty nearly to the gates of their transcendental heaven until the strain became too great for mere human effort and they folded their wings of thought to drop earthward that unfailing timepiece the human interior announced the hour of luncheon and with some haste they turned homeward i am hungry said lionel ogreishly dont eat me laughed miss tallentire you look as though you could you be red ridinghood and i the wolf suggested lionel no do be serious lionel i want you to tell me about this poor man you saw garth ah hell never see another christmas consumption is wasting him to a shadow in another three or four months lionel broke off with a sigh poor man cant anything be done asked joan sympathetically everything possible is being done joan the duke is looking after garth in every wayyou know how kind he is he even sent demetrius to cure him and if demetrius cant no one else can but if he was taken to a warmer climate the end would only be retarded for a few months interrupted the curate demetrius says there is no hope and i dont think the poor fellow is sorry to go joan he has no relatives and few friends i fancy he has had a lonely life the tears filled joans brown eyes poor fellow she echoed stealing one hand into that of her lovers fancy if we i cant fancy it with you by my side and what is more i dont intend to fancy it said lionel hastily please god you and i have many happy and useful years before us how do you like the firmingham vicarage joan oh its lovely and such a sweet church but i fear its too good to be true perhaps its not what you want joked the curate if i were the duke now ah thats impossible she laughed amused at the idea of being a duchess the very idea frightens me it neednt lionel assured her you will never be called upon to wear strawberry leaves unless the duke and frith and jim all go the way poor garth is taking and then friths wife may have a little lord firmingham i sincerely hope so as it would never do for jim to be the duke of pentland you dont like him not passionately said the curate dryly his wife would make a splendid duchess in looks i have no doubt but with fifty thousand a year and a great position she and jim would do good to neither god nor man lady james kaimes seems very kind observed joan timidly its all seeming of real true selfsacrificing kindness she knows absolutely nothing but she is so beautiful lionel so was jezebel i expect oh lionel oh joan he mimicked dont worry your head over lady jim she will always get on well in this world though i am very doubtful about her position in the next come he pointed down the incline of the lane ill race you to the bottom we might meet some one i dont careim out for a holiday and away flew lionel down the snowy lane with his clerical coattails fluttering in the wind joan girlish and simple and extremely young sped after him and with rosy cheeks arrived at the goal before her lover come said the curate wiping his heated brow considering i won three flat races at the varsity thats not bad joan you humbug as if i didnt see that you let me win ill be a tyrant after marriage said lionel merrily enjoy your little day my love i am enjoying this day said joan as they walked rapidly towards the park gates but what will lady canvey say pooh what does it matter she was young herself a century ago shes a dear old woman no contradicted lionel critically she is old and clever but i should not call her a dear that word suits some one else me cried joan triumphantly how clever of you to guess that hulloa who is this the gates were opened and a sledge issued drawn by two black ponies in it sat lady jim who was driving and dr constantine demetrius what is she up to now lionel asked himself he was intensely distrustful of lady jim but he did not explain this to joan chapter vii the sledge occupied by this wellmatched couple might have been used by pompadour in the days when the finances of france were melting in the furnace of versailles the basketwork body of a swan gilded and painted and elegantly fragile rested delicately on slim steel runners and glided over the frozen snow in the rear of two spirited black ponies these harnessed in the russian fashion with a paucity of trappings and many tiny silver bells sprang forward under lady jims skilful guidance as though they were rioting in a spring meadow she and her companion were snugly wrapped in an opossum rug which leah rather vulgarly despised as a cheap article her mink cloak with the snowy ermine scarf drawn through the shoulder cape in the latest fashion had cost nearly ten times the amount and leah wore it with the proud consciousness that she owed no money for it it was an earlywinter present from lady frith and she had accepted it on the generous ground that its cut and rich brown colour became her better than they would have suited the dowdy insignificant marchioness but the little woman never knew that lady jims goodnature had prevailed to this extent she had thought to give leah pleasure demetrius muffled in muscovite sables sat contentedly by this tauric diana wondering why he had been graciously invited to drive with the goddess after a hurried luncheon the two were ttette for the groom had been dispensed with as out of keeping with the novel vehicle the excuse was artistic nevertheless demetrius suspected other reasons for the absence of an eavesdropping servant what these might be he hoped to hear from lady jim but as yet she showed no disposition to speak frankly for the russian in jims picturesque speech was a gentleman to be handled with the gloves on jim himself had impressed this on leah before he sat down to spell out the woman in white needless to say this unusual effort to improve what jim was pleased to term his mind bored him extremely not a word about racin grumbled jim skipping page after page still as leah pointed out the necessity of poaching on the domain of fiction jim sat at his lesson like a good little boy and his wife drove out with her proposed victim that the irony of fate might change the victim into a possible tyrant did not occur to leah at the moment all the same she was careful not to commit herself too hastily and for two miles talked societyjournal paragraphs with an assiduity at once boring and perplexing to demetrius even when the sledge slipped silent and ghostlike over an arctic waste and they were alone to babble secrets to a frosty sky leah showed no disposition to come to the point she wished demetrius to question her and then by seeing into his mind she could be guided as to the most selfishlysuccessful way of making up her own but the doctor guessed her reason for this diplomatic silence and knowing what a shameless capacity she had for wordtwisting and for slipping out of untenable positions he gave her no opportunity to overlook his hand it was certainly as he reflected a game of skill but what the precise style of game might be demetrius could not guess however one thing was certain this game like all others was being played for money on lady jims part that is demetrius shuffled his cards for the stake of love and so having leah kaimes for an antagonist lost at the outset a game between a man and a woman on amatory grounds is always unequal the one in earnest invariably loses does this remind you of the steppes asked leah waving her whip towards a desert of snow and ice the polite conversation was still much in evidence somewhat madame but i cannot remember sledging across any steppe in such charming company ah you have never driven mademoiselle aksakoff then it is a pleasure yet to come in russia why not she may induce her father to make my peace with the czar you would be pleased demetrius shrugged his spare shoulders and replied in the evasive manner which characterised this conversation on the part of both i am well content with england he remarked calmly many people are pleasant and all agreeable also the duke pays me welltoo well considering he is my solitary patient i never knew a physician to quarrel with his fees before laughed lady jim flicking the ponies lightly and you have another patient i understandmr kaimes said something about it the young priestah yes he was at the gates with that most adorable young lady whom i presume he will marry your anglican priests like our greek popes have that freedom have they not you do not answer my question ah pardon madame said the doctor with an apologetic smile and his hands palm to palm yesit is so i have another patient a peasantone harold garth he pronounced the name uncommonly clearly how well you speak english monsieur demetrius so many foreigners overemphasise their hs and slur their rs we russians have a capacity for tongues i know five languages can you tell the truth in any one of them asked lady jim rather rudely but then she wished to make him lose his temper in the hope of breaking down his reserve but love had not yet blinded demetrius and he became offensively gentle to you madame i always speak the truth i take you at your word said lady jim smartly why did you leave russia monsieur demetrius madame i come of a princely family but for the sake of humanity i practised my profession in moscow a dear friend of mine foolishly joined the anarchists and an order was issued for his arrest fortunately the official who signed the warrant was my patient and i chanced to be with him when the paper was brought for his signature he laid it aside for the moment and i saw my friends name i therefore gave my patient a drug which made him sleep for twentyfour hours so that he could not sign meanwhile my friend escapedit matters not howbut he escaped with my help through a rival doctor my use of the drug to aid my friend became known and i was accused of conspiring also the governor of moscow was enraged and ordered my arrest in my friends place the prospect of siberia was not pleasant so i crossed the frontier after many delightful adventures with the recital of which i shall not trouble you behold me therefore in your free country madame no longer a subject of the czar but your devoted slave he told the story without preamble or excuse in an unemotional and level voice though all the time he wondered why lady jim desired to hear it she gave him no explanation and if you go back to russia she asked carelessly i fear i shall never go back madame who knows mademoiselle aksakoff might precisely madame she might and with small encouragement she would but her gaining of my pardon would assuredly lead to a marriage of gratitude that would be no sacrifice to manyno to myselfmadame it is impossible can you not make your peace without her influence alas no madame the grand duke was furious at my share in my friends escape he would give much to capture me and should i set foot on the continenthe shrugged his shoulders significantly but the third section has no power in your land of liberty the third section if it pleases madame better the secret police no unless i marry mademoiselle aksakoff of whom i admit my unworthiness i must remain in exilebut it has many compensations he added bowing his head courteously to lady jims profile quite so she assented scarcely heeding the compliment then added thoughtfully you are a daring man monsieur demetrius daring when necessary madame but i confess to a love of ease leah swung her ponies round a curve with careless dexterity it is not probable that any one will invite you to leave your lotuseating monsieur thank you for the story it is at your service madame lady jim hesitated you do not ask me why i requested you to relate it she said at last your wish is a command a command is never questioned i might wish you to do something that you might question ah nobelieve me dont jump in the dark said leah with a hard little laugh by the way this woman for whom you ventured so much it was a man madame david and jonathan in crim tartary i suppose they say she gave a conscious laugh that a man would venture farther for a woman than for one of his own sex you i resume are an exception madame one does some things for friendship but all things for love leah glanced at the pale face beside her with a smile and saw that the dark eyes were full of fire you are romantic as is every man when he loves madame i understandmademoiselle aksakoff you penetrate my thoughts admirably lady jim relieved her feelings by using the whip on the obedient ponies demetrius was clever and suspicious also as his story assured her he was daring clearheaded and might be dangerous if she gave this man a hold over her he might be and probably would be unscrupulous enough to use his power moreover lionel had not yet asked the duke and there was always the chance that the money could be obtained without the necessity of plotting leah had taken the doctor for this delightful drive with the intention of speaking plainly but his skilful use of words made her cautious she was too clever a woman to build her tower without reckoning the expense demetrius watched her with keen questioning eyes and a perfectly impassive face but he learned nothing lady jim was quite as oriental as himself in masking her emotions nevertheless he guessed that the interest displayed in his past involved more than the satisfying of an idle curiosity she wanted moneyhe was certain of that but unless she intended to sell him to the third section he could not conceive why she had forced his confidence the enigma irritated him though he paid a silent tribute to the diplomatic powers of this charming englishwoman but cool and cautious as he was her next speech nearly reduced him to the necessity of speaking plainly although he regarded candour as a greater sin than making love to another mans wife now well drive home said leah briskly ah but no madame this is charming and chilly i am not a russian to revel in snow and ice madame the fire in our veins prevents our feeling the disagreeables of nature i am no phlegmatic englishman how interesting said leah indifferently i wonder if the cattle will face this snowstorm they were driving straight into a chaos of eddying flakes and meeting the sting of bitter sleet dashed in their blinking eyes by the wind demetrius bit his lips and suppressed his fiery nature with an effort due to years of training he could have killed this woman with her contemptuous indifference and impregnable selfpossession as the ponies plunged with tossing heads and jingling bells into that arctic hurricane he wished that the sledge would overturn so that he might extort a word of gratitude by saving her life but leahs courage was as high as his own and her strength greater so it was quite probable that she would be able to look after herself all he could do was to unflinchingly face the volleying snow while lady jim dashed through the hostile elements like semiramis in her warchariot with a turn of her wrist she prevented the frightened ponies dashing into a thorny hedge with another turn swung the light vehicle away from a dangerous ditch and then lashed the animals into a headlong gallop which ended only when they trembled with smoking flanks and drooping heads before the firmingham porch and throughout that furious rocking blinding drive demetrius sat grimly silent lady jim was disappointed it would have been more courageous and amusing had he made love to her in the jaws of death quite a russian adventure she said tossing the reins to a groom and jumped out all colour and animation i hope you were not afraid monsieur demetrius she added unjustly for you he replied significantly with a rosy face and a display of white teeth leah faced him on the steps there was no need i assure you i can look after myself in every way i can believe that madame then why talk nonsense to amuse you my good man i dont want amusement but help demetrius started forward impulsively command me lady jim flung her wraps her whip her mink cape and her gloves into his arms thanks she said carelessly and turned towards the library leaving her illegal admirer pale with rage she stopped laughing at the remembrance of his wrath when she saw lionel studying a book near the window well she asked coming lightly towards him any news yes i have seen the duke and heand he her voice died away under stress of emotion he will help you leahs first feeling was one of relief and she was almost on the point of expressing gratitude but a sudden remembrance that aid from the duke meant the retention of jim as a most undesirable husband cooled the warm impulse she recovered her selfcommand and was about to go into figures when mrs penworthy with a noisy party bustled into the room looking rather tousled and flushed we have been playing hunt the slipper she announced in her high thin voice and algy found mine three times lady jim annoyed at the irruption glanced at mrs penworthys feet which could scarcely have worn the slippers of cinderella i can quite believe that she said sweetly and left the room smiling what does she mean asked algy obtusely mrs penworthy knew perfectly well what was meant but was too feminine to explain save in a way calculated to mislead her courtier this could be done by arousing his egotism she means that you are clever to play the game so well was her explanation i rather think lady jim admires you algy the youth fondled what he called a moustache rippin woman lady jim said he taking the speech literally go and tell her so snapped mrs penworthy colouring angrily you wouldnt like it nothing would give me greater pleasure remarked the lady fervently hating him for his stupidity than to see her dancing on you as she does on all men who are foolish enough to make themselves carpets im not a carpet no youre a tame cat then come and play puss in the corner urged algy gaily and mrs penworthy consented as this game had nothing to do with abnormal slippers leah pleased at having snubbed mrs penworthy whom she considered quite an improper person went to look for jim in his room he was there sure enough lying on the sofa with the novel tossed carelessly on the floor and a black pipe between his lips evidently he had not heard the good news jim cried leah breathlessly the duke will part he has parted growled jim swinging his long legs on to the floor and producing a cheque look at that lady jim did it was for two hundred pounds oh she crushed it in her two hands as though she were throttling his grace what an insult chapter viii two hundred pounds lady jim rapidly ran over in her mind such of the most pressing liabilities as she could recollect and shuddered at a total of two thousand they owed that and many other debts which for the moment escaped her memory so far as she could see nothing remained but a compulsory journey through the court not that she really minded bankruptcy plenty of people accepted as immaculate by society made use of that desirable institution to get a receipt for past extravagances on the plea of having lived beyond their incomes she and jim could make the same excuse with perfect truth and would doubtless be enabled to make a fresh start and if a few tradesmen were ruined what did it matter they always overcharged and it might be a lesson to them not to worry customers no the bankruptcy court matters very little but the want of ready cash mattered a great deal leah cared nothing about paying the bills but ardently desired to have a refilled purse and no bother about such vulgar things as pounds shillings and pence it was perfectly idiotic of the duke to be so stingy if he had come down with a thousand she and jim could have enjoyed themselves abroad for a couple of months and meanwhile he could have paid these troublesome tradesmen but two hundred pounds did the old fool take them for the respectable middleclass couple living in slateroofed houses to which she had alluded without jims assistance she could get rid of that trifle in a fortnight i believe your fathers brain is softening she complained crossly im not responsible for his crazy arithmetic retorted jim with the helpful addition of a few adjectives but beyond swearing as much as he dared in her presence jim could offer no assistance and leah concluded that after all it might be necessary to trust demetrius her husband having gained some faint idea of the novel had ended in declining to turn fiction into fact his remarks were not without shrewdness the chap who writes the story knows whats goin to happen said jim when pressed for his opinion an can invent circumstances to dodge results but if we start a yarn of this kind on our own we dont know what the end ull be oh yes protested leah very patiently considering she disagreed entirely youll disappear and i shall become a widow with my share of the twenty thousand an how long will your share last asked jim derisively that depends upon my mood some time i expect seeing that your death will force me into retirement and crape is not so very expensive and when you get through your lot jim what will you do thats what im askin you said jim evasively and continued hurriedly lest she should insist upon a disagreeable explanation sides theres my father to be considered since when have you taken him to your heart oh its all very well talkin but your fathers your father when alls said an done the duke doesnt think me a saint but hed be sorry to see me die no one wants you to die she said impatiently thats bunkum ananwhats the word might i suggest sophistry said lady jim quite aware that her reasoning was fallacious oh youll suggest anythin to get your own way but what i mean is that though i do die i dont really die how clearly you put things jim please yourself we must go back to town with this money to be whitewashed and eyeing the cheque contemptuously she saw that it was unfortunately made payable to jim her husband stretched for the cheque and slipped it into his waistcoat pocket im goin to see the duke mself he announced an tell him everythin what about the money weve raised on the income every blessed thing said kaimes doggedly hes my father an its his duty to square things he mightnt follow your reasoning murmured leah with one hand on the mantelpiece and the other holding up her skirts to warm one foot but you cant make a much worse mess of it than lionel has made two hundred poundshe must have thought he was asking money for some old woman shall i come with you jim no he halted at the door to deliver himself of the remark youre like a red rag to a bull oh very well i only thought youd like me to translate your talk into something resembling english dont you fret yourself ill make him understand an if i do get things squared cried jim warming at the thought of his heroism in facing an angry parent youll have to drop spending money an live as other women do yes dear james and youll live as other men do wont you ill do what i jolly well please an why james there never was a st jim that i ever heard of mused leah turning pensive eyes on her exasperated husband and as you wish to canonise yourself of course you must change your name yes jamesshe moved swiftly towards him and detained him gently by the lapels of his coatfrom this time forth well live in holy matrimony and pig it on whats left of the income curzon street given up bayswater remains and there james darling well live a life of extremely plain living and high thinking dont talk bosh growled jim trying to escape but she held on no james i wont if you will only raise my intellect to the level of your own and think what a delightful existence it will be james a cheap bayswater dungeon with three servants and the shopping done at whiteleys ill turn my dresses and trim my hats and youll give up your clubs to curse in a stuffy drawingroom while you play bezique with your dear wife till we go to bed at ten no more betting on podaskas james no more whistdrives or bridge or any such expensive naughtinesses and how nice it will be for you james to flirt with those earnestlyfashionable suburban girls who are just half an hour behind the times and who here jim rent his garments from leahs grasp and departed in haste with an impolite word his wifes humour did not appeal to him in the least and he banged the door unnecessarily hard leah returned to warm her toes and laugh till she cried there was something excessively amusing in the idea of jim setting up for a plaster saint for once in his dull life he displayed a sense of humour and she picked up the discarded novel with a fresh burst of laughter at the picture of the bayswater mnage as drawn by her fertile fancy jim as a middleclass philistine tickled her even more than jim in a stainedglass attitude with an artificial halo misfitting his empty head but a remembrance of the chequepayable to jimand of her husbands possible position at the moment telling clumsy truths to an aggrieved father made her serious certainly the duke pleased to hear his son speak honestly for once in a life of consistent fibbing might shed tears over a hastilyproduced chequebook jims falsehoods in times of pressing need were almost inspired and it was not impossible that he might return with the loot then the tradespeople being paid leah decided that she could run up fresh bills to any amount they would be all the more eager to give her unlimited credit when they knew that the duke was in the background decidedly the prospect was not so bad and after all it might be dangerous to make reallife experiments in sensational fiction these commonsense reflections led lady jim to thank the watchful fetish for governing her tongue during the afternoon demetrius could be nasty when he liked she was certain of that and it was just as well to give him no chance some people carried tyranny to a ridiculous excess and liked to hear their victims squeal unmeaningly leah did not belong to the squealing species and vowed a vow that demetrius should never have an opportunity of provoking such futile outcries as a gleam of good sense warned her of possible danger she decided to avoid the russian or only to flirt sufficiently to make him miserable and jim cross having settled the question in this sensible way leah sought her room to dress for the five oclock muffinscramble she assumed the prettiest teagown she possessed for the truly feminine purpose of irritating demetrius into overestimating what he had lost descending like a homeric deity in a cloudof laceshe went at once to the library and restored to its place the textbook of her proposed fraud fortunately the room was empty so no one would ever know that the novel had been read with a view to plagiarism not that it mattered much now since jim was proceeding on the lines of honesty is the best policy leah hoped fervently that he would succeed but felt more than a trifle doubtful jim was so new to this straightforward method of gaining his ends the houseparty was picnicking in the wintergarden a delightful eden where tropical plants flourished in defiance of the season on its glass roof the hail rattled like small shot and through its glass walls could be seen the bleak wintry landscape faintly white in the deepening gloom these glimpses of the unpleasant increased the sense of comfort and overcivilised humanity luxuriated in the warm atmosphere as independent of natures laws as the palmtrees under which it ate and drank and talked scandal the frumps nibbled dry toast and sipped milk the fashionables devoured dainty sandwiches and enjoyed the strongest of tea and both aided digestion with chatter and laughter it was the complacent contentment of animals mumbling a plentiful meal and for the moment all spiritual instincts were governed by material needs mrs penworthys courtiers were feeding their queen who had a large appetite for so small a woman after a full meal she was disposed to be amiable even to freddy had he been there but she became decidedly cross when some of the court deserted her for that woman as she termed lady jim leah was feminine enough to enjoy the fallen expression on mrs penworthys face and accepted with marked pleasure the attentions of those who crowded round her the sight gave mrs penworthy a fit of indigestion which prevented her enjoying a late dinner it was hard that her vanity had to content itself with the banal compliments of the faithful algy who tried to be a host in himself and was snubbed for his ambition may i present my nephew to you asked lord sargon in his thin precise voice leah intimated that she would be charmed and found herself nodding to a slim dark young man cleanshaven and alert he looked more alive than the languid youths around her and she was not surprised when sargon explained that mr askew was a naval officer who had lately returned from a five years cruise i thought you hadnt been wrapped up in cotton wool all your life said lady jim when sargon had removed the attendant youths and the lieutenant was making himself agreeable in a bluff briny way do i look so uncivilised he asked with laughing eyes highly you are the nearest approach to prehistoric man i have yet seen said she and thus was unjust to jim i am sorry oh theres no need to apologise i daresay circe found ulysses very agreeable homer says so answered askew who appeared to be well read but if i am ulysses you must be circe i accept the compliment is it a compliment asked the prehistoric man daringly unless meant for one it should not have been said beg pardon im several kinds of ass but i did mean it civilly you know circe was a clever woman whose magic turned men into outward semblances of their real characters lady jim smiled scornfully and if my magic could transform these she glanced disparagingly round the place what a menagerie it would be pigs and snakes and parrots and dogs of the mongrel kind mr askew do you speak of yourself he nodded laughingly dogs are so devoted that means you wish to attach yourself to me said leah gravely i might take you at your wordi need a friend but ulysses deserted circe askew laughed and gazed admiringly at her beautiful pensive face we talk parables i think he said with assumed lightness prehistoric man always did i understand on the contrary his speech was direct and blunt mine will be now smiled lady jim this cup has been empty for five minutes and you never offered to the young man took the tiny cup hastily but for the publicity of the place i would ask you to tread upon my prostrate body leah eyed his lithe active figure as he went to the bamboo table presided over by lady frith he was really a delightful sailorman she reflected and quicker than most of his sex to understand the unspoken it might be more amusing to drop demetrius and flirt with him but then his face was too honest and he might object to being made use of men of that kind are so dreadfully in earnest sighed leah with a sense of irritation they think a woman always means what she says askew walked lightly over the mosaic floor with a fresh cup of tea and a plate of hot cakes some man bustled in his way and he stopped to avoid an upset of his burden at the moment he glanced towards the moorish door which admitted triflers into the winter paradise to lady jims wonderment he started and a look of surprise overspread his expressive face her eyes turned at once in the direction of the entrance and she beheld jim blinking his eyes at the dazzle of light he looked heavy and sullen which hinted that the interview with the duke had not been successful but leah forgot that momentous question for the moment as her quick brain was trying to understand askews look of surprise before she could ask herself what he could possibly know about jim he approached with the tea this is nice and hot he said placing the plate on the table at her elbow and offering the cup i hope youll forgive me for neglecting you on one condition replied leah stirring her tea consider it fulfilled was the impetuous answer why did you look surprised when you saw that gentleman at the door leah pointedly suppressed the fact that kaimes was her husband as if there was anything she would learn it the more easily by pretending that jim was a stranger in fact should askew learn that the man who had startled him was her lawful lord he might decline to open his lips the lieutenants next words proved the wisdom of her concealment oh berring he said carelessly well i was surprised to see berring so unexpectedly is his name berring asked lady jim guessing that she was about to learn something connected with jims very shady past yes i met him in lima lima in peru and thats in south america leah nodded i did learn geography at school she said setting down her empty cup and when askew coloured at the implied snub softened it by asking a friendly question you are surprised at meeting mrererberring here yes i said so before a nice sort of chap but selfish what a reader of character you are mr askew he looked up eagerly you know him then a little why do you ask the young man stared at the ground and replied in muffled tones i thought you might have met his wife mrs berring of course leah began to laugh the idea that jim might be a bigamist had never struck her before she had guessed that there was a woman connected with those frequent journeys to lima but that jim had adopted the mormon religion was news some women would have been angry but leah had no amatory feelings likely to arouse jealousy so she was frankly amused at her husbands duplicity also she was sorry for mrs berring who perhaps was silly enough to love jim is she a nice woman was her next question shes an angel that means you love her how do you because you are a brick wall i can see through mr askew no i have never met mrs berring why did she throw you over and marry mrerberring askew looked quite alarmed i say you are clever he remarked why not you called me circe and i must live up to the name well well echoed askew blankly and their eyes met he coloured no i cant tell you he said quickly for he guessed her desire yes you can and you will rejoined leah composedly jim was bearing the artillery of mrs penworthys eyes in his usual indifferent way and showed no disposition to seek out his wife probably he would remain for the next hour in the clutches of the little woman who was the limpet to jims rock this being so leah began to ask questions which askew hesitated to answer we hardly know one another he murmured embarrassed i darent tell you lady james ah then theres something improper in the matter askew flushed through his bronzed skin not at all he said in a brusque tone seorita fajardo is all that is good and holy and pure what bread and butter thought leah wondering if jim had stumbled upon a convent but she was too wise to quote byron to this young man who apparently was simple enough to regard love as something sacred fajardo she repeated a spanish name and a spanish lady he said gloomily lola fajardo of the estancia san jago near rosario i thought you said of lima no i met her there she is in the habit of stopping at lima with her aunt but her true home is at rosario in the santa fe province of the argentine republic i wonder if berring brought her to england she was madly in love with him she must have been to marry him oh berrings a goodlooking chap and not bad said askew with the innate chivalry of a man towards a successful rival i suppose they did marry oh then you are not certain no i never even knew if they were engaged but when i joined my ship again at callao every one said marriagethey were so uncommonly thick i must ask berring im sure hell be delighted to afford you the information you seek was lady jims ironical reply have you seen mrs berring asked the young man eagerly no i dont think any mrs berring is stopping here then perhaps he did not marry lola after all cried askew rising hastily and with flashing eyes unlesshis voice fellshe is dead leah yawned really i dont know she replied you had better ask mr berring i see he is passing out of the garden with mrs penworthy in that case i cant spoil sport laughed the lieutenant with an obvious effort but later on later on of course she said rising here comes your uncle lord sargon advanced and with an apologetic look towards leah took askews arm i wish to present you to lady canvey he said the young man looked towards his charmer will you permit me to leave you for a time certainly you will find lady canvey delightful and as prehistoric as you can wish we may meet after dinner and with a nod she left the winter garden for the purpose of seeking solitude she wanted to think over jims iniquities and to consider what use might be made of them for her own benefit lady canvey was delighted to receive askew as she liked handsome young men especially when they were deferential and attentive as this new acquaintance appeared to be though im a bad substitute for lady jim she remarked pleasantly lady jim that charming creature with whom you have been talking yes of course lady canvey she is indeed charming but private property her husband is the dukes second son at present in the clutches of that little harpy mrs penworthy dont you make love to lady jim or youll burn your fingers i mistrust redhaired women myself but she and jim match each other capitally their marriage was made in heaven and lady canvey chuckled is her husband here asked askew looking round anxious to see who owned circeofthemanywiles no he went out with mrs penworthy a quarter of an hour ago askew remembered how lady jim had drawn his attention to an outgoing couple didnt the lady go out with a mr berring he gasped no with lord jim kaimes and shehis wifethe lady i askew stopped with a groan try an unmarried woman advised lady canvey misunderstanding his emotion its more proper and less expensive chapter ix keeping up the necessary darbyandjoan comedy kaimes strolled into his wifes dressingroom half an hour before dinner to inquire if she was ready leah had a secondhand view of him in a fulllength mirror before which she posed while her maid added a few final touches to an eminently successful frock from the composed expression of his face she guessed that he had not yet renewed his acquaintance with mr askew and therefore must be ignorant that the freespoken sailor had let the cat out of the bag lady jim possessed the animal now but she did not intend to reveal her capture until jim explained how he had sped with the duke a slight nod towards the glass showed her husband that she was aware of his presence and the maid continued to use experienced fingers but leah looked so charming that further trouble in this way was like adding sugar to honey jim stared approvingly and when the maid was dismissed saw his way to a compliment you have the good points of several women rolled into one leah he said with the look of a sultan appraising an odalisque that polite speech means much coming from a man of your experience my dear jim what good point of mrs penworthys have i annexed youre jealous horribly you are so deeply attached to that bundle of faded chiffon i dont care two straws for her appearances are misleading then but added leah remembering askews eulogy it may be that you prefer something thats good and holy and pure i dont know why you should say that grumbled jim annoyed at being credited with such primitive tastes you may know before long and she laughed at the thought of the marine bombshell which would shortly shatter jims complacency i dont know what youre talkin about said kaimes with unaffected surprise an im confoundedly hungry ah did the dukes lecture give you an appetite leah jim became so serious as to look almost intelligent my father is the best man who ever wore shoeleather he is usually condemned to cloth boots for gouty feet murmured leah patting the back of her head so youve pulled the wool over his eyes again i wish you wouldnt use slang protested jim virtuously i cant pretend to vie with mrs penworthys purity of speech my dear man how much have you got out of the duke well he hasnt given me money oh but hes promised ah i wish youd let me speak cried kaimes testily my father has promised to pay all the debts good heavens is he aware of the amount wait ive not finished hell pay the debts and reduce our income to a thousand a year till he recoups himself really i thought you had seen your father and not a moneylender have you accepted this most generous offer yes i have said jim sulkily and kicking a mat out of the way i see its to be bayswater after all james if you talk like that ill go down to dinner without you by all means youve taken away my appetite she laughed in a way calculated to still further infuriate jim who paced the room in a towering passion nevertheless she was seriously angry had the duke refused all help it would have been more decent but this bargain which was all on one side annoyed her beyond measure what did the duke mean by taking their money it seems to me weve got to pay our own debts then she said while jim seethed like a whirlpool an why shouldnt we its only fair leah stared and began to think that jim was too good for this world i hope you are not going to die she said anxiously not in your way cried kaimes misunderstanding her we arent going to have any buryin alive or substituted corpses an im goin to hang on as a respectable member of society ill come and hear you preach jim im preachin now raged her husband an dont you make any mistake leah ive told the duke everythin how injudicious he might have had a fit he didnt even blame me said jim breaking down an there were tears in his eyes leah laughed amazingly long and loud considering the tightness of her corset i wish i had been present did you cry too jim i jolly well nearly did said kaimes truthfully if ungrammatically though its no good explainin to an icicle like you but the paters goin to pay the debts free our income an let the curzon street house better and better then we do go to bayswater hell allow us one thousand a year till the debts are wiped off went on kaimes hurriedly and wishing to get the explanation over an we can go abroad for a couple of years you can i shant as my wife you must as an individual i shant retorted lady jim calmly she was getting over her rage now as she foresaw a very different interview between herself and jim before they retired for the night it is very good of you to have settled all this without consulting me and now that you have done so let us go to dinner but i theres the gong observed leah opening the door and i dont like cold soup youll have to like lots of things now you didnt like before said jim as they went down the selection doesnt include you my good man so dont be disappointed jim could have shaken her and began to understand why the lower orders indulged in wifebeating but as they were entering the drawingroom at this moment he had to play the part of a devoted husband leah floated radiantly into the brilliantly lighted apartment and jim sought out the oldest and ugliest woman he could find when he thought of his wife beauty sickened him for the time being thus it came about that miss jaffray had the pleasure of shouting into his ear throughout a long and wearisome dinner whether it was the work of the fetish or of lady frith leah did not know but she found herself seated at the table with askew on her right hand the young man looked flustered and ill at ease im so sorry he began apologetically and as she thought tactlessly that youre my neighbour she interrupted sweetly how unkind no but i never knew he was your husband who mr berring dont make it harder for me he entreated softly ive been calling myself names ever since we parted you should have left that to me mr askew theres nothing in it you know he stuttered heedlessly of course she never married him i hope not for the sake of morality said lady jim lightly and thinking that the soup was worse than usual however it doesnt matter my husband is a modest man and sometimes drops his title when travelling i daresay as mr berring he thought he was free to make love but he wasnt protested askew with a glance towards the unconscious jim who apparently had not recognised him you should tell him so i intend toin the smoking room lady jim looked at him imperiously and softened her voice to a very direct whisper dont make trouble she said in a somewhat domineering tone that will do no good and much harm and after all married or unmarried every man has a right to admire a pretty woman but not to make love to her muttered the young man with another vengeful glance i am no casuist replied leah calmly and you should be pleased that things are as they are you can now return to lima or rosario and marry the lady she wouldnt have me is she so much in love with mr berring then please dont lady james i cant talk like this to you she gave a light laugh it seems to me that you are talking therefore i repeat my question it might only have been gratitude he murmured for what berringi mean your husbandsaved her from being trampled upon by a mustang how picturesque and how suited to jims qualifications and she no she didnt interrupted askew hurriedly i see i have been mistaken it was gratitude not love of course said lady jim jeeringly a woman always prefers to exercise the former rather than the latter i wish id stopped and tried my luck muttered the sailor not clever enough to interpret this speech its not too late mr berring is safely secured by love and the law to my apronstrings so you can go back and no ive just come in for a property of sorts and the service has seen the last of me is seorita fajardo in the same predicament as the service theres a cousin lady james a female cousin who goes with the property as a fixture i quite understand you have to marry her out of gratitude for the money and without the discomforting passion of love the spanish ladys history repeats itself i see askew was rather discomfited how quick you are you cant have had much to do with women she murmured but i hope you will make no trouble in the smokingroom no as things are its none of my funeral he observed grumpily quite so i am the chief mourner but i say lady james said the lieutenant anxiously i hope what ive inadvertently told you wont of course not she assured him mendaciously my husband is most trustworthy as you can see by his choice of that ugly old maid as a dinner companion you were mistaken i think i must have been said askew with great relief of course people talk at lima as elsewhere he ended apologetically unless south america is inhabited by the deaf and dumb i suppose they do youre laughing at me lady james i always laugh its good for the digestion at everything at everything even at love he asked timidly she shot an amused glance at his colouring face remember you are engaged to the fixture mr askew but i say cant i come and see you in town i shall be delighted if you can find your way to curzon street you live there he asked obtusely in a most respectable manner with my husband mr berring im known as lady jim of curzon street most improper isnt it when berring i say dont expostulated the young man quickly ill never forgive myself for being such a fool can i call you lady jim he was getting on very fast and leah in the interests of virtue deemed it necessary to snub him certainly not only people who have known me fifty years address me so familiarly you must believe in reincarnation then he retorted this was clever and pleased her i was circe in the days of homer mr askew but as to my name now there is another lady jima horrid woman who carries tracts and meddles with morals and dresses in a piously shabby fashion so that we may not be mixed up i am known by the name of the street i live in to you i am lady james kaimes and circe the sorceress he murmured leah laughed well see what sort of animal my magic will turn you into she observed with an encouraging smile this was a distinct promise or at least he construed it as such for his eyes brightened and he glanced at her in a way which assured her that she was looking her best he was certainly a delightful boy she reflected if somewhat fickle but a man who was catholic enough to marry the fixture and adore the spanish lady and make sudden love to herself must be worth feminine appreciation and study besides he was goodlooking and had money conjoined with a frank and unsuspicious nature assuredly he might be useful if not inclined to explore the land of tenderness too assiduously but in that case he might compromise her in an earnest pigheaded way which would be at once boring ridiculous and dangerous leah approved of playing with fire but she was too careful to risk a personal conflagration though allured by the prospect of tormenting an honest heart she had not made up her mind to enjoy the opportunity by the time she left the diningroom but a distinctly tigerish glance sent to her address by demetrius almost inclined her to give young askew the chance of making a fool of himself the russian had apparently noticed the embryo flirtation all the better thought leah sailing into the adamless eden of the winter garden it will be an additional card to playwhich showed that lady jim was by no means satisfied with the arrangement come to between her husband and his father a cigarette dear lady jim simpered mrs penworthy no thanks i leave smoking to women who bait their hooks with agreeable vices and she moved towards lady canvey it was horribly rude and mrs penworthy choked back an hysterical scream delightful woman lady james said miss jaffray delightful assented the other who at the moment would gladly have mounted the scaffold on a charge of murdering her insolent rival i call her perfectly lovely such a perfect complexion and exquisite figure and heavenly eyes and large hands but this piece of spite was wasted as by this time lady jim was seated by her godmother assuring that sceptical lady how absolutely delighted she was to learn that dear jim had arranged matters with the dear duke and so sweet of the duke to tell you she went on i know how anxious you have been about me can you wonder at it my dear when you are so sweet and gentle and womanly said lady canvey who was quite equal to a war of words you must be thinking of hilda frith replied lady jim calmly i cannot call myself such an angel no you left that to the sailorboy you were flirting with poor boy he doesnt know how to flirt youll teach him my dear chuckled the old lady not without fees humph his education will cost him a pretty penny possibly but i might teach him for love after the fashion of miss tallentire and lionel rubbish joan doesnt know how to flirt or to dress either i must ask her how the whiteley sales are getting on leah said lady canvey with a pained look why have you such a bitter tongue i must defend myself somehow you wouldnt have me scratch and bite would you i would have you be more womanly and lovable my dear on a thousand a year and such a husband as i have every man is what his wife makes him they generally go to other mens wives to be manufactured besides so far as jim is concerned you cant make a silk purse out of a certain animals ear my dear i am an old woman and perhaps rather sharptongued at times but i have a motherly feeling for you cant you give up this wild life and go abroad to devote yourself to jim he has his good points my dear and if you would try and live more amicably with him i am sure you would be a happy woman then in a year or so you could come back to curzon street with all the debts paid and your full income to live on believe meshe laid a withered hand on leahs beautiful armi speak for the best my dear girl leah smiled disdainfully now that the sermons over can i pass round the plate she said cruelly not for me to put money in said lady canvey with a flush i shant give you a penny it is useless talking to you leah your one idea is money and enjoyment and love of admiration it seems to me that those are three ideas replied lady jim rising but as our conversation is neither enjoyable nor instructive i shall go away all the same she lingered and talked in a low tone with unexpected emotion you blame me lady canvey for being what i am pray what chance have i had of being otherwise i lost my mother when i was a child i was brought up by a neglectful and selfish father i am married to a husband who has nothing of the man about him save those handsome looks which lured me into a muchregretted marriage all my life i have lived with worldly and material people and your counsel has been as worldly as that of any one of them i have never been shown the difference between right and wrong and there isnt a single soul in the world who has a spark of love for me if my upbringing and surroundings had been better i might be a good womanso far as i can be i am a good woman i have my moments of regreti have my moments when i wish i could be a religious dowdy saint but who will help me out of the mirewho will here she broke off for her emotion was becoming too strong for the publicity of the place with a violent effort which showed the strength and courage of her nature she calmed down and the colour faded from her face as did the frown which gave place to a cynical smile annoyed with herself for having given lady canvey a glimpse of her better nature she walked away leaving the old woman surprised and startled and in her own selfish way truly sorry there was much truth in what leah had said but her mask was on again the moment she crossed to the door and demetrius who was obviously looking for her saw only the beautiful calm woman he knew so well his face was as agitated as leahs had been a few minutes previously madame i must see you privately what an extraordinary request monsieur ah but you will understand he threw out his hands expressively no i am ignorant of the deaf and dumb language cruelcruel sillysilly she mocked then glanced round with upraised eyebrows dont make a scene monsieur or i shall begin to believe that you appreciate our english custom of lingering over the wine will you let me explain entreated the russian certainlytomorrow at four ill be in the picture gallery good night and with a friendly nod she moved away demetrius swore softly in russian which is a most picturesque language in many ways without a glance lady jim ascended the stairs well pleased demetrius was losing command of himself and therefore would be all the easier to manage should she require his services ill have that twenty thousand before spring she decided chapter x what is love asked leah the next day at twenty minutes past four of a clear wintry afternoon with all his knowledge of five languages demetrius could find no answer and rose from his knees with the feelings of a man who is trying to melt an iceberg with a lucifer match ever since lady jim arrived to keep her appointment in the picture gallery he had been explaining his feelings at length and in the orthodox attitude of a mortal worshipping a goddess he had crossed his ts and dotted his is with the utmost precision from english he had glided into french to plead the attractions of illicit passion two minutes of german resulted in sentimental assertions of that passions righteousness and in illustrations of wertherism and immediately before she asked that impossible question he had harked back to her native tongue to impress upon her the solid british commonsense of his wooing leah listened to this polyglot lovemaking with the feeling that she was camping under the tower of babel demetrius might have been a gramophone pouring out recitations from the poets for all the impression his impassionate rhetoric made on her welltrained feelings i suppose all these speeches can be classified under the heading of love she said unkindly when his exhaustion gave her an opportunity of intervening butwhat is love i have been trying to explain stammered the russian getting on his legs dispiritedly oh your intentions are of the best i gather that much but i am still waiting for a definition love is worship ventured demetrius rashly then why arent you on your knees i have been on my knees for fifteen minutes really when did you look at your watch my heart told me then your heart is a timekeeper or perhaps a timeserver if you will permit me to serve you my service will be for all time ah it seems we are immortal then you are he declared passionately every goddess is immortal lady jim laughed this war of words was amusing and pretty but she wished to arrive at some conclusion which would repay her for spending an hour in a cold gallery packed with shockingly bad pictures i am waiting for your definition of love she said at length i cannot explain the impossible it seems to me that you have been trying to do so would you like to hear how i define love his eyes burned like two menacing stars yes he muttered in a husky voice and holding his passions in leash love is sacrifice said leah slowly then ilove you he burst out there is no sacrifice i would not make for your dear sake can i believe that try me and he again dropped on his knees get up said lady jim brusquely he did so take a seat he did so look at the floor and not at me he did so now then she continued feeling relieved that those fierce eyes were not making her flesh creep do you know what you are monsieur demetrius a fool he murmured bitterly his gaze on the parquetry i quite agree with you she rejoined promptly and why because i love you not at all because you dont love katinka aksakoff what has that to do with this he said gloomily everything she is free and i am not she loves you and i dont she will do you good i shall do you harm she can gain your pardon and make your fortune and you can make me happy cried demetrius looking up with the air of one who has found a clinching argument with the crumbs from my husbands table you dont love him the britishmatron portion of leah revolted against this plain speaking she liked sugarcoated speeches you have no right to say that i have no right to make love to you cried the doctor rising but i do pschutthe snapped his fingerswhat care i for that english pig your husband as to that young fool who sat beside you last night lady jim clapped her hands and jumped up laughing oh she cried with great enjoyment so it was mr askews attentions that made you lose your head but not my heart i lost that months ago when i first met you ah you cruel woman have i not worshipped and adored you these many days do i not ache here he struck his breast passionately have you not made my life miserable with your looks and smiles and coldness and beauty he seized her hands roughly i love you so much that ieven i constantine demetriuscould kill youkill you she released herself with a cold laugh that sounds as though you were in earnest but if i could return your love ah he made a step towards her trembling and breathing hard one moment she waved him back and retreated herself to the window supposing i could love youwhat then i wouldi would he flung out his hands with a sob what is your price he cried savagely how crudely you put things said lady jim coolly my price is your services to be given blindly and without question and my reward marriage with me demetrius stared and gazed at her with unaffected amazement you mock me he said faintly no i am in earnest it is true that i am not free now but she looked at him steadily you can make me so murder whispered demetrius looking up and down the long empty chill gallery and not at the eve who was tempting him leah blazed out into genuine rage what do you mean she cried stamping her foot not a hair of jims head shall be harmed then howhow sit down and listen she said pointing to a chair i have a deeper feeling for you than you think no leave my hand alone we are now talking business business echoed demetrius blankly lady jim nodded composedly the pleasure can come later you have no money no title no position i can make money he explained rapidly and i can take up again my title of prince which i dropped when i became a doctor as the wife of a russian noble you will have to make your peace with the czar to get these things i will do so through mademoiselle askakoff no there are other ways i am not worthy of katinka and therefore think yourself worthy of me said lady jim calmly thank you theres nothing like being honest but you do not understand oh yes i do i understand that you can make me a cheap sort of princess and in some way can give me money all that you requireas my wife you must have the lamp of aladdin then said leah with a shrug my capacity for spending will try even your finances but at the present moment i have not a penny neither has my husband well asked the doctor anxiously now that the plunge was made she found less difficulty in speaking plainly leaning towards him till the perfume of her hair and the close neighbourhood of her whole gracious person nearly maddened him into seizing her in his arms she proceeded rapidly my husbands life is insured for twenty thousand pounds if you as a doctor can arrange to satisfy the insurance company of his death so that we can get the money he will disappear and i in the eyes of the world shall be free to marry you do you mean that i should give him a drug and no i meanharold garth my peasant patient well how stupid you are said lady jim with unfeigned irritation this man garth is very like jim and is apparently dying he cant live another two months then the matter is easily managed cant you see yes replied demetrius whose quick brain seized the feasibility of the scheme at once but will your husband give you up leah nodded not wishing to be too explicit we have arranged that and does he know that his disappearance means our marriage no he thinks you are poor and will do anything for money ah said demetrius sarcastically then the highborn nobleman does not credit me with being a gentleman what does it matter what he thinks said lady jim impatiently we neednt trouble about him after he disappears can it be managed yes if you will promise to marry me when you are free and in possession of this money she gave him both hands i do promise he bent down and kissed them passionately consider it done without any scandal assuredly listen the duke wishes to save the life of this garth becausehe is fond of him yes yes i understand go on i say to the duke that a warm climate will work wonders continued demetrius dramatically he will gladly consent and with this garth i go to to nice or cannes or no said the doctor sharply if i set foot on the continent i may be captured by the secret police i have no wish to take garth with me to siberia he added sarcastically it is not a warm climate the azoresmadeirajamaicabarbadosany such place will make him better i dont want him to be made better said the other conspirator navely leave that to me madame garth will die as garth and be buried as milor your husband no no said leah with a shudder i wont have murder you are scrupulous rejoined demetrius with a shrug but make your mind easy garth cannot livehe may die on the voyage or he may live for months demetrius shrugged his shoulders again in that case i may have to assist nature no said leah again and very determinedly i could never spend the money with any pleasure if i thought that youyou assisted nature she ended faintly not liking to use a strong word the russian looked at her with silent surprise he could not understand why she should be scrupulous in one thing and not in another she contemplated a fraud on the insurance company and bigamistic marriage with him so it was impossible to guess why she should object to the inclusion of a third crime and it would scarcely be murder said demetrius continuing his train of thought aloud he is so ill this poor garth that the relief of death dont interrupted leah who both looked and felt pale i wont have it let the poor man die in peace if he dies otherwise i shall refuse to marry you you may do that in any case said the doctor grimly what hold have i over you there is no need for you to have any hold said lady jim wincing and feeling that she had indeed delivered herself into the power of the enemy but if you think i will not keep my promise you are mistaken i swear to marry you ah well said demetrius with a penetrating look if you do not marry me you cannot marry another since your husband will always be alive he spoke with slow significance oh you make him out to be immortal also said she with an uneasy laugh then felt the necessity of bringing this interview to a conclusion we must part now it will not do for us to be seen talking together i agree said demetrius gravely your proposal alters our relations entirely in society i will speak to you little lady jim nodded and put her handkerchief to her lips with a feeling of nausea now that her scheme was taking shape its outlines appeared rather repulsive to read of such a plot conceived and detailed by a dexterous author was amusing and stimulating to engage in its execution meant worry and a fearful ignorance as to what might happen should things go awry the same difference might be supposed to exist between aldershot manoeuvres and a real battle theorising in criminality was easy practice would be both difficult and dangerous moreover she might have to pay a very large price for the privilege of engaging in this questionable transaction demetrius would certainly exact his bond in genuine shylock fashion needless to say she had no intention of marrying him and trusted to the providence of the peacock fetish to avoid the necessity though at the moment she saw no means whereby she could escape fulfilling her promise this reflection almost made her draw back as yet she was not under the doctors thumb and could extricate herself even at this eleventh hour by denying everything should he dare to speak out but a second thought of her desperate need of money a sordid vision of cheap hotels and readymade frocks a shuddering remembrance that the future as it now stood meant limited pocketmoney and the everlasting boredom of jims society turned the scale in favour of the venture be bold be bold said the warning of the door in the old fairy tale and leah thought the advice worth taking but she forgot the concluding words be not too bold i leave details to you she said to her companion when they had concluded their nefarious bargain madame i relieve you of all responsibility said demetrius now quite his grave restrained self but should i tell the duke that your husband is suffering from consumption you will endorse my statement i trust consumption jim oh lord hes as healthy as a pig he will not be if he takes a certain medicine said the man dryly leah had a conscience though for years it had been persistently snubbed into holding its peace after all jim was her husband and she had no right to sanction tricks being played on his robust health you dont mean her voice died away nervously i mean business demetrius flashed out i love you and i mean to win you the price that you ask shall be paid without harm to jim or this man garth i swear it in that caseleah extended her hand to withdraw it suddenly before the russian could rain kisses on its soft whiteness a choking sensation new to one of her superb health made her gasp frantically after the breath which seemed to be leaving her with unexpected force came a new sensation this abominable playing with the lives and hearts of men stirred up to vehement protest a hitherto unknown better self which overwhelmed her with wave upon wave of reproachful shame conscience uppermost for once in her greedy selfish animal life stripped the contemplated sin of its allurements and she recoiled before an inward vision of the horror her baser nature was creating it might prove to her what the monster proved to frankenstein and haunt her with nightmare insistence for the remainder of an unbearable life so weak madame asked demetrius reading the secret handwriting on the wall like a very daniel the sneer nerved her and she strove desperately to escape from the light of heaven into the material darkness that would not reveal her sin unclothed and shameless no she cried in a loud ringing voice ii again the celestial light mercilessly and mercifully disclosed the inward foulness of that fairseeming sin and the sight beat down her pride and courage into nothingness i take it all back she stuttered brokenup and panicstruck forgetdont move inin something clicked in her throat and only by a violent effort did she repress the climbing hysteria incapable of speech and only anxious to escape from this extraordinary influence which compelled her to face the powers of darkness in their naked horror she passed swiftly down the long echoing gallery not till she was safe in her own room did she halt to consider why she had fled her brain was now clear and the actual world resumed its wonted aspect her face was still white her lips still quivered her soul was still shaken by the visitation but with a courage worthy of a better cause she sat down and fought with her fears till the colour returned and the nerves came under control yet her material nature could not grasp that the terrible gift of the interior sight had been hers for one short moment im a fool she assured herself harshly and she was for as the walls of the flesh closed round her soul to darken it anew her good angel who had wrought the miracle weeping for the blind that would not see and the deaf that would not hear left her despairingly then the powers of darkness soothed her into such contentment that she laughed scornfully at her late folly and adopted their explanation im run down with all this worry said lady jim i really need a tonic chapter xi a triple knock at the door both interrupted leahs meditations and annoyed her as she was far from wishing for company it could not be jim as he usually banged the panels impatiently and walked in before the invitation to enter could be heard through the noise of his tattoo besides jim for obvious reasons connected with askew had made himself scarce for the last fourandtwenty hours should it be a visitor leah resolved to decline conversation especially with one of her own sex but the women of the houseparty so rarely ventured into lady jims sittingroom that she concluded the disturber to be some servant with a message perhaps jim had broken his head while skating or had made a hole in the ice if so his death would greatly simplify matters come in she cried impatiently and to her surprise lionel presented himself with a somewhat diffident look oh its you padre lady jim had picked up the word from a sandhurst cadet whats the matteranything wrong what should be wrong inquired kaimes closing the door and remaining on the inside oh i dont know i always expect bad news when i see a lawyers letter or a parsons face well has lady canvey been converted or has jim gone to that place where the climate forbids skating nothing of the sort has happened said lionel dryly i have merely come to chat with you sit down then though i warn you i dont feel companionable you are worried my dear man when am i anything else but worried with jim for a husband and the duke behaving like shylock at his worst you and jim have made a mess of things i dont know about jim said lionel resenting this ungrateful speech but i did my best to put matters in the right light oh lord who wanted a right light the less light on jims and my affairs the better a few white lies would have resulted in a larger sum than that miserable two hundred with which the duke insulted us i am not in the habit of telling lies white or black lady james i daresay you parsons are so ridiculously punctilious as if diplomatic lies were not as oil on the troubled waters of this world i did not come to discuss this said lionel seeing how utterly impossible she was but to help you in your trouble what trouble i dont know i was reading in the library when a feeling came to me that i must see you at oncethat you needed assistance leah looked rather queer what could he possibly know of her late experience telepathy i suppose well that may be the scientific name for the divine spirit the what the divine spirit he repeated firmly and seriously i believe that the impulse to seek you came from above you are in danger am iof being bored to death you cant deny that you are in trouble of some sort i can see it in your expression my trouble is my own i share it with no one then you are in pray dont question me snapped leah with a nervous glance around this interference of the unseen with her material affairs was both weird and uncomfortable she could not deny the panic that had driven her headlong from the security of the flesh and it was remarkable that lionel unsummoned and unsought should seek her at so critical a moment the feeling that he was meddling with what did not concern him annoyed her the more i wish you would not frighten me she cried with an angry determination to stop this uncanny business perhaps it is your conscience that is frightening you how dare you say that because there is something serious the matter or i should not have been called to your assistance i never called you then your good angel did i dont believe in such things do you believe in anything yes she said defiantlyin myself that is a poor help in time of trouble i have managed very well hitherto can you substantiate that statement seeing how embarrassed your worldly affairs are at this moment lady jim could find no direct answer parsons have nothing to do with worldly matters she muttered averting her eyes very true but if i can offer spiritual consolation take it to lady canvey she needs it more than i do i doubt that or the call would not have come its a false alarm padre she said jeeringly i dont want to be preached at and youre suffering from indigestion or softening of the brain well lady james said lionel rising with a sigh your limitations may lead you to look at the matter in that light but if i can do nothing for you i can only retire after asking your pardonas i dofor my intrusion and he made for the door her mood changed with feminine rapidity and she beckoned imperatively that he should remain disguise it as she would to kaimes his sudden coming on the top of her late puzzling experience drove her to acknowledge that something outside the material was at work leah was too clever a woman to deny the existence of more things in heaven and earth than came within the scope of her knowledge it is the duty of you parsons to pry into the secrets of souls i suppose she said leaning her elbow on the chair arm and her chin on her hand but what interest can you have in my soulif i have one i as other servants of the master interest myself in all souls that you may save them only christ can do that i may deny his power to do soi may deny him and so fall as peter fell said lionel sadly yet he repented with bitter weeping i am not a tearful woman she retorted and turned to look into the fire she did not wish to meet his eyes when she spoke the ensuing acknowledgment you are a good man lionel andandyou may be able to help me kaimes resumed his seat i hope so but i can only point the way to a better helper and one more powerful she continued to gaze at the burning coals i was frightened a few minutes before you entered she said abruptly by what that is the question you must answer by something which made me see what a horrid nature i have lionel was silent for a few moments not quite sure of his speech the unseen presses closely around us he remarked at length and at times reveals itself for instance a contemplated sin may be prevented by a spiritual influence informing the intelligence how terrible the consequences of such a sin may be it was the sin itself rather than its consequence which frightened me murmured leah so softly that lionel caught but one word what is that you say about sin lady jims cunning made her shirk confession nothingoh nothing she said hurriedly only it seems to me that everything pleasant is a sin in your eyes dead sea fruit replied kaimes earnestly fair to the eye foul to the taste if you turn devoutly to the spiritual the material pleasures of this world lose their attractiveness perhaps she said sceptically but many things goodygoody people of your sort shudder at are attractive you cant deny that i have no wish to satan always supplies us with rosecoloured spectacles through which to contemplate his works lady jim rose and walked up and down the narrow limits of the room twisting her hands in a nervous hesitating way quite unlike her usually calm decisive self i wish you would not talk nonsense she snapped it is absurd to believe in a personal devil and in a possible hell also i suppose you would say oh she said carelessly scientists have explained that away and the inquisition of the middle ages denied that the earth went round the sun said kaimes grimly but i understand that it does clever but not convincing what is the use of talking nursery theology and cheap science to me what can you say that is likely to do me good the patient must be frank with his physician hinted lionel oh we always tell the exact truth to doctor and lawyer said lady jim scornfully because we fear for our bodies and our property but who tells the truth to a parson those who are convinced of sin in that case i may as well hold my tongue i am not convinced of anything not even if i ought to make you my father confessor i cannot compel your confidence on the other hand i cannot help you unless unless quite so let me think and turning her back on him she went to the window the early winter gloom was blotting out the distant landscape but near at hand the spectral glare of the snow revealed blackly the figures of homewardbound skaters the cold deadness of so sinister a world did not tend to soothe leahs overstrung nerves and shrouded nature could give her no counsel had it been a summers twilight of nightingales and roses of sleeping blossoms and murmuring leaves she would have recovered sufficient spirit to scoff but this arctic waste livid and still in the half light reminded her of the frozen hell in the deadly chills of which shuddered dante the seer and the virile saxon word hinted at the possible if not at the probable of course it was all very ridiculous and her system was out of order nevertheless she felt that some kindly human comfort and advice might restore her tormented mind to its usual peace and whatever she said to lionel he would not dare to repeat as a cousin as a gentleman as a priest his lips would be triply sealed and he might be able to point out a less dangerous path than that towards which the need of money was driving her he was a good fellow too and honest enough in spite of his superstition she decided to speak and came back to her chair had she been less material she could have heard in the stillness the rustling wings of a returning angel lionel looked at her inquiringly she was about to speak hurriedly lest the good impulse should pass away when jims tattoo was heard with a snap leah closed her lips as he lumbered redfaced hearty and essentially fleshy into the room the mere sight of his tangible commonplace made the woman thank her stars that she had not blundered into hysterical frankness holloa lionel holloa leah sittin in the twilight an talkin secretseh mind some light he clicked the ivory knob near the door and the room sprang into vivid being had a jolly days skatin y should ha come leah no end of a lark feel sick this polite question was asked because she shaded her eyes from the glare no but i cant stand wild bulls charging into a room might call it a chinashop chuckled jim glancing disparagingly at the nicknackery nerves slack ill bet fresh air an exercise an cheerful company is what you want leah im likely to get the last with you she rejoined witheringly for the overpowering vitality of the man made her wince well lionel heresbeen no catch in th way of fun i expect seems to have given you the hump goin old man all right ill cheer her up see you at dinner the curate nodded and went out since jims plunge into the middle of their conversation he had not uttered a word for the interruption had jarred on him as on lady jim moreover he departed with an intuitive feeling that the golden moment had passed and this was truly the case when she next saw him leah wondered why she had so nearly made a fool of herself and indeed she was already wondering while jim obviously embarrassed discoursed in a breezy blundering way with an attempt at connubial fondness poor old girl he said sitting opposite to her looking fresh and handsome and essentially manly awfully sorry youre chippy if id known id ha come back to keep you company are the heavens falling asked leah listlessly jim as usual could not follow this recondite speech dont know what youre talkin about he remarked goodhumouredly and bustling to the bell youre a peg too low leah tell you what well have tea here an a talk if you dont mind his wife nodded wondering if he was about to confess his possible mormonism she did not think so as jim never confessed anything unless it was dragged piecemeal out of him her feelings at this moment did not lean towards crossexamination so she let him ring the bell and order tea without using her tooready tongue in fact she unbent so far as to make use of him get me a dose of sal volatile jim she ordered theres a bottle on my dressingtable poor old girl said the sympathetic jim again and stumbling into the next room with eager haste leah smiled to herself this ready obedience argued a guilty conscience after jim dosed her he was tactful enough to hold his tongue and improve the fire without clattering the poker and tongs then he pulled down the blinds and drew the curtains and altered the shades of the electrics so that leah might not be overpowered by the glare its quite like a new honeymoon she said sarcastically the drug was doing its renovating work and her original devil was returning to a swept and garnished house with seven other spirits more wicked than himself jim took the remark seriously and coloured with pleasure i believe wed get on rippin said he enthusiastically if we only had the money i believe wed be as happy as birds they cant be very happy in this cold weather replied leah seeing plainly that jims amiability was owing to a selfish fear of reproval for his iniquities heres the tea i dont want any just now as the sal volatile is doing me good you can eat oh cant i just said jim when the footman left and he was filling himself a cup th skatins given me an appetite sides i want to get into form as ive somethin serious to say about this insurance business leah looked up suddenly i thought you had given that the goby nooo drawled her husband not meeting her eyes course th paters a good sort an all that but his arrangement will give us a howlin bad time for the next few years so i told you well then jim fiddled nervously with a piece of toast why not get the twenty thousand it could be managed of course with some little difficulty through that russian johnny demetrius yes youve see him then today hell see the thing through whats his price leah smiled blandly as she thought of what jim would say did she reply honestly to this question but she did not intend to it seemed to her that jim was driving her towards the very path which lionel unknowingly wished her to avoid it was useless to fight against fate so she decided and like many another person she laid the blame on those scapegoats the stars she was now completely dominated by the selfish influence of the great god mammon and the lesser sin of lying was swallowed up in the greater one of idolatry hell want a few thousands of course she said mendaciously but as yet we have not fixed any sum hum muttered jim suspiciously i thought hed want something more than money leah rose indignantly and proclaimed a virtue that her conscience assured her she might yet lose i am an honest woman jim she said haughtily and married or unmarried i should never allow any man to make love to me seems to me you do only to pass away the time i stop short when when their hearts are broken growled her husband upon my soul leah im straighter than you are i doubt that since you swear by what you havent got jim rashly became aggressively virtuous ive not been a bad sort of husband to you leah i have seen so little of you that it is rather difficult for me to give an opinion she said resting her elbow on the mantelpiece mrs berring may be in a better position to judge of your virtues kaimes turned white with emotion and he rose from his low chair as though worked by springs its a lie he growled hoarsely i never married her married who the lady you talk about the lady mr askew talked about you mean i merely mention her name it is not her name she is lola fajardo of the estancia san jago so mr askew explained oh if youre goin to make a row do i ever make rows asked lady jim impatiently you dont care enough about me to raise cain said jim rather sorry for himself i swear id be a different man if you were a different woman every husband in the divorce court witnessbox makes the same excuse sit down jim and let us talk over the matter quietly your infidelities have long since converted us from man and wife into a business firm to earn money but leah i swear by that soul you know nothing about she flashed out contemptuously talk sense if you are capable of doing so you have been trying to dodge this explanation ever since you met mr askew last night in the smokingroom but now that weve stumbled on an opening perhaps you will explain explain what all that mr askew did not tell me oh hes been makin somethin out of nothin the silly ass protested jim sitting down and handling the poker with a fervent wish that he could use it on the sailors head i met seorita fajardo at lima and later at buenos ayres her brother asked me out to their estancia in the camp of argentina near rosario and i stopped there for a month bit of luck came my way an i pulled her from under a beastly mustang that would have kicked the life out of her she took a fancy to me cause i saved her life is that all well i went again to san jago last year your third visit to south america since our marriage yes said jim sullenly an i met lolai mean seorita fajardo oh dont apologise lola is a pretty name an shes a pretty woman an im flesh an blood cried jim getting up to work himself into a rage i met her durin my second visit an went again to the estancia on my third it was no use luggin a title round for these mouldy hotelkeepers always make a chap pay for havin a handle to his name so i called myself berringjames berring james berring bachelor bachelor certainly i havent married her and if askew says i have hes a liar and assuredly a marplot said leah dryly since he has exploded your romance i understood from him that this lady loves you so she does and you love her jim wriggled oh go ongo on kick a chap when hes down if i had intended to kick you would have been black and blue by now mr james berring but you neednt flatter yourself that my feelings are hurt in any way youre not worth it other women think differently lola fajardo for instance well i cant help that can i if youd been a different sort of woman id have you said that before had we not better get to business what business the insurance business i dont care for you and you show very plainly that you dont care for me it is useless for us to struggle together like a couple of illmatched dogs in leash give me fifteen thousand of this money and then you can marry your lola woman jim turned white again you seem jolly anxious to get rid of me can you wonder if i do how many women would take this scandalous matter as quietly as i do its not scandalous said kaimes fiercely she thinks that i am a bachelor and im not even engaged to her i have tried to be true to you leah declared jim pathetically his wife shrugged her shoulders it was rather late in the day for jim to talk sentiment besides being a waste of time well she asked facing him squarely jim read her purpose in a very flinty face ill do what you want he said weakly then theres no more to be said remarked leah coldly moving towards the door of her bedroom demetrius will explain if you will afford him half an hours private conversation leah do you really mean it i have meant it from the first moment you put the idea into my head she said in a harsh voice this underhand lovemaking of yours only makes me the more determined but there was no dont lie jim a man can no more love two women than he can serve two masters is it to be lola fajardo or myself i leave it to you leah then i choose the fifteen thousand pounds she said and vanished into the bedroom jim took an impulsive step towards the door but the sharp click of a turning key showed him that he was locked out for ever that evening leah talked so gaily and looked so beautiful that her fatherinlaw was absolutely fascinated is it all right between you and james he asked graciously yes leah assured him we understand one another thoroughly chapter xii leah welcomed the new year at firmingham with the fervent hope that its bounty would bestow the insurance money and rid her of an official husband it really seemed as though providence or the fetish was in a benign mood for jim caught the worst of colds while skating being confined to an undesired bed and fed with food tasteless to a cultivated palate he lost both flesh and temper demetrius talked gravely of weak lungs and hinted at inherited consumption the duke was anxious but scarcely surprised and recalled similar cases of a grandmother two ancestors and a rackety uncle lady jim encouraged these pulmonary recollections for obvious reasons she and demetrius winked privately at one another like the celebrated augurs when they heard the old mans lamentations nature was acting strictly on the lines of the russians proposed medicine and there was no need to dose jim into a sickly likeness of garth day by day he grew as whitefaced as haggard and as lean until he became alarmed at the anxiety of providence to forward the schemes of himself and leah but there was no end to the kindness of an overruling fate jims illness afforded his wife the opportunity of posing as a sister of mercy and she fussed round the patient so ostentatiously that the duke was quite touched he began to think that leah was a true ministering angel and not the moneywasting doll he had considered her to be jim grinned as leah measured medicine and fed him with gruel and read him interesting bits from the sporting journals i believe im goin to get well he chuckled why so dear asked his wife who was profuse of adjectives in private so that they might slip out the more easily in public you look so uncommon dismal it is necessary to keep up appearances leah assured him besides this will be the last chance of my doing anything for you in future lola will soothe your weary pillow after which and similar passages of arms jim would curse himself to sleep and wake up to accuse his wife of wishing to poison him this fortunate illness kept lady jim at firmingham when the houseparty disintegrated but as the duke was a twaddling old ass and jim the most trying of patients leah looked upon her ten days boredom as a kind of lenten penance besides she had frequent confabulations with demetrius to settle details of the plot already the doctor had explained to the duke that garth would die easier in the tropics and funchal had been selected as the most agreeable place for his demise and then asked lady jim your husband must go to jamaica to wait events what events those which i propose to bring about retorted demetrius who had his reasons for not explaining himself too fully leah did not question him closely with a selfish regard for her own safety in case anything might leak out she preferred that the doctor should arrange matters in his own way but she obeyed instructions to the extent of hinting to the duke that kingston was the very best place for dear jims weak lungs will you go with him asked pentland anxiously oh no said lady jim sweetly we mustnt make too much fuss over him else hell think hes going to die he might sighed the duke i had an uncle and he described the sufferings of old lord george for the tenth time leah comforted him after the manner of one bildad a shuhite oh kingston will do jim no end of good my dear duke it wont cure one lung but it may patch up the other and then you know if he gets worse i can always reach him in fourteen days does demetrius think he will die asked the duke piteously he doesnt think poor jim will ever be so strong as he was said leah gravely but hell hang on with care just like my grandmother muttered the duke and then detailed the sufferings of a dowager duchess who couldnt be kept alive beyond the age of sixty if jim lives till that age i shall be content said leah are you thinking of the insurance money demanded pentland with sudden anger what insurance money oh yes i think jim did mention something about an insurance he gets it if he lives till sixty really i dont quite understand duke but im sure its all right i hope so my dear has he made his will no why should he because in the event of his dying the insurance money should be left to you no will means trouble leah had never thought of a will as it seemed natural that the money should come to her without the necessity of paying lawyers bills but her quick brain seized the chance of smoothing the way to acquiring the fortune with as little trouble as possible and she promptly cornered the duke you speak to him she suggested and this the duke did with the result that a will leaving the money to leah was drawn up and signed after some opposition by jim he did not at all relish the carrying out of this necessary step it was too like preparing a death certificate to please jim however as a reward for his obedience demetrius set him on his legs and jim went to torquay with the devoted leah but when he was settled in a comfortable hotel as an interesting invalid and with a superfluity of pretty girls to soothe him with sympathy lady jim left him for a round of visits to various countryhouses now that the duke was out of sight jims connubial comforts were out of mind but leah left strict injunctions that he was not to put on flesh within the month she was to see him start for jamaica and impressed upon him the necessity of looking quite ready to depart for a place where jim had no desire to go i dont see why you want to make a holy show of me grumbled jim we must make your death appear as plausible as possible but i dont want to look like a livin skeleton oh i dont think lola will mind said leah cruelly and started out to enjoy herself in the best of spirits while at lord sargons seat in shropshire she met askew in the company of the fixture the young mans betrothed was extremely like a dairymaid and her frocks set lady jims teeth on edge if she could combine colours that did not match she always did so and her character was as colourless as her wardrobe was gaudy marjory was the creatures name and her conversation was the papa mamma of a squeaking doll how much are you paying for her asked leah after satisfying herself that the young lady was really a woman five thousand a year replied the lieutenant sulkily what a bargain dont laugh at me he implored you know there is but one woman in the world for me so you told me lolawhats her name some one nearer and dearer than her he murmured with what the americans call googoo eyes whereat lady jim laughed and allowed him to fetch and carry and sit on his hind legs and bark prettily like a welltrained lapdog it amused her and kept him on tenterhooks the only annoying thing was that marjory seemed to care little for this annexation of her lover she much preferred a foxhunting squire who talked stables and glowered on askew for not appreciating the dairymaid in this capture of another womans man leah combined pleasure with business she did not wish to spoil jims little game with the spanish lady and it would never do for askew to detail mr berrings past in a quarter where such betrayal would lead to trouble by this time the amorous sailor was the slave of beauty so lady jim was sufficiently mistress of his will to limit his correspondence this she did one evening after dinner while admiring marjorys new frock yellow and green murmured leah when she and askew filled up a corner and watched frantic people playing bridge poached egg on spinach if you design her gowns mr askew i should advise a less lavish use of primary colours she means well he muttered apologetically people who need excuses for existing always do retorted lady jim but she is really a sweetly simple girl with two ideas neither of which includes you my dear boy i am sure you will be very happy together doing cakewalks doing cakewalks that sort of dress always makes me think of south carolina and the old kentucky home you know they invented cakewalks there i believe but i forgotyou prefer places below the equator i never think of south america he protested of course not the jewel is more attractive than the casket when did you last hear from seorita fajardo i never had a letter from her in my life she is cautious it seems are you i dont write to her if that is what you mean i did love her what a polite thing to say to me but i dont any longer you see i thought that berringyour theres nothing in that said lady jim quickly there never really was and if you really love this estancia lady why not marry her i am engaged already to me or to that pretty vivacious girl over there as marjory was looking particularly like a wooden dutch doll at the moment askew reddened i wish you wouldnt say these things lady jim lady james lady james then marjory cant help herself it seems to me she hasto that intelligent young man with the face like a sheep and the manners of a costermonger they were boy and girl together and are still from the infantile look of them i quite expect to see their nurse arrive you know it wont do said leah gravely here i am making fun of marjory and you arent man enough to stand up for her the young man coloured still deeper and mumbled something about a womans privilege shortly he made a lame excuse and left leah to devote himself to marjory who was not grateful for the attention leah did not mind she had learned that askew did not correspond with lola fajardo and had no intention of doing so therefore there was little likelihood that jims fettered past would ever become known at the estancia san jago being really a goodnatured woman with her affections thoroughly under control leah half decided to loosen her apronstrings and let askew lead his bargain to the altar but this she did not do for two obtrusive reasons firstly the foxhunting squire and marjory were made for one another and secondly it would be just as well to keep the sailor under her eye for the next year she did not wish him to hark back to lima for melodramatic purposes after a very pleasant visit thanks to askews infatuation lady jim returned to curzon street there she found a letter from demetrius announcing that he and garth had sailed for madeira early in the previous week and that it would be as well if lord james kaimes journeyed forthwith to jamaica leah promptly sent an answer to her accomplice at funchal a telegram to jim a paragraph to a society paper and a lengthy letter of sorrowful forebodings to the duke then she sat down to wait events and meanwhile considered the situation pentland was all right thanks to her cajoling before she left firmingham he had arranged to free the income to pay the debts and to allow her to occupy the curzon street house until such time as jamaica should kill or cure jim that interesting invalid had gone halves over the cheque and leahs purse still contained over fifty pounds which would do for the present but she intended to get a few hundreds from the duke by playing off jims sickly looks and her own lonely condition of grasswidowhood it was really very satisfactory and she found it hard to look miserable as in duty bound when pentland arrived to see the last of jim leah arranged that the parting between father and son should be in town she did not want to have a bereaved father bothering at southampton the journey back to town after jims dispatch would be boring at the best and her consolatory powers were not great you look disgustingly fit said leah when jim was established on the drawingroom sofa with a rug and a few unnecessary medicine bottles and other sickroom paraphernalia sorry i cant be more of a corpse growled the invalid but its not easy to pretend youre a goner when y feel fit to jump over the moon try and cough louder suggested his wife shant it hurts m throat hang it ive lost three stone i believe you want me dead in real earnest lady jim thought for a moment no i dont she said truly enough you havent treated me over well and i should have been a different woman had you been a different man divorce court lingo said jim remembering what she had said at firmingham and with a derisive laugh all the same i hope youll have a good time in south america why not in jamaica because youve got to be thoroughly sick there demetrius will come along later with garths corpse and ugh drop it what about the moneymy share ill get the cash as soon as you are sent home me what for aint i goin to disappear of course said leah impatiently but demetrius has to embalm your body and bring you home to the family vault i say dont cried jim uneasily thats the other johnny youre talkin about leah he looked round cautiously i hope demetrius wont polish off that poor fellow hes a sort of relative of mine y know dont worry your head said lady jim calmly garths dying as fast as he can he may be dead by this time for all we know and dont think that i would allow demetrius to be so wicked she cried with virtuous indignation im not a criminal oh lord was all jim could find to say as he thought of what they were doing and conversation ended for the time being leah went to the theatre and supper at the savoy that evening leaving jim to practise coughing amongst the useless medicine bottles next day both pentland and his eldest son arrived at eleven and were informed by a sadfaced wife that her dear husband would travel to southampton by the afternoon train at the sight of leahs dismal looks and attentive care frith expressed his opinion that women were protean never thought you cared so much for jim he said bluntly oh i dont for a moment say that i think jim is a good man was leahs artistic reply and weve had our tiffs like other married people but jims my husband after all and he has his good points what are they lady jim was not prepared with a catalogue of her husbands perfections oh i dont know she murmured vaguely he drinks in moderation you know thats something theres no virtue in resisting a nonexistent temptation said the marquis grimly jim doesnt come of a drinking family of a consumptive one i believe retorted leah softly frith was nettled at the implied slight not at all he said with unusual gruffness look at me but that poor garth oh hei dont understandand if you frith coloured as he met her derisive eyes and devoted himself to his brother lady jim left the affectionate trio together lengthening out their farewells and retired laughing to her room it was really amusing to think that jim who was as healthy as a trout in a pond should be wept over and coddled and pitied and generally elevated to a sainthood the business was serious enough no doubt but leah could not help seeing the humorous side she felt unequal to keeping a grave face while the comedy in the drawingroom was being played and therefore did not rejoin her husband till the principal comedians had departed we are a couple of rotters said jim gloomily when she appeared speak for yourself my dear she retorted coolly well and what did they say never you mind youd only snigger over a father takin leave of his dyin son oh i did not know that the duke had seen harold garth leah cried her husband fiercely youre anever mind whatever you are im another did the duke leave a cheque for me asked leah more businesslike than sympathetic jim banged about among the medicine bottles five hundred dear man cried his wife snatching the cheque from his very reluctant hand i must go and dress for the journey wont you kiss me leah quavered jim really moved and quite forgetting the rascally plot in which he was taking so prominent a part at the door she turned with an expression of withering scorn keep your kisses for your wife mr berring cried this tooprevious widow and left him to digest the insult at his leisure chapter xiii the paragraph sent by leah to her pet editor intimated concisely to the tufthunting world of tom dick and harriet that the suddenly developed pulmonary complaint of lord james kaimes necessitated his wintering in jamaica this intelligence surprised the clubs as jims hectoring voice and devotion to damp field sport had always suggested aggressively sound lungs never knew him to be chippy in his life growled one man who admired leah as much as he hated jim for possessing her whats his game this time i wonder perhaps he wants to get away from his wife hinted a pigeon of jims plucking bit of a tongue hasnt she tongue be hanged she has both wit and beauty the pigeon sniggered knowing the speakers devotion to delilah oh kaimes appreciates those qualitiesin another mans wife scandal scandal murmured a meek member blessed with a spouse whose looks prevented temptation kaimes has dined with us many times but i never saw no you wouldnt struck in a sporting baronet whom leah snubbed on every possible occasion jim likes redhaired women then why doesnt he stick to the one hes legally entitled to because she sticks to him if shed only syndicate her admirers in the d c jim ud be after her like an indian mosquito in search of a new arrival ill bet theres some petticoat in this jamaica business and the sportsman looked round for some one to pander to his besetting sinbut no one gave him a chance of committing it contradiction and argument arrived with the oldest inhabitant of clubland whose memory was as exasperating as his verbosity wrong all wrong he purred like the tame cat he had been for half a century kaimes is really consumptive i remember his grandmother dying of tuberculosis its in the family along with gout and water on the brain oh bosh if jim was sick hed sin more judiciously i never knew that damnation depended upon health was the retort take a case in point during the great exhibition leahs admirer cut short a muchdreaded anecdote shell make a lovely widow i dont believe in secondhand brides myself said the horsey man venturing an epigram sides her tonguecuts like a knife even the mares shy when she kicks wit wit explained the admirer who misread french memoirs she is madame de rambouilletwithout a history hum she hasnt published one yet but i dare say tut tut interrupted the ancient madame de rambouillet was and lady james is entirely respectable and the horse is the noblest of all animals snapped the baronet maybe though the beast doesnt improve your morals and the laugh was with the oldest inhabitant wonder if kaimes will die pondered the man who saw leah as a probable widow and a possible wife lay you ten to five he wont you will lose you will most assuredly lose said the octogenarian very consumptive family the kaimes and our friend is just the sort of healthy man to depart suddenly where to asked the pigeon husssh droned the meek member thats a serious question to jim finished the racing man smartly but i dont care jim dead or alive is equally useless to me oh he isnt in your debt then catch me trusting himnot much but whats the use of talking obituary notices lets bridge if your play is as bad as your grammar i prefer to stand out said methuselah and the symposium broke up in time to prevent bickering between crabbed age and irreverent youth there were many such talks during the nine minutes wonder of jims unexpected sickness and it was generally considered that he would return in spirits of wine to the family vault leah did not hear these encouraging prognostications so conducive to the entire success of the plot she was tolerating life at san remo under the hired roof of a truly great dame who wished to disentangle her from the golden nets of ultrafast society a grasswidow has to be more careful to keep up appearances than the genuine crape article even at the risk of being bored by highly placed humanity as dull as stainless lady hengist and her friends belonged to that seventh heaven where newly rich peris and the mammons who cocker them seek admittance in vain social laws differ from those of nature inasmuch as the gilded scum does not invariably rise to the top hence the creation of the overdiscussed smart set which is taken by the suburban reader of back stairs journalism as representative of the british aristocracy lord hengist came of an autochthonous family which had been at home when william the conqueror raided the ancestral cabin his wife was descended from a knight who emigrated from normandy in with apparently several million others judging by the claims put forward by those who enter the peerage this alliancethey were too great to talk of mere marriageresulted in two children not made of ordinary clay but compounded of the superlative porcelain sort their parents possessed a genuine medival castle as uncomfortable as the builders knew how to make it and which had the rare distinction of possessing a statebedroom in which elizabeth had never slept the family archives read like the book of numbers and their ancestors had made history at opulent wages for the benefit of the hengist coffers the men had sided with the stewarts and ratted to the guelphs the women bloomed in lely and kneller portraits in loosely slipping clothes with pastoral accessories and finally the present head of the house with four seats two children a charming wife and a large income lived comfortably on the loot of ages of all these things lord and lady hengist were so proud that they had no need to exhibit pride wellborn as leah kaimes was the pleasant if somewhat stately and stiff life of these genuine rulers wearied her intensely bread and milk is insipid after a repast of ortolans in aspic and a motorflight is more exhilarating than a donkeyride moreover it annoyed her to see how sensibly the hengists spent their many pounds a day they could have had much more fun for the money had they known the right shops but they patronised outofdate establishments where the goods were of an excellent quality but just five minutes behind the newest things of course this was leahs figurative way of saying that the hengists came out of the ark they always bought the wrong things at the wrong shops and had a middleclass eye to the lasting quality of the goods they purchased they were clothed rather than dressed and being colourblind invariably chose garments which matched abominably with their complexions in a word the hengists were so commonplace as to be original lady jim could not understand why they should have been thrust into positions which they could not fill it was like bringing cows into the drawingroom its so hard for me to taste the pleasures of selfdenial complained hengist one day as they sauntered on the promenade i dont think it is wise to attempt the extraction of sunbeams from cucumbers said leah dryly dean swift said that but he was an egotist replied hengist in his serious way that reminded lady jim of lionel at his worst it is more blessed to give than to receive you know is it indeed who said so the wisest and most loving of mankind and it is a true saying i assure you that if i deny myself something i greatly desire and send the money which would have purchased the gratification to a charity i feel absolutely happy i dont think i ever tried that experiment you will not know true happiness till you do lady james then i must make a bid for paradise she answered privately thinking that the man talked sad nonsense its a dreadful thing to be able to have the moon for the asking went on hengist reflectively thats your epigrammatic way of putting it i suppose but the moon wont drop from her sphere for me howl as i may you are very lucky to command the planet lord hengist so the world thinks but it forgets that there is the curse of satiety is there i never knew it existed i only wish i could cram the twelve hours of the day with twentyfour of pleasure have you ever had everything you wished for lady james no said leah promptly id have the sun as well as the moon and the stars thrown in if i had my way only to be bored by the acquisition of the lot me boredoh dear no i am too stupid it is only clever people like yourself who suffer from ennui i only wish i were a roman empress with provinces for a dowry those dear women knew how to live but in the majestic pages of gibbon who oh that man who came to think he was the roman empire now his work would bore meim not stupid enough to appreciate him juliathis was lady hengistjulia and i read gibbon during the honeymoon and received much instruction oh lord said lady jim as though honeymoons were not disagreeable enough without that the idea made her laugh consumedly in her minds eye she saw this new paolo and francesca reading heavy prose in ten volumes but hengist did not even smilehe had absolutely no sense of humour besides he considered his companions chatter painfully frivolous and sighed to think that she had such a light nature leah still laughing glanced sideways i shall begin to think you are discontented lord hengist i am that i cannot do the good i should like to do both julia and i wish to benefit mankind the twelve labours of hercules with no thanks for their accomplishment we dont want thanks but results said hengist austerely and we can commence in a small way next summer we intend to invite five hundred whitechapel children to the castle will you come and help us to entertain them lady james delighted yawned leah for the man spoke like a copybook but i hope youll wash them first it will prevent disease and give some new soap a philanthropic advertisement hengist eyed her suspiciously he was a very very dull young lord largehearted and unintelligent who took life so seriously that he had almost forgotten how to laugh england clean england contented england happy he constantly started crusades to bring on a premature millennium and earned his reward after the manner of reformers by being abused in halfpenny newspapers as one who attempted to avert certain revolution by stuffing the starving with sweets lady jim thought him a bore and a prig and too virtuous to be amusing but that he and his wife were of use to her she would not have endured this presentation of his yearbeforelasts treeofknowledge apples he never plucked fresh fruit and his eve was quite as blind as he in discerning uptodate harvests still hengist was a sort of bellwether leading a flock of prize sheep towards a closely guarded fold leah liked the fun and money and adulation of the smart set but she had no notion of being a shutout peri from that dull paradise that the newly rich longed for besides its very dullness gave a fillip to her enjoyment of the larky amusements of those who could not enter the sacred ark i am really very fond of children she said to do away with the effect of her last remark i wish i had some myself and she sighed very prettily hilda frith is more fortunate than i with her two dear babies both girls i fancy frith would like a son and heir im sure he would and both jim and i would be the very first to congratulate him your husband is next in succession yes poor dear but frith is strong and healthy while darling jimoh i cant bear to talk about it this was perfectly true to invent sentimental domestic histories and bewail a husband she detested was difficult even to a woman of leahs imagination and tact but hengist thought it was very good of her to talk so generously and paid her serious compliments till she began to think that some unpardonable sin had thrown her into the society of this prosing creature it was like reading the dictionary or drinking homburg waters or paying bills the sight of a friend made her gasp with relief after the manner of a pearldiver rising to take the air heres lady richardson and sir billy she said with a frown for her companions benefit so horrid to interrupt our nice conversation we can pass them replied hengist decidedly pleased oh i dont think so was leahs quick reply it would look rude and then fanny richardson never passes any one who will listen to her prattle of chiffons besides billy is a nice boyquite a little man dont you think so too much a man for his years said her companion austerely i do not like chesterfields in their teens the lads manners are too goodmuch too good can any child be much too good in the wrong way of overartificiality yes sir william he likes to be called sir billy so flippant his mother should insist she she never insists on anything except having the newest dye and the bestcut frock and a few dozen male ears to pour her babble into billy can do no wrong in her eyes nor in mine he is such an admirer of women and at the age of thirteen groaned hengist come now even you must have made love to some pretty pastrycooks daughter when you were at eton there must be some of the old adam in you lord hengist i was never an entirely modern child replied the serious man evasively and with a sad eye on the trim figure of the rapidly approaching billy to think that he should take dinner pills and know the difference between sweet and dry champagne what will the next generation be boys and girls said leah flippantly good day fanny the vivacious little fairy who warmly greeted lady jim and her solemn escort was as pretty and fragile and dainty as a dresden china shepherdess and quite a credit to the maid who recreated her every morning there was nothing natural about her save her genuine adoration of billy and that arose from a knowledge that royalty had made it fashionable to exploit the nursery blonde and plump jimp and graceful dressed in perfect taste and coloured in the latest fashion she was popular even with her own discriminating sex hengist thought her a respectable doll with no particular vices and did not object to having her at the castle but he disapproved of billy the precocious which was decidedly unfair as billy could scarcely help shaping himself to the mould into which he had been slipped by a mother who required his assistance to play the pretty comedy of the widows only son how are you leah darling so sweet you look and lord hengist too a most unexpected meeting and so delightful babbled lady richardson who talked more and said less than any society gramophone billy and i are just going to monte carlo to plunge on the red reggy lake is to meet us at the station such a nice boylancers you knowa great chum of billys wont you come too leah to brighten billy up hes got the hump poor boy as his new nervetonic doesnt suit him and such a lovely lovely day as it is too dont you think so lord hengist the respectable hengists hair bristled at this incoherent speech and did not lie down again at the look in billys eyes dressed in a particularly smart eton suit gloved and silkhatted and patentleatherbooted with fashionable accuracy the boy appraised lady jims beauty in a calm way which would have made a captain of dragoons blush behind his graceful nonchalant handsome mask of youth was hidden an old old man and in many ways hengist was his junior he certainly blushed when leah gave him an amused glance but this was billys way of mashing the sex he knew the value of youthful diffidence backed by mature knowledge should not your little boy be at school asked hengist scandalised into an implied snub sir william looked at the troubled face of his elder with the serenity of a cherub goin back nex week said he carefully dropping his gs th little mother wanted me to look after her for a bit billy cant trust me out of his sight giggled lady richardson hes so afraid ill give him a second father not reggy lake anyhow hes a rotter whats a rotter sir billy asked lady jim enjoying the disgusted looks of hengist a fellow who rots what an admirable definition billy rapidly dropped his left eyelid and showed a set of white teeth i dont carry coals to your newcastle he said parabolically say lady jim chuck this chappy and come to charlies mount the wink and the speech were lost on hengist for he was being worried by lady richardson she danced before him a pretty figure gowned in burntalmond red and would have distracted his heart with daintiness but that julia kept that article in the nursery do join us lord hengist she pleaded seductively such fun when you know the ropes billy can show them to you out of the mouth of babes and sucklings quoted hengist ironically quite a new reading lady richardson now you are horrid said the widow who did not know in the least what he meant ill tell your wife by the way how is she and the darling darling twins twins are too sweet i wish billy was a twin one of sir william is quite sufficient im sure i dont know what you are talking about and its very horrid of you to say so billy is adored is he ever whipped lady richardson gave a scream how barbarous the man who tried to whip billy would have to order his coffin beforehand billy can handle his bunches of fives i can tell you lord hengist his what its billys way of putting boxing you should see him give the postmans knock oh he is clever he can drive a motor too and pick out the winner five times out of ten does he know the kings of england no

afternoon tea with monsieur aksakoff and his daughter whats that asked leah overhearing the names the russian man stiff sort of fella said young eton nothin birdish about him daughters a clipper though say little mother wed best get th train wont wait y know before he had finished speaking lady jim had made up her mind she had not heard from demetrius and it was not impossible that he had written to katinka in spite of his discouraging lovemaking he kept in with her on the chance that she might be able to procure his pardon and in any case she was useful in keeping him posted in the doings of the third section the girl was so infatuated that she never saw he was making use of her in this way and constantly wrote to him about any official gossip she heard there was something pathetic in her devotion and heartwhole love for the man who deceived her but leah did not look at the matter in this way she knew that katinka if any one would have news of the doctor and being anxious to learn how garth was progressing towards the grave she turned to hengist i think ill go over she said in a low voice jim asked me to see m aksakoff on some business would julia mind not at all said hengist heartily and quite deceived i would escort you only i have some letters to write about the distress in london oh billy will look after us said that young gentlemans mother i have driven a team before now observed billy with dignity i hengist gave him a reproving look which billy bore very stoically and whispered to leah as they parted dont encourage that lad i dont think he needs much encouragement said lady jim laughing and the two women walked away with billy between them hengist stood where he was and frowned charming woman lady james he murmured gazing after leahs amethystine gown but that ladugh he shook his head over young england uptodate then returned to the villa to hear the twins say the alphabet life had its compensations even for a millionaire peer chapter xiv after the happygolucky fashion of italian officialism the train was detained for some time at ventimiglia lady richardson unsettled as a fly changed her seat five times and complained garrulously captain lake is so very particular she explained producing a pocketmirror and a powderpuff to repair possible damages he cant bear to be kept waiting five minutes then i should make him wait five hours replied leah calmly it doesnt do to spoil men you spoil me said sir billy audaciously pooh you are merely a rascal in the making i wouldnt hint how we govern your sex if you were anything but a grub the boy laughed complacently im a very nice grub very precocious at all events you know much more than is good for you fanny you should whip him i havent the heart or the muscle my dear the only safe thing will be to marry a strong man with a bad temper i should jolly well like to see the stepfather who would pitch into me you will if you dont behave isnt that eyebrow a little crooked billy and she fingered it delicately dont think so but you have a smudge of powder on your chin so i have how horrid there dusting it off what a comfort you are to your darling mammy my own kiss me billy brushed her rouge with careful lips and after a glance to see that he had not blurred the picture lady richardson put away the mirror thank goodness were moving again she prattled i do hope reggy wont be in a bad temper ill square that little mother been to the theatres lately lady jim no answered leah amused by his manabouttown air is there anything good on awful stuff announced billy with the conviction of mature judgment couldnt sit out more than two plays the woman with three husbands isnt bad though very french of course saw it four times before i told the little mother she couldnt face it how alluring will you take me billy was obviously shocked no woman should see that piece i can stand heaps but an aftermethedeluge shrug hinted at the degradation of the drama yes poor darling chimed in his mother he was blushing three inches deep all over when he came home i am glad to hear that billy can blush at all murmured lady jim hows the betting william tolerable i pulled off a fiver on flybynight but a man in my form lost a tenner silly juggins oh how old is that man sixteen and thinks hes twenty awfully saucy chap though went nap on a girl and another fella scooped th pool dont they teach english at eton billy the youth was quite undisturbed try to he assured her but theres no snap about the classical rot they give us oh here we are and there is reggy cried lady richardson craning her dyed head out of the window like another jezebel how dy do captain lake lovely day so sorry were late you know lady james kaimes i have that pleasure said the tall young soldier saluting very sorry to hear your husband is ill lady james thanks but i daresay jamaica will pull him round captain lake hope it wont breathed billy at her elbow as the lift soared why you horrid little boy therell be a chance for me no no youre too much of a general lover billy girls do run a man so hard nowadays observed billy pathetically it was different in your youth no doubt but i am not a girl and quite old enough to box the ears of conceited urchins doif youll let me give you a kiss for a blow what precocious christianity you had better apply to that pretty american girl near the casino door miss mamie mulrady oh i can get her kisses without fightin not badlookin is she lots of tin an as spry as they make em theres th little mother an that rotter chippin into th casino shall we follow lady jim they were stopped on the steps by miss mulrady who knew both and claimed acquaintance through a wholly unnecessary lorgnette she was a vivacious wild west product who exaggerated the vernacular because europeans expected to find the californian girl of fiction in real life her exaggerated slang was assumed out of sheer amusement and she greatly enjoyed the amazed looks of those who heard her talk good anglosaxon which she did when she escaped from fools to forgather with wise men how are you miss mulrady asked billy solemnly keepin afloat i guess but thats about all the dollars ive lost buckin the tiger would have bought me a dozen husbands foreign ones are cheap i believe said leah admiring the prairieflowers paris frock more than her republican manner you make me smile im goin to run tandem with sir billy hereme first and he the wheeler no go said the boy quite able to hold his own im not goin to marry a bret harte girl oh do replied miss mulrady in the purest of english and placing two small gloved hands together ill be a wife and a mother in one what economy smiled lady jim are you coming into the devils parlour later im waiting for mr askew leah started she thought that askew was safe in shropshire making attempts to civilise the fixture harry askew thats so assented miss mulrady relapsing into her wild west vocabulary and with a keen look he called on mommo an me when he was cruisin out frisco way were negotiatin a system to break this old bank you evidently wish to be popularised in a song said lady jim languidly how long has mr askew been devoting his energies to such things this with an angry reflection that he had not called on her you might reckon it twentyfour hours said the american admiring her pointed brown shoe hes here for his health ive heard that excuse before with regard to monte carlo shouldnt wonder we ticket our sins best sugar sir billy come along an buy me candy at the stores but your man miss mulradythe askew chap lady jim an i ull swap humans what say and she looked at leah mischievously overdoing the slang i never swap what isnt my own property answered lady jim considering this offer too western and resenting the familiarity to the extent of walking into the casino with her head very much in the air america could hold her own with the mothercountry and leah did not approve she wants to be the whole show an the boxoffice murmured mamie mischievously stay here bub i am sorry to refuse a lady replied billy resenting the word but ive put my money on lady jim this trip on the redhair you mean go byebye with your nurse then heres mr askew hes older than you and easier to please snapped the youth much offended youll excuse me miss mulrady but a man cant keep a woman waitin he retired into what lady jim called the devils parlour with a floreat etona air and miss mulrady after a glance at the ears which she longed to box soundly turned to receive a breathless apology from the belated askew theres a friend of yours gone in to sin for an hour said she when a treaty was concluded i have so many friendssocalled of the hightoned giltedged sort with red scalps askew comprehended in a second lady jim he stammered yes i heard that she was at san remo whats she doing here visitin the sick an the poor said mamie shrewdly its what folks come to monte for guess she best drop in on youa sicker man i never saw an youll be poor enough by th time were through with this old system of yours i know a bank where th wild time goes you may look all through bacon without findin that remarkits my own lets get thus with barbaric japes did the child of nature lead her companion into the gilded halls of iniquity and the two jostled the welldressed crowd which circulated round the tables the silence was that of an arctic night save for the droning voices of the croupiers and at times a hurried whisper of joy or dismay goin in for rouge et noir with lady jim asked miss mulrady alluding to the hair of askew and his friend or perhaps shes sportin on trente et quarante to suit her years shes under thirty growled askew crossly an youre under the weather considerable retorted the american sharply get up steam an fizzle a bit cant you shall i warwhoop or dance a hornpipe neither i prefer originality try the system then and askew pushed his way through the mammonworshippers to where the roulette ball wheeled its fatal round lady jim did not play she had stupidly forgotten her peacocks feather and could not risk loss with her small capital but billy having the audacity and luck of innocence was at hand so she gave him five hundred francs to experiment well halve the winnings never take money from a woman said billy gravely but i dont mind a fly got any sportin number thirteen because thats your age there is mademoiselle aksakoff i wish to speak to her and she moved gracefully towards the tall pale girl while young iniquity with the air of a vanderbilt planked her money on the odd number katinka aksakoff grew crimson when lady jim saluted her and would have evaded the meeting if possible she might have been a nun from the looks of her and was garbed in unrelieved black which leah concluded was mourning for unrequited affection after that fleeting wave of colour her thin oval face grew marble white and a pair of dark questioning eyes appeared twice as large and three times as brilliant as they had been before resting on lady jims gracious smile so glad to meet you murmured leah as they shook hands in the air lady richardson and i have come to tea where is your father he is talking with the german ambassador replied katinka without a smile and with siberian coldness so fortunate we can chat without interruption i scarcely think we have much to chat about oh yes rejoined lady jim with perfect goodhumour when you learn how you misjudge me we shall get on capitally pardon i do not understand probably not since i have yet to make my explanation let us walk on the terrace and you can throw me over to where they shoot the pigeons if my conversation displeases you ah but it is so strange and so necessaryto your peace of mind no mademoiselle aksakoffs face grew scarlet once more and she pressed her hand to her heart as though she felt there a cruel pain perhaps she did poor soul but the stoicism of the slav enabled her to summon up a wry smile and to bow her head as she followed her brilliant rival with the excess of an illgoverned passionate heart did she hate this woman but as a niobe frozen and cold did she appear when they were pacing the terrace and not one single word of her companions sugared speech was she prepared to believe leahs eyes rested appreciatively on the varied beauty of gods work and mans improvements the huddled white houses of monaco crowned its giant rock which bulked hugely against the blended azure of sea and sky the placid waters ringed its base with foam and stretched with sparks and dashes of fire towards an immeasurable horizon landward bunched the red roofs of the town below arid and precipitous heights soaring massively into the radiant and everdeepening blue a balmy wind like some invisible alchemist changed the sombre green of the olivegroves to patches of glittering silver near at hand spread the lustrous foliage of lemon and orangetrees nor was wanting the almondblossom of the far east they walked under palms suggestive of bedouin life and to the wellread of heines sad little song immortal and heartrendingly true roses and violets and flowers of many shapes and hues bordered the terrace the wide sea laughed at their feet and behind them rose the palatial structure of the casino gorgeous as the golden house of nero it was fairyland and lady jim said so to her sad companion who was too blinded by love to see beauty anywhere when the beloved was absent we can talk in french if you like said leah after she had paid her tribute to nature in english i think replied the russian girl my father wishes me to speak only your tongue while we remain in london so that i may improve you cant answered leah genuinely complimentary your accent is much better than a born english person also your grammar and your choice of words we take the trouble to learn your language whereas you english do not were too busy annexing the world to bother about philological lessons said lady jim remembering heines remark anent the romans possibly assented katinka with a chilling smile but interesting as this conversation is i do not see its necessity monsieur demetrius began leah abruptly when mademoiselle raised a protesting hand we need not speak of him madame why not he is a mutual friend i know you fancy i fancy nothing interrupted the other haughtily words are not needed where he is concerned but explanations are you think that i love demetrius katinka flushed painfully and she put her hand suddenly to her throat i forbid you to speak she said in a stifled voice nonsense we are not in russia where people kneel down and say please besides it is necessary for your peace of mind that you should hear what i have to say you made that remark before lady james true and i make it again to emphasise my meaning though i hate repetition demetrius loves you no no it is you who pish his heart is yours his science mine his science mademoiselle aksakoff looked surprised what else do you think attracted me i am an english cat and i have no lovers do you remember la fontaines fable lady james be plain with me i am trying to be you think that i love demetrius and that he is devoted to me it is not so katinka winced she did not like such plain speaking and moreover doubted its truth if i could think so i would of course you can think so said lady jim amiably demetrius is particularly clever in curing consumptive diseases for that reason i conversed with him a great deal my husband is very ill and i wanted the doctor to cure him if demetrius thought that my liking for his society meant anything else he is an egotist my advice is that you should procure his pardon and marry him there are obstacles in the way i am not one i assure you are you speaking honestly i am and the eyes of the two women met katinka searched the hard blue orbs of the great lady with painful intensity and leah bore the scrutiny with the knowledge that her conduct had been and always would be perfectly correct had she been the least in love with the doctor she would not have dared to submit to that probing painful gaze women may deceive mere men they cannot deceive one another especially in affairs of the heart when katinka withdrew her eyes she was satisfied that lady jim cared nothing for demetrius without explanation she burst into rapid and wrathful speech and leahs feminine perspicacity enabled her to guess the unuttered preamble which a man would have required to be put into words why then do you lure him to your feet cried the russian girl in a sharp pained voice if you love him not why torture him and me i know he loves youi knowi knowoh yes i know you do not his love for meif it can be called sois the mere passing fancy of a man for a woman who has been kind to him too kind muttered katinka vengefully not at all but men are so conceited that they think a womans smile means a womans love you have a golden heart yet you throw it into the greedy hands of this selfish egotist he is not that gasped the girl yes he is and much worse demetrius possesses the selfishness of a woman and the vanity of a man you reverse the proper order no i dont men are far vainer than women and women more selfish than men im selfish myself therefore i am happy you are one of those selftormenting selfdenying angels who make men what they arevain greedy conceited lordofcreation beasts and i insult the beasts by such a comparison i thought you liked men i use them and i detest them retorted lady jim speaking more plainly than was her custom there are good meni dont deny that for i know one at leastshe was thinking of lionel but the majorityugh god help the women like yourself who give their hearts into the keeping of such animals you love your husband surely we all love our husbandsits part of the church service to love them pahi am not here to talk of my marriage but of yours you know now that i dont care for demetrius and that i desired his help merely for my husbands sake yes i have wronged you and katinka put out her hand lady jim took it rather softened you poor child how foolish you are why not forget demetrius i cannot he is not worthy of you is he notah you dont know him leah smiled grimly i know him much better than you do however if you insist upon putting him on an imaginary pedestal there is no more to be said have you heard from him lately mademoiselle aksakoff was now quite deceived and looked upon lady jim as her dearest and best friend last week i received a letter from funchal she said eagerly yes i wrote to him about the chances of his pardon are there any chances yes yes i assure youyes i have a cousin high in favour with the czar who can procure an immediate pardon but my father does not wish me to marry demetrius wise man murmured leah and so there is some difficulty ohshe clasped her handsif constantine would only be guided by me he comes of a rich family and has the title of prince so he told me ah but did he say how he had parted from his family because of his advanced ideas he gave up money and rank and all that makes life pleasant to labour among the poor peasants is that not noble so noble that i have difficulty in thinking m demetrius acted so but he didhe did and my father is angered because of this selfsacrifice if constantine would only return to the rank of life in which he was born my father would permit me to marry him and then the pardon would speedily be procured but i plead in vain she murmured with hanging head he will not listen he may when he returns volunteered lady jim kindly but when will that be if he goes to jamaica leah turned suddenly white why to jamaica she asked sharply he wrote that the duke of pentland had asked him to go there to see after your husband and you say that yes yes but this patient garth who katinka looked surprised but have you not heard heard i have heard nothing i do not correspond with m demetrius my dear it is now april and he has been at funchal since january trying to heal that poor man has he no said mademoiselle aksakoff quickly the man is dead garth dead lady jim sat down with a gasp yes so demetrius wrote last week and said he would go on to jamaica at the dukes request to see your husband but you look quite ill i hate to hear of deaths said lady jim viciously she certainly spoke truly with regard to this particular death in her mind lurked a dread lest demetrius had assisted nature after all chapter xv monsieur aksakoff owned a toy villa pleasantly placed amongst orangegroves and lemongardens on the outskirts of fools paradise hither somewhere about the hour of five trooped a gay party of which katinka was not the least merry so unaccountable were her spirits that the majority judged her to be what the scotch aptly call fey lady jim in the minority knew better a recollection of the recent interview explained the girls dancing on a possible grave leah had subjugated one of her own suspicious sex this is a rare miracle rarer still it had been achieved by truthtelling certainly with inevitable female reservation lady jim had not told the whole truth and nothing but the truth but then her knowledge did not include the shibboleth of oathtaking she did not love demetriusno avowal could have been more honest still his medical acquirements had scarcely induced the flirtation which katinka resented and in saying so she swerved from the path of rectitude nevertheless that ingenuous explanation of the illegal apronstring deceived mademoiselle aksakoff into believing that truth had really been dragged unclothed and impeccable from her well the result may be guessed from cold hostility katinka ignorant of the golden mean melted into warm friendship the sadness of unrequited love was replaced by the allurements of hope and the hitherto dreary unpeopled world became an arcadia of magical beauty through which there ever moved a possible bridegroom the colour returned to her wan cheeks the light to her dark eyes and in place of a listless nun the astonished father beheld a dancing laughing nymph clever as aksakoff was he failed to understand the why and the wherefore of this transformation being a diplomatist he searched for the magician who had accomplished its wonders being mere man he naturally espied the obvious the unexpected presence of demetrius as he concluded was responsible for the breathing of life into this statue lady jim guessed his explanation and was amused by his inquiring looks she promised herself the pleasure of making things clear in such a way as would compel confidences on his part these might be useful in averting the wrath of demetrius when he came to know that his reward was withheld and leah was not unreasonable in anticipating trouble of the worst seeing that the doctor had already loaded her with a portion of a debt which she did not intend to pay garth was dead that part of the task had been accomplished now katinka informed her that demetrius was bound for jamaica there he would arrange for the obliteration of jim and return with a substituted corpse to console the afflicted widow the widow herself shivered at the prospect of being honest and tangibly grateful and since the possible was rapidly becoming the probable began to consider means of evasion but it was no easy matter to nullify the bond of a semioriental shylock with a diplomatist superadded to a father for an ally and with tricky muscovite politics to play with lady jim fancied that her end might be obtained but although she knew the goal she could not see the most direct and least dangerous way to gain it her path was perplexing and perilous so it was necessary to find a fingerpost she thought that aksakoff might stand for such since he would do much to neutralise the chance of his daughters marriage with demetrius but to enlist him on her side and in her schemes required a private conference and plainer speaking than lady jim approved of however as there was no opportunity of private speech for at least one hour she had time to construct feasible plans meanwhile her silence over the teacups was remarkable in so lively a lady certainly garth might have died in the orthodox manner as ample time had been given for his exit on the other hand demetrius eager for his reward might havebut no she could not bear to think of such a horror and employed her will to deny the possibility nevertheless strive as she would to banish the thought it returned again and again insistent and terrifying no wonder askew was moved to ask if she felt unwell and no wonder she protested with unnecessary emphasis that she never felt better in her life i am gathering instruction from the conversation of others she assured him when he urged smellingsalts but you are so extraordinarily pale i have parted with my colour to mademoiselle aksakoff see she blooms like an artificial rose why artificial her bloom is natural and her spirits are forced a hothouse is natures corset i dont know what you mean said askew bluntly you are a puzzle which is as much as to say that i am a woman i wish you would cease personalities and refill my glass this sounded more bacchanalian than it was for the glass contained nothing more destructive to the nerves than strawcoloured tea prepared milkless in the russian manner with plenty of sugar and a squeeze of lemon katinka presided over a samovar and dispensed caviare sandwiches so that the meal was entirely muscovite aksakoff stiff and pale and lean precisely dressed and watchful as a cat paid diplomatic compliments to lady richardson while captain lake laughed with katinka miss mulrady had annexed a flattering vicomte who wanted money in exchange for a name which dated from the crusades and askew hovered like the silly moth he was round lady jims superfine wax candle this possible tragedy of singed wings doubly and trebly assured katinka of leahs honesty for who could love the demigod demetrius and trifle with a nautical butterfly thus did she argue crediting her once rival and now ally with the infatuation which in fairyland made titania clip bottom in her arms the air of this place suits you said lake wondering at this bubbling gaiety you were pale and sad when we last met mademoiselle i may be the same when we meet again she replied refilling lady jims glass what would you moods are agreeable hum i dont choose april as the most enjoyable month of the year katinka laughed meaningly and glanced slyly at lady richardson i see you prefer an autumn monthhighly coloured and mature this was too symbolic for lake but some intuition of its meaning caused him to flush to the roots of his fair hair and verbally deny comprehension i do not understand no gallant man would she retorted and further enlightened the captains pink became a violent crimson to the concern of its cause how red you are reggy cried lady richardson i hope it isnt scarlet fever i guess you suffer from that murmured mamie posing her lorgnette platil inquired the bewildered vicomte but received no reply miss mulradys knowledge of french was too limited to permit of pathological discussions russian tea explained lake cooling to his ordinary sunburn why not one wordindigestion indigestion repeated the soldier with dry obedience you should really try billys new medicine it has made him very fit by the way where is my darling lake dodged the quizzical glance of miss mulrady and explained that sir billy had been last seen wrinkling his young brows over the intricacies of trente et quarante couldnt haul him off but i daresay hunger will fetch him to the teatable such devotion argues good luck said leah wondering if billy would arrive with full pockets perhaps lady james most boys are lucky at play and therefore unlucky in love inquired katinka smiling children should know nothing of such things said aksakoff stiffly i guess not cried mamie but sir billy is a freak really miss mulrady frowned the indignant little mother my son is not so eligible for barnums show as you seem to imagine he hasnt got two heads or an elastic skin or any of those things which seem to be so popular in the united states wouldnt make him more interestin if he had hes a moral freak et moi aussi asked the vicomte whose scant knowledge of americanese prevented entire understanding oh you havent got morals of any sort m de marville is the more interesting on that account said leah rousing herself from a two minutes silence a really good young man should be sealed as a bore in a glass case then why is mr askew at large the sailor laughed i fear my past can best answer that question by your tongue well better leave that well alone laughed katinka gaily besides only women have pasts and presents when the men are generous said lady jim i guess men are always generous when theres anythin to be got after meals there is nothing to be got save smoking said the hostess you gentlemen have leave captain lake will you give me a cigarette like many russian ladies mademoiselle aksakoff adored those fatal rolls of tobacco wrapped in coffeecoloured paper and consumed a great quantity lady richardson unlike the average englishwoman smoked likewisethat is she fiddled qualmishly with half a cigarette because it looked smart to do what you shouldnt the gentlemen also offered incense to the very modern goddess nicotine and shortly lady jim was the only person present not committed to this agreeable vice i am behind the times she confessed but please dont look upon me as a prude on the prowl i willingly permit other women to spoil their teeth and ruin their digestions what a nasty speech cried lady richardson offended especially as leah knew it was an effort for her to sin in this way my dear it is but then i feel nasty and look charming whispered askew i wonder how many times a day you repeat yourself she replied impatiently as often as i recall your face i can think then of only one adjective charming and one noun angel what limitations and the necessary verb i love you first person singular as usual after the manner of the male egotist isnt this rather lindleymurray whispering if it was they had no opportunity of continuing it for lady richardson drew leahs attention to the fact that she had lost a fortune in the casino i depend upon you dear for my return fare billy will pay conjectured lady jim calmly i quite expect he has broken the bank not on mr askews system cried mamie you couldnt run an applestall on his lines you would suggest improvements complained askew reproachfully then you admit that they were if fitted properly into the puzzle and at the proper time but its a mistake to swap horses when crossing a stream huh said miss mulrady in her best californian style i guess the animals belonged to you i lost no dollars and with a comfortable sense of her own cuteness she accepted a cigarette from the attentive vicomte this frothy chatter irritated a lady who was inwardly grappling with problems of the near future askew ventured on more spindrift only to be snubbed into seeking the complaisant society of mamie this necessitated a game of general post for katinka slipped in rapid french and boulevard gossip with de marville while lady richardson drew lake once more to her elderly feet remained the diplomatist in splendid isolation and his gaze wandered to lady jim who stared straight before her she was looking into the next world where a reproachful ghost something resembling jim was asking why he had been butchered to make a womans holiday and the living half believing the terrible truth implied gave shuffling answer to the dead demetrius is to blame so vivid was the vision so powerful the thought so guilty the conscience that her tongue actually framed this much aloud before she became aware that her secret was slipping out a hasty glance around assured her that none of the prattlers had overheard but an echo of the name at her elbow testified to monsieur aksakoffs excellent hearing lady jim grew chill what had she said how much had he gathered instinctively facing a possible danger she did not even turn her head or raise her voice but almost in the same breath concluded the sentence differently if he does not cure jim your husband asked the diplomatist politely with admirable skill leah started as though her reflections had been unexpectedly interrupted you there m aksakoff i was thinking of my husbandyes he is trying to get well in jamaica and m demetrius has gone to pull him round i shall certainly blame him if he does not cure jim that is severe madame after all no human being holds the keys of life and death selfcontrolled as she was lady jim shuddered demetrius certainly held the key of death and had used itfor so she began to believein opening for garth a door into the unknown however she utilised the shudder very dexterously dont talk like that it makes me fear lest jim should never get well but after all m demetrius is extraordinarily clever i told your daughter only this afternoon how i had been attracted to him for jims sake and by his knowledge of consumption oh aksakoff looked at her with his pale eyes and very inquiringly it had not occurred to him that the lady was a model wife the medical attainments of m demetrius attracted you naturally my husband is ill i wish him to be cured m demetrius has a european reputation for cure of consumption we have held many conversations on the subject and i feel certain that there is a chance for poor dear jim if m demetrius becomes his medical attendant he is leah assured him the poor creature he was looking after in madeira on behalf of the duke is dead and katinka informed me that m demetrius had sailed for jamaica aksakoff frowned how does my daughter know that lady jim rose to shrug her shoulders and to seize the opportunity thus offered to solve her problem by means of a private conversation a charming place you have here she said glancing round and giving him to understand that the shrug was his answer the air is so balmy you will find it more so without tobacco smoke said the russian throwing away his cigarette and without knowing it was thus skilfully entrapped into a duologue by an ostensibly reluctant woman i am so comfortable here urged leah with feigned hesitation so pleased madame but your sense of the picturesque will make you sacrifice ease for a particularly charming view of the estrelles the proper study of womankind is man misquoted lady jim accepting the invitation but nature comes as a relief at times we see so little of her in society and she glanced at lady richardsons dyed hair and tinted cheeks you are severe madame i shall begin to believe so if you repeat that a third time she replied smiling and glancing sideways at his face this she did to discover if possible his intentions it suddenly occurred to her that the diplomatists insistence meant intrigue on his part he like herself was playing a game and lady jim for the sake of the result wished to overlook his hand had she seen it which she did not the knowledge that people knew more about her domestic affairs than she would have approved of might have shocked her ivan aksakoff was not a tricky russian nor a diplomatist of repute for nothing instructions had reached him several times from headquarters that demetrius was to be watched while in england and if possible decoyed into the territory of a less scrupulous nation for the purpose of arrest a drugged officials feelings had been outraged a muchwanted anarchist had escaped through the connivance of the exile and a paternal government thought that an enforced trip to siberia might cool misplaced friendships for suspected persons several times aksakoff had tried to induce the demetrius opossum to climb down from his tree of refuge but the suspicious beast refused to oblige him therefore all that the diplomatist could do was to keep himself advised of the doctors doings in the hope of luring him to destruction when he was off his guard he had biblical precedent for this hope shimei the son of gera lulled by long security had crossed the forbidden brook kidron so why should not demetrius likewise forgetful cross the channel stealthy inquiry into the doctors affairs had led aksakoff to ask himself why the man dangled at lady jims apronstrings reports poured in fast and thick that the curzon street household was insolvent but these did not help the diplomatist overmuch if lady jim wanted money she would scarcely ask a penniless exile for the cash he did not possess the man was not sufficiently handsome nor so superlatively fascinating that he should gain the love of the most beautiful woman in london and incidentally aksakoff learned that lady jim was a modern lucrece although she did not profess an ardent love for her lord and master therefore as neither mammon nor cupid could explain a friendship which was pretty freely discussed in clubs and drawingrooms aksakoff could not comprehend this particular wile of woman in his endeavour to fathom the meaning he even went so far as to question his daughter knowing that she was as infatuated with demetrius as demetrius was with lady kaimes but katinka either could not or would not explain and for months the diplomatist had been exasperated by the sight of a genuinely platonic friendship for which there seemed to be no reason now he learned from one of the parties to the bond that a husbands sickness and a friends skill were the elements which composed the intimacy such a case in such a light had never before been presented to him and while sauntering by lady jims side to view the estrelles against the sunset he was trying to think if the explanation was genuine to his acute hearing it did not sound even plausible neverthelessand this was aksakoffs reason for seeking the interviewsome use might be made of the woman to entrap the man lady jim was badly in need of ready money and the russian government had at the time full coffers since there was no love in the question this singular lady might for a round sum dispense with the doctors attendance on her husband moreif delicately handled she might induce demetrius to show her the sights of paris it was difficult to hint this without shocking the feelings of a great lady and a spotless woman still if skilfully done and without too much emphasis lady jim might gather that her finances could be put in order without much trouble on her part but aksakoff had another argument which induced him to risk a scene with outraged virtue he loved his daughter and wished her to marry a highly placed cousin who would be of political use to his fatherinlaw unfortunately katinka was infatuatedaksakoff could find no more appropriate wordwith demetrius marriage with a person wanted by the powerful of st petersburg meant a check to the diplomatist and a handle to his many enemies the match was not to be thought of yet if demetrius would only prove kind mademoiselle aksakoff would assuredly become his wife even if she had to achieve the marriage by elopement also katinka might be able to procure the mans pardon and of this aksakoff entirely disapproved even if the doctor was whitewashed he had such socialistic or anarchistic feelingsit mattered not whichthat he would never consent to resume his title or the large income attached to such resumption on the whole both from a fatherly and a domestic point of view aksakoff felt that this marplot would be safer in a siberian mine how to get him there was the problem the solution might come through lady jim if he could only ascertain her feelings towards demetrius and hint that such a lovely woman should not be worried by sordid money affairs it was not improbable that such a satisfactory result would be arrived at it was a forlorn hope but aksakoff dared it it was a straw but he grasped at itand now fully committed to the speculation he was casting about in his mind as to a promising beginning no easy task for aksakoffs spies and aksakoffs experience assured him that lady james kaimes was a prickly plant needing care in the handling so it will be seen that leahs intuition had not deceived her scanty as was the ground for suspicion the closer she examined his face by swift sideglances the more certain she became that he was playing a game andfrom her experience of diplomatistsby no means for love to vary the metaphor she and the russian were about to engage in a duel either with foils or swords lady jim did not care which she was perfectly assured that however dexterous her antagonist might be she could fence quite as well if not better and thus she marched to the duelling ground already a victor chapter xvi silhouetted against a pale purple sky the dark masses of the estrelles floated on a shimmering sea nearer and clearer yet less sharply defined etherealised by amethystine hues and indistinct through the haze of gloaming frowned the grimaldi stronghold its mouldering walls clasping closely packed houses dominated by a lean and soaring campanile over the cactus hedge and between bending palms could be caught a glimpse of the trim unromantic modern town of the sleepy waters of the bay and fishingboats rocking beside spickandspan toy yachts with here and there the picturesque felucca of mediterranean commerce oldfashioned with oars and lateen sails only shelley in radiant verse could have described with any approach to truth this magical dreamland real yet unreal under the changing colours of sunset as at the outset of an earlier and less difficult interview lady jim admired the loveliness of paradise with ostentatious disregard of her embarrassed companion and embarrassed he was to such a degree that she marvelled at his choice of a profession in which emotions count as crimes this judgment was unfair for aksakoff ordinarily commanded his feelings with the severity of a martinet but so great were the stakes for which he proposed to playhis daughters future and his political advancementthat he shifted uneasily from one foot to the other clasped and unclasped his hands and betrayed more of the natural man and anxious father than was consistent with diplomatic reticence having some idea of this mental confusion leah waited for him to make an almost certain mistake of which she intended to take full advantage she was like a cat watching a mousehole ready to pounce at an opportune moment meanwhile she held her tongue which sufficiently assured aksakoff of her dangerous capability he had never before beheld the ominous miracle of a silent woman and his nerves were none the better for this surprising spectacle demetrius madame he finally blundered and recognised the blunder as the words left his mouthdemetrius is your friend the attack was so weak that lady jim contemptuously gave him vantageground katinkas lover also i understand and the czars enemy retorted aksakoff angrily let us have all his qualifications at once madame by all means enemy friend lover well it is very far from well as you know madame i desire no siberian felon for my soninlaw i never knew that m demetrius had been to siberia he will go there yetto his grave what an odd choice of a cemetery said leah shrugging but i assure you m aksakoff that i take no interest in these funeral arrangements no yet report says he was about to blurt out something still more undiplomatic but that lady jims pity for his ineptitude made her intervene i know what it says and of course i deeply sympathise with you madame yes yes i comprehend your feelings it is hard that your own daughter should defy you especially as m demetrius is merely a doctor he is a prince in our country said aksakoff furious that she should take the lead and at a loss how to regain it a felon also i understood you to say let him venture on french soil and i shall certainly make him one snarled aksakoff with unpleasantly glittering eyes lady jim had scratched him rather dexterously and the tartar stood revealed she scratched again even if katinka makes him your soninlaw that shall never be he hesitated then attempted a bearhug i will speak plainly madame about katinka and her infatuation oh certainly aksakoff bit his lip used as he was to verbal fencing leahs handling of her tongue baffled him he took refuge in truthtelling demetrius does not love my daughter he said bluntly how fortunate for you and disagreeable for her he loves ananan actress explained aksakoff wondering if her interest in the man deepened to jealousy apparently it did not that would interest katinka more than it does me she assured him then affecting the innocence of ignorance may i ask why you chronicle small beer demetrius is your intimate friend my husbands medical attendant she corrected quietly if you remove him to that distance i confess to an indiscretion shall we return without admiring the estrelles madame the excuse was obvious for what aksakoff shrugged his shoulders for the clearing up of misunderstandings you are anxiousso you saythat demetrius should cure your husband my reason for this conversation is to apologise for my intention to rob you of his very valuable services if i can trap demetriussay in parislord james must content himself with an inferior doctor leah looked pensive and puzzled i comprehend but why should you make use of the wrong word misunderstanding then when she nodded my ignorance of your language or of my feelings by this talk of parisian traps and siberian punishment you assume that i am acquainted with the private affairs of m demetrius it is possible that i have made that mistake said aksakoff dryly as a diplomatist you should never confess as much it might be that i may take advantage of yourmistake to inform m demetrius of his danger i foresaw that possibility madame as a dutiful wife you naturally wish to keep so clever a doctor in attendance on your husband of course but a trip to siberia would not improve jims health there is no need for the mountain to go to mahomet madame pardon me if in this case i think otherwise aksakoff shrugged again i admit the reason seeing that this particular mountain is married these parables are a trifle wearisome m aksakoff the air is chilly and i wish to return to lady richardson would you mind telling me plainly before we part why you sought this interview assuredly madame my daughter loves this man who does not love her and who by reason of his crime and opinions is not an eligible husband you were with katinka this afternoon as you informed me and she is now so cheerful that i suspect you must have delivered some message from demetrius to so raise her spirits or it might behe looked squarely at her as he added that demetrius is in monte carlo no your daughter had a letter from him in which he stated that he was leaving madeira for jamaica go on please katinka had a letter said aksakoff with an unpleasant look that no doubt accounts for her spirits were you cupids messenger madame lady jim smothered a laugh no though i admit that i should like to see her happy she will never be happy with a man who does not love her demetrius will not come near me and i cannot explain will you oblige me by taking a message why should i for the sake of retaining him as lord jamess medical attendant leah nodded as a wife i will take your message what is it tell demetrius that if he will give katinka to understand that he will never marry her my gratitude will be stronger than my duty in other words you will not arrest him so long as he remains in england where he cant be arrested laughed lady jim well your message shall be duly delivered and i may as well confess since we are committed to plain speaking that m demetrius informed me why he had to leave russia his confidence will render it easier for you to make a treaty between us madame possibly but you will understand that i assume the rle of peacemaker solely on my husbands account madame aksakoff bent and raised her hand to kiss it as a wife you are far above rubies shall we return leah consented without moving she had not yet solved her problem one moment you will give me your word that m demetrius will not be lured to paris i give you my word if the treaty is made and katinka is disabused of her infatuation which forms part of the treaty said leah lightly in the interests of jim ill do my best but should he go to paris he will assuredly leave it for siberia which is much colder and not so amusing then i must advise him to be naturalised in england it will be the act of a friend madame and also you might advise him to beware of this actress oh i cant intrude my advice into his strictly private affairs if you wish your husband to be cured it will be as well to do so aksakoff recommended mademoiselle ninette is not to be trusted ninette i have seen hera very charming artiste but unscrupulous not so much so i hope as to betray the man she loves a woman madam will do much for money how well you know the sex monsieur said lady jim ironically i have had some experience madame and have benefited so little that you cannot manage your daughter without my intervention i confess it let me amend my statement by saying that i have had many experiences and little experience that is a more correct way of putting it said leah gravely for i assure you m aksakoff that if a woman loves a man she certainly will not betray him for money we join issue madame the uranian aphrodite is not the divinity in this case and aphrodite pandemos can be bought how classical and confusing and the price two thousand pounds said aksakoff carelessly you should reckon it in francs seeing that mademoiselle ninette is french otherwise she will not understand the jingle of gold is a universal language madame an agreeable one at all events i wish we had more opportunity of studying it well m aksakoff for jims sake i shall see that m demetrius affords this harpy no opportunity of earning the money and you will pardon my mentioning the harpys name we are a man and woman of the world m aksakoff there is no need to call spades shovels i thank you for considering my husband to lose the skill of m demetrius might result in his death i am happy to have been of service to you madame and of course you can understand my paternal feelings assuredly i shall do my best to make your daughter see reason a woman can talk to a woman of such things you know when she is such a woman as you madame said aksakoff again bending over her hand and now just one hour to catch the train remarked leah with a glance at the tiny watch set in her bracelet in this way leah solved her problem and aksakoff gained his point yet on the face of it their conversation dealt entirely with the saving of demetrius from a siberian prison and katinka and katinkas matrimonial salvation but lady jim knew that if she could lure the doctor to paris she would not longer need to fear a sabine alliance while the diplomatist was satisfied that for two thousand pounds demetrius would be safely transported to siberia leah guessing this let him think that the money tempted her though she wondered how he came to know that she needed cash and was secretly angered that he should dare to offer a bribe but she could not confess her true reason for wishing the exile of demetrius without letting aksakoff know about the plot therefore of the two evils she chose the less but she resolved to take no russian gold this cynical foreigner should learn that a strictly virtuous englishwoman cannot be bought it was commendable in these augurs that they did not wink at one another their reappearance at the teatable was greeted with shrieks of joy from lady richardson whose emotions were invariably noisy leah leah she cried overcome by maternal love and pride billy has won you twelve thousand francs twelve thousand five hundred corrected sir billy who was disposing of tea and cake and sandwiches in a way which argued long abstinence five hundred pounds translated captain lake oh you dear clever boy said lady jim coming rapidly to the table to kiss her catspaw halves of course sir billy shook his head and tried to keep cool for the kiss rather upset his dignity i am more than repaid said he gallantly so i should think murmured askew who would have doubled the amount for a similar attention mamie overheard and recalled a phrase she had never used before but which suited her impersonation of the american girl asshe is not dont put the bananapeel under your own foot sonny what do you mean asked the mystified islander miss mulrady glanced at lady jims back then winked at askew to intimate that she had remarkably good eyesight also that kissing married women led to dc crossexaminations alsobut there was no end to the many meanings of that wink lord burleighs headshake in the critic act ii scene could not have been more eloquent meanwhile applausive adjectives buzzed round billys head he fought his trente et quarante battle oer again between hasty mouthfuls while his mother thanking providence for having bestowed on her such a son murmured ecstatic asides to katinka aksakoff it was the apotheosis of the modern child leah counted her gains placed them safely in one of those wonderful feminine pockets unknown to man then gave a passing thought to the virtuous hengists we must get back dear she warned lady richardson katinka darlingthis was for aksakoffs benefitdo come over and see me we have so much to talk about i shall be delighted replied the girl flushing with joy and really was so the prospect of unlimited conversations on the subject of demigods and their ways with a sympathetic friend allured her towards an hour of happiness what was left of lady jims conscience smote her she felt almost sorry for her dupe but with the premeditated selfdeception of people who rearrange biblical texts for the palliation of pet sins she reflected that a fools paradise for katinka was better than no paradise whatsoever monsieur aksakoff said no more he and lady jim understood one another perfectly and it was useless to add touches to a finished picture with cordial stiffness he sped his guests on their way through the town and the glare of the electrics down to the stationlift mamie and her supple vicomte shook hands midway but askew and captain lake insisted upon seeing the ladies safely into a comfortable compartment billy was disgusted one mans enough to run this show protested billy dont talk american slang rebuked his mother and pelted the men with breathless adieux goodnight reggy so very charming our day mr askew goodnightso very amusing weve had a ripping time and the motherkettle calls my pot black billy breathed to leah she paid no attention askew was trying to extort an invitation to san remo with eloquent eyes and persuasive lips but a recollection of his fourandtwenty hours in the vicinity without calling added to a resentment that he should have experimented with his system in the unauthorised company of a much too attractive girl made her ignore his hints moreover being an exsailor and undiplomatic he would probably prove so affectionately honest that the hengists mightand if the hengists did then adieu grapes the vintage is over julia and her serious spouse would never understand the need of a grasswidow for amusements of this sort while her ulysses wandered they expected her to be a replica of penelope that dull woman who was so fond of speeches and sewing come to curzon street in a fortnight she advised and the train departed leaving him to muse on the ars amatoria as understood in the navy i hope you have enjoyed yourself dear said lady richardson arranging billys tie and kissing billys nose but addressing leah im sure you ought to have this darling has won you pots lady jim nodded rather wearily the cackle of the hen over her chick worried her and she retreated to the most distant corner bored by maternal fussiness this visit had taken her a step farther but it was most annoying that success should make her feel uncomfortable aksakoff misapprehending her reasons as he did would certainly assist her materially but katinkaburrrr why couldnt conscience quit worrying chapter xvii even the skilful find it no easy matter to drive a kicking squealing team the offhorse must be flicked into decorum the near leader soothed the wheelers bearing the heat and burden of the day encouraged into pulling with a will then a deft hand on tugging reins a quick eye for the deviations of the road some knowledge of mouths tender and hard and manifestations of that will which makes of vehicle and quadrupeds a coherent wholethese things must be attributes of the god in the car likewise of the dea ex machina although lady jim was in and not out of the vehicle enthroned with whip and ribbons she drove a team of five and in the odd number lay the difficulty of bringing the car of destiny to the selected stables for by this time rejecting an overruling providence other than the fetish who was a domestic god and biased leah looked upon herself as her own omnipotent and triumphing destiny she would so she decided expunge jim utilise askew and katinka obliterate demetrius and assist muscovite politics through aksakoff this team in harness and rendered obedient by blinkers she controlled with considerable judgment and made singlehearted for her goal that the actual destiny whose rle she affected to play might upset her smoothlyrunning chariot by a judiciously placed and unlookedfor stone she never paused to consider so far as she could see the course was clear to the prizea moneybag which she would seize as a victorious widow of the wrong sort askew was the odd animal of the team the fifth wheel on her chariot though he was less like a horse than a troublesome and overfaithful dog notwithstanding her prohibition he invaded san remo played a most exasperating patience on a monument along the promenade and dodged her angry eyes round convenient streetcorners she could not go abroad but what he turned up in unexpected quarters nor could she remain at home without his appearing to excuse on frivolous pretexts a wholly unnecessary visit luckily the hengists approved of his frank looks and modest manners else she might have been compromised even in easygoing italy such cicisbeism was annoying later lady jim returned to london for that season invented by man and left him to kick his heels in cross isolation but even before the curzon street house could be warmed he rang the bell and presented himself in the character of a martyr for the sake of the future leah kept him in the team but she gave him more of the whip than he liked and alsoironicallya marked almanack limiting his visits but that she had some liking for him and much use she would have bundled him into the arms of the fixture with strict orders to give those same arms a legal right to embrace him for ever but askew himself put an end to that chance of being safely bestowed what will marjory say if you make my house your hotel she asked when he appeared on the fifth day of the week for the eighth time and at afternoon tea too when she with a hard days pleasure behind her was recruiting for the nights fatigue nothing he asserted sulkily and guiltily she has no right to control my actions that depends upon your feelings towards your future wife she is not myi mean we have broken it off what lady jim was frankly exasperated she as a married woman and he as an engaged man could platonise to any extent but he free and she shortly to be a widowwhat then she would no more make him her husband than she would allow demetrius to lead her to the altar and here he was selfishly placing himself in an eligible position for the very matrimony she declined to contemplate marjory and i decided we were not suited he explained but timidly because her eyes flashed she takes half the income and marries that foxhunting ass i am free with the rest of the money he waited for congratulations which never came i thought you would be pleased he blundered and pray why should i be pleased i believedi fanciedyouyou liked me he stuttered growing red tolerablyas an engaged man then youve been playing with me he cried you dont love me did i ever tell you so no but i thought your vanity thought go on oh leah kaimeswhich is my married name askew gasped her amazing impudence reduced him to staring silence she had lured him to her feet with sweet looks and significant smiles and cooing words till he had been deceived into thinking that her passion was as strong and as true as his own now she reminded him that she wasmarried oh he gasped again and lady jim laughed shortly her catnature was enjoying this mouseplay visitors had come and gone and they were alone in the dainty drawingroom with an untidy teatable askew having escorted her home from ranelagh had waited for an hour with stubborn patience for this solitude of two his end had been gained and nowhe looked helplessly round as though seeking for some third person to explain if his charmer were a demon or a woman oh he said once more nearly six said leah consulting her bracelet how long do you intend to stand there saying oh and she mimicked him leah lady james kaimes not even lady jim he said clenching his brown hands oh youyou his voice became inarticulate with sheer anger pray consider that you are in my house she reminded him coldly ill never come here again that is as you choose but i cant live without you how flattering and i wont he came a step nearer the low chair in which she sat but her derisive laugh made him pause leahiilove you his voice broke and he stretched out his arms i saw that ages ago then why did youdid you he stopped and looked at her with imploring eyes i thought you loved me he murmured choking oh you thought said she ironically is it not true have i been deceived no he flung out a beseeching hand dont speaki cannot bear to hear the truth let me golet me go he stumbled towards the door blindly you have broken my heart but ill go awayfar awayto south america andandoh my god he leaned against the wall and covered his face with his hands lady jim might have been in the stalls of a theatre for all the personal feeling she had hitherto shown but his last words brought self uppermost if he went to south america he would certainly see lola fajardo and possibly might come face to face with jim recognition of an admitted corpse would spoil jims game and her own askew for she put herself in his place would certainly make things unpleasant and she did not wish to provide a scandal in high life for circulating extra editions of newspapers during the silly season besides he was really a nice boy and she would miss his good looks and canine attentions both circumstances and inclinations demanded that she should keep him under her eye an explanation came to her while he sobbed at the doorlooking very ridiculous she thoughtand she made use of it to soothe his sorrow and save herself you silly boy she began and the beginning produced an effect she was far from foreseeing silly yes i am silly he admitted between his teeth and flinging back his head to regard her with fierce wet eyes i am silly to have believed in you and in your false affection before she could protest against this languageshe had risen to do sohe hurled himself across the room and gripped her wrists so tightly that she could have screamed with pain you shant treat me in this waydo you hear you shant im not going to be whistled to your feet like a dog and then kicked aside married yes you are married as you were when you whistled but hang your husband and damn your husbandhe has no claim on you other than a legal one mine you are and mine you shall be i tell you leahhe shook her in his angerthat you must leave this man and come with me you mustyou musthe dragged her hands to his breastyou shall harry she gasped his name in sheer surprise yes harrythe fool if you will the man as you shall find howhow dare you because i do dare and i shall dare more if you play football with my heart why couldnt you leave me alone why couldnt you stick to the man whose name you bear dont struggle for you shant be free till i have had my say out you made me love younow i shall make you love me you and your society rubbish and gimcrack rules and polite lies and makebelieve of truth you withahrrr he shook her againyou overcivilised coquette you circeofmanywiles you ruin of honest men do you think that i who am flesh and blood care for your lady and gentleman humbug no no i am a man you a woman and we are one you hearone if not ill put a bullet in your head and another through my own you have fooled many you shant fool me there ha flung her roughly from him now you can ring for your servants to put me to the door with bruised wrists and wideopen eyes leah stood dumfoundered jim at his worst had never been like this if he had been she would have truly loved him at the moment she very nearly loved askew recognising in his outburst that masterful nature which every woman adores and succumbs to in spite of her dexterity in playing with amorous fire it really seemed as though she was burning her fingers on this occasion naturally she enjoyed the experience this reversion to cavelife thrilled her pulses had leah been capable of loving anything with a beard she would have then and there fallen at askews feet and implored him to trample on her but her absolute ignorance of the strongest of passions save selflove snatched the victory inwhat would have been to an ordinary womanthe hour of defeat well she said admiration struggling with anger you are a brute the man still panting from conflicting passions acted strangely and foolishly as men do at crucial moments he smoothed his hair arranged his tie and pulled down his waistcoat not looking at her but into a near mirror yet he saw her astonished face at second hand and smiled grimly i can be a brute said he ominously quiet but you havent seen me at my worst yet good heavens this was undoubtedly a manthe manthe dominating male the genuine lord of creation whose animal honesty can rend the cobweb entanglements of the female sex and does rend them when the bandage of love inopportunely slips defiance would not lure him again to his proper position at her feet and she was half afraid of the might her trickiness had evoked but in womans weakness lies womans strength and delilah pulled down the corners of her mouth to subjugate samson my poor wrists she murmured askew wheeled from the mirror shied and winced but his mouth and eyebrows were still three straight lines my poor wrists reiterated the temptress moving towards her prehistoric man seeyou have bruised them he could see that he had they were under his eyes under his very nose but he threw aside his head with the modern equivalent of a word which a caveman might have used in some such plight adam was weakened into aggressive firmness eve offered a more tempting apple if you really loved metears emphasised the murmur leahdarling he was again in the toils and kissing the bruised skin madly with feverish lips how could i be so cruel he mumbled and slipped to her victorious feet oh oh oh in three distinct keys forgive if you will promise not to leave me she whispered tenderly never never never never a kiss on alternate hands for each word circes magic having evoked the brute she knew thoroughly the sort of animal she had to deal with considering that she had no feeling of love or even pity to create fervour leah acted admirably cooing like a mother over her babe and with a seraphic look she bent above the tame animal less to caress him than to make sure that the halter was round his neck you foolish hotheaded boy do get up and talk sensibly the subjugated obeyed meekly all the fire out of his veins and sat like a whipped schoolboy in a distant chair which she indicated with regal indignation for said leah as if she were announcing an entirely new fact i am a married woman and she slipped behind the teatable to prevent further demonstrations as if i didnt know sighed askew disconsolately then why did you behave so badly you wicked boy because jewellers windows are tempting jewellers windows you look into them and see pretty things you cant buy naturally a fellow wants to smash the glass and i understand the parable but a thief has to reckon with the law and so has a married woman you would not like to see me divorced harry i would like to see you my wife he retorted evasively and stubbornly impossible i am already a wife if i eloped with you what respect could you have for me i should have whatever you liked including you which i dont like and wont give said leah indignantly in you i looked to find a friend and i find nothing but ungoverned passion that would drag the object of his adoration in the mud oh ohout came the inevitable handkerchiefhow i have been deceived by this time the brute with a penitent tail between its legs was beginning to believe itself entirely in the wrong lady jim seeing this became more than ever a tender woman i forgive you she declared plaintively from behind a handkerchief mopping dry eyes this scene will be as though it had never been but my feelings rebelled the caveman sulkily will always be those of sacred friendship for a muchtried woman how can they be when when you have made such a fool of yourself ah my poor harry forget your folly remember only that i forgive you i dont exactly mean that grumbled poor harry scenting sophistry but unable to prevent the war being carried into his camp youwellyou see oh hang it leah you know that i love you not with that true love which is at once tender and respectful these sentiments were really noble but somehow the bewildered man was not in the mood for copybook philosophy you offer me a stone and call it a beautiful loaf said he bitterly and with heat another parable how biblical you are becoming said lady jim desperately weary and with her eye on the clock i do not understand nor do you my poor boy i understand that you have made a fool of me he snapped brusquely oh no nature has been beforehand there she retorted beginning to lose her temper with a man who would explain dont be silly harry go home and think of our future our future he leaped to his feet with a shining face leah regretted the misused pronoun and began to anticipate renewed melodrama but her little tin god pitying a votary whose nerves were jangled by stupid honesty sent a seasonable visitor his grace the duke of pentland announced a grandiloquent footman flinging wide the door dont look so disgusted leah flung an angry whisper in askews lowering face as she sailed forward to meet her fatherinlaw how are you duke this is a surprisea delightful one of course i never expected so pleasant a visitor the room was tolerably dim and the duke had not the keen sight of his youth mrmr hesitated his grace mr askew chimed in lady jim glad that the mask of twilight was on the younger mans very cross face hes just going you know mr askew of course duke i met him at firmingham must you really go mr askew so sorry we may meet at lady quains tonighti look in there for half an hour goodbye for the present so kind of you to see me home from ranelagh very dull wasnt it and rattling on to drown any too tender word he might let slip she hustled him to the door our future breathed the inconvenient third opening the gate of paradise most reluctantly even the brutes have instincts if not sense snapped lady jim scathingly and adam without eve took his solitary way down the stairs to be dismissed into a cheerless world by an indifferent footman to prevent interruption leah closed the door herself and switched on the electrics before she returned to her untimely visitor will you be long duke she asked again consulting the clock i have to dress for dinner mrs martins you know a stupid woman with a bad cook such a bore i wonder you care to see people when jims away said pentland fretfully and she noted suddenly his aged looks lady jim felt inclined to retort with the proverb of the absent cat and the jubilant mice but she really felt sorry for the old mans drooping mouth and additional wrinkles i wont see any one if you like dukeim sure its no pleasure to make conversation without ideas do let me ring for hot teayou look so tired sit down in this chairand the cushionthere she made him comfortable with genuine womanly sympathy wondering meanwhile what was ageing him no tea my dear i can only wait for a few minutes my carriage is below tired yes i am very tired worried also nothing wrong i hope murmured leah sympathetically jim my dearpoor jim have you heard about his health lately oh yes last week i received a few lines and he said that he felt ever so much better his cough is almost gone ah said pentland sadly like all consumptives he is too hopeful leah became nervous and anxious had jim been obliterated at last what is it she demanded irritably is heis he her tongue could not form the lying word worseyes much worse said the duke rubbing his forehead and producing a letter this is from demetrius we may expectoh my poor son and he almost broke down i dont trust these doctors remarked lady jim skimming the letter with a feeling that demetrius was really too imaginative they always shout wolf when the animal is miles away dont worry but you see demetrius says that poor jim may go off at any momentand demetrius is a clever man he may be mistaken i have heard of surprising recoveries pentland shook his head and groaned not jim i had a conviction that i should never see him again when we parted in this very room its absurd argued leah artfully jim was quite well till he caught that stupid cold at firmingham why should he go off suddenly what they call galloping consumption is i cant believe it nothing would surprise me more than to hear of jims death and she soothed her conscience with the reflection that this speech was perfectly true considering jim had the strength of a bull and the appetite of a shark if i lose him you wont lose him ill send a cable to demetrius and if jim is really so sick ill go out and nurse him pentlands face lighted up and he pressed her hand how good of you my dear it will ease my mind but he hesitatedi never thought you cared enough about jim to inconvenience yourself jim has given me very little reason to care for him said leah with some bitterness if he had been a better husband i should have been a different woman she used the stale argument tactfully and regretfully yeserim afraid thats true said the duke recalling his sons peccability but he is so ill forgive and forget leah for your sake if not for jims she said gracefully ill send the cable this very night and she did when pentland overflowing with outspoken approbation of her correct conduct took his leave she went to her desk and hunted out a cypher with which demetrius had supplied her it would not do to let the postal authorities know of their schemes and the cypher was a particularly intricate one leah spent an hour in concocting her cablegram and was late for dinner in consequence but she had a good appetite all the same in spite of the bad food and the dull conversation for on their way to kingston jamaica were a few lines in cypher a translation of which would have been of great interest to the fatherinlaw who thought her so womanly and good duke wants me to nurse jim ran the cypher when demetrius used the key wire that there is no need if jim had really been dying she would not have altered a single word chapter xviii an urchin throws a stone into the horsepond circles form not only in the still water but in the fluent air to enring invisibly our sphere and who can say to what limit they recede if limit there be so with a carelessly selected hastily flung word had lady jim said your future askew assuming no coupling would have grumbled himself back into tamecatism and canine contentment with casual headpats but our future the pronoun bulked portentous its three letters encompassed to the lovers prolific imaginationdivorce remarriage a lifelong duet and amorous communings in the highest paradise attainable by those yet moving in time lady jim less philological gave him to understand that a single word could by no means embrace such various interpretations she again emphasised her matronhood called askews attention to the spotless reputation he wished to smirch and intimated that poor jims illness precluded her from thinking of anything save poor jims possible decease in which sad case mourned leah we could renew our conversation without reproach a widow has no bridesmaids i believe hinted askew reflectively she hinted back with sweet smiles dont you prefer a quiet wedding and on this adjustment of the situation he built castles believing the foundation to be sound strangely enough in so honest a gentleman the heartlessness of utilising possibilities connected with the kaimes vault never occurred to him which proved without need of words the essential selfishness of the feeling he miscalled love on this arrangement lady jim frolicked gaily through the remaining weeks of the season well content that things were as they were a jamaica cablegram whichit designedly not being in cyphershe could and did show to the duke informed both that a wifely nurse was needless the last word of the communication promised a letter which duly arrived this last also was a public document demetrius being too cunning to detail criminality in black and white pentland and leah read the letter cheek by jowl lord james was a trifle better said the script and if able to outlast the voyage would return to england en route for algiers lady james could then nurse him into health say at biskra thank heaven quavered the duke not reading between the lines as did his betterinformed daughterinlaw well make a party and go there for the autumn frith will be delighted on jims account inquired leah dryly rather an effort duke on my account rebuked the old man frith knows that if jim is to leave ushis voice faltered and felli should like to see him depart why does the prodigal son always banquet on the calf mused lady jim restoring the letter to her pocket my dear many failings require many excuses so it seems selfish people receive more praise for one creditable action than do those kindhearted fools who spend their lives in selfdenial we must encourage the good seed to grow my dear she laughed unpleasantly it usually springs up wild oats with overattention and she departed to consider the inexplicable growth of green baytrees lord frith had never given his father the slightest trouble he was a model son an admirable husband his friendships were staunch and his life cleanyet pentland contented himself with perfunctory praise of these qualities he expected his eldest son to be a domestic bayard as the unimaginative marquis had shown no desire to sow the wind jim on the other hand left the reaping of his whirlwind to doting relatives devourer of husks with congenial swine and caring only for his large healthy greedy self he had never done a kind act or shown a filial trait a spendthrift a rogue in grain cursed by many men blessed by no woman hethis profligate egotistwas dealt with not only tenderly but in a way calculated to assure him that he was a pearl without price his notorious failings were covered by the phrase that he was his own worst enemy and the presumed possession of good qualities never manifested entitled him to paternal pity leah an easygoing sinner herself was not hard on those who dwelt in glass houses but this gilding of jims base metal made her gorge rise whats the use of being good she moralised as her brougham sped towards curzon street kindness is looked upon as weakness and the more generous one is the more those who dont know the meaning of the word sponge and sneer if you are really bad sham philanthropists reclaim you and cocker you up and praise you loudly if you say hang instead of damn a sinner repents and heaven is aflutter a saint makes one slip and the world yells hypocrite a pied person neither white nor black is left alone as the majority are of that mottled complexion to be really good is to be hated to be extremely bad means excuses help and trumpetings frith gets the kicks without deserving them and jim the halfpence he has never earned clever jim who has chosen the worlds better part it will be seen that leah being of the world judged as the world and yet with greater discernment in one way she was right it is generally your sinner who gobbles up the cakes and ale but lady jimno very ardent bible studentmisread texts or rather read her own material meaning into them therefore although conversant with green baytreesdid she not dwell in a grove of suchher memory did not recall the axe that might be laid to the roots thereof the seventythird psalm might also have assisted her to a better understanding of undeserved worldly prosperity had she done other than gabble it hastily when it happened to come into the service but the fetish which stood to her in place of the living god did not encourage spiritual explorations and leah saw life as a comprehensible stretch of time limited by birth or death the hereafterif anyshe could not conceive knowing only the present as the real the actual and the true therefore did she grudge jim his undeserved coddlings had he lain on a bed of his own making it would have been justicestrict justice but that fools should prepare him a feather mattress and downy pillow seemed and really was intolerable thinking of the dukes wasted and misplaced affection leah plucked the fruit of her tree of knowledge good people need missionaries said lady jim however as jim and she had occupied separate rooms for many a long day his featherbedism troubled her little also askew had been brought to heel by the promise of future bones the plot was being rounded off in far jamaica without her aid and what with sir billys winnings and a moderate cheque cajoled out of the duke she had enough to keep the wolf from the curzon street door on the whole things could not be improved and it only remained to exercise patience but of this virtue leah possessed little and did not care to expend what she had in twiddling her thumbs at home jim was away so she could playand did a masked ball at covent garden amused her immensely the plays condemned by sir billy found in her a lenient critic and now that pentland had paid off old bills she ran up new ones with the zest of a woman who required nothing also she went to epsom and pulled off a decent sum on a tip breathed into her ear by the racing baronet whom she had snubbed into slangy admiration to hurlingham and richmond she raced a splitnew motorcar of the latest pattern and exhibited her nerve and skill in the park charity bazaars savoy dinners bridge parties sunday river excursions and suchlike timekillers beheld her in varied and tasteful frocks and she also dined with those friends upon whose cook she could rely altogether she enjoyed the life of a busy idler and had that remarkably agreeable time which magnificent health comparative wealth and a conscience of no importance would give to such a woman but her head duly governed her frivolities and she made no plans for the cowes week although she knew a manageable man with a delightful yacht the daily expected decease of jim had to be considered and thoughtful leah had already designed her mourning meanwhile she babbled of biskra to lady canvey and rather overdid it are you and jim going on a second honeymoon inquired that suspicious old dame we are replied leah calmly how clever of you to guess it humph the poor wretch must be worse than i thought i see my affection to your mind is too obvious the nonexistent can never manifest itself said lady canvey in scientific english either a miracle has happened to give you a heart or jim is dying and you are getting ready to dance on his grave leah coloured with suppressed anger this plain speaking annoyed her and she disliked people who peeped behind the scenes jim and i are not angels godmother she said with dignity but were pals enough to make me regret his death my mourning though you may doubt it will be perfectly sincere lady canvey gave a dry laugh see carlyle on the philosophy of clothes well i shant pay your bill at jays thanks i dont ask you to the total might involve a larger cheque than you would care to sign im sure of that my dear seeing your mourning is to be perfectly sincere the impracticable old woman and her goddaughter were alone else this snapping might not have occurred leah had rather neglected lady canvey of late because that astute octogenarian had locked up her chequebook but on her way to an at home she had looked in for a few moments and sat in the stuffy victorian room radiant in a crpe ninon frock of parma violet elaborately flounced and with a fichu and short sleeves the dress was simple enough and she wore little jewellery but her dazzling neck and shoulders and arms her glorious hair and calm strong face would have made her noticeable even in a crowd of picked beauties lady canvey whose illhumour was mostly surfacecrabbedness for she preferred losing a friend to withholding an epigram could not refrain from grudging compliments but between women these rang hollow you look charming tonight my dear after the storm the sunshine said lady jim smiling at such novel civility well i appreciate the change whatever my faults may be godmother you cannot say that i am disagreeable i always call in spite of youryourwhat shall we say hometruths and you call when it suits you humph perhaps i am a trifle shorttempered a trifle old age has its privileges lady canvey reminded her and you can be so cleverly nasty when you like that it amuses me to bring the worst out of you what a doubtful compliment do you extract amusement from the tallentire girl in the same way she has no bad in her quite so and you never try to bring out the good which does not amuse you sunday schools are beneficial rather than entertaining i dont see misswhats her name and lady jim glanced round the room joan tallentire snapped her hostess you remember the name well enough its fashionable to have a short memory i suppose for debts said leah sweetly but miss tallentire she is looking after her fathers house as the mother is ill poor woman i hope lionel is not preaching at her to make her worse lionel isnt always in the pulpit by the way leah he told me that he had a serious talk with you at firmingham did he yes i believe he did give me a dull quarter of an hour something about sin i fancy it was parsons have a monomania on that subject lady canvey made an angry noise in her wrinkled throat youre impossible she pronounced tartly lionel wishes to improve you what about jim charity should commence with his own family well my dear lionel admires you and oh he is a man then i dont think i ever made running with a clergyman it might be rather fun i suppose lionel would recite the song of solomon to metheres lots of lovetalk in it not very proper talk either im told perhaps solomon wrote it for married women he had some experience of them hadnt he he collected concubines didnt hejust like a stampmaniac leah youre insufferable and impossible she rose to go and arranged the furlined medici collar of her evening wrap in the dim mirror but im about to be punished for my sins the duke made me promise to go to this at home mrs saracen you knowshes one of the submerged upper ten or she married one of them i forget which though i know she has something to do with a pickle or a sauce very amusing old thing too she gives you a nutshell biography of every one before she introduces what on earth for oh so that you may be warned against peoples skeletons mrs saracen points out the cupboard and tells you not to open it and of course you do lady canvey chuckled rather clever and her friends male and female i believe she collects people who have done something in the criminal way she would if the law allowed them out of gaol but at present she contents herself with freaks i dont go to middleclass menageries as a rule but at the dukes request i patronise this one come tomorrow and tell me all about it if youll promise to be nice her godmother was silent for a moment leah my dear she said at length taking the gloved hand i am sorry we always quarrel when we meet i really have a corner in my heart for you and if you were only lessless lady canvey hunted for the right wordless exasperating we should get on excellently lady jim nodded squeezed the bony hands and kissed the wrinkled cheek let us make a fresh start she said gently for she really felt sorry ill come every day while miss tallentire is absent and tell you the news thats a good girl goodnight enjoy yourself my dear and the two parted better friends than they had been for months on her way to mrs saracen who lived in the wilds of kensington leah saw herself in the new character of drynurse to a spiteful old harridan and wondered at her goodnature why should she bore herself with a spent octogenarian whose sole attraction was the possession of money with which she declined to part yet lady jim had promised daily visits to this ruin and what is more for no reason discoverable to herself intended to keep her promise even though there was nothing to be gained by such selfdenial the idea that she of all people should do something for nothing tickled her greatly and the streetlamps swinging past the brougham flashed on an amused face she was so pleased with discovering virtue in such an unexpected quarter that she quite forgot to look mournful when her hostess inquired after jims health the waist upon which the honourable mrs saracen had prided herself somewhere about the middle of the nineteenth century was now a matter of guesswork her stoutness impressed even the unobservant with the conviction that she had eaten her way through life and was at present engaged in digging a notfaroff grave with her teeth and for her age she had an astonishingly good set obtrusively genuine her general appearance was in keeping for she wore her own white hair in smooth bands under a waterloo turban fearfully and wonderfully made and presented a natural face of winterapple rosiness scored with goodhumoured wrinkles as nature had made her and time had aged her so she was growing old healthily if not gracefully in an alarming dress manycoloured as josephs coat she wheezed like a plethoric poodle and rolled in a nautical manner by reason of her bulk who would have guessed at a brain hidden in this ponderous mass of adipose yet she was a selfmade woman who had acquired a large fortune by the sale of saracens sauce therefore did current gossip accuse her of beginning life as a cook a perfect invention this as she was a gentlewoman who had intellectually married beneath herthat is she had bought with the sauce money a scampish aristocrat of the jim kaimes type only less manly he had long since drank himself into the family vault and had left his wife with one son who was now in the army every one liked mrs saracen in spite of her eccentricities and love of glaring colours and many a society pauper had reason to thank her for timely help and to cap her good qualities she professed open pride in the sauce which appeared on every middleclass dinnertable throughout the three kingdoms dear lady james she wheezed wagging two fat hands like a seal its flappers how good of you to come you will find some interesting people hereshe looked round with pride at the collection of lions old and young tame and wild fat and lean sham and real now mr wallace herelet me present him charming manvery outspokengreat travellerzambesiknows cannibals intimately then behind a plump hand whispered a nutshell biography dont mention his wifedivorce thus warned leah got on excellently with the lean brown keeneyed man who confessed to extensive explorations cannibalsyes lady james i know a few and love them what strange affection mr wallace why they ate a man i detested i fear he disagreed with them in death as he always disagreed with me in life lady jim laughed is there any one here you would like to make a sidedish of she asked letting her eyes rove no i am a complete stranger in london it is the one place i have not explored but mrs saracen has told me the past of many here and i can give you histories if you like go on then only dont give me dates else the women here might scratch i dont know these creatures myself she went on with the calm insolence of a great lady to me they are like your central african natives i agree lady jamesonly less civilised in what way niggers wear no clothes and therefore are more modest i can quite imagine it that thin lady over there is evidently of your opinion and leah glanced at a mature damsel who wore just sufficient clothing to prevent interference by the police miss fastine shes a naturopath and is trying to revert to primitive simplicity with such a figure she might stop short of the garden of eden said lady jim dryly i never heard of a naturopath what is it an american sect which needs solitude to carry out its theories the members sleep in the open cover themselves with earth when they feel sick and advocate the altogether you are joking mr wallace the traveller stifled a laugh upon my word lady james i am in earnest the sect really does exist that stout man talking to mrs saracen belongs to another queer lot calls himself an osteopath what on earth is that one who cures by vitalising the nerves i am as wise as i was before any more freaks yonder is a christian scientist and the man on the left advocates mahomedanism as the state religion in england while the dressmakers charge so ruinously hell never induce men to take four wives and the woman in the red dress lady tanseya believer in spirits so i should imagine said lady jim surveying the ladys nose which was long and thin and the hue of her gown no no i talk of heavenly spirits lady tansey has a large circle of departed friends who rap what a bore as if one didnt get enough of friends in this world without worrying them to knock out bad grammar from the next really mr wallace i begin to think mrs saracen must keep a lunatic asylum oh dear no he answered chuckling it is the sane people that are usually shut up certainly not the disagreeable people retorted lady jim oh if you go to those lengths there would be no society said wallace with a shrug the travellers cynicism exactly suited leahs humour at the moment and she made him take her in to supper meanwhile askew who had not seen lady jim arrive was watching the grand entrance with a lowering face he had called at curzon street and thence had borne a message for leah which he was anxious to deliver already he had been bored to distraction with faddists and their whims and was seriously thinking of slipping away when mrs saracen bore down on him for the fourth time before he could object she had him by the arm and confronted him with a severelooking woman pensive and solitary do let me introduce you to miss galway she wheezed youll get on so well with mr askew dear miss galway hes navy you know or has beenleft itgoing to be married and mr askew if you can talk of phoenician inscriptions to miss galway shell entertain you for hours quite an authority on solomon i believevery clever most intellectual then aside hastily say nothing about her brotherjail poor askew miss galway proved to be a limpet and held on to him desperately not because he was handsome but for the sake of the two ears he possessed into which she could pour her archological triumphs she prosed in a manly voice about hiram of tyre and the building of solomons temple and the probability that its design was copied from the shrine of moloch and the remains that zerubbabel must have found after the babylonian captivity until his poor head buzzed like a sawmill in the hope of stopping this endless trickle of nothings he cajoled her to the supperroom there at a small table wellcovered lady jim ate and drank and chatted lightheartedly with a sharpeyed sundried mummy she nodded a how dy do to her sailor and smilingly observed his entanglement luckily for the preservation of askews temper a rival archologist arrived to discuss hittite grammar and he managed to slip away while the male and female dryasdusts wrangled over the probable origin of the perizzites you havent been near me all the evening complained leah when wallace received his cong and askew sat in the seat of the scornful didnt see you arrive worse luck if youd been dosed with hivites and jebusites and all that truck as ive been youd have a headache too its unusual for you to have a headache and inevitable for me to have a heartache on account of that alphabet woman i suppose why dont you feed no appetite but if youll come along to the cecil certainly not weve been there much too often of late people will talk let them what does it matter everything matters when people have tongues and eyes and envious natures dont be silly i promised the duke to stop here for half an hour and after all its amusing i never knew such people existed outside punch wellwhat now this because with sudden recollection of an oversight he brought out an envelope this was waiting at curzon street he explained handing it across and the butler thinking it might be important asked me to why whats the matter leah it was his turn to inquire for reading while he talked she had suddenly whitened dont call me leah she snapped with the irritation of a shaken woman then reread the cablegram again and again what is itwhat is it my husband isdead she crushed the paper into a ball rose to go and dropped back overwhelmingly faint oh she moaned faintly for once in her life of shams and sneering and playing with otherworld fires she was moved to genuine emotion chapter xix leahs emotionas she feltwas almost cruelly genuine it bore the trademark of sincerity it made her heart hammer furiously against her ribs and drove the blood from her cheeks yet she knew that jim still lived that the lying cablegram was but a necessary card to play for the winning of large stakes for once the expected had happenedthat was all why then should she exhibit emotions which could not possibly have been caused by the excuse offered to the public her heart replied with brutal directness that she had crossed the old bailey rubicon and was actually participating in a crime the last word shook her out of cottonwool wrappings into a naked world up to the receipt of the cablegram she could have drawn back now fully committed to the adventure she was compelled to tread a perilous path a criminal yes she had been one in intention which mattered little she was now criminal in fact and that meant punishment her imagination conjured up visions of the possible the judge spoke the prison gaped the bolts shot home curzon street was exchanged for wormwood scrubbs ugh but after all such queasy thoughts were unnecessary if she had broken the eighth commandment she fully intended to keep the eleventh and unwritten one thou shalt not be found out the truth to mrs saracen excusing a hasty departure served to circulate the fiction of jims death which the widow wished to be speedily and widely known she could not have selected a bell with a better clapper promulgated by the sauce queen the sad invention shortly became towntalk and disseminated by myriad tongues ran like a prairie fire throughout society with a capital letter a more weighty bag on the postmans back resulted and commiserating platitudes showered on leah as thick as the overquoted leaves of vallombrosa she glanced through many replied to a few and burnedvery wiselythe majority betweenwhiles her attention was given to parcels from jays and considerations of widows caps and the recognition that the feminine uniform of woe clothed with marked distinction a really beautiful mourner to women grief has its consolations in crape millinery seclusion was necessary in those days of lamentation but none the less wearisome to play the nun while people scattered to cowes and the continent chafed the chameleon woman some intimate sympathisers she received and to these she matched mournful words with a mournful countenance with the blinds half down and sal volatile at hand in a becoming gown and using a handkerchief three inches blackbordered to redden the driest of eyes lady jim held funereal receptions and spoke in low tones of her late husbands hitherto unknown good qualities his palpable evils she cloaked with the hisownworstenemy phrase and mentioned twice that if not an angel he at least had been a man the visitor addressed made her exit expressing hopes that lord james was an angel now and the door closed in time to prevent her seeing leahs enjoyment of the picture thus cashed on her amused mind jim an angel murmured the widow wiping away real tears hed bet on his flying with the duke she played her comedy of sorrow very prettily pentland and frith arrived in haste while the marchioness hurried on beforehand to prepare leah for the interview but she was already wordperfect in her part aware that lord frith would discredit ostentatious grief she assumed the position of a shocked rather than a brokenhearted widow though she said nothing but what might have been inscribed on jims tombstone not a crocodile tear did she shed under friths tooobservant eyes but sat near the duke holding his gouty lean hand and skilfully impressed the trio with the belief that she and the deceased had not been so far asunder as was supposedthe corollary of such impression being that she honestly regretted jims untimely demise no more could be expected even from the most forgiving woman and no more was demanded by the ducal family after these preliminary condolences pentland suggested that leah should come to firmingham for the funeral it was necessary to agree to this and she did with graceful readiness only intimating that she would remain in town until the remains arrived at southampton even as she made the stipulation she wondered how demetrius had contrived to transfer garths body from madeira to jamaica for the deception i thought poor jim would have been buried where he died she remarked tentatively the duke was shocked certainly not jim poor fellow must rest with his ancestors we must look upon his face for the last time leah plucked nervously at her black gown and wondered if the russian was wise in submitting a substituted corpse to family scrutiny they say that death changes people she ventured uneasily and of course embalming just what i said to bunny interrupted lady frith in too vivacious a tone for the occasion we shall hardly know jim with the soul out of him mydearhilda well bunny you know souls arent buried they go to a better world as jims has gone mourned the doting father frith looked doubtfully at his sisterinlaw the less said about jims destination the better therefore did he crush sentiment with dry business i expect demetrius will arrive with the remains about the end of the month said he in the hardest of voices after the funeral we can see about the will it leaves everything to leah his father informed him indeed and what had jim to leave behind him besides his character the insurance money ohahyes jarvey peels present twenty thousand poundseh and accumulations supplemented lady jim but need we talk of such things now and she sighed the conversation back to sentiment quite soquite so quavered the duke shaking his head terrible loss to you my dearand your natural grief andhumhum further fossilised phrases escaped his memory i certainly feel for poor jim said leah with sedate dignity he had his faults of course but then so have i your kind remembrance of jim excuses the few you possess was pentlands reply while frith compressing his thin lips made no remark indeed there was no chance for hilda clamoured that leah should come to her house for beeftea and consolation she had never agreed with her more sceptical husband about the curzon street menage and credited lady jim with the requisite virtues of a genuine widow your strength must be kept up dear she babbled as though she expected leah to faint then and there i know exactly how you feel just as i should if bunny became an angel but we must all die dear leah and death is the gate of life and cant you leave these proverbial condolences to lionel broke in her exasperated husband oh bunnywith a wailthe sacred dead let the child talk commanded pentland she expresses my feelings thus encouraged the child did talk and lady jim listened with a bent head to original remarks about time the great consoler and meetings on a golden shore to part no more and keeping the loved memory green and bowing to the inevitable and suchlike official utterances without which no funeral is complete when hilda stopped for want of breath and memory leah kissed her with the affection of one deeply moved and observed that she was tired and indeed she wasbored to death in fact so the marchioness pleased with her plagiarised eloquence took leave tactfully and tearfully on the dukes arm frith lingered why dont you laugh he said dryly at hilda in the pulpit why should i she means well huh i allude to your demure listening i do not wish to speak ill of the dead and after all jim was my brother but are you really and truly sorry in a way if you will press for an answer one cant live five years with a man without missing him at the breakfasttable hum though you and i pretend otherwise to console my father we know that jim was no saint am i she asked shrugging politeness forbids my answering that question i dont see what politeness has to do with this interview have you remained to make yourself disagreeable on my honour no youre a clever woman leah and as a scamps wife you have conducted yourself admirably as i am now the scamps widow had that not better have been left unsaid frith shrugged in his turn i suppose so since we have agreed to call black white but i waited to say that ill help you in any way you wish leah was surprised and touched she and frith had never been good friends apparently he was not such a bad sort after all but what was behind this offer her ineradicable suspicion of human nature made her doubt though she spared him the question it is very good of you said she cordially but with the insurance money and this house which your father says i can retain i shall do very well there is no need for you to open your purse or your heart the marquis hunched his shoulders and let them drop hum he repeated biting his forefinger you will be marrying again what has that to do with you she flashed out haughtily well you bear our family name he reminded her and demetrius lady jim felt qualmish demetrius she echoed faintly what could frith possibly have to say about the prime mover in the plot the man is crazy about you said he frowning i cant help lunatics being at large said leah reassured as to his meaning and at once on the defensive have i encouraged him he hastened to protest oh no as i said before your conduct as jims wife has been admirabletruly admirable but i should not like to see you marry demetrius why should you think me willing to do so i dont since the man is a foreigner and poor and untitled he can be a prince and wealthy if he chooses to be reconciled with the russian authorities even then leah do you really like this man as a clever doctor and an amusing talkeryes well frith baffled and perplexed bit his finger again he is devoted to you they talk of it at the clubs no no hurriedly as she turned crimson with indignation theres not a word said against you but this absurd infatuationand you a widow these foreigners go to ridiculous lengths so you see i certainly do not see interrupted leah with conviction did you offer assistance so that you might meddle oh no no protested the marquis looking shocked but you have behaved so well as jims wife that is the third time you have said so and i am by no means stupid it seems to me she looked straight at him that you believe m demetrius will ask me to marry him yes i do think so will it ease your mind if i say that i have no intention of accepting any impertinent proposal he may make it will and it does said frith bluntly i should not like to see you throw yourself away on that man should you marry again it will be entirely my own affair of course of course all the same quite so goodday lord frith he smiled grimly seeing that she would not permit him to finish a single sentence am i to take your use of my title as an intimation that we are to be strangers to the extent of supervision yes but you cant manage things unaided that also is my business as your interference is concerned with m demetrius and i have set your mind at rest on that point there is no more to be said as you please still this demetrius oh demetrius she echoed enraged by this parrot repetition i never wish to hear his name or set eyes on his face again this was true enough now that the russian had served her turn he could go hang she had no further use for him and he could whistle for his wellearned wages when frith after further interrupted expostulations took his leave lady jim sat down chin on hand to consider this towntalk the lovesick babbling of demetrius troubled her little no scandal could attach to a diana who never hunted the noble quarry man and leah was such a known lover of herself that even scandal refrained from giving her a rival still the russian was pertinacious and could be vindictive he had fulfilled her bidding for a certain price and that price he would assuredly demand make him her second husband she would not he belonged to katinka who could keep him and welcome the remembrance of the daughter suggested the useful father aksakoff unfettered by honourable prejudices certainly could help her for the attaining of his own ends if demetrius became troublesome could she lure him to paris his disappearance from her life would only be a question of days perhaps hours but for the moment she did not see how to export her accomplice to siberia via the gay city without becoming a more active agent than was wise one russian had herthere was no blinking the factunder his thumb and to remove that pressure in the only way in which it could be removed meant the substitution of a similar thumb she would merely jump from the fryingpan into the fireboth equally uncomfortable on this account and lest she should exchange king log for king stork leah hesitated to enlist aksakoff s assistance luckily there was no need to come to an immediate decision she had three weeks at least to consider the matter the funeral the procuring of the insurance money natural grief for the tricking of the world and the regulation period of mourningshe could oppose these obstacles should demetrius press his suit unduly hard this being so she flung off the burden for the time being although the necessity of settling the matter sooner or later haunted her thoughts such insistence of the disagreeable broke up her rest and she would waken at dawn to plot escape chloral occasionally aided her to sleep the difficulty out of her head but she detested drugs that demand extortionate repayment for their kindness and used narcotic discreetly a week of these haggard hauntings aged her anxiety became apparent in hollow eyes and colourless cheeks one day with outspoken horror she discovered an entirely new wrinkle and noted later that the unexpected opening of a door caused her nerves to jump kind friends ascribed such things to commendable sorrow for the dead and leah tacitly accepted their comforting and petting on this obvious plea but not to regret a thousand jims would she have risked her beauty as after her tonguefor leah put brains before looksit was her keenestedged weapon with which to fight the world and was supremely powerful to control fools daily the stream of sympathising friends rolled through the dainty drawingroom and bore lady jim away from comedy grief to more pleasant shores where gossip of he and she and the tertium quid interspersed with millinery discussions and shrewd female handling of current society events made things more tolerable lady richardson babbled herself in with a box of chocolate from sir billya consolation not unpalatable to leah who liked billy and loved sweets both being acquired tastes said lady jim but not to the little mother so thoughtful of him isnt it chattered lady richardson who was coloured in subdued tints with a gown to match for the visit the dear boy he said to me that we must prevent you from breaking your heart and prescribes eating said leah humorously i never knew sir billy was so young thank him for me fanny and tell him that when i think of taking a second ill give him a look in oh billy has thought of that alreadysuch a boy as he is youre sure to have a badly spelt proposal from him dear but seriously speaking will youoh of course you will why should iyou have not my heart is buried in the grave of billys father murmured lady richardson pensively dig it up again well theres reggy lake of course but hes so poor all the more reason that he should propose you have a good jointure settled entirely on myself said the little woman shrewdly then added romantically i must be loved for myself alone oh lady jim shrugged if you expect miracles really leah her visitor became pinker than her rouge i mean that men are selfish dear they always have their eye on the cashbox you know i hope that wont be your fate darling was the spiteful reply for lady richardson always scratched back oh my face is my fortune fanny jim poor dear spendthrift has left me with only a few thousands which wont last long i should think not in your hands dear but there is mr askew and dr demetriusboth admire you admiration does not necessarily mean marriage and at present i think more of my loss than of a second husband so sweet of you and so proper but you might take a look at the market mr trent now the south african hes a millionaire so i should think from his manners lord canvey would give me a grandmotherinlaw of the worst sir jacob machpelah the man who has taken his name from abrahams cemetery i suppose he thought it sounded scotch no thanks my name is hebrew but my tastes are gentile johnny danesbury a penny doll with a squeak i want a man colonel harrington hes a brute without instinct i begin to think you keep a matrimonial agency fanny it wouldnt pay were you my only client retorted lady richardson still remembering the miracle dig no one seems to satisfy you i believe you mean to marry askew after all what of him hes a nice footman and doesnt ask wages arent these suggestions rather premature my heart like yours may be in my husbands grave i didnt know he was buried yet said the little woman crossly how impossible you are darling always when people get on my nerves dear i believe you want some other womans husband oh dear no i never covet my neighbours ass shot and shell were flying rather thickly and seeing no chance of planting her flag on leahs bulwarks lady richardson beat a discreet retreat with judas kisses and parthian shots so glad if i have cheered you up dear kiss bear up and dont break your heart kiss kiss so sweet your sorrow and so genuine kiss kiss kiss and having given several rowlands for one oliver lady richardson departed cat said lady jim to the closed door and settled to munch billys chocolates over marcel prvosts lettres dune femme chapter xx the supposed remains of jim kaimes duly arrived on british ground in charge of an extraordinarily anxious medical attendant and lord frith arranged for their transfer to firmingham there leah was already established as niobe studiously dismal in the jettrimmed crapeflounced equivalent of sackcloth with the marchioness a few decayed cousins and many hired mourners connected closely or distantly with the family she assisted the duke to lament his absalom therefore behind lowered blinds in the twilight atmosphere of the great house did officially griefstricken relations move warily on tiptoe speaking in hushed voices with downcast eyes of the deceased and his postmortem virtues the apotheosis of the prodigal son who had thus quietly come home made the place about as cheerful as a mausoleum limiting the solemnity strictly to the family lionel was requested to inter jims body with the rites in which jims soul had never believed then for the first time did he behold leah in her new character as hitherto a sympathetic letter had excused a personal interview now face to face kaimes considered the advisability as clergyman relative and friend to administer presumably needed consolation this last straw broke the widows overladen back she had wept with pentland mourned with kith and kin enduring also for three dreary weeks twaddling platitudes written and spoken by meddlesome wellwishers these exasperating necessities would have been unendurable even had jim been where he deserved to be but that she should suffer them when jim was rejoicing as mr berring and expecting his share of the money she thus laboriously earned nearly drove her beyond the bounds of decorum she could have thrown the novel she was reading at lionels head and barely escaped doing so when he appeared in her sittingroom almost aggressively sympathetic but reflecting that with the funeral would come a cessation of these aggravations and mindful that the money was almost in her purse she asked him to be seated and prepared to stomach aphorisms how good of you to come she sighed conventionally then added to avert if possible protracted boredom im dull company naturally lady james but i rejoice to see that you are resigned im not tearing my hair and gnashing my teeth if that is what you mean i will if you think jim worthy of such excesses hush hush he is dead i see evidences of that on all sides of me replied leah tartly shouldnt you say that he is not lost but gone before i believe that is one of the stock phrases of your profession lionel moved uneasily it was difficult to whitewash jim and he could not invent nonexisting virtues on the spur of the moment he was your husband remember was his effort to parry this thrust oh lord dont i know it would i put up with all this else did you come to tell me that queen anne is dead i came to cheer you go on then tell me a funny story the curate looked and felt shocked lady james lionel if you preach i shall scream cried leah developing whirlwind passion and rising a veritable bellona or else illilloh she ripped her handkerchief viciously while sweeping tempestuously up and down i dont know what ill do if you play jobs comforter her cheeks flamed her eyes sparkled and her voice leaped an octave as she flung the last words at him lionel started up surprised at this sudden anger and wondered if grief was bringing on hysteria wont you sit down said obtuse man giving the worst possible advice to overstrung woman a little sal volatile im sick of sitting down and lying down and sal volatile and listening to humbug and wearing black and being bothered ive had more trouble over jim in his death than i ever allowed him to give me in his life you say the same silly things every one else saysyouyou parrot cant you be original death is such an oldestablished institution that it is difficult to be original said lionel resuming his chair with a shrug then i shall talk myself yes i wish to speak plainly and to you i intend to speak plainly since you are the only man i respect thank you i daresay you are priggish went on lady jim finding it a marvellous relief to speak loudly and without reserve but you are honest in spite of it and you dont gossip though you are a parson in trouble i shall always come to you padre you are in trouble now hinted kaimes smiling at her frankness eh what yes of course jims dead she choked over the lie and returned to laugh at ease in her chair where has he gone lionel dont lady james i admit that he had his faults be honest he had nothing else but faults no no we all have our good points give me a list of jims she suggested derisively for the moment i cant think no nor you wouldnt if you thought for a century jim is as bad as they make em wasif you will abuse him oh yes i forgot well then jim was bad and i dont know if you call telling the truth abuse of the most virulent sort on occasions are we not all sinners speak for yourself mr humility lionel amazed by this selfcanonisation became less aaron the priest and more adam the natural man you dont call yourself immaculate surely he observed sarcastically did i by inference and if no sinner you must be saint ah i see lampblack or snowwhite grey does not exist parsons see the horizon the doorstep but no middle distance woman is lucrece or jezebel with you i am neither but a simple woman as god made me and as the devil has marred foh in this very room when we spoke last i scouted that bogies existence if you dont believe in evil existing you cant in good no devil no god lady james i never knew that the deity depended upon satan for his being said leah dryly and theology doesnt amuse meits cobwebs and spindrift talk sense if you must talk lionel hoping to lead her by a sidepath to further consideration of her spiritual needs consented to diverge for the moment ill talk money if you call that sense of course i do uncommon sense as there is so little of it money she looked at him questioningly the insurance on your late husbands life oh well she wondered what he was about to say the duke asked me to interview the lawyers very unnecessary i know all about the twenty thousand pounds jim left it to me by will you underestimate by ten thousand what thirty thousand pounds then in answer to a nod oh youyou must bebe mistaken leah was truthfully agitated had the golden goose laid two eggs instead of one no your husbands life was insured when he was a child for twenty thousand pounds with profits at an annual premium mr jarvey peel and his executors paid the money to keep the insurance in force yes yes and the principal was payable to jim at sixty or to any one he might leave it to at death i as the widow take allallall she repeated the word three times in the purring voice of a cat over cream exactly assented the curate thinking she betrayed overplainly horseleech parentage and the extra ten thousand is the accumulation of an annual bonus of fifteen pounds on every thousand thats three hundred a year calculated lady jim feverishly quite so jim was thirtyfive when he died so three hundred a year for thirtyfour years comes to ten thousand two hundred supplemented lady jim correcting his arithmetic oh lord thirty thousand two hundred pounds and jim never knew that he was worth his weight in this gold he never inquired since the money would not come to him till he attained the age of sixty it would have been almost double then commented the lady pensively what a pity jim did not live till but no we should have both been old then and there would have been no fun i am content with thirty thousandreally i am lionel it doesnt do to be greedy you are not said the curate ironically else you would have again mentioned the odd hundreds leah made a ball out of the torn handkerchief and tossed it gaily in the air that will do for lawyers costs said she airily though i hope the bill wont be so extortionate thirty thousand pounds she sprang up with dithyrambic utterance scarcely refraining from a wardance thirty thousand golden sovereigns six thousand lovely lovely bank of england notes oh vanderbilt oh the sight of her relatives disgusted face curbed her ecstasy you think that my exultation over this money is vulgar heartless at least since it is the price of your husbands death to you apparently jim is more valuable dead than alive i entirely agree with you confessed leah candidly then added with impatient anger do you expect me to tell you lies you might show some grief heavens what else have i been doing for the past three weeks assuming a virtue which you have not that remark is too clever to be original my dear man how impossible you are i wear mourning and cry at the right time and say things i dont believe about jim to his father and the rest of them while to you who blame me for behaving decently outside i speak as i feel only to be condemned what do you expect to see you exhibit some real grief said lionel who was really angered by her callous behaviour you show more genuine emotion over this miserable money than over poor jim poor jim she mocked scornfully are you going to cry up his virtues he was not so bad as you make him out to be retorted lionel doggedly then he must have revealed a side of his nature to you which he never showed to me snapped leah sharply foh whats the use of acting to empty benches go downstairs if you want an audience we are behind the scenes here very allegorical and needless cant you be more womanly if i were the sal volatile yon recommend would be needed i can tell you being a parson you will not understand being a man you cannot womanly womanlydoes that imply cant and shams am i to mourn with spurious lamentations that selfish profligate who would have broken my heart had he ever possessed it to be womanly is to excuse a mans faults to lie down and be trodden upon to condone unfaithfulness and to be grateful for the shreds and patches of an egotistic life never never her lips twisted scornfully her nostrils dilated and she clenched her hands to restrain an outburst of that wrath which had consumed her during five years of holy matrimony lionel astonished by her sudden transition from gay to grave forbore interruption and she declaimed her marital wrongs in a boadicean vein i have read in that bible of yours of the casting of pearls before swine jim was a gadarene pig who would have rent me had i loved him as i admit a wife should love her husband my coldness and what you consider my selfishness was my sole safeguard against ruin and sorrow and outrage you know that i speak the truthi defy you to say otherwise jim oh jim she laughed unpleasantly jimthat rag doll of his family who is placed on a pedestal and worshipped as though he were the golden idol he never was and never could be i respect the duke much more than i ever respected my husband for he is genuinely blind to jims faults and mourns honestly but youyou who knew the man and rebuked the manoh it would be amusing were it not so shameful her bosom heaved as she hurled this speech at him with gibe and jeer and ironic laughter i thank god that the man is out of my life was her passionate cry yesi thank god did you believe in god you would not say that bah theology again and truth which is not theology and never will be that depends upon belief the science which treats of god and of mans duty to god cannot be understood by you who have neither hope nor faith at least i have charity the greatest of the three which you lack give me an example i credit you with honesty while you cry me down as a bad woman pardon me i do not say that you are bad misguided rather and whyaccording to your lights because i do not put up jim as a pigidol to worship with crocodile tears she silenced kaimes for the moment as there was much truth in her overstated contention no decent woman could have loved or honoured the dead man and this outspoken condemnation provable in the main was assuredly more honest than pretended laudation and sham sorrow would have been yet the merciless indictment jarred on lionels sense of propriety righteous as he knew it to be the man is dead said he testily leave him to god leah held her peace it annoyed the ordinarily selfpossessed woman that for one fierce moment emotion should have overleaped judgment reining in her passions she relapsed into the sober jogtrot necessary on the rutted road of conventionality but lionels final speech provoked a laugh would his laudation of the dead she wondered change to criticism of the living did he learn the truth feminine desire for the last word would have blurted out this final argument but that an innate masculine discretion recommended silence therefore did she compromise with the laugh which lionel misunderstanding resented with the warmth of a generous nature that is positively cruel said he indignantly very human i think said lady jim yawning away the reaction following his own line of thought the curate did not traverse this statement a woman can make of a man what she pleases possibly but i had a beast to deal with cant you think more kindly of him now that he is gone no said leah decisively i would not say so to every one but i do to you out of respect for your character i am both flattered and grieved be lenient lady james are you so good yourself that you can refuse charity to the dead leah shrugged her shoulders and crossed her feet thats a trifle personal isnt it she asked goodhumouredly like the rest of this futile conversation well for the first time and the last i shall pay you the compliment of defending myself to begin with my friend your definition of good and bad depends upon dogma so we disagree at the outset let us take the primary instincts of being and oh i fear we have not the time to begin with genesis what is left of poor jim arrives in charge of m demetrius within two hours and i must prepare myself for the scene there is bound to be to be brief in my defence i can safely say that i am better than most women i never gave jim the chances he gave me of appearing in the divorce court i keep my temper even when most provoked i don t say nasty things about those who run me down and always help those i like i avoid the use of slang and of excessively strong drink i neither smoke nor indulge in morphine i invariably go to church with half a crown for the plate andandi think that includes all my virtues what more would you have unselfishness responded lionel gravely egotism is your sin and the worlds i might inquire with the apostles and i do inquire with all curiosity who then can be saved those whose merits do not spring from the ego as do yours to you lady james satan comes in his favourite guise as an angel of light and only the ithuriel spear of the holy spirit can unmask him virtuous i grant you arebecause you pamper self too much to sacrifice your position and comforts to a love that is willing to lose the world for love alone goodtemperedwhy not with a healthy body and an equable nature that you do not gossip is certainly a point in your favour although i suspect that this abstinence is again the ego which does not permit you to be sufficiently interested in others to discuss their affairs you help those you likefeed them as it were with the overabundant crumbs from your table in the words of our lord i can say do not even the publicans so but would you help those you hate and at a sacrifice certainly not why should i they would not be even grateful quite so you expect a reward for your good deeds in this world you look for yours in the next no though i admit that the temptation is strong i try to serve god out of love and gratitude ridiculous even if true such selfabnegation is beyond me yes that is what i call being really and truly good i seethat is i dont see you are always so impossible nothing is impossible with gods help as without it nothing is possible listen lady james and with his soul on fire to raise her from the material to the spiritual lionel attempted reasonable argument for over half an hour did he preach expound warn demonstrate quote deduce persuade but at the end of thirtyfive rapid minutes he found her and himself again at the starting point leah listened critically and even with interest hindered by her limitations from seeing a satisfactory conclusion she declined the tournament and retired to watch her opponent tilt at giants which she mistook for windmills said the inversely deceived donna quixota how well you talk lionel why dont you leave the church and go in for parliament the curate shook the cold water of this douche out of his ears and rose markedly discouraged i cannot make you understand he said sadly only the holy spirit can convince you of your need my need of what of salvation that would be adding sugar to honey and i feel very contented with my honey good health plenty of money a tolerable position and and you have yet to reckon with god all these things come from him and all he can take away i dont agree with you nor will you until your pride is broken that it never will be said leah superbly so you think in your insolence of beauty and health but when you come to die well then i shall die and thats all about it what is the glory of the rainbow to the colourblind lionel asked himself and walked to the door there he paused to deliver himself of a final warning though you triumph in your own strength and be at ease in the palace of sin yet will the reckoning come the most high godis and he departed word words words that was lady jims summing up of the interview chapter xxi in that chilly hour preceding dawn under the searching grey eye of earliest morning the coffin was opened in the presence of pentland and his family the likeness between the lawful son and the unlawful even more apparent in death than in life startled the woman best prepared to countenance a gross deception leah could almost have imagined this waxen awful face to be that of jim and an emotion of genuine fear shook her to the soul she had so deliberately burdened moreover and not without reason that haunting thought of an assisted death became appallingly obtrusive before these medicated remains was demetriuswas sheguilty of her will fought desperately against the suggested word and this mental struggle still further compelled the revelation of elemental feelings streaming tears trembling hands furtive glances testified to truthful terrors breaking through calculated pretence it needed a scornful look from frith the sceptic and an amazed stare on the part of demetrius to assure her that she beheld a corpse of no importance save as a substitute for a living double and even then this ironic inspection of the false seemed but a gruesome masquerade of jims lying in state when his turn really came the actuality of her feelings afforded a welcome escape from further harrowings and she left the room clinging to the arm of demetrius careless whither he led her the picture gallery was his goal since its seclusion invited no eavesdroppers and here he experimented with personally manufactured salts pungent and rousing these it soon appeared were scarcely needed lady jim released from the necessity of playing a grim comedy recovered speedily and with recuperation came the disposition to flick away the disagreeable what a fool i am said leah enraged to discover she was but mortal a woman a woman murmured demetrius cynically complacent but no heroine ugh she shivered and huddled in her chair i shall dream of that thing for the next year it was so like jim ugh ugh horrible horrible why should the sight of an empty house so startle you madame i am in no mood for metaphors go away you will be needed to shut that thing up my successor the undertaker will do that i have done my share i only hope you have not overdone it muttered the woman and the meaning of that remark madame leah wanting to know yet fearing to know evaded an answer and shirked a question leave me for a time she entreated noif you will pardon my rudeness we have much to talk about cannot you wait till after the funeral she said crossly it will look so strange your remaining here with me ah but no madame to those who might speak i am but your doctor who has brought you here to recover yourself i am perfectly recoveredperfectly in that case we can talk he insisted she yielded not being yet her old fighting self after the soulshaking it was dangerous to enter upon a contest with flawed armour so she temporised it would be best she decided to hear his story without committing herself to comments later when her nerves were steady she could answer more cautiously the question he was about to ask at an inopportune moment her wary nature declined a consideration of marriage arrangements to the extent of fixing a date for a ceremony in which she did not intend to take part still he could plead and she could and would procrastinate therefore would the victory be with her when this unprepared interview ended talk on she said languidly then added with a spite created by shattered nerves though i think it very disagreeable of you to make me look on that horrid dead thing demetrius was tolerant of feminine irrelevance madame to avert possible suspicion it was necessary undoubtedly it was necessary admitted selfcontradicting woman butwhat a risk ah pardon in the dark all cats are grey i know nothing about cats but the faces of the dead certainly vary m demetrius and dangers cannot be explained away by proverbs in this case the danger has explained itself we are now safe the plural struck disagreeably on leahs ear and reminded her somewhat pointedly of the readjusted relations between herself and the doctor we are now safe she echoed with reproving emphasis assuredly responded demetrius wilfully blind monseigneur has been completely deceived also m le marquis and madame his wife while your tears my dear friend have washed away any possible doubts which for my part i do not believe existed again she was faced by positive circumstances for the russians last words hinted a sarcasm which annoyed her it might be that with still quivering nerves she looked too anxiously for causes of offence but the familiar ease of his manner was unpalatable a second implied rebuke would avail as little as had the first and leah mindful of her dignity abstained from indicating in words the rubicon he was not to cross demetrius knew overmuch for her to speak authoritatively so it was necessary to permit him the odious intimacy of an accomplice but he should pay hereafter for his usurpation of such a position that she vowed inwardly even while smiling on his success smiling was possible now as the prospect of an inevitable verbal duel braced her to abnormal selfcontrol sit down she commanded abruptly i have yet to learn details of your scheme our scheme he reminded her you flatter me m demetrius since i cannot take credit for your clever inventions we are all in the same boat madame you i and she glanced at him inquiringly your husband can you not grasp the fact that i am a widow when i have a husband she smiled meaningly do you think he will sanction mr berring rowing in the boat you mention suspicious people are the easiest to gull and the smile rather than the words changed the gloomy doubter into a confiding child her enforced diplomacy was gaining her ground already my angel you mean leah cleverly shortened a possible rhapsody of course i do ah with a sentimental sigh what have i done to be so doubted never by me i swear believe me soul of my soul hush she raised an admonitory finger to check dithyrambic wooings at an untoward moment we are yet in the wood out of it while hereyes here where you so sweetly promised we should become one his voice sank tenderly after certain preliminaries had been observed m demetrius say constantine as you will constantine i can deny you few things after what you have done yet what you deny is what i desire lady jim displayed impatience at this headlong haste we are not in verona nor will your age permit you to play romeo to a juliet of my temperament when my husbands body is buriedshe laughed consciouslyand my months of mourning are ended thenwell thenah be patient constantine am i not to touch your fingertips meanwhile if it is any satisfaction and she gave him her hand to mumble ruminating meanwhile on this shrinking of giant to dwarf the unendurable lasted half a minute then be sensible m demetrius ah the child sighed for his lost rattle you descend from poetry to prose she nodded would you versify explanations explanations necessary ones how did you transfer garths body to jamaica the doctor looked piteous to think of wasting this golden hour he murmured oh the ejaculation was careless but the instinct was to box a dullards ears business before pleasure m demetrius at least constantine m demetrius she repeated inflexibly we are to marry well and good but beforehand i must understand my position as a russian princess the pessimism of the slav asserted itself in renewed doubts i am a simple doctor madame very simple if you imaginebut that can be discussed later come cajolingly to a hesitating and sullen being an account of your adventures must prove amusing cheer me up for the funeral this extraordinary conclusion staggered a man not easily moved to amazement mon dieu then in english you were weeping some minutes ago madame and i may be weeping some minutes later she retorted suppressing rising irritation i ask explanations rather than give them tell me how you managed shrugging away a question relative to female weathercocks demetrius reluctantly obeyed he desired lovetalk and she hard facts but naturally her subject forced his subject out of sight man being romantic and woman practical the latter invariably clips the formers wings lest he should soar beyond the necessities of her hour moreover his pinions rendered useless demetrius could not dispute commonsense views thus dexterously managed did he yield to a puppet fate the strings of which were pulled by obstinacy and selfishness blended into what leah called firmness she was an adept at ticketing her vices virtues that poor garththe doctor mentioned his late patient thus endearingly throughout the narrativedied of consumption of consumption leah put the question she had been shirking for so long with nervous emphasis and with short indrawn breaths assuredly and earlier than i expected there was no need to i knowi know do not put it into words she fiddled with her handkerchief looking up down everywhere except at her companion did he suffer much was her inquiring whisper not at all he died in his sleep pray do not alarm yourself madame the release was a happy and an easy one i am so gladso relieved murmured lady jim seeing the spectre which had long haunted her pillow dissolve into thin air you see i thoughtthat is i fancied she hesitated and passed her tongue over dry lips the need did not arise explained the doctor answering somewhat contemptuously her unspoken fears although i was prepared to no do not shudder there is no blood on my hands nor on yours we can marry in peace the doubly false prophecy of the last sentence provoked her into ignoring the entire speech go onplease go on garth died a natural death at funchal well i did not say that madame absurd why your explanation is yet to come if you will accord me a hearing whereupon accepting an impatient permission demetrius slipped into the undramaticliterally so for he avoided oratorical snares the high colouring of superlatives and the temptation to dilate on obviously sensational moments he might have been reciting the alphabet so dry was his deliver of an advisedly barren tale one richard strange marinerso commenced the sober odysseyowned and captained a seagipsy prowling on ocean highways and in harbour byways for the picking up of chance cargoes as an instinctive buccaneer ostensibly lawabiding he lent himself and his trampsteamer to whatever nefarious proposals promised the acquisition of money at slight risks thus fitted for the russians requirements secret instructions brought him to anchor in funchal bay with him sailed for possible restoration to health a consumptive nephew herne by name also a factor in an admirably conceived scheme the dead was necessary for the living and the dead for the dead said demetrius paradoxically what do you mean by that questioned lady jim very naturally the body of that poor garth had to be buried in madeira madame yet being wanted here to pass as the corpse of your husband it was necessary to arrange for a substitute i understand herne was to pass as garth and garth as jim demetrius assented and proceeded with his two patients the doctor lodged at a secondrate hotel not a stonesthrow from the shore in due time herne died and demetrius at once transferring the body to garths bedroom induced the surviving consumptive to board the stormy petrelso the seagipsy was namedfor the purpose of informing its skipper of his relatives death strange previously advised detained the young man and demetrius proceeded to bury herne under the prisoners name an easier task than you would think madame he explained for the portuguese landlord confused the names of my patients owing to his ignorance of their language but scarcely of their appearance i should think observed lady jim shrewdly demetrius shrugged away the objection i cannot say that the landlord had studied lavater to his uninformed eye two fair young englishmen were much alike and consumption madame begets a family likeness in those it afflicts i assure you that this portuguese was as satisfied that my poor garth had died as is monseigneur convinced that his son lies in the coffin we inspected leah shuddered for the twentieth time at the mental picture evoked ugh what then the doctor informed her placidly as garth under a tombstone suitably inscribed the skippers nephew was buriedthe very fact that he had existed thus being blotted out by a chiselled lie then did the seatramp loafthe word is appropriateoverseas to jamaica at a slow ten knots an hour with bad luck it would seem to one passenger at least he died on board exclaimed the listener that poor garthah yes as a child did he fall asleep to waken demetrius spread his hands at a loss to supply further information his ideas of a future state were vague with an admirably embalmed body on board the disreputable craft of captain strange slipped her anchors in kingston harbour but no halfmasted ensign intimated her lugubrious cargo lord james kaimes forewarned by a cypher letter rowed out to inspect an eidolon of himself as he would one day appear his nerves being shaken by enforced invalidism he did not appreciate the sight also the medicines of demetrius given to induce counterfeit consumption and lean sallow looks made him fear lest this rascally comedy should deepen into a real tragedy for himself those in kingston with whom he had made acquaintance were not surprised when demetrius took him eastward to the famous blue mountains in the hope that the healing air would mend his lungs nor did any one manifest astonishment when after a discreet period news came of his death perhaps if these sympathisers had seen one james berring sneak on board the stormy petrel and had beheld that ship rolling south to buenos ayres they would have expended less pity on his untimely decease as it was while jim foregathered with the skippera man after his own buccaneering heartformer acquaintances government officials and local doctors were complimenting demetrius on the clever way in which he had embalmed the late james kaimes body with such few scientific appliances as could be at hand in the blue mountains they had no suspicionthese people questioned leah abruptly i assure you no madame my mummy you saw it yourself leah rose lest her minds eye should conceive too vivid a picture i shall always see it she murmured with loathing ugh what a fool i amwhat a fool a woman a woman and so madame we recommence our conversation it has already lasted too long she rejoined lord frith here she stopped too discreet to repeat club gossip which might strengthen still more the already strong position of demetrius you were about to observe madame nothing it is of no moment you are sure all is safesure as sure as i am that we you and i shall be happy sentiment and business mix about as well as snow and fire snapped leah yet ridden by a nightmare memory of that dead face but this sailor whose nephew you borrowed captain strange he will say what i will at a price no doubt of the smallest madame one thousand pounds ridiculous extortionate one cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs said demetrius in dry tones it would be well not to vex my friend strange who wants to vex him he shall have his money anything else this letter from your late husband and demetrius handed over an envelope directed in jims sprawling hand and sealed with jims ancestral coat of arms fool was leahs comment on this carelessness doesnt he know he is dead and is about to be buried she thrust the letter hastily into her pocket and was about to hurry away when she caught a glimpse of the russians darkening face she paused wisely to dismiss him with a compliment you have managed splendidly m demetrius do i not deserve to be called constantine now yesnothat isoh dont bother lady jim snatched away the hand he had captured you foreigners never learn sense are you teaching it to me now he asked in a metallic voice i amif you are clever enough to learn the lesson see as little of me as possible and dont speak to me at all when jimthat is when garthis buried we shall see but madame quite so consider your objections answered they will be answered said demetrius very distinctly before the altar of any church you may select a remembrance of his capacity for being dangerous and an anxious survey of his narrowing eyes made her deceptive she diplomatically employed feminine strategy against which no man living can manoeuvre you doubt me constantine whispered the shejudas with trembling tenderness will not this she bent forward to drop a butterfly kiss on his forehead and left him dazed in the seventh and most exalted paradise of fools faugh said lady jim when shut up in her own room there she read the communication from her legally deceased husband it narrated a story similar to that detailed by demetrius but scarcely so concisely mr berring showed a disposition to ramble and his excursions ended on every occasion in a command to send half the insurance money at oncethe last two words being aggressively underlined he was in the best of health on his way to buenos ayres thence would travel to rosariowhere that woman lives commented leah tearing off the address and carefully burning jims maunderings half the moneyeh fifteen thousand pounds i think not mr berring that captain too with his absurd charge and after all my trouble i wonder demetrius does not claim his share also it would have been cheaper had he done so since she possessed the money and he intended to possess her but he would refuse a cheque and claim her hand as she reflected with impotent rage what a pity she could not pay him off and along with jim and strange dismiss him into limbo she did not exactly know what limbo was or where it was save that once there these people could not bother her but with all the will in the world she could not get out of the apparent culdesac she had walked into demetrius wants me and these other beasts my money she raged inwardly what a mean advantage they all take pigs as though i worked for nothing what is to be done whatwhat this question was difficult to answer jim she could bamboozle with a small sum since he could not well betray her without laying himself open to a charge of conspiracy but the russian and the skipper both adventurers of the most reckless type would assuredly demand their wages i shall have to pay that captain she decided regretfully but demetriusinsolent little creaturehe shall go to siberia even if i have to kiss him again faugh then she descended to tell the duke how the sight of poor dear jims face had broken her up entirely yet people said that leah kaimes had no sense of humour chapter xxii a sociable undertaker lacking the indispensable humour of his brethren bitterly complained that he rarely inquired after a friends health without being suspected of business motives exlieutenant harry askew found himself in a similar predicament since his desire to marry a widow precluded him from offering sympathy that he should personally or by letter deplore the necessity of crape caps would suggest waning affection while a congratulatory address laid him open to the chargewhich this especial widow would certainly makeof unseemly dancing on a newlymade grave with laboured wisdom askew dropped between the horns of this dilemma paying no visit writing no letter he compromised by leaving a card in this dexterous avoidance of impalement lady jim read the untold story of his perplexity and smiled at the diplomatic evasion there being an exception to every rule the absence which should have made the askew heart grow fonder produced an opposite effect debarred from the temple of his goddess he began to ask himself why he worshipped and thereby dug the grave of illicit passion that such was now permissible and even praiseworthy considering its consolatory results only made him a more ardent sexton the votaries of eros can begarland themselves with roses but hymens celebrants wear chains of approved legal pattern was the cultus of the matrimonial god worth such encumbrances thus askew inquired of his own pampered self and not knowing exactly what his selfishness desired obtained but a doubtful response what else could he expect twofaced janus is the true god of oracles lady jim was witty beautiful chaste and brilliantadmirable qualities in a woman but in a wife unless informed with love rather unattractive askew doubted if a composite mate of this glittering unwarmed sort would satisfy his somewhat exacting requirements accepting too readily the worlds definition what he and it called love was actually selfishness masquerading he fancied and with much reason that leah openly devoted to herself would not show devotion to him that is she being selfish and he ditto genuine happiness would not and could not spring from this union of like and like moreover he ignorantly lovedin the worlds sensethrough his eyes and with his lower nature so it was probable that the legal possession of irresponsive beauty would pall to limit a butterfly to one rose would bore the butterfly and if the rose were sentient she also might feel weary in this way and from surface feelings argued askew but natural limitations prevented comprehension of the true reason which disinclined him to prosecute his now legal and therefore uninteresting wooing he was a better man than he knew and this he would have known had he paid heed to the intimations of his higher self when it occasionally overcame the lower when the god within overtopped the brute he had beheld not so clearly the body as the soul of lola fajardo and had for one swift moment recognised that conjunction with the spirit would best promote his happiness a genuine marriage must be spiritual and it is the souls whom god hath joined which man is forbidden to put asunder askews introspective self knew that his allotted wife on this physical plane was lola and that to her alone should love be given but the lust of the eye demanded leah kaimes beauty and feigned a spurious passion to gain possession absence from lady jim made him aware that he did not actually love her and a feeble struggle of the soul bound in chains of selfishness revealed that he would do well to seek lola once more hence came the war between light and darkness wherein the light so far triumphed that the young man sought curzon street with more selfcontrol than was desirable in an admitted loverone be it known of the worldly material type only and may all such for the wellbeing of the race be anathema maranatha i took you to be more original said leah when he entered original to the extent of defying conventionality by calling before the funeral your grief needed consolation you declined to console i come now at the eleventh and less necessary hour besides she looked meaningly towards the windowseat where a flushed and smiling katinka adored with timid conversation and eloquent eyes a rather sour demetrius will you have a cup of tea thank you and they moved towards the bamboo table whence she had risen to whisper her greeting at the door advisedly it would seem since she cast a rapid and satisfied glance at the doctors lowering face the set mouth the narrowing eyes hard as jade betokened jealous rebuke of leahs condescending to meet the newcomer as royalty should be met reading this index of a mind ill at ease lady jim resumed her seat tacitly pleased she had an end to gain and this overattention to askew meant the beginning of plots it was over a month since the supposed jim kaimes had been packed away in the family vault and his widow enjoyed the fruits of her labours dr demetrius looking upon the thirty thousand pounds as purchase money wished to possess the woman he had thus bought and objected to other customers eying his bargain hence his jealousy discerned a rival in askew and lady jimaware of this clearsightednesswas content that he should so discern she could neither cajole nor reason demetrius into trusting himself in paris but the desired result might be brought about by utilising greeneyed jealousy the unexpected meeting of the rivals afforded her an eagerly seized chance of putting fire to powder the possible explosion she hoped would blow demetrius into siberian wilds thus playing with amorous fire she hastened to heap on lavish fuel i am seeing a few friends now said lady jim ministering to her visitors fiveoclock wants mademoiselle aksakoff and dr demetriusyou know both i believe lady richardson may look in later also here she checked her tongue aksakoff was due in half an hour but it would not do to advise demetrius of that the chances were that katinka aware of the intended visit would carry off the doctor early lady jim devoutly wished that she would her drawingroom was no stage for melodrama also queried the newly arrived also her son sir billy have you met him of course monte carlo i remember isnt he charminga dorsay of the cradle brummel in embryo i have a mind to marry him as a pockethusband am i to wish you joy leah looked at him suddenly and understood this man had risen from his knees and the chances weregoing by experiencethat he would stroll away she did not intend to permit that since he was necessary to her schemes until demetrius was safely bestowed in siberia he would have to be flattered and coerced and ensnared into remaining then he could go and welcome with freedom and money she wanted no encumbrances and it vexes a woman to have a man more earnest than herself hanging round her skirts however this was not the time for plain speaking and she answered in this thalian vein of course you must wish me joyin a whisper the smiles of leah the attitude of askew the sibilant indistinct voices of both goaded demetrius he all but interrupted the teatable conference but since lady jim wished to be a princessshe had conveyed that idea clearlyand as katinkas aid was necessary to the recovering of his birthright he dared not to offend the girl jealous himself demetrius knew how easy it would be to arouse the doubts of anotherespecially of a woman he therefore remained seated and waited developments while katinka chatted earnestly i really wish you would be reconciled with my father said she m aksakoff is less willing for such a consummation than i mademoiselle she disagreed hurriedly you are wrong my father is willing but your enemies are not and my enemies are his enemies he inquired dryly assuredly but one enemypaul petrovitchis my friend your cousin katinka nodded and proceeded with explanations he has as you know much influence with the czar that would be used on your behalf if she paused coloured and cast down her eyes if what if i agreed to marry him thin ice indeed but demetrius skated extremely well mademoiselle said he gravely i cut myself off from my princely family and surrendered wealth that i might work in the cause of humanity to assist a brother worker did i risk exile with the result you behold why then should i demand a sacrifice on your part to restore that which i personally do not regret believe me my friend it would mean no sacrifice you hinted when last we met that you were prepared to consider the proposition of resuming your rank i didcontingent on certain events happening replied demetrius thinking that if lady jim insisted upon being a princess of the drawingrooms he would be forced to yield but we can talk of this in awell in a few months there is no hurry recalling the necessary period of mourning no there is no hurry he paused then questioned suddenly you love paul petrovitch no no ah no it would then certainly be a sacrifice for you to marry him i would never do that how then could you persuade him to use his influence it is a case of diamond cut diamond explained katinka with the indifference of a woman to all other honour save that of the man she loves paul petrovitch wishes to marry me if i agree he will induce the czar to reinstate you in your possessions when you have made your peace at st petersburg i could refuse to oh she broke off with a confused laugh do not look shocked m demetrius i but trick him as he is prepared to trick me i am far from being shocked denied the liberalminded doctor to prevent being bitten we must bite but the possible sacrifice lies in lending myself to such a trick i make it for youfor you yes do you not understand only that stupid animal a sheep could have refused comprehension i am not worthy shuffled demetrius hurriedly i think you are she breathed tenderly will you not permit me to prove my belief i shall be honoured ifin a few monthsthe time is scarcely ripe for me to move and you will understand in short when things are differentyour noble offerwe can discuss it later believe mehe thrilled her with a light touchi comprehend the nobility of your nature ah my friend do not press me to take advantage of so glorious a sacrifice so stammered demetrius his confusion being worse confounded and wrapping up refusal in evasive words meaningless if sugared katinka sighed always she pressed her mediatory offer and always she declined acceptance angry that the proffered gift should be flung back in her face she suddenly felt a sense of outrage at his persistent quibbling this man must see that she loved him yet he trifled with her too obvious passion there was lady jim of course in spite of lady jims readjustment of the situation at monte carlo yet could he could any man love this chilly selfcentered englishwoman no as she knew demetrius demanded love for love and he certainly would not give all to lady jim without receiving back in kind therefore he did not love the woman therefore he was heartwhole and being so why should he not yield to one who was ready to suffer all for his sake she could not understand but this she knewthat her selfrespect rebelled and at the moment that feeling swallowing up all others impelled her to walk away without even a backward glance but she remained where she was since her adoration for this unresponsive god amounted to monomania she hated to cringe to cast down her womanly dignity but she was forced to do so passion proved stronger than selfrespect than natural shame than maiden pride enthralled by venus as had been helen of troy she was forced to grovel at the feet of thisas she suspectedignoble paris would he never smile would he never unbend she could not say she did not know all she felt was pure unhappiness and she could have cursed the power which trammelled her in these nets of undesired love the gods were sporting and olympus shook with laughter at her mortal sorrow comewhen you need me said she and rose demetrius was selfseeking yet possessed human feelings and of these shame was uppermost the vein of divinity which streaked his clay made him acknowledge that he was using hardly this flouted worshipper outwardly at least and with an impetuosity alien to his calculating character he wished to make amends let me come also there is no need she replied coldly and crossed to the teatable you will excuse my departure lady james i have an engagement mr askew she bowed and then went silently out of the room do you follow doctor asked lady jim stepping with him to the scarcely closed door he did not reply directly but glanced across her shoulder towards the yawning lieutenant remember he breathed significantly and in his turn departed leah wondered that the feelings which had evoked the word should not have kept him watchful of her pretty play and confessed herself puzzled by his abrupt following of katinkas trail but having as she knew aroused his jealousy there was no need to consider meanings which would not affect her schemes aksakoff was due and before he appeared it was necessary to teach askew the rle of catspaw he was to decoy demetrius to paris but of course she did not mean him to be aware of his ignoble duties she returned to rebuke him for yawning and to propose a remedy what you need is change of scene if not of society now there is paris which you probably know well i do not know it at all he confessed what a neglected education i must teach you paris will you be ready for your first lesson early next week i do not quite understand lady jim nodded laughingly which proves that our future is now split into your future and my future i am more in the dark than ever said the amazed listener lady jim curled her lip contemptuously you men need so much explanation said she then meaningly i can still retain you as a friend i hope what do youthat ison what grounds you do not comprehend he stuttered grew red and writhed over the fire on which she was grilling him with much enjoyment to herself ah but i do comprehendvery clearly too when did the change come thechange of heart if you wish me to enter into details there is no change in me he denied still red and flurried and no truth either when you make such a statement with a light laugh she recalled his fierce wooing you would not attempt to break my wrists now i am very very sorry that i was rough with yon quite so and cannot you see that such sorrow explains everything not to me said askew desperately fervent leah clapped her hands gaily how very badly you do it do not go on the stage i beg of you well she kissed her hand to him adieu i hope she will be happy who will be happy the other woman there is no he caught her derisive eyes and broke down with an uneasy laugh i suppose we have made a mistake you have she replied promptly emphasising the pronoun ah his pride was wounded by the implied indifference then you knew it would come to this of course because i did not choose that it should end otherwise if i had chosen you would still have been she glanced smilingly at her slim feet then handled the teapot with ostentatious liveliness you can have some cold tea if you like as askew had intended to drop her the idea that she was dropping himand very readily toowas wounding to his vanity you never loved me he declared did i ever say that i did well no all the same she clasped her hands over her knee and smiled indulgently at his mortified face all the same you are unwise to explain so we will change the subject mr askew ah not even harry not even leah she mocked still you can call me lady jim till you change the name certainly not for that of askew seorita fajardo may think differently when you propose how do you know i shall he asked sulkily for every word she uttered fretted his uneasy vanity because you are a shuttlecock between two battledores she sent you flying to me i shall speed you back to her the young man was almost too mortified to speak what a light vain fool you make me out to be no you are merely a man in the hands of two womenclay in the hands of accomplished potters now she laid a caressing hand on his arm promise me to go back to rosario at once no snapped askew wincing at the touch and so gave her the very answer she required her motive in pelting him with hard sentences had been to arouse his vanity to assert itself in aggressive contradiction and for three reasons firstly she did not wish him to make an inconvenient third in mr berrings wooing of the spanish lady lest he should learn much that it was undesirable for him to know secondly she required him as her parisian decoyduck and thirdly it was out of the question that he should dare to end the flirtation without her leave a reflection of these things led her to play skilfully on manly conceit with the aforesaid result she was satisfied when he replied in the negative askew also since thereby in his own estimation he had vindicated virility and lacked the insight to see himself her puppet having gained her end lady jim apparently yielded to the lordofcreation fiat well then come to paris with me and joan tallentire we go on monday to the hotel henri trois champs lyses you can come on wednesday but i dont think i am quite sure you dont perhaps thursday will suit you better if you insist i do not unless on common sense of which you possess so little how you bully me he cried much vexed by this badgering of course we always bully those we loveas friends that is ah here is m aksakoff what a surprise she rose gracefully and sailed forward with outstretched hand so kind of you to come you know mr askew i think the diplomatist bowed and seated himself near the table whereat askew devoured by a desire for further confidences fumed with depressed eyebrows and twisted mouth lady jim rang for fresh tea listening meanwhile to aksakoff discussing the safe subject of the weather occasionally she glanced with amusement at her victim who by this time did not know his own mind and certainly was incapable of analysing his very complicated feelings she bewildered him he was not master of himself in her presence and alternately quailed and rebelled under her spells flight from circe was his wisest plan must you inquired lady jim winningly at the first movement must what please he asked sulkily settling down again must you go i see you must so sorry goodbye i do not want to to be bored naturally a widow is but dull company please do not leave us in the dark the button is on the righthand side of the door no that is wrong she rose and switched on the light herself that is better dont you think it is so good of you to come and cheer me then dropping her voice paris i shall cross on wednesday he murmured then we can resume our conversation what pleasure you promise me she retorted and closing the door came back to the waiting diplomatist yawning daintily excuse me m aksakoff i have just ended a bad quarter of an hour that young man madame the same he wants to marry me shocking isnt it seeing that i scarcely know how to pose as a widow but natural on his part surely how nicely you pay compliments by the way sliding away from the subject your daughter was here she has gone off somewhere with your friend m demetrius aksakoff frowned it is kind of you to enlarge my circle of acquaintance madame i presume you desire to speak of this gentleman leah raised her eyebrows no why should i our conversation at monte carlo did we converse so we did something about a sunset wasnt it the diplomatist became unworthy of the name through sheer irritation can we not drop our masks madame i never knew that we wore such things said lady jim lightly i am sure i do not why should i but you sent for me leah placed her elbows on the table and the tips of her fingers together i did to ask you for some letters to nice people in paris ah his face lighted up you go to paris my good friend have i not said so and the letters i shall be delighted aksakoff was now beginning to understand the necessity of reading between the remarks but are letters necessary i hope to be in paris myself next week how delightful you will be able to amuse me do not look shocked i assure you i only wish to drown my grief of course assented aksakoff dryly then added with a significance she ignored do you go alone to paris oh dear me no miss tallentire goes with me a charming girl who is engaged to my cousin the rev lionel kaimes we stay for a week at the hotel henri trois champs lyses very quietly you know as i am still mourning as you are still in mourning corrected her visitor politely certainly you would not have me flaunting colours with poor dear jim just dead i want to be cheered up and i ask you and mr askew to cheer me oh ah aksakoff wrinkled his brow mr askew goes to paris also he said something about it such a nuisance seeing that he thinkswell i told you madame his thoughts are excusable but m demetrius will be angered what do you mean demanded lady jim imperiously aksakoffs patience was almost exhausted we spoke at monte carlo he reminded her surely we understand one another possibly you may i am quite in the dark why should you couple my name with that of m demetrius report says that he loves you ohreport she laughed frankly amused if you believe reports here a shrug and a contemptuous laugh why reports leave no one a shred of character i quite expect that my enemiesmrs penworthy for onewill say that mr askew followed me to paris for the purpose of marrying me at the british embassy aksakoff admired her profoundly without committing herself in any way or for a single instance she was placing in his hands the thread of the intrigue tacitly acknowledging a diplomatic superior he followed her lead i trust that mrs penworthy whom i have the honour to know will not spread such a report he said gravely oh but she will a horrid woman and scarcely respectable she has called in dr demetrius as her medical attendant and ifas you sayhe admires me she is sure to make mischief well said aksakoff reflectively i am perfectly sure that if m demetrius heard such gossip he would forbid the banns finished leah hastily and derisively pah do you think knowing his danger he would trust himself in paris you are entirely wrong m aksakoff our mutual friend left me this very afternoon to follow your daughter let him marry hernow do no said aksakoff setting down his cup until he surrenders katinka he is safer in england in that case please do not let mrs penworthy gossip him into crossing the channel for your sake i will not said aksakoff dryly and with every intention of aiding and abetting mrs penworthy will you give me another cup of tea she supplied him and their conversation embraced a variety of subjects no further mention was made of demetrius or of katinka or of askew or even of paris they quite understood one another did these two clever people when the diplomatist departed he kissed lady jims hand with courtly warmth you are a charming woman madamea truly admirable woman buthe straightened himself and looked into her eyesi should not like to have you for an enemy what do you mean by that asked lady jim artlessly a compliment madamebelieve me a very high compliment chapter xxiii oh its lovely lovely lovely sang joan tallentire clapping her hands and whirling dervishfashion around the room a radiant day or so in paris had acted on her as sunshine acts on a flower when the petals expand the colour deepens and the perfume exhales what observer casual or close would have recognised in this eagereyed and sparkling girl the timid companion of lady canvey for weeks she had associated with the octogenarian many months had she superintended the wellbeing of pauper hags in lambeth slums and in the nursing of an ailing mother many precious years had been expended no wonder the fire of being burnt low no marvel that for long the eyes had lacked lustre and the cheeks colour it was truly a case of the old eating the youngstealing by contact as it were the vitality of youth to reanimate waning life now lady jim playing fairygodmother had transformed this cinderella and the grub of lambeth soared a splendid dragonfly the spring long delayed in its coming sang in her veins with stimulating company amidst novel surroundings and with tempting food for satisfying physical and moral appetites came the renascent period joan felt the burden of artificial years slip from her shoulders her quick blood responding to its environments rose to fever heat one cloud alone necked the sunshine of pleasures dawn i wish lionel was here she sighed a pagan in the temple a jew in the church said lady jim shrugging my dear paris was invented for clergymen to rail at not to enjoy lionel is not narrowminded lady james he approves of innocent amusements magiclanterns and penny readings i fear paris cannot supply those dissipations you can enjoy them under the honeymoon meanwhile mr askew is less exacting and more amusing there is no one like lionelno one i grant that else would the world be innocent and dull joan pursed up her pretty lips and wrinkled a smooth brow i dont understand that said she meditatively no assented leah with a slow and somewhat envious look you never will why not i could give you fifty reasons but three will do you are good and kind and healthyminded to excessan angel whose white wings flutter above the mire in which we bipeds grovel quite the wife for our unsophisticated padre st sebastian and st ceciliasurely a marriage arranged in heaven miss tallentire could not quite follow leahs flightsnot an infrequent occurrence nevertheless her intuition espied a compliment do you really mean that as i rarely mean anything let me be candid for once since we converse in the nursery and say that i respect lionel and i respect you i would rather have love suggested the girl timidly leah touched her breast with eight fingertips from then in response to an answering blush my dear i love no one but myself i cant believe that or you would not have bothered to bring me to paris merely the desire for a new sensation i assure you as lionel assured me that all my virtues spring from the ego what is the ego leah kaimes in this instance i dont think you are selfish persisted joan if you really and truly were you would not say so oh but i should that is my refined form of selflove when i cry aloud my imperfections i receive some such compliment as you have paid then little god ego sitting within my breast sniffs up the incense in that case i am selfish too i like to be told nice things and to be given nice things such as well i expect lionel in spite of clerical propriety can explain better than i and added lady jim mischievously in dumb show my dear your ego is shaped like a good young padre you are merged in lionelswallowed up as some ones rod swallowed up some one elses i suppose nowleah nursed her knees with clasped handsi suppose when you marry st sebastian you will be wildly happy in a dull country rectory wearing twiceturned gowns and last years hats and fussing after old women and grubby village urchins with your husbands sermons for relaxation when penny readings pall quite happy assented joan laughing at the overcoloured picturewith lionel of course as i say your ego is his ego dear and lady jim dropped two impulsive kisses on her companions cheeks joan wondered at this uninvited display of affection and wondered still more when leah turned away with a somewhat bitter laugh perhaps had she guessed the truth her sympathy would have extended to this woman whom selflove isolated from humanity it pleased leah to pose as this simple maids providence and on the whole she sustained her deity excellently many a time did she check her freespoken and sharp tongue lest joan should feel hurt or become precociously enlightened about those sins which are dubbed idiosyncrasies in society the amusements provided were primitive and commonplace as befitted the retirement of a newly made widow and uncultured idbutantei tastes drives in the bois visits to the louvre to versailles to notre dameon the tail of hugos romanceto pre lachaise many inspections of many delightful shops one concert at least and the exploration of places which had to do with the picturesque history of france filtered through baedeker and murray leah unused to bread and milk thought the majority of these outings insipid but joan enjoyed them immensely and wondered at continental dissipation her ignorance credited leah with loving and invariably leading this cookstourist life when abroad and that lady laughed frequently in the seclusion of her bedroom at the idea of being limited to nursery geography nevertheless she did not undeceive her iingnuei the bloom if she could prevent it should not be brushed too early from this peach which reticence and determination showed that lady jim had in her some soul of that goodness which lives in things evil askew duly arrived fortyeight hours later so that his meeting with leah might appear unexpected he called daily at the hotel henri trois and on a hint from lady jim devoted attention to joan the maid leah herself philandered in a businesslike way with m aksakoff who strange to say followed askews trail on important business lady jim enjoyed many interesting conversations with him dealing with a quiet obliteration of demetrius if he should by any chance walk into the trap joan and her cavalier good surface readers did not guess at the elements working below and so danced unsuspectingly on a volcano the fickle sailor was now lukewarm in his affections and as leah purposed dropping him gradually as soon as demetrius was on his way to siberia she was not ill pleased to watch redhot passion cool to ashengrey friendship certainly it still remained to withhold him from seeking a foreign wife overseas but she postponed schemes of prevention pending the disposal of immediate troubles sometimes it occurred to her that askew a man of tow like all sailors might catch fire from contact with joan but player as she was with the hearts and brains of men she cherished sufficient friendship for lionel to forgo a possible spoiling of his sober romance there was little danger that miss tallentire would exchange church for navy but that the juxtaposition of an artless maid and an inflammable bachelor might not breed fickleness lady jim wrote a letter why not come over and escort us back to town ran this epistle also in paris you will assuredly find material for a sermon on the wickedness of that great city ninevehi believe you parsons give western towns eastern names when you wish to abuse themto avoid libel actions maybe then followed the mention of the rope to drag this clerical lover across channel do come if only to see how joan enjoys the society of mr askew the expected happened on the fifth day of lady jims sojourn in paris when shortly after noon demetrius obviously disordered in dress and mind presented himself in the character of a bolt from the blue luckily askew was translating to joan the luxor hieroglyphics in the vicinity of the place de la concorde obelisk so that she had an hour to explain away the rumours which had undoubtedly brought him over when the sittingroom door clicked behind himhe facing her with black looksshe drew a deep breath to brace for the fight and heard what he did not the snick of prison bolts shot home so far lured by the willothewisp jealousy he had followed recklessly the dangerous path now it remained for her to conduct him to the precipice over which she and aksakoff intended he should be thrown a trifle of acting was necessary to reassure the venturesome and perhaps suspicious traveller m demetrius are you mad not constantine then he panted like a spent runner and his face twisted in a wry smile what do you mean demetrius dropped heavily into the nearest chair and sent angry inquiring glances into every corner where is he where is who oh madamehe became sarcastic hereyou know very well i think i know nothing save that you are foolish to venture into paris where there is a price on your head m aksakoff is here too if he knewif he guessed well what matter i have run greater risks for lesser reasons yet they must be strong ones in the present instance to make you enter the bears den i have one reason for my venture madameyou and anothermr askew not to speak of a thirdthis marriage at your embassy i can understand the first the second may be explained by wholly unnecessary jealousy but the final onethis marriage you speak of between yourself and mr askew lady jim stared then laughed goodhumouredly my dear constantine the idea is too ridiculous i have the news on good authority which is the last authority you should believe mr askew is certainly here but not i believe in the character of a bridegroom mrs penworthy oh leahs scorn was worthy of the great sarah mrspenworthy she told me that you came here that mr askew followed fortyeight hours later quite correct and that you intended to marry him at the british embassy really i never knew that mrs penworthy was imaginative it is not true his eye probed her she did not flinch you must be mad to think so it is not true he persisted you yourself have denied the truth of it twice mr askew at this moment dances round miss tallentires skirts would i permit that if oh ridiculous you men swallow camels her dupe rose to pace the room and to pour out the anger of many brooding hours it is not trueah if i could only be sure of that this womanthis mrs penworthyshe sworesworethat youthat you he choked flung himself headlong to where she smiled contemptuous and seized her hands vehemently swear that it is false he dropped on his knees almost tearful i do swear rejoined leah disengaging her wrists you can take mr askew back to london if you like he is engaged to marry a lady in south america there is nothing between usnothing a flirtation yes banter and pretty smiles idle nothings and surface conversations she smoothed back his hair and smiled playfully am i marrying othello you are so beautiful he muttered wavering in your eyes no doubt mr askew prefers brunettes south of the equator butshe rose suddenly as though she spurned himbut i prefer trust i am angryyes very angry oh that you should doubt medoubt me her tragic assertion was admirable i do noti do not and he still grovelled catching at her dress your presence here proves otherwise mr askew indeeda general lover a volatile sailor with a wife in every port for all i know can you not credit me with more exclusive tastes he is handsome muttered the still suspicious doctor and rose brushing his knees mechanically is he so you think i am to be won by looks like a schoolmiss in her teens she looked at his sharp white face and laughed cruelly that i am engaged to you should prove differently he scarcely heeded her swear swear and his eyes flamed leah calculating the effect lost her temper i shall in a moment she cried angrily the most patient of womenof whom i am not onehave their limits why do you allow jealousy to overrule common sense when the position is so plain you fixed your price and fulfilled your part of the bargain am i i ask you free to play you this trick of a hasty marriage when you can expose me as privy to a fraud you see that i do not mince matters i speak plainly do i not you have all the winning cards and can compel me to become your wife even if i dissented why then do you come here on a fools errand but i love you so he protested piteously and love being blind makes you stumble into danger i think you had better return to england by the night train am i to leave you with mr askew oh take him with you i gave you permission before and pray dont make scenesi dislike them then i am wrong faugh if you doubt my word perhaps you will take mr askews he will be here soon with miss tallentire i decline to defend a position which requires no defence a shrug ended this speech and this in conjunction with the anger brightening her hard blue eyes reduced him to profuse apologies but indeed my soul you should not be enraged that i should risk what i do risk surely proves my love for you you have proved it before by getting me the insurance money she replied impatiently pray return at once i can see you in curzon street when i return on tuesday then you promise to marry me yes leah heaved a sigh of exhaustion how often do you wish me to say so even if you remain dr demetrius i am bound to become your wife seeing that you hold my reputation in your hands though of course she added sweetly i expect to be princess constantine demetrius i am willingbelieve me i am willing he stuttered now quite positive that mrs penworthy was a liar of the worst aksakoff what of him did you not say that he would aid me to regain my position if i gave up katinka he said something like that she rejoined carelessly and wondering why at this moment he recalled the proposition but i rather fancy his offer was merely to leave you alone demetrius looked silently at the carpet leah watched him with a doubtful look on her guard against complications he looked up suddenly and with rather a shamed face certainly i could secure the services of mademoiselle aksakoff he murmured but it seems cruel to use her influence and then to leave her she loves me ah yes she loves me very truly and ii treat her most badly if you think so why not make amends and marry her because i love you and at great risk i have bought you he glared at her savagely i refuse to let you go you are minemine i never denied that said lady jim dryly but i really cannot accompany you to siberia and if you remain here wait he flung up an imperative hand i shall see aksakoff this sounded almost too good to be true and leah doubted no yes ah my adored i know how you feel for my safety his voice took on a caressing tone butit is nothing he brushed away imaginary danger with a rapid gesture i shall see him i shall plainly surrender katinka and thenthen when he knows that weyou and iare to marry he will interest himself with the czar on ouryou mark me my angelon our behalf its a mad idea impracticable you dare not trust aksakoff ah bah he will not arrest me publiclyhe cannot the scandalthe diplomatic stormthe newspapers no noit is too absurd besideshe shruggedthis tender father will repay me if i give his daughter to understand that we can never marry he desires her to be the countess paul petrovitch hum said lady jim rejoicing that the prisoner should thus lock himself in and pitch the key out of the window m aksakoff hinted something of this to me at monte carlo then you can seethen you must understand demetrius gesticulated excitedly should i surrender mademoiselleif i write a letter stating that i do not love that there can by no means be marriageaksakoff will help me help you help us both as prince and princess demetrius yes i see and yetthe risk there is no risk publicly and to snare me in secretno i am waryoh most wary no one can trap me i swear to you no one demetrius said leah as gravely as her delight would let her you have done me a service which i repay with my hand in marriage i do not love you as i ought to but love may come with the honeymoon still even now i have sufficient affection for you to wish for your safety supposingshe laid an anxious hand on his armsupposing m aksakoff played you false and you were trapped into taking this siberian journeywhat would i do ah no my friend believe me it is best to treat with this diplomatist in london there you are safe hereshe shook her head warningly she could not have made a speech as she very well knew more likely to provoke demetrius into remaining in his enemys camp he had accepted her disavowal of mrs penworthys gossip and yet now that she asked him to go urged him to depart even in askews company his incurable suspicion made him hesitate i shall stay here and see aksakoff he announced doggedly very good assented lady jim accepting the fiat he is coming to luncheon you can speak to him then why to luncheon asked the doctor sharply why not demanded leah up in arms on the instant when we are married your enemies shall be my enemies until then my friendsof whom m aksakoff is oneshall be my own she became less imperative in her speech and looks dropping to a conversational tone if you must know katinka asked her father to call while he was in paris i could not do less than ask him to luncheon could i a less clever woman would have made a less frivolous excuse and despite his cleverness demetrius was gulled into accepting the false as genuinely true you will permit that i go to brush my clothesto remove the dust of travel he asked politely i return soon to meet m aksakoff halfpast two is the time said leah with a careless glance at the gimcrack clock on the mantelpiece and perhaps it will be safer for you to meet him in my presence at my table he can scarcely arrest you there one moment as demetrius turned to go with a hasty bow mention our engagement to him privately i do not wish miss tallentire to know as she would probably tell lionel kaimes and then the familyvery rightly toowould be shocked you can always depend upon my discretion madame murmured the doctor bowing over her hand and brusquely departed with the air of a conqueror lady jim rubbed the kiss from her hand with vehemence and flew to the window where she watched as eagerly as sister anne on bluebeards castletop the dapper little figure emerged from the grand portal and strutted victoriously down the street leah nodded complacently he was now in the toils and moreover was voluntarily binding himself in bonds all the better there could be no compunction on her part in betraying such a heedless fool if he would insist upon letting his jealous heart govern his usually wise head it was impolitic to prevent him with sudden thankfulness lady jim fished out of her pocket a ruffled peacocks feather my luck holdsit holds said she kissing the fetish you always bring me luckdeardear and she kissed again this religious ceremony ended the fortunate lady looked again at the clock it was five minutes past one sitting down at a sidetable she wrote a note sealed it and delivered it to an obsequious waiter with directions for its delivery at the russian embassy and lay two extra places at luncheon she ordered two gentlemen are coming in this way m aksakoff had the unexpected pleasure of partaking of lady jims hospitality chapter xxiv alone and punctual hungry for midday victuals and eager to impart newly acquired knowledge miss tallentire returned from studying the luxor obelisk her coming upon the hour and solitary state were noted but a secondhand rendering of hieroglyphic lore could be dispensed with by a lady entertaining a more modernminded guest aksakoff with a notable sparkle in his eyesbegotten by confidential conversation with his hostessrose to welcome the fair interrupter international courtesies were exchanged while leah glancing impatiently at the clock waited for their conclusion to slip in a question or so where is mr askew why did he not bring you back he did lady james as far as the lift he is now writing a letter in the smokingroom and so will forget that i asked him to luncheon please remind him dear or better tell the waiter to bring him up m demetrius is coming also dr demetrius joan paused in her exit i did not know that he was in paris lady james nor did i until an hour ago dont lose time dear mr askew may go and i particularly wish him to stay lady jim ushered the girl out hurriedly judiciously saw to the lady jim ushered the girl out hurriedly and judiciously saw to the closing of the door before turning to meet aksakoffs inquiring gaze you approve of a full table madame there is safety in numbers she assured him for m demetrius leah resumed her seat with raised eyebrows i fear you will think me dull m aksakoff but i do not understand the diplomatist bowed an apology he had forgotten that even in private her comedy was to be played by the book the conversation of the next few minutes he foresaw very plainly she would play round the reason for their meeting without coming to grips mysteriously conveying her meaning in speeches which she did not mean only a politician of aksakoffs subtlety would have understood the unsaid from what she now proceeded to say besidesshe was continuing the speech interrupted by his bowyou promised that no harm should come to the doctor madame i renew that promise i hope so otherwise i shall regret having consented to this meeting yet i understood that m demetrius desired it that is no reason why i should consent possibly not still as a peacemaker you put me into the beatitudes then why not if you achieve your object in reconciling enemies the signing of the treaty depends upon you m aksakoff consider it signedon conditions which means that it is not signed hm m demetrius is anxious even willing to renounce your daughter a dull red stained aksakoffs opaque skin how flattering to my fatherly pride there is thenthe hint was delicateanother lady jim retorted in kind so you said at monte carlo mademoiselle ninette i believe i did she lured him to paris then how should i know he has never mentioned the creatures name to me nor would he dare to he came so he declares to see me on matters connected with your recent loss no doubt it is more than probable her avoidance of the necessary topic exasperated him sharp words were on the tip of his tongue but wisdom withheld them his accomplice was not the woman to yield to dominance and the merest hint of its exercise might probably would engender wrath likely to jeopardise the almost achieved plot money or no moneyaksakoff still ascribed mercenary reasonsher pride would never bend to the yoke of advice to be silent was his second thought and silent he became this it would seem was wise since she began to explain aksakoff paying out liberally the necessary rope that she might hang herself m demetrius is unwise to come here i told him so yes i confessremember my warningthat i betrayed you all the samevery foolishly i thinkhe insisted upon an immediate meeting to recover his birthright he says can you arrange for the rehabilitation of this exiled esau a faint smile played round the diplomatists thin lips i can and you will assuredly if m demetrius disabuses katinka of her infatuation that is his affair and yours no doubtshe spoke meaninglyyou will wish to speak to him privately there is no need madame seeing that you are in his confidence and in mine besidesvery slowlywe can converse over our tea lady jims nerves jumped over tea she echoed equally slowlytea after luncheon it is a russian custom m demetrius and i are russians still if the suggestion appears presumptuoushe waved his hand with assumed deprecationi withdraw it and apologise no she passed her tongue over dry white lips and answered faintly you shall have yourtea then rising hurriedly she made for the near window on an obvious excuse i do not see him coming as plainly as though aksakoff had put it into words did lady jim know that he intended to drug their victim what would occur if this plotter succeeded she did not know what might occur she shivered to think of and the thought made her rash the police she murmured turning from the window m aksakoff joined her adjusting his pincenez leisurely and proceeded to look up and down the street two stories below i do not see the police madame but what a delightful day i trust the night will be equally mild since i journey to havre you go to havretonight breathed leah not yet herself by a moderately late train my cousin count petrovitch is there with his yacht we have to talk about his possible marriage with my daughter before he leaves tomorrow for kronstadt oh sighed lady jim very white howhowamusing and after misusing the word she went back to her chair with geographical thoughts parishavrekronstadtsiberia and demetrius oh sighed she again with a trembling hand shielding her eyes you are ailing madame cried aksakoff hastening to her politely starving replied leah with a wry smile hush the warning hissed through the chatter of joan and askew who entered almost riotously happy their exuberant manners and frank speech brought a wholesome breeze of cleansing honesty into the atmosphere of stale rascality the bracing wind blew lady jim out of dark chambers into the daylit spaces of the commonplace with the protean capability of women she flashed as a sun from passing stormclouds to shine on the honest and hungry thanks awfully for your invitation to luncheon said askew which you forgot did i ever receive it he asked doubtfully did not my last remark imply the invitation remarkable so irrelevant sounded the last word that aksakoff queried its reason not that a man should forget an invitation she explained but that a single meal should escape his greedy memory you make me out to be a gourmet hinted the invited guest why not a gourmand one speaks french in paris not invariably since we now converse in english said askew dryly and she approved of the retort clearly he was rapidly recovering from the greensickness of crude passion meantime joan instructed aksakoff in ancient history the hieroglyphics on the place de la concorde obelisk describe the triumphs of rameses ii who reigned over egypt in the fourteenth century before christ mr askew knows him indeed smiled lady jim is he stopping in paris miss tallentire means to say that i know of him well i said so but my english is faulty mr askew will surely improve it his knowledge of hieroglyphics the guidebooks knowledge lady james corrected askew hum information while you waitmurray and baedekers extract of historyarcheological tabloids what felicitous phrases sarcasm that surely meansconvalescence you have been ill then monsieur aksakoff addressed the colouring young gentleman heartdisease flashed lady jim gailyah m demetriusand so did her exlover out of a retort you know miss tallentiremr askew they were at firmingham if you remember and m aksakoff who will doubtless recall dr demetrius say prince constantine demetrius madame you place me too high said the doctor bowing stiffly out of russia i am but a simple physician and a remarkably clever one according to this lady madame flatters i failed where i should have succeeded leah murmured a sharp aside reproving the professional humility which necessitated an allusion to her loss a bowing waiter entered before the doctors apologetic shrug could be followed by words madame is served said the waiter and the lift lowered five hungry people to the diningroom says a disciple of brillatsavarin with solemn truth and the infallible judgment of experience breakfast in scotland lunch in america and dine in paris circumstances prevented lady jim from dispensing boston hospitality but having supervised the ideas of the henritrois chef she placed a very dainty and tempting repast before a quartette almost too hungry to be critical nor was wanting wine chosen with masculine discretion to loosen rusty tongues and release fair thoughts embedded in slow brains but this latter adjective must be takenvery appropriately at tablewith a grain of salt none of those who ate and drank were dull three of them indeed were much too clever and the remaining two made up in sparkle what they lacked in depth many good things were eaten and said during that merry meal and the corner near the large window bubbled with laughter leah watching stealthily the courtesy of aksakoff and his fellowcountryman shivered internally at the irony of circumstances parishavrekronstadtsiberia the four names repeated themselves dolorously in her brain like a street cry what wonder then that the spectacle of this tragic comedy made her laugh and babble and smile and nod and play to perfection the rle of an attentive hostess she was quite glad that what would prove in all probability to be her victims last civilised meal was appetising aksakoff professed himself charmed with her esprit here thought he were the makings of an ideal conspirator and he regretted her nationality the anglosaxon nature is so alien to working molefashion yet had he only known the truth lady jim had already proved her willingness to conspire if not against a throne at least for the cheating of a limited company the luncheon was thus pleasant and not less so the digestive hour when the repleted guests assembled in the sittingroom anxious to afford the diplomatist every assistance lady jim gathered the young people under her wing near the piano at the far end of the apartment joan who had more of a soul than a memory for music played scraps chatting to right and left while her nimble fingers ran from mozart to chopin and attempted what their owner remembered of wagners creations thus the muscovites smoking by special permission were enabled to exchange views in comparative privacy to assure complete secrecy and with the holeandcorner instinct of the slav they talked russian with a bluntness strangely opposed to lady jims elusive suggestiveness the situationto demetrius at leastdid not admit of sugared phrases or ambiguous explanations madame yonderhe nodded towards leahtold you why i desired this interview yesaksakoff handled his cigarette daintilybut an explanation from you is necessary demetrius nodded brusquely i must mention the name of your daughter without doubt since her welfare is the main object of our meeting mademoiselle aksakoff said demetrius coldly has done me the honour to admire me but that my affections are already engaged i should certainly reciprocate you allude to mademoiselle ninette a look of surprise flitted across the others face the actress why should you think so rumour credits you with being her lover and as usual rumour is wrong mademoiselle ninette was assuredly my patient but i received my fees in gold not in kisses as poor dr demetrius i i cannot live on love ivan aksakoff prince constantine will be able to do so with the lady he mentions i mentioned no lady ah pardon aksakoff was foiled you accept my apology none is needed i intended to tell you the name of the lady ivan aksakoff it is madame yonder with uplifted eyebrows the diplomatist glanced in the direction of leah i heard something in london clubs of your admiration for her constantine demetrius even before her husband died it was said that you had laid yourself at her feet what a pity you cannot marry her an ideal match my friend quite ideal and so useful in promoting a social understanding between holy russia and these islanders we marry in a year announced the doctor calmly ah no but pardon me it is impossible aksakoff really and truly startled dropped his cigarette that haughty lady james kaimes should it is quite impossible said he staring i refer you to the lady herself insisted demetrius aaah droned the other picking up his cigarette to place it in the ashtray and lighting another yes he stared again at his companion then stole a glance at leah apparently her desire to assist muscovite politics was not entirely a question of pounds shillings and pence she was less sordid and more subtle than he had guessed demetrius giving him no time to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion went on with his explanation you will therefore understand that my marriage with your daughter is out of the question of course assented aksakoff absently and wondering why lady jim engaged herself to this exile of course he added more briskly i trust you will permit me to announce this engagement to my daughter certainly it will show her that that you are unworthy of her hand ended aksakoff sharply for here the father overleaped the diplomatist quite so ivan aksakoff and i hope soon to congratulate the countess petrovitch you are too good constantine demetrius in return for thus arranging your domestic affairs continued the doctor unmoved by the sarcasm will you gain my pardon from the czar can you gain it he asked with emphasis i can and will my title my money both shall be restored and of course added aksakoff with a keen glance you will no longer work in what you term the sacred cause of humanity demetrius waved his hand gloomily dreams of youthdesires for the impossible i am aware he added bitterly that individuality in a bureaucratic administration is looked upon as a crime can you wonder at it if one wheel refuses to fit in with another the machine will not work we are all parts of a mighty engine which crushes the poor and the weak what matter since you constantine demetrius are neither poor nor weak my sympathy a most dangerous word current only in that utopia you dreamed of it is not in the russian dictionary demetrius turned on the scoffer a glittering eye it will be some day said he slowly my friendaksakoff shook the ash from his cigaretteif you propose to edit dictionaries you must remain dr demetriusin exile i gladly would rejoined the other heartily only his voice died away as he looked towards lady jim the diplomatist laughed there is always a woman ah these dear ladies how practical they are in their hands we are wax which they mould after the honey is squeezed out he laughed again then resumed businesslike you will write to my daughter and place the truth of this engagement beyond question tomorrow ivan aksakoff when i am in london and needless to say i shall always profoundly respect mademoiselle your daughter you mean the countess petrovitch if you can so far bend her to your ambition retorted demetrius you promise then to right me with the czar aksakoff nodded and laughed cynically you are already prince constantine demetrius rich honoured andunsympathetic the doctor winced at the last word but shook hands on the agreement lady jim glanced across the room with judas and his kiss in her mind that the cap fitted her also she did not consider for the moment coffee coffee cried the pianist rising just what i want it is tea on this occasion replied leah and went over to take charge of the tray brought in by a smiling waiter tea joan echoed the word in an amazed voice and tripped like a fairy towards a comfortable low chair who ever heard of tea in the middle of the day australian colonists in the back blocks explained askew sauntering to assist in arranging a harlequin set of cups they drink tea at all hours in russia also remarked lady jim jingling the saucers this is a concession to the prejudices of our foreign guests and she laughed amiably at the muscovites demetrius bowed and smiled twisting his waxed moustache with admiring glances at leahs red hair he was far from suspecting a snare and that aksakoff should have a finger and thumb in his waistcoatpocket did not seem remarkable but lady jimnervously on the alertguessed that the diplomatist was fiddling with something of a narcotic nature also his significant glance at her at the teacups at demetrius hinted at her duty she fulfilled it with a spasm of fear well masked by frivolity joan i have dropped my handkerchiefnear the piano i think will you please look for it miss tallentire rose to be anticipated as leah guessed she would be by two attentive gentlemen allow me permit me mademoiselle and with askew demetrius crossed for the search while lady jim ran on lightly it might be on the floor near you joan what a nuisance how stupid of me then joan looked on the carpetleah also the latter straining her ears to hear the almost inaudible the faint tinkle of a pellet dropped into a cup sounded to her guilty soul like a clap of thunder here it is cried joan fishing under the table and picking up what lady jim had purposely dropped thanks awfully dear mr askew m demetrius do not trouble give me the teapot joan ah she babbled on while filling the cupswhat a pity we have not glasses so that you could drink the tea in your own fashion m demetrius m aksakoff we did so enjoy the novelty at your monte carlo villa still here is a lemon slice it joan dear do sit down doctor m aksakoff you can be waiter allow me cried askew half rising sit where you are said leah sharply youll upset the table m aksakoff with pleasure madame and he obliged her with stiff cordiality leah wiped her lips which were dry and stole a stealthy glance at the cup which he handed to the doctor it was of a deep blue colour augh she breathed as he set it to his lips you are wearied with your duties madame conjectured aksakoff sipping with gusto and i alas can relieve you only by acting as waiter you are a guest now she rejoined with a nervous laugh is the tea to your liking most delightful tea said demetrius courteously you compliment the decoction too highly tea on the continent is like rain in the sahara i except russia of course she ended smiling you will find us english in many ways when you visit moscow madame leah looked inquisitively at aksakoff who spoke guessing that he was in possession of the truth and wondering what he thought of the engagement the mans face betrayed nothing however and her gaze travelled to demetrius he was sitting perfectly still and his eyes looked dull as though the fire of life was dwindling within meeting her smile he roused himself with a jerk and an apology i feel sleepythe heat no doubt he murmured i cant say that i feel scorching said askew glancing through the window at a grey sky you are used to the tropics m demetrius is not observed aksakoff joan laughed you remind me of a horrid story my brother told me an old angloindian was being cremated at woking and said that it was the first time he had felt warm in england a horrid story indeed murmured lady jim with her eyes on the expressionless face of demetrius you shouldnt tell it dear then she rose hurriedly are you quite well m demetrius oh yesquite the doctors voice droned into an inarticulate mumble and his head fell forward oh mr askewm aksakoffwhat it the matter his eyes are closed his breathingjust listen kind of fit perhaps said askew rising to shake demetrius and so extorted a cry from the kindhearted hostess dontthe man is ill oh how dreadful loosen his collaropen the window i wonder if he needs a doctor and she stepped to the electric button of the bell there might be one in the hotel said aksakoff as joan and askew obeyed her directions and from the tone of his voice she knew that there was one in the hotel it really seems to be a kind of fit said aksakoff looking at the now unconscious man yet he appeared to be quite well a few minutes ago leah did not hear she was already at the door issuing hurried instructions to a waiter whose smile had vanished when she came back the two men had placed demetrius on the sofa where he lay breathing heavily his face white and his lips purple not a pleasant sight by any means as askew thought had not you ladies better retire he suggested no no they cried in one breath we must help only the doctor can do thatif there is one said aksakoff observing his handiwork on the sofa with a critical eye then at the tail of a triple rap entered the fat proprietor of the henri trois scared in looks and importantly fussy in manner behind him glided a spickandspan man not unlike demetrius and unmistakably tartar dr helfmann happened to be luncheoning explained m gravier fortunately what is the matter madame helfmann soon explained that he felt the pulse of the patient laid a gentle hand on a weaklybeating heart and turned up the purple eyelids askew and aksakoff stood aside with the proprietor lady jim and joan bent forward with pale faces and clasped hands anxious for the verdict a kind of fit explained the doctor he will be insensible for twothree hours in my hotel achthe scandal cried gravier spreading his fat hands in dismay is it really a fit asked lady jim paying no attention madamethe doctor faced her coldlyto speak technically would not enlighten you i can bring this gentleman back to his senses but i thinkwith your permission added he bowing that if you will permit me to take him in a cab to a chemists shop where i can procure the drug i require it will save time and in this casehe glanced calmly at the unconscious mantime means life ugh said askew take him away at once if you think it is better murmured lady jim not daring to meet the victorious eye of the diplomatist of course rejoined askew brusquely you and miss tallentire can do nothing and the sight is not a pleasant one joan lady jim drew the girl away and passed with her into the bedroom adjoining there behind a closed door they listened to the sound of a body being removed the scraping of feet the heavy breathing of ladened men the bumping and humping of something soft horrible suggestionthey could hear these intimations of removal very plainly leah sat on the bed with tightly clasped hands between slack knees augh said leah it is all right lady james said joan petting her poor m demetrius will soon be all right i wonder what made him ill i wonder echoed lady jim and wondered very truly she could not understand what drug aksakoff had used to reduce demetrius so rapidly to unconsciousness and not another word was spoken for ten minutes they have driven away in a fiacre announced miss tallentire from the window who have driven that doctor and m demetrius not m aksakoff before her question could be answered a sharp knock came to the door and aksakoff presented himself when it was opened all is well dear ladies said he blandly dr helfmann has gone with our sick friend mr askew follows to see that all is well askew follows said lady jim with a sharp glance but why the diplomatist still smiled he has a kind heart that young mr askew and so he shrugged then bowed to joan i compliment you mademoiselle on your courage you also madame and now all being well i must take my leave he kissed lady jims hand i shall see you again in london as tonight i journey to havre he went out and leah again heard four names as though a ghostly porter was calling them at a ghostly junction paris havre kronstadt siberia said the ghostly porter ugh said lady jim chapter xxv joan was less surprised than a better informed lady when no word of the sick mans progress came to hand aksakoff was presumably at havre and askew having missed the fiacre and called uselessly at a chemists shop indicated by helfmann clamoured for information unacquainted with the address of demetrius no information could be given by lady jim but she proffered a suggestion to keep the budding philanthropist quiet he might be in an hospital he might ill go the round do she assented cordially and quite easy in her mind about this needleinahaystack search so askew wisely acting immediately on an impulse that could not last set forth on his quest only to drift across the path of an old shipmate the meeting led to cocktails at the american bar and the consumption of these involved the callingup of a past which made the exnavy man long to nose the outtrail once more that his friend who did business in great waters should know of a cleanbuilt schooneryacht for sale at a ridiculously low price was natural and equally natural was askews determination to cross the channel that very day lest the desirable vessel should be snapped up thus it came about that he presented himself to leah prior to an immediate departure without recurring to the quest lady jim however could not forbear a taunt and your philanthropic search she inquired askew coloured laughed and shrugged demetrius is no kith or kin of mine was his excuse and wouldnt do as much for me i doubt sides hes probably on his legs by now and will come skipping along to see you if he does i shall advise him of your charity no dont urged the youth coolly hell be giving me a testimonial leah laughed goodhumouredly well goodbye and she shook hands thanks for your company joan has enjoyed it immensely and you ah with a sigh and a twinkle think what i have lost meaning me meaning you man of lightning moods philanthropy loveten minutes of each shall i see you in london oheryes but if i can annex this schooner at a fair price im thinking of a cruise in pacific waters he grew red and uneasy shifting from one foot to the other i might that means you will hm the first case i ever knew of a man being off with the new love and on with the old butshe held up a fingeri claim a visit before you go askew seized her hand i promise then coaxingly we are friends parting friends and i have already shaken hands with you twice au revoir till curzon street and nodding him godspeed she retired to consider possibilities of preventing a speedy departure poor woman no sooner had she cleared away one obstacle than another bulked in the path and these unfortunately she could not leap over or go round they had to be removed by toilsome pickandshovel work what a mercy demetrius is disposed of said lady jim to her mirror two new wrinkles i shant give that silly boy the chance of adding a third on the morning of departure from paris leah received a letter from demetrius which she showed to joan almost as soon as the train steamed out of the gard du nord a week of talk in paris and five years study in england had instructed miss tallentire insufficiently in the french tongue therefore did she wilt away at the sight of the epistle lady jim translated he is still ill in some hotelshe was careful not to give the addressbut better much better later he proposes to go to russia i thought he was an exile said joan doubtfully he is i think the folly of risking his liberty in st petersburg is apparent but he hopes to cajole the czar into granting his pardon mm leah packed away the letter in her dressingbag i daresay we shall hear of him next in siberia joan opened a pair of horrified eyes lady james oh its a charming place they say and not at all so disagreeable as people make out the climate is much more delightful than our own dear and the society really intellectual the russians send all their clever people there you know i am sure dr demetrius will be very comfortable exile to siberia it sounds horrible yessounds but isnt you have been reading tolstoy and seeing melodramas my dear i thought dr demetrius loved you said joan suddenly oh he did the man was a perfect nuisance but you see i did not love him no no of course you would not i never meant that as poor dear lord jamess wife you could not and as poor dear lord jamess widow i can only i dont miss tallentire was still confused you must think me dreadfully rudeoh dreadfully she murmured regretting an unintentional insinuation i think you dreadfully innocent and dreadfully sweet said leah kissing the flushed face im talking like that horrid mulrady girl where do these americans pick up their adjectives even while chatting and while the train tore through a bleak landscape almost blotted out with rain leah wondered who had written the letter not demetrius certainly although the calligraphy would have caused an expert to commit perjury aksakoff was more clever with tongue than pen so leah fell back on helfmann as a possible forger assuredly she did not believe that he was a medical man and his fortunate presence at the needed hour argued a carefully laid plot the fiacre probably drove to st lazare and thence helfmann had no doubt personally conducted his patient to havre to be shipped on board the petrovitch yacht now the boat was kicking her way through the grey northern seas and demetrius in possession of his senses was looking forward to a forced passage across the urals an unpleasant journey at this time of the year but needful for men who wanted more than was good for them and thank god this particular man was out of her life for ever while offering up the hasty prayer lady jim touched the peacocks feather tucked away in her pocket and felt that life really was worth living when one knew how to dispose of disagreeable people perhaps the prayer addressed to a deity other than the fetish made the domestic god sulky but he or it certainly did not expedite leahs journey to curzon street for two weary days wind and rain stormy waves and overcautious officials detained the travellers in calais a hurricane that would have done credit to the south seas made the channel impassible and the waves that britannia is supposed to rule rebelled furiously against her white cliffs leah inconceivably bored watched the gusty hours through streaming panes and wondered if the gale extended to the mediterranean if so the ducal yacht with frith and his father on board must be having a pitchandtoss time of the worst the duke was no hardened mariner and uncomfortable motions prolonged to excess might make a man of his age so ill that he would here leahs vivid imagination produced a shudder she did not wish the kindly old duke to die of exhaustion not that she cared overmuch for him but frith succeeding to unlimited moneybags would be less easy to manage in the important matter of occasional cheques the insurance money would not last for ever with one of her tastes and after allsince this greedy captain strange would insist upon his duesshe had only twentynine thousand pounds then jim would want ready money and his demandsshe knew him of oldwould probably be shameless of course seeing that on the face of it he was involved deeper than she was in a shady conspiracy he could be told to mind his own business and marry seorita fajardo if desirous of being kept like a gentleman but to avoid unnecessary trouble it was probable that she would have to send him a trifle how dreadful it was to think that a single shilling of that hardlyearned money should slip through her fingers but the harpies had to be appeased or driven away she could not achieve the last therefore her pursestrings would have to be unloosened already the pockets of strange gaped hungrily and it was her hard fate to fill them so absurd grumbled lady jim as the wind whimpered and the rain lashed the glass in the middle ages one could have hired a nice bravo to put him out of the way and there would not have been even funeral expenses i must pay i suppose but ill see if the beast will not take the money by instalments there is always the chance that he might be drowned between paymentsand i hope he will be she ended devoutly in this amiable frame of mind she arrived at curzon street after sending joan brimful of continental experiences to the less fashionable district of lambeth the house looked cosy the servants were attentive the insurance money swelled her bank account and best of all demetrius was posting towards siberia on the whole things were tolerableit was not leahs custom to indulge in superlativesso she decided to remain for a week or two in london prior to being bored at firmingham where the marchioness awaited the homecoming of the yachting party after her late efforts in the cause of politics lady jim felt that she really could not stand hildas artificial childishness without an intermezzo of amusement but fun of any sort was hard to find since her widowhood and the emptiness of town precluded indulgence piccadilly and the park st jamess street and pall mall were as barren of pleasure and a fashionable population as that siberia towards which demetrius unwillingly journeyed even lady canvey had moved out of the early victorian room into more modern surroundings at nice askew certainly paid his promised visit but he proved to be dull thinking more of the yacht than the woman the technical terms he employed in describing his purchase made lady jim yawn and she decided that like all men he was unutterably selfish however she was sufficiently kindheartedand diplomaticto show him the pseudo letter and translate it for his benefit told you so said he when in possession of misleading facts the beggars all rightbe on his legs in a jiffy thanks to your care dont rub it into a fellow lady jim lady james lady james it is though it seems to me that we are to be merely acquaintances most of my friends are acquaintances but i want this acquaintance to be a friend what an exacting nature wellwith a sighi suppose as you have loved and i have lost we can be friends till you marry why not after dear mr askew a bachelor selects his own friends a wife chooses those of her husband meantime you are a nice boy if somewhat fickle and i like you sufficiently to let you go when does this ship of yours go south schooner lady jimschooneryacht two hundred tons lloyds measurement and you explained that before did i yes of course well she is a beauty ah the same term was applied to me once and by a man who said that he would love me for ever i dont believe i was ever so crude retorted askew bluntly you dont tell a lady that she is a beauty though you might say it to a shopgirl really i dont know any people of that class you do apparently the young man grew red and wriggled like a speared eel thinking how very like a woman she was she did not want him and she did want him she told him to go and wished him to stop she pardoned his fickleness yet kept it in mind ah you bundle of contradictions why not say a woman one word explains your three i like to be verbose said askew sulkily you always arefirst about me and then about this ship thing i suppose the fajardo woman will be the next dont speak of her like that why not she is my rival i should be more than mortal if i forgave her and less than a woman if i did not say nasty things about her say them about me then i have been doing my best and really you take a ragging very well there poor boyshe patted his cheeki shant tease you any more when do you sail in three weeks for buenos ayres of course oh true and eager lover dine with me next thursday and we can talk about her youll be nasty about the ship oh no i thought you meant lola perhaps i did both ship and woman are hers you know next thursday i shall be delighted you look it do try and conceal your emotions better askew laughed and took up his hat she was more like a mosquito than a human being and he made for the door weary of being stung i would rather be your friend than your husband lady jim he said coolly what a compliment seeing what husbands are i ought to know oh pardon mei forgot he stuttered much confused she shook her head at him gravely what a child in arms you are to this last piece of impertinence askew would have replied rather sharply thereby proving the truth of her remark but that the door was blocked by a tall lean man m aksakoff announced the footman behind the newcomer goodday lady james goodday m aksakoff and goodbye leah when alone with the diplomatist felt her heart leap at the solemnity of his looks she fancied that he might have come to tell her of the doctors escape in reality aksakoff was wondering how he could pay her two thousand pounds without turning the arranged comedy into a drama feeling his way he allowed her the first word you will stop to luncheon said lady jim amiably i trespass too much on your hospitality dear madame you must have had enough of me at our last luncheon in paris oh i have forgotten all about paris and she gave him a look which intimated that he also should feign forgetfulness ah no but pardon me i came to inquire about m demetrius why from me i know nothing waiti do know something he wrote me a letter saying he was better and intended to go to russia probably to see petrovitch about his pardon i wish i had seen him before he left paris and the diplomatist smiled when the letter was mentioned did you not see him aksakoff raised his eyebrows but it was impossible madame he explained without even a wink dr helfmann took him away in the fiacre and i departed for havre i did not return to paris i see your business at havre detained you longer than i expected said the diplomatist taking his cue you see madame i was forced to repeat my conversation with m demetrius to my cousin the count i expect that he wrote to paris and told m demetrius to come to havre for a conversation without knowing his address how clever aksakoff laughed you have me there madame i really dont know what you mean how is katinka she is at brussels in good health i believe does she know that m demetrius has gone to st petersburg possibly he had to write announcing his engagement to you if he expected lady jim to be taken aback by this abrupt speech he was mistaken in the woman whose aplomb he should have known she merely laughed and dropped out a ready lie with slow amusement ah my dear m aksakoff clever linguists as you russians are your comprehension of the english language is limitedvery very limited m demetrius should have known that in our tongue one word may have several meanings seea diocese seeto perceive by the eye your illustration is felicitous madame i understand then that m demetrius translated no as yes oh he was by no means so stupid as that the man bothered me with attentions for months and was quite a nuisance i nearly spoke to poor dear jim about his smirking grinning compliments he talked of me in clubs and followed everywhere sighing like a furnaceif a furnace ever does sigh i speak on shakespeares authority to keep the creature quiet i said something which he apparently misconstrueda sop to cerberus a cake to a child you understand i think so there was no engagement none at all how impertinent of him to suggest such a thing when my husband is scarcely cold in his grave but i pardon him on account of his ignorance of our language which undoubtedly led him into error when i see him again i shall explain myself in a way which he will probably find disagreeable aksakoff smiled imperceptibly m demetrius is much to blame madame for not having given more attention to your english grammar i go to st petersburg myself in a week perhaps you will give me some message to him no the man is a fool and i never wish to hear about him again your command shall be obeyed from this moment his name shall never be mentioned by me and he mentally admired the clever way in which she had wriggled out of an untenable situation but the object of his visit had still to be approached and at this moment an inspiration how to approach it came opportunely the mention of poor dear jim suggested lines upon which he might proceed with safety i come on a serious errand madame said he softly yes she did not know what he meant and under the circumstances did not intend to inquire to advance under the guns of masked batteries was never leahs mode of campaigning your husbandpardon your late husbandplayed bridge said the diplomatist so crudely as to render himself unworthy of the name i believe he did assuredly and with me on occasions twelve months ago we were a party of five at torquay i believe jim did go there sometimes go on it is hard to go on madame said aksakoff with feigned nervousness as i have a confession to make i grant you absolution beforehand you are too good then i can repay you by handing over the money what money my losses at bridge yes with your husband and others i played a great dealunfortunately for my pockets she noticed the misused plural and smiled most people made that remark grammatically when they played with jim so you lost two thousand pounds the exact sum he had mentioned at monte carlo at once she saw that he wished to pay wages on a sufficiently plausible pretext the money would have been useful to pay strange and jim so that she could keep her thirty thousand pounds intact but strangely enough in so unscrupulous a woman she could not make up her mind to finger such dirty gold death pays all debts she said quietly on the part of the corpse assuredly but those who live have to reckon with the executors in that case you had better see the marquis of frith he is poor jims executor ah no madame be kind i should have paid this money before but my salary did not permit what would m le marquis say if i confessed that i delayed so long to pay a debt of honour what does it matter so long as you do pay it matters much amongst men said aksakoff stiffly but you a woman and a clever woman he added with emphasis will understand i pray you madame to take my cheque for the full amount and permit my mind to be at rest lady jim priding herself on performing a hard penance for her late rascality shook her head no said she seriously i am quite sure that jim who was often in a hole himself would not have been hard on you had he lived the money would have been a godsend to himi admit that but i really cannot take payment of any gambling debts it would not be right she finished virtuously aksakoff was less surprised than she anticipated her refusal of this money assured him that the story of the engagement was true and that leah had rid herself of an undesirable suitor who had power to compel completion of a forced contract what power demetrius had over her aksakoff could not guess but the whole circumstances showed that her desire had been for the obliteration of the man and not to earn two thousand pounds but nothing of this appeared on his calm face pray take the cheque madame he urged and held it under her nose no no she pushed back her chair from that too alluring bait i cannot take it and i shall say nothing about it stayshe took the fluttering paper from his hand and rose you have paid me on jims behalfis that not so yes aksakoff watched her wondering at this rightaboutface thenshe approached the fire and flung in the chequethe debt is paid and you are free ah but no i say yes lady jim approached him with outstretched hands and a smile which had won her many things you are my friend and not my debtor is it not so he kissed those extended hands madame a hardworking and poor official thanks you my services now and ever are at your command with the thought that demetrius might return unexpectedly from siberia she thanked him i may have to remind you of that some day when and where you will madame his pale eyes lighted up with enthusiastic fire were you my wife i should be an ambassador you may be some day madame aksakoff has talents madame aksakoff ismadame aksakoff and you are well what she demanded smiling an angel how weak all language is weak when used to describe such a woman as you madame i take my leave your servant and my friend to the death madame he went out as stiff and solemn as ever with the conviction that he had parted from jezebels cousingerman nevertheless he admired her prodigiously especially as he intended to put into his own pockets the two thousand pounds she had so tactfully earned and so foolishly rejected the bureaucracy would never hear of her folly and it would be a pity to return money which a poor official could bank against evil days not that aksakoff expected these the capture of demetrius without publicity and so cleverly achieved would gain him infinite credit as an efficient servant of the czar a charming and astute woman he thought gratefully when ruminating on certain advancement but dangerous added prudence leah went about for the next seven days with her head in the air and with a contempt for those people who found renunciation difficult she could renounce with ease had she not refused a large sum of money because she felt that it was wrong to take it what selfdenial she felt aggressively virtuous and but for the circumstances would have liked to trumpet her perfections in the street that she did not do so was further selfdenial and a flattering conscience with which providence had nothing to do assured her that she was a pearl amongst women now that demetrius was out of sight she calmly put him out of mind and began to think how she could prevent askew from spoiling jims nefarious courting of the spanish lady there was no way so far as she could see since the sailors love had grown cold and she had no bonds in which to bind him but she trusted to that luck which the fetish always sent her way and sure enough the luck came but some weeks later beforehand the fetish still annoyed by her prayer to another god sent her a reminder that it could be disagreeable a bolt from the blue came in the shape of a telegram from firmingham come to me at once wired the marchioness yacht lost off brest duke and frith and most of crew drowned come she might have spared the last word said leah staring and stunned chapter xxvi lady jim boarded a special train to firmingham in a royal rage the more riotous for necessary suppression after the shock of the unexpected had passed she gave a flitting thought of pity to her drowned relatives and reverted hastily to selfish considerations solitude permitting the play of temper she punished the fetish by flinging its outward and visible sign of a peacocks feather from the compartment which witnessed the unmasking that her baal should have played her such a trick was intolerable and still more intolerable the thought that circumstances muzzled her for the first time in her victorious life leah kaimes dealt with a fixed decree against which there was no appeal what could she do nothing to make chaos of a continent would not have relieved her feelings and there was nothing to wreck in the limited space of the carriage unable to sit still she threw herself from seat to seat feeling like a caged tiger with the added savagery of a trained intellect unlike the beast she had the use of speech to vent her wrath but this she did not utilise from a conviction that no words would do justice to the situation a texan muledrivers vocabulary would have fallen short of her requirements her impotent anger was like that of a dog leaping and slavering against an offending but unreachable moon and the factsthe hard ironic facts which she could not do away with scheme as she might those inflexible actualities buzzed in her brain until repetition took the rhythm of the droning wheels underfoot pentland was dead along with his son and heir hilda a widow with two girl babies who did not count in the succession jim was wiped out of social existence and by her own act remained lionel the curate the prig her one honest manthe duke of pentland leah could have screamed in the face of this crushing truth a title at the best fifty thousand a year three country seats a town house spacious and crammed with beautiful things and a scotch moor with an adorable shootingbox this was the heritage of the new peer of a milkandwater parson raged lady jim unjustly who will waste everything in charity and turn the houses into pigsties for the unclean oh lord to think that such a clerical ass should get the inside runnings this latter phrase she had picked up from miss mulrady and at the moment it seemed expressive the position would not bear thinking about yet she had to think appealing betweenwhiles to the godsofthingsastheyare for reasons to justify such shabby treatment what had she done that they should be so disagreeable it was enough to make a truly virtuous woman as she assuredly could call herself dance a cancan in piccadilly then she desisted for a few moments from calling the unseen bad names to lament over her own shortsightedness to think that she should have sold jims birthright for thirty thousand pounds it was not even one years income of the pentland estates she would have been a duchess too not that she personally cared for rank but with a higher position she could have trampled the more easily on her enemies a thought of these flashing into her mind made her clench her fists and grit her teeth how they would rejoice the beasts to think what she had missed and by how short a period she had missed it if they had only one neck as caligula desired for his enemies how she would have enjoyed a chop at it oh cried leah banging the cushions and choking in the dust thus raisedif i could only bring jim back it was a kindly wish as she desired him to enjoy the good things that had fallen into his sham grave but there did not seem much chance of achieving the impossible jim was dead and buried and the interment had been legally sanctified by her tears if he came to life it would be difficult to explain how a corpse in his name came to occupy a niche in the kaimes vault also inquiry might lead to the production of a siberian exile if demetrius told the truthwhich he assuredly would do in the face of a betrayal he must guess was her workthere would be no place for her in society and she would starve a social peri at the gates of a forbidden paradise no think as she wouldand think she did till her brain achedthings had to remain as she had foolishly arranged them it was a galling thought to think that none but she who suffered was responsible she could not even lay the blame on the stars but she could and did on the fetish it was something of a relief to have thrown its peacock manifestation out of the window two hours in the railway carriage tamed her unruly nerves into some sort of submission and partially schooled her into accepting the inevitable to make the best of it to rob the new duke shamelessly of money and the curzon street house on the plea of disinheritance were the results at which she arrived by the time firmingham appeared through the carriage windows she had ceased to kick against the pricks the mask was on her face when the train stopped and it was a quiet and demure lady who alighted at the station even the sisterinlaw who entered the great house to console the marchioness was as sympathetic as the most exacting could have required she suppressed a groan when she passed through the doors of the lordly mansion that was really and truly her own but managed by a steady exercise of her strong will to greet colley with great calmness the butler intimated that lady frith wept incessantly in her boudoir and that the duke what queried leah sharply adding more grammatically who his grace the duke my lady he is in the study mr lionel kaimes as was my lady his grace came down last night augh why wasnt there an accident on the line muttered she who longed to announce herself as a genuine duchess and could not i beg pardon my lady oherill go to my room colley tell his grace i shall see him in an hour when she had changed her dress for one heavier with crape as a sign of additional grief and had lain for a miserable forty minutes without closing an eye and had swallowed a muchneeded dose of sal volatile and had relieved her feelings by scolding an unoffending maid she went before the footlights to play her most difficult and unpalatable part the former nobody seated at his predecessors desk rose looking pale and careworn a terrible thing said the new duke giving his hand gravely awful i can scarcely believe it is it really true and she had a passing hope that it might not be seeing she could not benefit only too true unfortunately for those two i suppose you mean youre all right a square peg in a round hole i fear he sighed i would give much that both had survived how unnatural commented lady jim with a grimace but you always were eccentric people wont mind that now you are a duke but i am sorryreallyfor them i mean such an awful thing to be cut off before youve made your arrangements for an agreeable reception in the next world what a mercy they went togetherfor company you know and they say drowning is really quite nice after the first choking is over lionel looked at her sternly but felt helpless she played with the solemn issues of life and death as a child with a bauble would nothing touch her heart would nothing make her serious the flippancy jarred on his overstrung nerves please do not talk like that said he harshly and emphatically please do not i am only trying to cheer you up she answered opening her eyes wide and with a faint smile softening her hard mouth i really criedyou mustnt think me hardhearted really i cried when i heard of the accident i suppose it was an accident i should call it the act of god oh leah could find no very pertinent reply and glided dexterously into another subject to prevent religious instruction i came down to see poor hilda as she wanted me so badly but i thought it best to learn details from you first we must spare the poor things feelings you know lionel ended lady jim thoughtfully his face brightened i am glad you call me that said he earnestly for i confess it is difficult for me to respond to my title youll get used to it she assured him i suppose you will drop the parson now certainly not i am still my masters servant he has merely raised me to a higher and more responsible position in his household raised your wages also murmured leah shrugging i beg your pardon lionel i should not have said that you should not indeed was the pained response its a kind of hysteria apologised lady jim almost at a loss for an excuse like that man who botanised on his mothers grave you know besides people who really feel laugh awfully when sorrow comes and jims death took most of my tearspoor dear jim i daresay you think that i am unfeeling but im notreally and truly im not what with these dear things dying so unexpectedly and my own feeling of widowhood and condolences from people who will say the wrong thing i feel brokenhearted lionel smiled grimly at this incoherent and wholly false explanation you have a strange way of showing grief lady james dont be nasty now that you are up in the world ill be quite different with hilda poor soul though i must be natural with you it is a compliment if you only look at it in the right way which of course with your priggishness you wont and you neednt use that cheap title of mine just to remind me how nearly ive missed being called by a more expensive one i suppose joan will be your duchess do you think she will fill the position admirably how curt there is still a lot of the parson about you lionel and ever will be world without end i suppose hysteria again duke so dont look shocked give me details the young man looked again at this wonderful being for many months he had known the impossibility of altering leahs view of things seen and unseen the most sacred subjects seemed to appeal to her sense of humour and no solemnity could banish the everready smile from her lips in reality he was unjust in thinking thus lady jim considering her losses and the ironic position she occupied only kept herself from shrieking out the truth by giving vent to illtimed frivolities her greatest relief would have been to tell this prig that he was a supplanter hysteria said she was the excuse for unnatural merriment and truly hysteria it was although she could not swear to it unaware of all this turmoil in the mind of the mourner in motley lionel positively thought that troubles had rendered her distraught and so passed over her incongruities the yacht was on her homeward way he explained in the eminently laboured fashion of a landsman when dealing with ships during that storm a week ago she went down off brestcape brest struck on a reef no she sprang a leak and the boats were stove in so no one could be saved in that way by clinging to a spar the steward reached shore he alone survived and lionel covered his face to indulge in a silent prayer for those who had perished lady jim was more practical according to her lights why did you only hear this weekold news yesterday the steward the survivor was ill with fever also he was wounded in the headagainst the rock i suppose the yacht was seen to founder far off shore but no one at brest knew her name when the steward came to himself the other day he explained and the news was telegraphed to the dukes lawyers who sent for me i expect we shall not learn full details till this steward arrives he is now on his way to london and the dukefrith their bodies are in the depths with the ship and those who formed her crew peace be to their souls you neednt worry about that said leah tartly and paying her tribute to the dead i am quite sure that the duke and frith have gone to that heaven youre always talking about it is awful she added pensively and with a shudder but talking only makes it worse ill go and see hilda poor dear lionel followed her to the door lady james let me beg of you to keep theerhysteria in check of course she assured him giving her hand frankly i always adapt my mood to my company it would be useless for one woman to waste hysteria on anotherboth know too much about it ill be niceoh you can be sure of that im not a bad sort my good man sometimes i think you are a very decent sort lady james and on other occasions she questioned unmoved dont ask me i wont you cant explain and will only fib parsons cant keep back an answer whether they know anything of the matter in hand or not but ill be good to that poor babywomanindeed i will and indeed she was swinging round to the opposite extreme with the protean adaptability of her nature besides after the interview with the new duke she felt able to command her feelings better it is only possible to act perfectly when the emotions are under control as lady jim found and if she said what she did not mean and acted as she did not feel well that was the fault of the circumstances into which her treacherous fetish had thrown her but at heart she really had some pity for this useless doll of a woman who sobbed in her arms dont cry dear said leah ardently beginning to console you know how i feel for you i also have lost a husband owing to circumstances she rather choked over this lie but it came out pretty readily i shall nevernever lift up my head again sobbed the latest widow oh yes you will dear replied the earlier one cheerfully look at me hilda shook her head and declined to look frith wasnt jim said she and he wasnt my husband either you feel friths death and i feel jims we each have our own sorrow and time alone will help us to forget the dear departed leahhilda sobbed more violently than everi shall nevernever forget nevernevernevernever i didnt mean forget exactly murmured leah who had been more candid than she intended but time will soothe us and we shall all meet on a happier shore i hope soi hope so the marchioness clasped her hands devoutly and raised her eyes i can see our three dear ones meeting now i wish i could said lady jim truthfully and she felt that the meeting of the kaimes family in heaven would be a sight worth witnessing of course jim was alive but even if he were dead she did not think that hildas vision could possibly become fact the duke who had turned angel in his old age and frith who was always pious had a chance certainly but jim when his turn came would probably not be of the party however the business of consoling a sore heart had to be attended to and leah dosed hilda with all the platitudes which the marchioness had used during a similar and earlier event and lady jim was so admirable an actress that she really deceived herself into thinking that her stageplay was real life her eloquence her attentions her hoverings like a guardian angel over hilda her bringing in the childrenthat was a masterstrokeand her general zeal in drying a mourners tears were truly wonderful by the time she left the marchioness sitting up with his children on her lap soothed and comforted and grateful for leahs kindness poor lady jim felt quite exhausted i do hope there will be a decent dinner she soliloquised in the seclusion of her own room i cant stand much more of this without food through the troubles of death and the joys of birth the worry of weak minds and the scheming of strong ones ever moves the solid business of life connected with eating and sleeping therefore the firmingham cook being a hired servant was sufficiently master of his emotions to send up a really tempting repast the new duke and the disinherited duchess partook of this meal in a small room without attendance wishing to talk family matters they did not desire eavesdropping footmen besides hilda remained in her own apartment nourishing her emotions with red lavender and calling at intervals for bunny to come back lady jim paid several visits to the poor little soul during the evening and each time was successful in cheering her up but it was trying work as again and again she had to begin from the beginning no wonder she looked harassed when seated opposite to her host lionel thanked her gratefully and with reason for hilda had eulogised leah and her work of mercy i knew you would prove yourself a true woman said he pouring her out a glass of champagne oh lord said lady jim sipping the wine and wondered what he would say could he see into her mind give me some of that volauvent lionel it is really very good the man felt slightly disappointed you can eat do you require me to tell you that she asked lightly i have enjoyed every course eati should think so you dont want me to faint as hilda has been doing but your feelings oh they are well under control now and after allleah paused with a fork halfway to her mouthits best to be sensible even when things smash if i had come down to howl about the house where would you have been i really cannot understand your nature lady jim nodded same here i never know what i shall do under given circumstances save keep my poor wits about me were strange beasts lionelstrange beasts he disagreed mindful of her good samaritan kindness you make yourself out to be worse than you are lady james dont you make any such mistake i never seek cheap praise by crying down my virtues were you my fatherconfessorwhich you are notand i religiouswhich i have no inclination to bei should shock you into hildas state poor little thing what an undisciplined mind she has and how she does work for those tyrants the emotions i think you had better send for joan she is used to women who run wild you put things unpleasantly said he uneasily and truthfully answer my question please joan arrives tomorrow with her mother i am glad leah assured him fervently too many female cooks can never spoil the funeral broth the more women you have in a mourning house the better we like to weep in company and to talk obituary notices that is other women do i fancy i have a dash of the man in me and this sort of undertaker rejoicing gives me the creeps lionel secretly agreed with her although he disapproved of the mode of expression ostentatious grief he disliked as most men do and discussing funeral emotions threadbare was not to his healthy liking therefore did he talk business with lady jim it was necessary to distract his attention she said and so set about plundering the heir by the time coffee arrived lionel had promised her the curzon street house as a gift and had agreed to pay all debts as the late duke had arranged also untruthfully assured by leah that her temporal prosperity had suffered by the untimely demise of jim he promised to pay a quarterly thousand a year for the rest of her life yes said lionel emphatically even if you marry lady james i have no intention of marrying yet said leah who was busy with kmmel she really felt that the consoling of a tearful widow required kmmel i thought that mr askew admired you he admires a new schooner he has bought and some woman in south america oh mr askew has a catholic mind i can tell you dr demetrius he has gone to russia i believe on business connected with his pardon didnt joan tell you how he was taken ill in paris yes what a strange thing oh i dont know he once told me that he inherited fitsmothers side it was very rude of him to have one in my rooms but some men are so inconsiderate he loves you or loved mewhich present tense i fancy will you marry him will i marry the emperor of china you mean no thanks i have no wish to live in a country of bounce and bombs and i never could read those novels written by men with unpronounceable names besides i cant bear dapper little men with waxed moustaches i only tolerated dr demetrius because he was useful to jim a great friend of your husbands i believe do you does one generally make a friend of ones doctor the man was certainly credited with being your friend and more he talked openly of his love for you what bad taste i dont see how you can hold me responsible he did love me i believeat least he pestered me with attentions its a mercy he has gone to sii mean to russia i hope hell stay there and be eaten up by white bears like those poor brats elisha was so spiteful to as to marryingher eyes twinkledit wont be easy to replace poor jim he was such a good husband you never said that when he was alive of course not he would have taken advantage of the compliment but jim wasnt bad on the whole he left me alone at all events perhaps his successor will bother me to show public affection as if i wouldor could for the matter of that lady james do you love any one but yourself you and joandear little innocent glasscase dolls that you are yes you may blush and smile but i am really in earnest you were always so rude to me that i knew you to be genuine oh lionel exhibited shocked surprise i hope i was never rude horribly on all occasions if you had not been i never should have believed that you were genuine when people mean what they say and dont want anything from one they are always rude its a kind of trademark i am sure socrates was a man you could always trust and would never have invited to dinner youre something like him only you dont ask questions and are betterlooking i always consider you the one honest man in a world of rogues and if you were not engaged to joan i should marry you lionel coloured still deeper and laughed in an embarrassed fashion i might have something to say to that not at all didnt you hear me say that i should have married you what could you or any man do against me and she laughed with an insolent pride in her beauty and powers by the way she added i have to run up to town tomorrow on business do you mind not at all joan and her mother will be here do exactly what you please lady james call me leah now that you are the head of the family she murmured and laid a gentle hand on his shoulder he threw back his head and met her eyes with a boyish blush leah he breathed very well thenleah lady jim tapped his smooth cheek indulgently you foolish thing she said kindly if it was worth my while i could leaving the sentence unfinished and lionel furious she left the room that shethis hardened coquette of the world should dare to think he would forget the sweetest and best of girls let her sing the song of the sirens as she might he would neverno never prove false to joan but honest as were these thoughts lionel was but a man when all was said and done and the touch on his shoulder the look in her eyes the cooing murmur of her voice made him wince and not unpleasantly well was it for the young man that leah did not choose to try her wiles else he might have been lured towards that pit the edges of which are wreathed with roses had his future duchess been any other than joan the simple a perverse spirit might have led lady jim to indulge in some perilous amusement but she liked the girl and honestly respected lionel therefore did the lover scoff at her magic arts strong only in escaping temptation had leah put forth her powers silly little donkey she thought climbing the stairs as if i couldnt do what i liked it would be a hard battle but i couldi couldi couldonly i shant she finished joan is a dear girl and i am the most worried woman in the world she made the latter part of this final remark again when she conned a brusque and somewhat imperative letter which had arrived by the evening post it came from one richard strange and purported to be written from a thirdrate strand hotel this uncivilised communication intimated that the aforesaid strange would be obligedthis underlinedif her ladyship would afford him an immediate interview mm commented leah glancing suspiciously at the underlined word he isnt sure of his money and means to be nasty if he doesnt get it wellshe heaved a sighhe must be paid i suppose the blackmailing beast and the whole sum down i expect time payments wont be acceptable to a man who writes in this fashion she wrote an artful letter stating that dr demetrius had spoken of his travels with a captain strange and solely because she wished to hear of poor mr garth who had been a protg of her late fatherinlaw she made an appointment at curzon street for five the next evening this epistle which did not recognise existing facts and could be shown to the whole world without betraying anything underhand she sent off at once if possible she would have shirked meeting a man she more than suspected of being a brute but to vanquish danger one must meet it as she very well knew and if he wants more than his thousand thought lady jim again on her way to the widowed marchioness hell find that i am quite equal to deal with him and with a dozen like him if need be a thousand pounds oh lord the greedy wretch then she spread her wings as a ministering angel chapter xxvii no rasped the lean man and his eyes hardened like those of a cat with her claws out you figure it out maam in your own way very prettily i dont deny but my pisgahsights got to be took you bet guess well do th view in a bunch an toss fur lots leah smiled vaguely because she was not sure of her ground and required a translator badly jim had been abstruse on occasions but this seafaring person spoke the shibboleth of a shifting population to excess never having met one of this breed before she did not know how to handle him captain strange was not a muscovite diplomatist who would call black white or even grey to please her and moreover he appeared to be extraordinarily unsympathetic in the presence of lovely woman the magic of sex had worked weakly hitherto and this brusque visitor gave her to understand that he was not to be cajoled into makebelieve conversation he required and declared emphatically that he did require an unvarnished statement of facts to be argued exhaustively so that he might knowas he tersely put itwhere he dropped anchor you dont chuck orangepeel my way maam said the mariner and intended to clinch his assertion by spitting but the sight of the carpet pulled him back to civilisation the friend of demetrius owner and captain of the stormy petrel presented himself as a tall smallboned man with no superfluous flesh on his framework and with a jaw as hardfrom bullying underlingsand as bluefrom close shavingas were his eyes the tint of these added to the blackness of curling hair combined with the racy vernacular which he flung fairly in her face inclined lady jim to class him as an irishamerican but from the discourteous way in which he spokeas they never would have spoken in dear dirty dublinand from his habit of interjecting slang words chosen from the domestic speech of the five nations she was puzzled to fix his nationality accurately as a matter of private history and this she discovered later he was entirely cosmopolitan and out of sheer contrariety owed allegiance to no particular flag not a badlooking freebooter leah decided with his regular features and wellshaped head and white teeth and ruddy cleanshaven face but dangerous was her second and wiser thought she was right the man of many lands was also of many minds but at the back of them all lay the unalterable determination to ride roughshod over any one who would submit as lady jim also held to the same theory of individualism it was not unlikely that a brisk encounter might ensue and for this she was quite prepared meantime she decided that he was picturesque and in his rough blue clothes with a red necktie and barbaric gold rings in his ears and a general air of youbedamnedness would have amused her as a new figure from the underworld but that the large issues of the conversation induced seriousness i dont understand you and i am sure you do not understand me was her observation after digesting the orangepeel parable let it go at that maam but i reckon i kin make mself as clear as any man livin or dead when dollars are in th pool now youhe shook a large brown fingeryou maam give me

me fur a millennium bout them little nippers the last word was pure whitechapel and leah wondered if that parish could claim this buccaneer but time was too valuable to go into his private history so she replied gently quick to perceive that there was a flaw in his armour on another occasion i shall be delighted to talk nursery captain strange but the millennium has not yet arrived in curzon street yve got me there i dont deny cried strange hardening now this here racket as ive sailed longsides t fix up it will be fixed up as you call it at once said lady jim sharply the matter is very

weve bin doin maam leah winced again not liking to run with this ruffian in iniquitous harness you want a thousand pounds well drawled the captain y might say fairer than thet which means that you intend to ask for what you wont get huh guess thetll be as right as pie when i open out you can open out now said lady jim coolly her antagonist admired this bluffing to the extent of slapping his thigh and chuckling like a blackbird over a worm youre a dandy one t deal with fur sure an a woman at that my wordthis was australianif my missus hed bin your sort maam id ha bin walkin a liner as a goldenbarred skipper you kin freeze on t thet straight lady jim laughed not ill pleased aksakoff had paid her some such compliment and it was interesting to see the diverse ways in which the same idea can be expressed go on said she nodding her thanks dont waste chinmusic neither mused the captain wants t git at my cards afore she shows her own you are in the right so far captain strange talks book english like print if she aint a queen of dimins an hearts im i have no doubt you will be some day interposed leah before he could get the word out but until you are suppose youeropen out touchin the passage money as you might call it in a highfalutin way maam passage money for my husband an fur a double of his as negotiated the noo jerusalem on th vyge nodded the captain extending his long legs

this information until you cashed my cheque it will make a difference goin t cut int th thousand asked strange blandly he was not your nephew remember she retorted the mariner stared and chuckled donner und blitz i know german if you prefer to talk in that tongue he recovered with another stare i reckon yve hed a boardschool eddication all along th line i swear in any lingo handy so i hear she informed him swiftly but i dont stock furrein chinchin nowhow an now maamhe expanded his chest and puffed out his cheeksill trouble y t han over ten thousand dollars whats that in english two thousand pounds evidently strange had gone to considerable trouble in calculating his blackmail and if you do not get it then i guess youll be sent up leah laughed scornfully i understand unless i submit to extortion you will tell this story about your supposed nephew and mr garth ill rip out everything the captain assured her without flinching an t th nearest copperthe last word she observed was popular cockney be careful she warned him our police make capital out of rascality the sailor choked and his eyes bulged rasrasrascality blackmail in plain english captain strange naow dont git me riz strange implored her im a holy terror with m hair off oh we can tame wild beasts in this country but if i tell tell what damn breathed the astonished man then almost shrieked an explanation why thet dr demetrius brought garth as a corp t kingston an yanked your husband int the blue mountains t sham death aye he did y bet an thet berrinlord james y call him in your cussed fine waycome aboard my barkey while the corp as wos called by his name lighted out fur th old country so thet y might run rings round a company of sorts how interesting and what has it all to do with me my stars strange rose to stamp the more freely sit down please said lady jim sweetly i do not allow people of your class to show their manners in my drawingroom it should be a prison with you in it he raged what a brute you are because you think that i am under your thumb you not only attempt blackmail but add insult ill make things hum i kin tell y ill bust up this conspiracy what conspiracy asked leah stubbornly strange made for the door with a nautical roll you kin arsk th nearest copper ill give him details never fear close the door after you please said lady jim as he wrenched it open fiercely the captain immediately banged it again with a naughty word and turned to behold her opening a book colddrawn cheek of th mos freezing style murmured the almost stupefied man oh my country taint no wonder he took legbail if i wos married t her id larrup her every day an twice on sundays not gone yet inquired leah glancing over the top of her book oh please do i dislike hearing an illiterate person muttering lord keep me fro murder gasped strange piously say maam aint you afeared awfully and as there are several policemen within call bring em upbring em all up right along i will if you do not go away and she reached for the bell snakes y mus hev a card up your sleeve perhaps i have or y may be bluffin perhaps i am dont you think it would be better if you sat down and talked pleasantly if id a wife like you commenced the captain obeying id i am quite sure you would bullies like you always enjoy wifebeating i aint a bully he wiped his face with a flaunting red bandana handkerchief breathing heavily yes you are and a coward who thought to frighten me now i am about to frighten you huh strange laughed scornfully there aint man woman or kid kin make me sing small though i dont deny he added gracefully as youd make old nick squirm thanks but i am rather tired of costermonger compliments come to business you accuse me of being mixed up in a conspiracy well an aint it true as gospel between ourselves to the world it is a lie i bet you cant prove tis so sneered the sailor proof is not required denial is not when im in th witnessbox not when youre in the dock you mean my good man her visitor grew purple mein th dock he thundered lower your voice please or i shall order my servants to turn you out yesin the dock your natural place this conspiracy of yours engineered for your little game mind he gasped not at all i have nothing to do with it her hard eyes held him as he blankly considered her astonishing impudence you tell me that dr demetrius buried a man at funchal in place of mr garth and then when mr garth died on board your ship sent home his body as that of my husband as mr garth and my husband resembled one another closely i can see how i and the family were mistaken when we beheld the substituted corpse but i do not understand why my husband should have consented to this no more than i understand how you dare accuse me of conspiring but i do you bet maam you played low down on a company where is your proof youve got the dollars she played a bold stroke ignorant that the money was paid under false pretences it shall be given back strange turned white and jumped up my share he cried i know nothing of your share apparently dr demetrius who happened totoeradmire me kidnapped my husband in order that i might think myself free to marry hima thing said lady jim with scorn which could nevernever have occurred it seems that my husband was taken away by you and dr demetrius against his will i shall communicate with him now that i know he is alive oh i assure you search shall be made captain strange and the moneyevery pennyshall be paid back to the defrauded insurance company as for youblackmailing hound and bully and coward the law shall punish you and she daring greatly was again about to touch the bell several times during this clever explanation strange had gasped and sworn softly almost helpless with rage but by the time she ended his anger had cooled and he was regarding her with profound admiration her astonishing boldness her dexterous turning of facts into fiction and fiction into facts and the unbroken nerve which she displayed when at bay commanded his respect unknowingly he fell into line with m aksakoff and rendered homage to superior wickedness dont shoot colonel ill climb down said he collapsing lady jim knowing the old possum story laughed and withdrew her hand secretly relieved that he had not dared her to press the button ah now you talk reason captain strange you bet im goin to he retorted bluntly yve played your hand fur all youre worth an mighty prettily bluffed it is but i guesshe swung back in his chair largelyi guess i hold the ace you do she eyed him uneasily for he appeared to be much cooler than she approved of and the ace your husband jim leah started forward grasping the arms of her chair huh grunted strange i thought you gilded bummers were allays lords an ladies t one another jim she repeated blankly jim you bet kidnappin wos th word i used an kidnappin it is thet there berrin your husband sailin under false colours come along with me to buenos ayrestheres no denying thet buthere the freebooter winked significantlyhe didnt git set ashore there oh no not much you bet i gummed on t him as m ace till i landed stakes he dont mind bless ylikes the life wonderful weve bin gavortin round pacific waters fur months till the dollars ran low then i brought the barkey norard with him under hatches and naowhe stretched out a huge pawy kin pass along thet ten thousand her brain was working so hard that she scarcely heard half the speech at the back of it she began to see possibilities my husband is in england then within reach anyhow and with my first mate hangin on t him maybe the barkey anchors in a french port might be spanish fur choice if y liketheres no knowin but hes within hail same as them coppers of yours the ace maam the ace y might put in a day arskin me why i let him go at ten thousand dollars th hull shoot is worth heaps an heaps more leah watched his face closely worth five thousand pounds perhaps well he drawled equally watchful i shouldnt mind goin nap on that all things being on th square naow if wait wait i tell you she clasped her hands across her forehead and paced the room with slow steps which did not betray the nervous hurry of her overwrought brain strange watched her as a naturalist might watch an entirely new animal clever and hard as he was in his bullying way he felt instinctively that he had little chance of getting the better of this woman unlessas he phrased ithe kept his tail up shes the dandiest devil i ever sot eyes on was his admiring verdict golly wot a flyer huh lady jim twisting her hands distressfully strolled slowly up and down with bent head and thoughtful looks at times she would halt and reflect deeply then her face would brighten as she resumed her prowling sometimes she glanced at strange sitting like a graven image in his chair and occasionally she peered into any near mirror as if to seek inspiration from her own wicked eyes for ten minutes amidst a petrifying silence she behaved thus then having solved part of her problemthe solution of the other part depended upon stranges consentshe returned to face him do you mind imprisonment she asked casually the sailor jumped goin t begin agin he demanded irritably answer my question do you mind imprisonment i do an i dont accordin to th dollars give it a name five thousand pounds twentyfive thousand states currency mused the captain y wish me t sample one of your gaols fur thet she nodded on charges of conspiracy and blackmail strange jumped again my gun dy intend t advertise th circus i intend to have my husband set free to enjoy his own since you have kidnapped him you shall confess and sufferfor five thousand pounds leavin you out maam oh i had nothing to do with it nor had my poor husband you and dr demetrius are the rascals huh an whatll y pay the doc nothing she said serenely the russian government is paying him whew strange whistled with a stare theyve got him at las if you mean the russian authorities yes poor chap he wasnt bad fur a foreiner i kind o froze on t him somehow but this catchycatchy biznai aint none o mine so let him slide he shook his head vigorously slide it is an this noo game o yours maam bending forward until her mouth was almost at his right ear she explained a very pretty scheme which would oust lionel and restore jims birthright without inculpating her strange listened calmly and nodded heavy approval at intervals all the time admiration deepened in his hard eyes but this did not prevent him bargaining yes said he balancing his hat carefully it kin be done six thousand aint it five thousand six he insisted so much was at stake that leah yielded she could afford to do so with fifty thousand a year in prospect six thento be paid when you leave prison huh an when might that be how should i know said lady jim crossly for the strain on her nerves was great ask some lawyer blackmail an conspiracy murmured strange reflectively sounds like a few years of oakumpickin dont it not as i intend to give my opinion on these british gaols singsings good enough fur me what do you mean by that never you mind maam but if the dollars aint planked down they will be cant you trust me man i guess not youre what i call a holy terror an no mistake firmingham y saidfirmingham he nodded ive nailed it when will you go down arter ive seen thet landshark bout the kind of poppycock th bloomin judge ull talk go slow maam y git along with your share an ill do mine so long leah did not like to grasp the tarry hand extended but out of diplomacy she was forced to touch the pitch which was defiling her i can depend upon you captain strange he nodded y kin let it go at thet so long agin an if id married you he added with genuine emotion cuss me if i wouldnt hev bin runnin the usa in th presidential chair leah digested this compliment at her leisure chapter xxviii after that momentous interview lady jim realised the truth of stranges scriptural quotation although he had translated it into his own lax vernacular unfortunately hearing it after the event she could not take isaiahs advice and had too hastily condemned the fetish she would have given much for the recovery of that precise peacocks feather for having freely thrown it away it was doubtful to her superstitious mind if the luck would hold certainly she had arranged judiciously for jims return to civilisation and the unscrupulous captain appeared willing to earn wages as a scapegoat but there was always the unforeseen to be reckoned with a chance word a chance discovery a too minute inquirythese might wreck the whole scheme and she would reap a whirlwind stormy enough to sweep her out of a social paradise into the bleak desert of sinnersfoundout a most uncomfortable locality she did what she could poor woman to propitiate her baal a new peacocks feather was procured and she apologised for her want of faith also she experimented with the new symbol would a particular costume arrive at a certain hour would some very doubtful stock which she held turn honest would captain strange after consulting a lawyer still hold to his nefarious bargain the test proved satisfactory for her baal apparently amenable to apology worked excellently through the new semblance of his deity the dress duly arrived within the fixed time the shares rose rapidly and enabled her to sell at a profit which she did not deserve finally a grubby note from strange assured her without detail that he was on his way to firmingham it would seem that the prospect of picking oakum for a livelihood appealed to him at the agreed price pending the explosion of the mine to which strange was about to apply a match leah possessed her soul in patience three days did she wait and they were days of purgatory for obvious reasons she did not return to firmingham but wrote to lionel stating that she had received a terrible shocknature not mentionedand intended to consult the family solicitors about the same she thus made herself safe about the sailors visit in case any one might wonder why he had come to her in the first instance and in the letter she told the truth for once since she paid a visit to lincolns inn fields an explanation of her errand startled the suave head of a justly celebrated legal firm on recovering from pardonable amazement he gave his client the full value of her sixandeightpence kidnapping explained mr hall to a tearful listenerfor lady jim thought that the circumstances demanded emotionis not in itself a serious offence and really applies only to persons under fourteen years of age in the case of an adult like lord james this sailor would be punished withermaybe two years imprisonment he might even be let off with a heavy fine leahs face fell considerably she would have to pay that fine and did not relish parting with more money how interesting she murmured vaguely and waited for further information blackmail however pursued the lawyer emphatically is a very grave offence and can be punished with five years imprisonment involving penal servitude that would be better agreed lady jim thinking that strange at hard labour would earn one thousand a year and have an extra thousand over when his term was ended a profitable imprisonment for him truly she reflected and extremely costly for her then again lady james if the offence s committed by letter sentence for life can be passed oh he didnt write she said hastily and congratulated herself that strange had not done so since even for so many thousands he would not be inclined to remain a prisoner for ever but perhaps mr kaimes may receive a letter the man hinted that he would try in that quarter seeing that i would not yield to his extortion you should have had him arrested i had not my wits about me he would have shot me had i summoned the servants bless me lady james had he a weapon a revolver she replied unscrupulously so you can see how ia poor weak womanwas intimidated that will add to his sentence said mr hall upon which she wished she had checked her imagination it would be foolish to push strange into a corner for as yet she could not reckon the exact power of his greed however she could not unsay what she had said and nothing remained but to pray to the fetish and hope for the best the duke must be warned went on mr hall who asked leah just as sharply as she had asked colley the new dukei beg your pardon for of course if this story is true lord james is the duke of pentland you doubt the story then hall raised his eyebrows and shook his head i cannot give an opinion until i have seen this man and sifted his statements he paused and looked at her inquiringly i presume lady james that this man closely resembles your husband what man oh garthyes you may guess how closely when the late duke lord frith and myself were all deceived certainly the likeness was well known in firmingham there were reasons she added with hesitationfamily reasons oherquite so mr hall who knew something of the adamite side of his late grace coughed away a laugh i can see how the mistake arose lady james natural enoughoh dear menatural enough why do you not give me my proper title she asked haughtily pardon me but the truth of this mans wild story has yet to be proved may i ask a few needful questions a wave of her hand signified that he might and she submitted to a tolerably stiff examination being prepared with artless answers to every question she emerged triumphantly from the ordeal and when in possession of her facts mr hall subscribed to the wickedness of demetrius and strange a pair of villains my dear lady the one sinned for love and the other from avarice astonishing whither those passions lead usastonishing well well we must hope i trust for your ladyships sake that the story is true so do i wept leah producing her handkerchief not for the sake of the title or the money dear mr hall but because my poor husband oh here she skilfully broke down for want of something to say pray calm yourself lady james let us hope that in a few days i shall be able to address you as the duchess of pentland give me back my husbandi ask no more was her magnanimous reply and while driving to curzon street she reflected how very magnanimous it really was seeing that she had no wish for jims company to be tied to that log again was scarcely worth the income besides jim who had no sense of decency would assuredly laugh his loudest at the thought of her unnecessary trouble he would not even thank her for giving him his rights although he must know that it was sorely against the grain for her to put up with his boring society but in spite of jims probable ingratitude she would behave as his wifeas the lenient woman she felt herself to be certainly her common sense recognised that he was returning from his sham grave with gifts in his hands but of those she was the giver and seeing that she could betray his share in the conspiracy without inculpating herself leah foresaw the possession of limitless power to enforce obedience that power she resolved to utilise for the purpose of getting her own unfettered way and all the money she required for contemplated extravagances also she intended to stop jims illicit flirtations now that he was a peer of the realm he would have to purge and live cleanly after the fashion of one sir john falstaff knight we owe that much to society thought leah virtuously and considered the rumoured doings of black sheep who would be cast out of the mayfair fold were their housetops removed that the shifting of the curzon street mansion tiles might also be attended with danger she did not pause to consider on the ensuing afternoon askew arrived to say farewell but as circumstances were too embarrassing to permit of her taking any interest in other peoples affairs she declined to see him nevertheless he urged a personal interview on the plea that he would be absent for months she yielded very unwillingly as her nerves clamoured for some outward sign of emotion which by the rules of society she would be obliged to suppress i know i shall be horribly rude murmured lady jim when the footman left the room to introduce the visitor but he has brought it on himselfwhich excuse she considered ample for ensuing impoliteness askew with mistaken consideration entered the drawingroom almost on tiptoe and proceeded forthwith to condole with her in stage whispers she soon put a stop to this artificial sympathy further reference to life beyond the grave she could not and would not stand as she told him crisply dont talk funeral unless you wish to see me wreck the room i have had months of crying and crape and condoling but the sad circumstances are such that i did not wish to see you she retorted finishing his sentences for him as usual after her old fashion i feel so scratchy that i declined your visit out of sheer pity but you would insist so dont blame me if i am disagreeable you can never be disagreeable said askew soothingly cant i you wait ten minutes and see i think i had better go lady jim for your own sake i think you had goodbye askew still kept his seat i only wish to say that i am veryvery sorry for your terrible loss lady friths terrible loss you mean go and see her if you want to play the hired mourner ah poor lady frith now dont begin about her snapped leah viciously but you must be sorry i amfor myself i have been dosed with the postmortem virtues of those three kaimes men until i feel that only wicked people are truly agreeable i regret the duke who was a nice old sinner turned saint and i lament lord frith for his goodness and sweetness of dispositionthere i never heard that lord frith had a sweet disposition he hadnt but im only saying the kind of things you expect me to say oh askew looked shocked have theerbodies been found i dont think so but you can ask the executors who look after these things any more questions no only i am sorry you said that before you are sorry i am sorry we are sorry i think that conjugation exhausts the subject let us talk of your yacht mr askew shes all right he murmured confused it was difficult to comprehend this woman who so lightly dropped a family sorrow to take on a subject which he knew interested her but little and when do you sail tomorrow or next day i came to say goodbye oh said leah carelessly i fancied you came to sympathise wellshe rose and extended her handgoodbye askew clasped her hand coldly wondering how he ever came to love so heartless a woman as jim was returning in glory and had not seen seorita fajardo since his reported death leah felt that she could safely dismiss this boy to go where he would besides she was beginning to find him a bore he took things much too seriously and was by no means so goodlooking as she had imagined all the same after the manner of woman who wants to have her pie and eat it she by no means approved of his readiness to depart you dont seem to care much she said reproachfully and felt quite illused askew coloured boyishly i am not brokenhearted certainly i do not believe that you have a heart you are rightit is at rosario then i advise you to go after it lest it should get mixed up with other mens hearts lola is no flirt cried askew loyally then she must be altogether too good for this world goodbye bring mrs askew to see me when you return i fear you would be bored with her said he sore and sarcastic probably married women are not interesting except to people like you and jim who persistently break the tenth commandment i know one married woman who who has just said goodbye to you and repeats it snapped lady jim seeing he was about to be rude oh very well then goodbye said askew going out in a rage with her and with himself and so they parted leah returned smiling to her seat delighted that she made him lose his temper as by doing so she had recovered her own it was so satisfactory to a deserted woman to think that a man whose love had cooled should go away uncomfortable and what a mercy he is gone said lady jim settling to read fashions i hope hell stop in america with that lola creature for the rest of his silly life i suppose he wont turn over this page of his book of life but tear it out and in this she was perfectly right he did towards five oclock lionel arrived although she had no intimation of his coming she quite expected to see him and was prepared to make any necessary scene the young clergyman looked white and excited entering the room so rapidly that the footman had hardly time to announce the title that he was losing lady jim recognising a crisis came forward rapidly with studied emotion you know allall she said in a choking voice and caught his hands he was taken aback yes if you mean that your husband lives it is true thenit is true she tottered to the sofa and cast herself down with passionate emotion say that it is true i think so but how do you know leah sat up with a puzzled look did you not get my letter saying that i had had a shock and intended to consult mr hall yes but you did not explain i could not seeing the position it places you in never mind me if jim is alive he takes the title so this man came to you he did and tried to extort money because i refused he hinted that he would buy your silence i never thought that he would dare to go to firmingham but when you entered a look told me all but can you believe this storyit seems incredible the police do not think so said lionel grimly lady jim dropped on to the sofa again the police of course this scoundrel came to firmingham and said that if i gave him three thousand pounds he would keep jim away from england so that i could enjoy the title i learned the truth about this conspiracy of dr demetrius and then had captain strange arrested today a policeman brought him to london he is in prison serve him right the brute did he not tell you how he threatened me no i never guessed that he had come to you but he did and said that if i gave him two thousand pounds he would bring jim back failing me he tried you at a higher price i should have had him arrested mr hall says but i could not i was bewilderedquite bewildered it seems incredible oh lionelshe laid her hand imploringly on his sleevesurely demetrius did not behave so vilely i fear that he did the man as every one in london knows was madly in love with you i never encouraged himreally i didnt no said lionel bluntly i do not think he was rich enough for you to encourage how can you think so badly of me because you are all selfyou admitted that long ago to do you justice i think you were a good wife to jim i am a good wife dont make me out to be the widow i am not of course this story must be false she ended helplessly i think notit is too circumstantial and moreover this man who appears to be illiterate could not invent such a tale plainly the russian who seemed to be clever conspired to get rid of jim so that you might be induced to marry him as though i would ever do such a thing i told you at firmingham that i had no intention of marrying i daresay jim and i will come together again and be very happy i hope soi trust so said lionel with solemn emphasis remember god is giving you another chance i made very good use of the last one she retorted sullenly jim was always to blame and not i i suppose this insurance money will have to be given back certainly you can hardly complain of that seeing the income you will now receive jim will you mean i expect hell turn out a screw now that he is rich your spendthrifts are always old misers and i dont see why you should be nasty im sure i have had a miserable time you will have a happy one now he said relenting with jim she cried derisively how optimistic you are surely i have a right to be when god is so good to you god she echoed vaguely and thinking of the obliging fetish oh yes of course im awfully thankful the insurance money would not have lasted for ever and i might not have found so manageable a husband as jim things will be jolly now lionel groaned is that as high as you can rise he asked rebukingly oh lord what do you want me to say cried leah with the causeless anger of the overwrought i cant think of pious proverbs when i am like this what with supposed deaths and real deaths and nothing but funerals to amuse one i dont know if i am on my head or my heels there thats vulgar and you neednt look disgusted if it is i feel vulgar i could run out and howl up and down curzon street like a whitechapel woman in a tantrum and if you preachif youyou oh what fools men are she choked rolled in her chair ripped a handkerchief and kicked away a footstool the curateas he was once moresaw how she tried to fight down the hysteria and wisely refrained from speech a single word might cause the primitive emotions to burst with volcanic force through the imposed customs of civilisation considering the joyful news of jim kaimes resurrection and the trouble of the attempted blackmail it was natural that she should suddenly betray feminine weakness she was but a woman when all was said and done leah would have repudiated this conclusion with scorn as she had small regard for her sex but a woman she was at the moment unstrung foolish wild with dread that the unforeseen might happen lionel moved silently to the door in a moment she was at his side reaching him with the bound of a pantheress dont be angry she panted laying her hand on his arm but you do worry me so and if you knewif you really knew she gasped and bit her lip to prevent an unguarded tongue blurting out the whole there there he patted her hand and she could have slapped him for the caress which revealed his knowledge of her weakness its all rightall right be calm there there oh lord what tact and so disgusted was she with the stupidity of the man that her nerves relaxed i say lionel with an artificial laugh arent you sorry for yourself not in the least he replied promptly i am no jacob to usurp the heritage of esau high or low we can all serve god in our degrees ask jim to make me vicar of firmingham i will if you promise not to preach how would you have me earn my salary then he asked humorously and glad that she appeared more composed now i advise you to lie down yes she assented submissively i will lie down and you i go at once to see mr hall about getting jim set free goodbye duchess and in a moment he was gone anxious to escape further irresponsible speech duchess echoed leah staring at the closed door duchess it was all right then so far as lionel was concerned seeing that he gave her the title which mr hall withheld he at least believed in the wonderful story of strange with lionel on her side things would be bound to come out all right still although the trees were thinning she was not yet out of the wood the green light of safety had not yet been substituted for the red danger signal i am aching all over said leah addressing her reflection in the mirror theres a twist of nerves between my eyes and i could scream the house down but i shant she flung away from the glass gripping her courage with both hands ill be calm and easy in my mind till jim comes back when the worst is over i shall collapsei know i shall till thentill thenoh godthe weakness she declined to recognise broke forth in prayergive me grit and pluck to fight through to the end so she prayed but not to the fetish in this uplifted moment leah felt that lionels deity was not a myth but a terrible reality chapter xxix then did rumour painted full of tongues enter into lady jims strictly private life and depart with halftruths for the bewildering of gossips in some marvellous way the news leaked out as news will despite careful caulking of the human vessels containing it lord james kaimes ran the babble had been kidnapped by his medical attendant who substituting an illegal corpse for that of the husband he wished to supplant had plotted to secure the wife this was the tune correct enough then came its variations the hurdygurdy of society ground out wonderful twiddles and twists of false notes distorting the original theme into a melody leah herself would not have recognised not that she heard any of the fiortura prudence counselled a retreat to firmingham pending the homecoming of jim and thither very wisely she went at this crisis of her fortunes lady jim felt that she required the countenance of all truly respectable people however dull and therefore sheltered like a maltreated chick under hilda friths wing to console the widowed and orphaned was her obvious excuseso obvious indeed that she declined to make it thus did she escape questions about the one engrossing topic of drawingroom club and publichouse bar every one from the lowest to the highest talked exhaustively and the newspapers cheap and costly printed scandal with alluring recklessness out of london ec issued halfpenny journals with lurid headings over incomplete histories of the plot invented on unsound premises these transparent fictions began with the russians snakeinthegrass intrusion into the happy home of an attached couple and ended with a political cry for the exclusion of such immoral aliens from the island of the blest which is england the more expensive smallbeer chronicles refused to believe that so fantastic an occurrence could have happened in these enlightened days of policecourts and publicity but nevertheless supplied middleclass breakfasttables with equally doubtful data out of which to weave romances of the minor peerage the triangle of dumas the younger cried one scribe with a fine disregard for meaning and metaphor must never be sounded in our dear motherland a sufficient sample this of the stuff supplied but since the silly season prevailed when reporters one and all were credited with marchhare madness such incongruities were pardoned and the public gaped to swallow fullsized camels the clubs buzzed like hives at swarming time for their members wondered at jims adventure wondered also how so knowing a johnnyso they put itcould allow himself to be diddled by a measly little foreign beast all were agog for the heros appearance and curious friends thirsted for a firsthand account of the enforced odyssey many speculated as to the probability of jim being sobered by untoward experience into becoming a truly respectable duke and a few made original observations anent a muchquoted leopard and his unchangeable spots in this way was the statement that men are not born gossips contradicted for the eveless edens of st jamess street pall mall and piccadilly resembled a village sewingclass in midcareer the drawingrooms as was natural interested themselves chiefly in leah and chafed that she should become an unexpected duchess hitherto lady jims skilful manoeuvring had saved her reputation but as animals fall upon the wounded of their kind so did the pack of hounds she had never hunted with fling itself forward fullvoiced and openmouthed rejoicing women cried her sins on the housetop with surprising details she must have encouraged dr demetrius shamefully else he never would have gone to such lengths though why he should do so for such a woman it was impossible to understand they had never admired her said the pureminded and had always suspected her of being no better than she should be poor mr askew too had she not put an end to a family matrimonial arrangement by her arts had she not inveigled him to paris in the hope that he would marry her in haste to repent at leisure certainly aware of her character before it was too late he had sailed to the south pole or the north pole or to somewhere she could not follow as she was certainly dying to do her vanity was insatiable she had flirted quite indecently with sir billy richardson though he was but an infant lately breeched julia hengist had only snatched her lord from the claws of this harpy by the merest the very merest chance and the money she wasted oh why the bailiffs had twice and thrice been in the curzon street house also she was so lucky at bridge that she assuredly must cheat and it showed what a blackleg she was that no one had ever caught her cheating then her dresses were ridiculous for a woman with her poor husbands income she had ruined him completelythat was why he ran away in a dying condition and the money had not gone to discharge lawful debts she never paid anything therefore she must have spent the cash on some secret vice which she certainly must have since she always posed as being so very correct she ought to be cut she ought to be in gaol whipping was too good for her put her in a pillory and throw stones at her and let such a creature be anathema maranatha for ever and ever and ever amen but for all this throwing of stones by ladies who were without sin leah had her supporters in some who must have been wicked since they declined to condemn her wholesale on hearsay evidence these pointed out that she had behaved admirably when jims supposed death had been reported the late marquis of frith was himself deceived by the likeness of the corpse to his brother though of course there were family reasons for such a likeness also the old duke had paid the curzon street debts which so good a man would not have done had they been of a questionable character and the very respectable hengists kind things spoke highly of lady jims patience under trying domestic difficulties caused by an unfaithful husband besides leahpoor dear persecuted womanwas now the duchess of pentland and could do no wrong she was a misunderstood angel hilda frith doted on her and every one knew how very very particular hilda frith was to decry a woman who had suffered so much and who had so nobly borne suffering was a crimeworse was a blunder seeing that the latest duchess would assuredly sway society to bless or damn at her good pleasure the peeragethe immaculate peerage of great britain and irelandwould stand or fall by leah pentland as a perfect example of what a titled woman should be in this way raged the war of tongues while lionel in mr halls company and with the assistance of scotland yard officials sought for the missing prodigal strange playing the game with characteristic stubbornness refused to indicate the whereabouts of his victims floating prison and as the stormy petrel under a new coat of paint with readjusted rigging and bearing a prettier but unknown name could not be found in any shipping list there appeared little prospect of finding the kidnapped the telegraph wires sizzled in the air and under the sea with messages to home and foreign ports bills with jims portrait and a most flattering description were scattered broadcast a reward large enough to tempt mammon himself was offered in every journal and in many languages and the journals themselves denounced the police authoritieswho were merely mortal poor scapegoatsfor not producing a mislaid nobleman in five minutes it was an enjoyable time for armchair critics who on insufficient evidence knew exactly what should be done and blamed the police confronted with hard facts for not doing it as to the culprit he might have been nero judas iscariot and captain dreyfus rolled into one from the obliquity which was heaped upon him since he refused to produce his prisoner inquisitive people were frantic with annoyance one enthusiast even suggested that torture should be used to make him speak another considered that so recalcitrant a brute should be starved into submission a third that he should be offered a free pardon on condition that he sent back a regretted duke to his lonely wife but strange chuckling over the storm he had raised hugged his secret close hall the ducal lawyer knew what his terms were and if hall did not choose to accede he would have to remain without an aristocratic client hall however had no notion of losing the money with which the accession of lord james kaimes to a wealthy title would probably fill his pockets still stranges terms were too preposterous to consider for one moment he had to consider them for a fortnight all the same and finding that they did not vary he came down to consult lady jim after a lengthy interview with the rev lionel kaimes at lambeth even though jim had risen from the dead leah had not laid aside her mourning indeed she added fresh crape to show her grief for the recent deaths and greeted the lawyer with the air of one to whom life is a burden and so it was to her at the moment the funereal atmosphere of the great house the delicacy of her position until jim returned to tell her that all was safe and the constant boredom of listening to hildas wordy lamentationsthese things wore her out and mr hall noted that she looked fatigued natural very natural thought mr hall unfortunately aloud what is natural asked leah seeing his eyes on her the mans parchment cheeks reddened i beg your pardon duchess i did not intend to speak aloud a trick of mine when i am interested bad habitbad habit i was thinking that you looked wearynatural very natural weary leah placed her elbows on the table which stood between them i tell you what mr hall unless you bring my husband back soon i shall take to drink mydearduchess well and dont men take to drink when they are worried what better can a poor woman do than imitate the lords of creation you are so inconsistent what about my particular lord has that beast spoken out no he refuses to speak save on his own terms which are i may say preposterousextremely so leah thought of the price to be paid for the imprisonment strange was now undergoing and smiled dryly he is the kind of man who would ask for the sunand get it she added as an afterthought whether he gets it is for you to determine duchess oh she looked at him sharply am i to arbitrate quite soquite so a very wellchosen wordarbitrate he chuckled heartily and adjusted his pincenez and the joke mr hall it might almost be one duchess so preposterous is the demand of this man he refuses to reveal the whereabouts of his grace unlessprepare yourself for a surpriseunless he is set free now then duchessmr hall threw himself back in his chair and flung open his frockcoatis that not preposterous i cant see it myself replied leah coolly he seems to be a very sensible man butbuthe ought to be punished i fear he would not agree with you there is this what you have come to see me about yes all attempts to find the duke have been made in vain the resources of civilisation are exhausted only one thing remainsto accede to the prisoners terms i saw the reverend lionel kaimes and he agrees not to prosecute now i come to you to ask me not to prosecute exactlyexactly the man attempted to blackmail you and the reverend mr kaimes if neither one of you will prosecute the magistrate will be obliged to dismiss the case for want of evidence and then then captain strangethat is his name isnt itwill send jim back i question iti question it once free he may again attempt to blackmailthat is he may refuse to surrender his prisoner without money being paid i do not agree with you said leah mendaciously the man has had a fright and will not trust himself again into the lions mouth besides even if he did try to blackmail we could refuse and he cant keep my husband for ever on board his dirty little boat a prisoner who cannot be ransomed would be expensive to keep jim has an enormous appetite hall smiled at the aristocratic jest truetrue you put the case conciselyvery concisely i may say the question is whether it is right to set the man free and trust to an honour which i fear he does not possess leah thought for a few minutes playing her part to perfection it appears that captain strange very wisely will not open his mouth so long as he is shut up if set free he promises to be amenable to reason of two evils i choose the least as mr kaimes has done that means you will not prosecute yes let the man go and probably my husband will arrive within the week how can it be done very easily tomorrow or the next day strange can be brought before the magistrate but as neither you nor mr kaimes will appear the charge will be dismissed and then then my dear duchess he will vanish into the world and we shall have to trust to the honour of an admitted blackmailer it is really a terrible dilemma cried the lawyer dismally and forms such an evil precedentoh a most deadly blow at justice i assure you not at all contradicted leah coolly we can say that captain strange turned kings evidence but my dear duchess whats the use of talking she snapped impolitely i have told you what to do go and do it really pardon me if i am rude but i am not fit to talk and she hurried out of the room glad that she had settled the matter thus hall departed to london reflecting that the rudeness of the duchess was quite explicable under the circumstances but resenting it all the same to punish her he had a great mind to delay the return of the duke until his good sense or his avarice told him that this would be a costly price to pay for a petty revenge in this way captain strange triumphed as most people can by simply holding his tongue as no evidence was forthcoming when he presented himself before the magistrate he could not be committed for trial and after a few formalities walked out of the dingy court a free man hall followed him as quickly as was consistent with the dignity of a lincolns inn fields solicitor but stepped into the open air to find his bird had flown nor did inquiries at the thirdrate strand hotel result in an interview the buccaneer warned of possible danger never reappeared to claim the carpetbag which held a few shirts and oddments he disappeared apparently into the air as did macbeths fortunetellers hall was vexed as he had intended strange should be shadowed by detectives of this the astute sailor might have been aware as he gave no chance to the bloodhounds of the law and we have to depend upon his honour about restoring the duke thought hall with anguish it might have eased his mind had he known that the dependence was really to be placed on six thousand pounds being paid within a stated period but of that he was ignorant and leah did not think it necessary to comfort her legal adviser in any way indeed she needed comfort herself sorely for when a week passed and jim did not reappear she began to think that strange was contriving some new villainy perhaps he was about to put up his price and leah was determined not to ransom jim at any greater sum than that she had already agreed to the newspapers were filled with astonished paragraphs about the inexplicable conduct of the authorities in connection with stranges acquittal and some kind friend sent the most spiteful of these to the waiting wife leah did not read the opinions of cranks set forth in inferior english and was much more taken up with a letter from katinka aksakoff it was not easy to answer such a letter yet she would be compelled to reply mademoiselle aksakoff wrote indignantly saying that she did not believe the statements of the papers concerning the conspiracy of constantine demetrius she denied that such a noble man would act in so base a way and reminded leah of their conversation on the terrace at monte carlo you then said that you did not love him complained the letter and insisted that he did not love you but if he kidnapped your husband so that you might be free to marry him he must love you and you have lied but i cannot believe that you would break my heart in this way nor can i credit so honourable a man with such conduct katinka then went on to say that demetrius had not been seen since he crossed to paris where was he did lady jim know if so let her tell the writer or elsethen the epistle ended with a vague threat about hunting out demetrius and learning the truth and when i do ran the final line your conscience will tell you if we are to be friends or foes this challengeas it truly wascame from paris where katinka was stopping at the russian embassy it had been registered to ensure delivery a most unpleasant letter leah felt inclined to tear it up but some instinct told her that katinka aksakoff was a persistent girl with much obstinacy in her character if no reply came she would probably hasten to firmingham for an interview and lady jim did not care about having the second honeymoon of herself and her restored husband spoilt by the scene which would surely take place after destroying several sheets of notepaper she produced a concise reply saying as little as ever she could nevertheless she was forced to say much she would have preferred left unsaid captain strange said lady jims reply declared that demetrius had so conspired but he had been set free and had disappeared what he said might be true or might not nothing could be known for certain unless lord james returned and up to the date of the letter he had not put in an appearance demetrius certainly had come to parisnot to see the writer but to interview m aksakoff about a possible pardon at the henri trois hotel the doctor had been seized with a fit and a dr helfmann had taken charge of him since then wrote lady jim i have not seen him however i enclose a letter which he sent me on the day i left paris it would seem that he has gone to russia and i hope katinka will follow him there said leah after adding a few judas words of endearment aksakoff might keep her on his volga estate shell only make mischief if she comes to england ill warn her father of that and she did for m aksakoff received a letter which hinted that his daughter might prove to be a possible firebrand and so the matter for the time being ended but jim had not yet arrived seven days passed and the eighth night since the buccaneers release closed in leah felt the strain terribly and hardly ate or slept hilda did what she could to cheer her up but not knowing the whole truth could do very little lady jim declined to take drugs as her last experience of these had shown her how they aged people though that might have been her fancy all she could do and did do was to keep a tight rein on her emotions and beyond looking pale and a trifle haggard no one could have told that she was in any way disturbed joan was a great comfort to her in those days of strain and so was lionel with his prophecies that all would yet be well but leah had no one to whom she could tell the whole shocking truth and it was desperately trying to a woman whose nervous system was almost wrecked to hold her tongue these still waters were running very deep she found a certain relief in motion and while hilda wept and wailed that the bodies of her dear husband and his father had never been cast ashore for christian burial leahs motorcar tore round the country through storm and sunshine she would not even take a chauffeur but engineered the machine herself providence or the fetish that stood to her in place of it watched over her escapades she met with no accident not even the most trivial although in her reckless driving she did her best to reduce the car to matchwood like a witch on a broomstick she flew round the country frantic and insistent as though she sought the enjoyment of some wizard sabbath the motor flung mile after mile behind with a buzz and a hum and the speed of a destroyer buffeting a rough sea leah with her hand on the levers swooped down narrow lanes spun furiously along the kings highway crashed through scared villages and raced the setting sun to the verge of the astonished lands it was the extreme danger of these flights which delighted and strengthened her and if she had a large bill to pay for breaking every known law in the county policemens notebooks it was easy for the duchess of pentland to pay for such frolics the thrill the dash the knowledge of power the governance of a flying bombshellthese things were worth double treble quadruple the money she was inebriated with danger exalted by the constant nearness of death and like a shesatan defiantly selfsufficient scorned both god and man of woman needless to say she took no account whatsoever then came one memorable night riotously wild with wind and rain with gleaming lamps at top speed facing the wrath of conflicting elements battling under a stormy sky she drove her machine roaring up the avenue a quick turn of the hand and she stayed it fuming and whirring like a live thing before the porch contrary to custom the door was open against the light she saw lionel and in a moment guessed the inevitable leaving the chauffeur to attend to the monster this mrs frankenstein sprang up the steps and dragged lionel under the glare of the electric lamp a look into his face redoubled the beat of her heart there sure enough she saw what she expected to see take me to him she breathed still retaining her grip on his arm but are you quite prepared he is in the library and leah flung the curate away so forcibly that he staggered against the wall she was out of the hall she was at the library door she was in the library itself and all in two quickdrawn breaths hulloa leah said a wellknown voice in a wellknown manner she did not answer but stared with a bloodless face possessed entirely by the devil of hysteria then she dropped without a cry or a word like a bloodmare she had held out to the winningpost and thus paid the price of victory chapter xxx there are periods in the growth of a tree when the sap unable to circulate freely coagulates into knots and protuberances leah had heard some empirical dabbler in science say as much and recognised it as a truthful symbol of her existence for the twelve months following jims return there was certainly a knot in her life for somehow in an unaccountable way things seemed to be at a standstill before intermeddling with criminal matters she had indulged her senses in every possible way and now that she had receded within the legal limits of action she was prepared to indulge them again to her surprise they did not respond and she discovered that the nursery stage of enjoyment had been passed that intermezzo of fierce endeavour of scheming and fighting of dancing on the edge of a precipice and of wandering in perilous ways had ruined her for untroubled days and comfortable nights while battling with desperate fortunes she had detested the storm and necessary stress of the encounter now she longed to set her forces in array once more and dare the worst the salt had lost its savour and her vitiated palate demanded pepperred pepper hot and bitingto flavour the good things ready for her eating at lifes banquet but leah found as many had done before her that desire is better than success that there is more zest in striving than in attaining she had longed for ample funds and since she possessed full control of the pentland income this longing was almost but not quite satisfied nevertheless her soul was hungry still she bought everything she fancied and scarcely cast a look on her most costly and attractive purchases she travelled with the luxurious surroundings of a queen and only felt bored she stopped at home and yawned incessantly twice round the clock she would have willingly remunerated the inventor of a new pleasure but like xerxes she could not find so imaginative a man it was truly lamentable to think that she should possess the moon she had cried for only to find it was but a usedup world jim on the contrary flourished healthily under his strawberry leaves and this bestofallpossibleworld satisfaction added to his wifes exasperation daily he grew stouter and more plethoric daily he made the same stupid observations and daily he indulged in the gross material pleasures dear to his infinitesimal soul which was being smothered in superabundant flesh you are like a pig removed into a new sty his wife scornfully informed him not a bad sty answered the duke looking round the room good enough for middleclass people but not for us jim we are desperately poor as duke and duchess thats so leah but you spend most of the income i have a right to dont forget what i have done for you you give me no chance said her husband bitterly every time we have a row you mention things that neednt be mentioned and after all leah you got me back for your own convenience i am not so sure of that i wish now that i had kept the thirty thousand which we had to pay back and had let you remain where you were on board stranges oddjob steamer it wasnt so bad though i was chained by the leg i learnt a lot about engines there used to watch em when she was bumping through hurricanes they were triple expansion too it was fun to watch the old scotch engineer with his hand on the throttlevalve and hear him curse when the screw leaped skyhigh to race like a motor ive had worse timesmuch worse he spoke with more animation than usual and leah sympathised with his enthusiasm she also would have enjoyed herself on a rotten hulk with doubtful engines and an hourly chance of going down into the great green seas the excitement would have been intense and the death a clean one perhaps jim had forgotten the softer emotions of man when the tramp stormed north with every rivet in her hull straining for dispersion she wondered i suppose you missed seorita fajardo then no curiously enough i didnt there was too much fun in thinkin what would come next to bother about her im a bit of a philosopher leah an when i cant get cake i chew bread now ive got the cake im enjoyin it and eating too much of it look how stout yon are getting respectable men always get stout when they grow old you are not old im a bit elderly somehow i dont enjoy larks so much as i used to mused jim thoughtfullysign of age i suppose but i daresay ill get some sort of fun out of life an maybe will need old jarvey peels money at sixty itll be more than thirty thousand by then less the six thousand you paid strange said his duchess cruelly jim winced bit of a pull thathey nice fancy price ive had to pay for your fun leah it was to bring you back to make you a duchess you mean one would think you were middle class to hear you talk of titles in that respectful way who bothers about such things nowadays i have been bored to death since stranges blackmail turned you into a pauper duke her husband made a grimace at this very plain speaking i wish you wouldnt talk like that leah hang it i thought you really loved me when you fainted on my return all acting my good man she assured him annoyed by his recalling that twelvemonthold weakness i had to impress the family somehow then you dont love me said jim slowly what a question to ask after nearly seven years of married life but im respectable now urged jim setting forth the contents of the new page he had turned over i dont race or bet overmuch an never look at a pretty woman i go to church an sit in the lords an take the chair at charity dinners an you do that last because you love eating all the charity funds are spent on the victuals and the poor get about a penny in the collected pounds oh you are quite a model jim and so dull this is but a sample of the few conversations the ducal pair allowed themselves for they did not foregather with any enthusiasm for proprietys sake the duke and duchess of pentland were seen together at the few functions they could attend during the months of mourning their home life was outwardly harmonious and the crying down of a grasswidow which had been heard during those weeks of suspense following stranges arrest had changed to crying up when it was seen how very correctly the new duchess behaved therefore they saw one another only officially save on rare occasions leah found jim dull as she had frankly told him and he winced always at his wifes tongue which had lost none of its cutting power even his stupid brain grasped the fact that she was changed though in what way he could not exactly say she was certainly restless and his bovine contentment with thingsastheyare could not understand this phase also she was dissatisfied although she had secured all she had wanted by almost a miracle rum creatures women soliloquised the philosopher sauntering to his club if you gave em the solar system to play with theyd howl for the universe which was a high flight for jim to take in the way of metaphor leah sometimes thought that the long period of mourning might have darkened her outlook on life she and jim were forced by a ridiculously particular world to live quietly and she could not indulge herself to the full a constant succession of black dresses palled on one fond of colours and custom forbade her filling the various ducal residences with amusing people who in any case were almost impossible to find then as leah stated they were really poor considering the title what with regiments of servants and the stately mansions which housed them the horses and carriages and motors and rents and taxes and unnecessary personal expenditure and equally unnecessary charities it was truly difficult to make two aristocratic ends meet the duchess of pentland had to contrive and arrange almost as much as had lady jim from two thousand a year to twentyfive times that amount seems a large jump but the title nullified the value of the estates leah ardently prayed that the fetish would increase the incoming and decrease the outgoing but her baal seemed to think that it had done enough even for so devout a woman am i never going to have a good time wailed leah later she found that the wail was unnecessary for the fetish pitied his worshipper and granted her prayer coal of the best quality was found on a welsh property of the kaimes family and hall prophesied that in a year or two the ducal income would be doubled leah took heart at this sign of grace as one really could manage pretty well on one hundred thousand a year but a pound a minute was leahs idea of a moderate income and then she would have grumbled that each hour only brought her in sixty sovereigns however she decided to spend what she had and what was coming along from the coal to the last farthing and arranged when the year of sorrow was endedas it now wasto take her place in the very gayest of society she would be presented again this season according to custom and then would see about exhausting the most advanced pleasures of a civilisation that could not do enough for one of her greedy appetite this she told to lady canvey that is a mistake rejoined the sagacious octogenarian who was a year older in body and a year younger in brain if you exhaust everything in this world nothing will be left for you but to try the next and i dont think you are quite prepared for that my dear perhaps not i never set up for being a saint no that is a pleasure you have not yet exhausted why not try it because i am no hypocrite what is the use of pretending to be goodygoody when you are not saints are holy not goodygoody its the same thing it might be with you certainly but you are not the sort to be canonised well i dont know a sinner is the raw material out of which a saint is manufactured you cant be really good unless you have been really very bad that is useful information said lady canvey dryly and very encouraging to people like yourself you might make an attempt at being saint leah or saint jezebel lady canvey oh the old dame chuckled then you do know something of scripture yes but i dont quote it to annoy other people your tongue is quite clever enough to do without such aid my dear and dont lose your temperi am only talking for your good disagreeable conversations are always prefaced by that remark yes i was thinking you might begin on your saintly career by endowing a church with this coal money they build churches very cheap nowadays you can have one of red brick and there are too many churches and too few worshippers interrupted the duchess with a shrug besides i propose to endow myself with the coal money i daresay i shall give fifty pounds or so to lionel for his paupers you must not ruin yourself my dear said lady canvey with affectionate spite i thought that lionel as a married man and the vicar of firmingham had nothing to do with paupers there are none in the parish thereat least there were none in pentlands time she ended with emphasis i suppose you mean to hint that jim is stopping his charities and putting on the screw dont distress yourself godmother everything is as it was save that our tenants and villagers are more gorged and much more impudent lionel doesnt appreciate the godliness of his heritage because his parishioners pay their rents regularly and come to church without the whip they are so pious that his occupation is gone that would not suit an energetic christian like lionel it doesnt he and joan take pleasure trips into the lambeth slums and ask seedy ruffians to stay with them in the country what with converted burglars and wives who assure you they havent been beaten for weeks the place is quite a whitechapel paradise lionel preaches to the ruffians and joan listens to the wives with whole skins i believe they join forces to wash the children oh they have rollicking times at firmingham vicarage i assure you very meritorious times said lady canvey reprovinglyquite like the primitive christian church less clean i fancy and more ungrammatical murmured leah dont mock my dear lionel is a noble man i quite agree with you and without mockery jim is also a noble man in a different sense if you will forgive the pun it is unworthy of your wit i cannot always be pyrotechnical you need flint and steel to strike fire and i find no flints amongst the idiots i have to entertain do you know godmotherleah stared into the firei often wish that lionel had remained the duke and your husband had been really a corpse how like you well said the duchess cheerfully jim might have been of some use if hiswhat do you call those thingsoh yesif his vortices had combined with other elements to grow into plants and sheep and cows and generally do the sort of things which vortices are supposed to do but as a duke he is a failure i dont exactly know what you mean by your heathen talk of vortices snapped lady canvey dust we are and unto dust shall we return not jim protested leah he would return to mud he just looks as though he were made of sticky clayey stodgy mud it is not original to abuse your husband i know that but you are too oldfashioned to admire originality lady canvey thumped with her stick vigorously do not be so desperately sharp leah you make my head ache by the way i have news for you about that nice boy you treated so badly i have treated so many nice boys badly billy richardson algy turner harry askew the last he is to be married i knew that a year ago he left before jim came home to make some spanish creature his wife miss mamie mulrady does not sound like a spanish name that girl you dont say so leah looked genuinely surprised i suppose seorita fajardo would not have him perhaps she is waiting for mr berring who is he ohera friend of mine she put up her muff to hide a smile i know that usa heiressa nice girl if she did not affect the wild west of which she knows absolutely nothing no doubt she thinks it chic to let europeans hear the american eagle scream in the vernacular fancyand to askew a good match for him i suppose he will call pounds shillings and pence collectively dollars now that he is brother to george washington i dont think so mrs askew will probably be more english than the english she might easily be that since the english are mostly aliens nowadays well i must go goodbye i have enjoyed my hour i always do with you godmother such a clever tongue i am not leaving you any money my dear please dont your grandson is finding that operadancer expensive give canvey your savings and his ladylove will dance professionally on your grave i am glad cats dont talk said the old woman addressing no one in particular one is quite enough ah they do talk then laughed leah and having got the last word slipped away before lady canvey could rally her forces the duchess well wrapped up in expensive furs stepped into the crisp air thinking of askew and his triple dip into the matrimonial luckybag lola fajardo marjory the fixture and mamie mulrady not to speak of herself whom he would have married had she cared to call herself by his unpretentious name certainly he was a man unfettered by prejudices in love affairs dark or fair tall or short and of any nationality he adored them all in an entirely respectable fashion which included a ring and a parson though i dont believe the silly boy knows what love is thought leah passing into piccadillyshe was walking for exercise towards the park but people of that ignorant sort always seem to land on their feet like the cats lady canvey spoke of i have landed very comfortably myself i wonder why i cant love any one how is it that no man can stir me into experience of the grand passion lately leah had taken to analysing herself with fatal results it seemed to her that she was shallow since nothing in the world made any difference to her or could make her feel if jim had dropped dead of the apoplectic fit which was waiting for him she would merely have shrugged her shoulders had the old duke come back to claim the title she would have had small regret in surrendering it everything seemed trivial and dull and vulgar a remark made by lionel occurred vividly to her at this moment you will never be truly happy he had said until you are truly sorrowful it was an unintentional epigram on the vicars part as he was dense like all the kaimes family but it was clever enough to be true onlyand here was the hopelessness of her lifeshe saw no chance of becoming sorrowful in any degree since her indifference nullified deep feelings of any sort i suppose i shall have to run in this society circus till i die she thought drearily what a clowns destiny the mention of one lover naturally recalled the name of another and by the time she passed apsley house thoughts of demetrius were running in her head not a word had she heard of him since his enforced journey to siberia via paris havre and kronstadt katinka aksakoff might have supplied information only that katinka for reasons which leah guessed rather than knew had disappeared some nine months ago according to m aksakoff she was ruralising on his volga estates and her health forbade an exciting life the duchess did not quite believe this smooth explanation and yet at times she fancied that the diplomatist might have taken her advice regarding the shepherding of an infatuated child it was then by one of those curious coincidences perfectly explicable to the psychological mind that the man himself glided to her side he looked as tall and lean as ever but his eyes were less direct in their gaze and he did not seem to exercise his former selfcontrol leah and he had met but rarely during the past year owing to her retirement consequent on mourning observances and when they did meet each had avoided mention of that memorable afternoon in paris but when he crossed leahs path thus unexpectedly and when her head was filled with demetrius and with the woman demetrius did not love she resolved to learn the worst or the best after greeting she began to speak with unconventional abruptness where is your daughter m aksakoff on my volga estate he replied nervously and from his averted eyes she made sure he was lying badly in siberia you mean he turned with a start how do you know that i am right then aksakoff clasped and unclasped two restless hands over the knob of his cane i really cannot say i do not know why you should make that observation after i have informed you of my daughters whereabouts i make it because i am a woman and being such i know that katinkas love for that waxedmoustache creature will lead herperhaps has led hereven into siberian wilds aksakoff stopped under the achilles statue and probed her mind with his eyes do you really think so i do does my thought confirm facts he resumed his walk with a troubled face i will be frank with you madame since we both know that constantine demetrius left paris on that afternoon en route to siberia i know nothing of the sort contradicted leah sharply yet you have just admitted that the man is in siberia the duchess laughed carelessly all russians go as naturally to siberia as cockneys to margate its a kind of bank holiday with them i suppose why not be frank with me madame i rather think that i should ask you that question i never answer questions said leah coolly it saves a lot of trouble but i make statements and one is that demetrius and the woman who loves him are in siberia do you really think so said the diplomatist repeating himself i do think so but surely you know aksakoff shook his head katinka refused to marry her cousin petrovitch after the disappearance of demetrius she questioned me continually about him and showed me the letter and enclosure which you had sent a very diplomatic letter if i may say so i of course denied that i knew anything she appeared to be satisfied yet nine months ago she left my houseleft this country to rusticate on your volga estates that was my excuse for her disappearance and i beg of you madame to accept that excuse in society for the sake of her good name and mine she nodded and he went on gravely i confess to you madame that i do not know where she is you suggest siberia it is possible i fancy so seeing she is infatuated with the man but how could she possibly learn that he was there leah asked this question a trifle nervously for there seemed to be something menacing in this strange behaviour of katinka very easily you sent her the letter supposed to have been written by constantine demetrius in paris what letter is that she asked obstinately the russians eyes flashed you must know madame and you do know that the letter was forged for your safety the duchess stopped abruptly and became as ice in manner and speech you talk very strangely m aksakoff my safety was never in danger so far as i know your anxiety makes you indiscreet and thinking so i pardon the indiscretion aksakoff knowing that she would continue to feign ignorance even in the face of aggressive facts apologised with a bow since it mattered very little in that forged letterhe was determined to stick to the wordwas the name of helfmann dr helfmann she corrected i gave him that degree madame said aksakoff dryly helfmann is one of our secret police then you had no business to introduce such a creature into my rooms said leah angrily pardon the crime is twelve months old to proceed katinka knew the real business of this man and may have learned the truth or enough of it to make her journey to siberia tomskyes tomsk he leaned his stick on the ground his hands on the stick and stared vaguely at the leafless trees assuredly tomsk is dr demetrius there aksakoff nodded vaguely i wish you a good day madame said he and turned away abruptly without raising his hat the omission of a usual courtesy either betrayed his absence of mind or showed what he truly thought of the duchess of pentland leah having a tender conscience chose to assign the latter reason and resolved to cut the man if he should dare to speak to her again but what can you expect from the russian bear she said resuming her walk it ended in curzon street she and jim rented the ducal residence to a wealthy american and retained the smaller mansion on the plea that their happiest days had been spent there this excuse was of course a lie but every one believed it and said how touching it was to see that a duke and a duchess could be so human and after all leah really did like the cot of her humble days it was pleasant to think that she had been lady jim of curzon street and had taken her title in that way just like a peer in his own right sometimes she regretted that she was simply a duchess and not lady jim as of old then she had enjoyed life now she found it excruciatingly dull and it was all the fault of demetrius who had taught her more exciting methods of passing time than by killing it when in the drawingroom she recalled the conversation with aksakoff and began to think that there were troublesome days ahead if katinka had learned the truth through helfmann she was assuredly hovering round tomsk in the hope of aiding demetrius to escape should she be successful as so determined girl might easily be the man would return to this island of refuge breathing out vengeance of the direst leah had often contemplated a possible escape followed by a certain return and the contemplation invariably produced a shudder now that there seemed to be some ground that the man who knew all and would tell all might come to england she was conscious of rising spirits the feeling puzzled her i ought to be shaking in my shoes she reflected but i feel rather pleased than otherwise i am spoilt for a life of cottonwool and policemen at every corner danger is the sole thing which amuses me that must be the explanation of my feeling jolly i expect the heroes and heroines of cheap novels feel the same when they settle to a dull marriage after pages of hairbreadth escapes she was perfectly right leah pentland was a bad woman mainly because she had been looked after too carefully it required upheavals to bring the possible best out of her she had behaved unscrupulously and basely in dealing with the insurance fraud because that was the sole adventure which had come her way but had the adventure been heroic and noble she would have enjoyed it quite as much and would have struggled quite as bravely the reckless way in which she pulled the whiskers of death when throned on her motorcar was characteristic of the woman given danger and she blossomed into a heroine good or bad as circumstances served at heart she was no vapid society woman and her fiery pursuit of aimless pleasures merely showed her restless and masculine temperament danger braced her at times during her first taste of it she had certainly given way from overstrained nerves but now she was steeled to the worst that could happen blooded to the open trail baptised in unholy fire if katinka and demetrius returned to london to give battle she was certain absolutely certain that she could beat them singlehanded katinka she felt was the more dangerous of the two well let her come let him come and victory be to the selfconfident leah was so sure of her triumph that she did not even cast a thought to her hardworked fetish all the same she kept the peacocks feather constantly in her pocket jim said the duchess that night after a ttette dinner when the pair reached the coffee stage let us sell up drop our rank and go to canada the duke stared as well he might good lord pooh why do you not say damn as i feel inclined to do jim still stared with infantile blue eyes you say such queer things he objected fishing for a cigar i should like to do them oh why wasnt i born a real live man i should have livedlivedlived well said jim stolidly clipping his weed you live now dont you in a satinlined rosewood jewelbox if you call that living i see what you mean confessed the duke lighting up same here i was ever so much jollier aboard that dirty tramp i slugged one of the crewa finn he wasa hulking finn who thought i was a worldcrawler an no man they carried him away in bits finished jim with the battlelight in his blue eyes leah looked at him curiously jim i really believe that we might understand one another you and i are meant to be pals and not a conventional man and wife if you were only a backwoodsman i should adore you an do the washin an the scrubbing and the cookin i fancy i see you puttin your back into that sort of work leah honeypots are more in your line i am as sick of honeypots as you are all this dressing and undressing and court functions and paltry pigeonshooting and skating at princes on sham ice and yachting at cowes in a floating hoteloh lord how it bores me youre always bored grunted her husband unsympathetically can you wonder at it when i have to go round and round and round in a decorated ring like a trickpony if i were a woman it would be satisfactory no doubt well said jim obtusely aint you a woman leah sprang from her chair and flung out her arms with a deep chest breath i am a man she announced in resonant contralto tones i feel like one anyhow didnt some one say there was no sense in this grownup business well i am like that up to the time you went after lola fajardo i did enjoy things all round but somehow i feel as though the bottom had dropped out of creation drop lola fajardo also then growled the duke colouring i never went near her because you couldnt the serpent in the bambooeh jim i dont care anything for her now leah looked at him steadily i am glad of that because you belong to meto me and much you think of me i think you are extremely selfish and desperately weak with even ugly women and quite a brute when you dont get your own pretty way andin short you are a man a glorious lord of creation oh drop rottin i am not rotting as you delicately put it like myself this sugary civilisation has spoiled you if you had to earn your bread i should respect you jim i might even love you yesshe considered for a momenti daresay it might come to that jim was growing bewildered what does all this mean was his very natural interrogation his wife bewildered him still more by acting in a way which made him gasp she walked round the table and standing at his back placed her arms round his neck ill tell you jim i have just found out by my very own self that you and i are cavepeople pitchforked into the wrong century we live ten thousand years too latejust think of itten thousand years of life and death let us go back to the mud jim and take up the life where we left it when you were killed spearing that mammoth leah his head was thrown back and his eyes stared upward in alarm i know what you think but i am as sane as you are and ten times cleverer no she loosened her arms from his neck and locked them behind her look at me jim am i a doll the startled duke wheeled his chair and stared at her brilliant eyes no longer hard and cold at her stately figure her splendid red hair her clearly cut face flushed and animated youre a rippin fine woman said he his sluggish pulses stirred so you thinkso the world thinks yet i have to live in a wadded box like a wax doll i want to get out of that boxit stifles me chokes me i am sick of the tents of shem and wish to house under those of esau you and i will take the privilege of rank and be eccentric as pals well get on much better than as a mayfair man and wife of the wrong sort beyond the borders of this horrid civilisation that is buy a yacht jima tramp hulk with those triple expansion engines you told me about and let us make for the south seas theres a clear path down channel let us explore let us venture into the naked lands and exploit the fringes of the empire i want to liveto live you understand oh she cried almost fiercely cant you understand no said jim truthfully and as stolid as ever you have your rank to think of and my name the fire died out of leahs eyes the colour from her face the ring from her voice even her figure seemed to dwindle from that of a tragedy queen into a conventional belgravian wife then she laughed shortly and in a way which jim did not approve of in his duchess i beg your pardon pentland said leah using his title to mark the far recoil i took you for a man you are nothing but a society gramophone jim would have resented this contemptuous description but that she gave him no time to formulate an idea in his slowthinking brain with swift steps she left the room and ascended to her boudoir there after locking the door with a strength which disordered the lock she flung herself face downward on the sofa and cried quietly passionately with that suppressed anger and grief and rage which rends the body and brain so terribly jim could not would not understand he was what he always had beenthe sole gadarene pig into which a devilkin had not entered can i never put fire into that clay sobbed leah savagely only god could have done that and she did not believe in god but the fetish was in her pocket chapter xxxi leah made no farther attempt to decivilise jim he was too engrossed in egyptian fleshpots to set out for the promised land of splendid adventure and elizabethan enterprise in his clay there did lurk a spark of that promethean fire which melting meaner aims into one passionate purpose to explore the world and exploit the world has made england great unfortunately it could not be fanned into anything resembling a flame the cucumbers the melons the leeks and the garlic of civilisation appealed to him insistently and even if he did betake himself to roaming unfenced wastes he certainly would not number a wife amongst his luggage moreoverand this she knew by instincthis basic qualities were markedly those of the homing kind this being so a few months of tent and road would be used by him as a relish to increased appreciation of the cedar chambers and painted halls wherein his cradle had been rocked it was clearly impossible to make a silken purse out of this particular sows ear so jim drowsed very contentedly beside the fire while his wife out of sheer ennui chased piccadilly butterflies or sat in her ducal niche to be bored with social adoration but one thing rendered life endurable to leah pentland at this juncture and that was her coming opportunity to exhaust the enjoyable now that the days of compulsory sorrow were ended she had plenty to do and ample funds for the doing at firmingham the new king and queen celebrated christmas new style with celebrants who were but doubtfully informed as to the why and wherefore of the festival certainly jim and his comusrout invaded church on the holyday and yawned impatiently through liturgy and sermon but this was a concession to county prejudices leah would tolerate no santa claus tree no druidical decorations and no modernised mumming of the middle ages these outofdate enjoyments were replaced by political and poetical tableaux by amateur renderings of smart french and dismal russian plays and by the kitchen lancers when riotous cakewalks palled imported musicians in an incorrect foreign uniform played greigs melodies tschaikowskys weird soundpoems and that nerveexhausting music of the present by herr wagner which has now arrived at its future for the uncouth carol of innocent victorian days was substituted sousas clanging marches comic songs clean but inane and catchy airs from the newest vaudeville miscalled musicalcomedy outofdoor sports included skating on artificial icesince it was a green christmasmotorcar races attempts at golf and poloplaying riding driving and sauntering flirtations while bridge circulated the guests money at odd moments it was truly wonderful to see how completely these nominal christians had substituted a heathen festival of some sort for the orthodox pleasures of tradition the participants in the orgie were all smart and all blass perfectly dressed and triumphantly selfish with that careful avoidance of spoken appreciation which marks the modern trifler they took leave of the duchess with the remark that her notion of what yuletide should be was not half bad a week of dull sundays so to speak had been got through capitally nothing frumpish about the thing pronounced mrs penworthy who had been asked to gratify jim and who had been found woefully wanting in snap every one was quite up to scratch leah pentland did simply ripping off her own the little woman was not talking an unknown language for the latest successor to algy understood her excellently well she spoke the gibberish of those in a hurry which she had taken some pains to acquire the very few words in the dictionary used by the fashionable were dropped into the meltingpot and came out in ungrammatical lumps of misused adjectives and verbs with a paucity of pronouns and prepositions mrs penworthy whose sense of humour was strong had proposed that lionel should translate the bible into this timesaving vernacular so that its spiritual meaning could be arrived at by those who thought the verse of milton and the prose of bacon starchy wouldnt hear of it said she to algys latest successor while munching american sweets in the upgoing train told him it would be spiffing to fetch the psalms up to mark but he didnt catch on somehow wonder the duchess can stand him with his horrid correctness shes fond of doing herself well thought the duchess had rather a shoppin face replied the man meaning that his hostess had looked worried dont knew why she should got heaps of cake to chew might be she missed demetrius wheresey hang out dont know went prancing off on his own got a puff the inheritor of algys shoes provided the lady with a cigarette fancied she cottoned to th askew chap he remarked striking a match sure she didoh rather aksakoff let on to me bout the boy jumping paris to get fixedbritish embassy fixings you know leah pentland didnt bring it off somehow lucky for her seeing jim wasnt a goner we really could not have received her ended mrs penworthy then aware that she had lapsed into decent english corrected her mistake mean we couldnt have let her chip into our game like th duchess inquired her companion languidly dont know quite saucy and swagger and all that freezes a bitwhat talks like a book you know awfully expensive rattle the man nodded thought she wasnt up to dick daresay shell spin along on her own freely when the humps off hump she hasnt got the hump or the needle either very saucy hump insisted the male linguistquite birdish sorry the old duke an frith hopped maybe how very unnatural sighed mrs penworthy reverting to english in her disgust quite too awfl to think how luck hooks on to her really makes one wish to be a bad woman to see how she lands the salmon she finished more creditably algys latest successor was right for once in his life of mistakes leah was not entirely her own brilliant self notwithstanding that successful inauguration of the new era the early excitement consequent on the conversation with aksakoff had died away and again she felt the old haunting fear of the possible but this absurd mood she hoped would pass away when the test came facing her enemies male and female she would doubtless fight like a cornered rat and would conquer from sheer determination not to be beaten nevertheless this period of suspense was trying to one who had no listener and who could not talk herself into heroics by mere monologues a confidant was necessary only to the weaker part of her character since her deepest feelings advised her that pure strength must needs be solitary she was an oak not an ivy and unknowingly agreed with emerson as to the vitiating effects of comfortable circumstances cast the bantling on the rocks sang the seer of concord and leah indubitably squirmed thereon as jim had informed her in his simple way in a conversation nowapparentlysome centuries old every months a year now sighed leah wearily however pending a possible fight for her social throne the duchess made the very best of the passing hour after the pagan entertainment of the winter solstice she endured the gorging christianity of a few belated countryhouses whose inhabitants were still eating in honour of a birth which had taken place some two thousand years ago as a book they seldom read assured them she went alone to these vitellian feasts as jim was off the chain until such time as he would be needed to play duke during the season the aristocratic prodigals reformation was but skindeep and the late whitewash soon wore off to show the unchanged black fleece since he began with the zeal of a newly uniformed subaltern to poach on various matrimonial manors mrs penworthy he had naturally grown tired of as she preferred syndicates to partnerships so he placed his tried affections on lady sandal who was horsey and doggy and tremendously expensive on account of her betting craze she and jim talked kennels and stables discussing their very unplatonic loves between times and found each other kindred guttersnipes of the earthly sensual kind leah speedily informed by a feminine sidewind of this new amusement of jims fourandtwenty leisure hours did not object or even hint her knowledge of his backsliding it kept him out of her way and lord sandal a nero with limitations who dwelt in a superlative glass house was not likely to submit his wifes latest sin to the fierce light which beats upon the divorce court witnessbox nothing could be more satisfactory to a woman who wanted complete freedom and leah again thanked the agreeable fetish for making straight her very crooked paths but all this time the sword dangled over leahs head and its menace became so insupportable that she wished the single hair would give way to decide brusquely for hit or miss her desire was gratified on the very night when she made her curtsey to the sovereigns having created an immense impression the duchess with eyes as radiant as the family diamonds crowning her imperial head returned at midnight to her home in the company of a purring husband jim really felt that leah had upheld the family name with her insolent beauty and moreover was quite the grandestlooking woman in london or out of it when they arrived in their own drawingroom and she had emerged a royal court butterfly from the chrysalis of her cloak he turned abruptly and took her in his arms with the hug of a bear leah he murmured hoarselyoh leah and kissed her fair on the mouth with the kiss of pan but only once did he exercise that connubial privilege for she released herself roughly with a sense of intolerable outrage isnt it rather late in the day she asked scornful and angry pon my word leah id be a good husband to you if you would only let me oh as an overmarried turk i am sure you would be admirable i know you disapprove of monogamy what the deuce is that something that the church encourages and society shirks the sandal woman can explain the objection jim winced at her knowledge of his latest love you said that i belonged to you he reminded her sulkily officially may i ask the reason for this sudden devotion you look so rippin thanks for the belated compliment i am aware that your love is dependent upon the eye an what else should it be dependent upon the heart may have something to do with it you knowor rather you do not know since our conversation when i asked you to buy a yacht i have given up trying to educate you in the affections ill buy a yacht nowa dozen yachts to please you oh said the duchess with a cold smile so that epsomnewmarket woman has been nasty jim uttered a bad word under his breath and flung out of the room in a pet ill play at the club till alls blue he called out while banging the door and a minute later she heard the butler whistle for a hansom the deserted wife was perfectly aware that jims sudden admiration arose from pride of proprietorship and objected to be cajoled into righteous matrimonial principles on such terms as it was scarcely one oclock she seated herself to consider if it would be worth while to lift her uxorious pig out of the mire he loved a footman with a salver interrupted these creditable meditations a lady called twice to see your grace this evening said the man presenting a visitingcard and has now called again the duchess lifted her eyebrows as she lifted the card at this hour the lady says her business is important your grace what business here her eyes fell on the card and a swift alteration of expression changed her into a different and harder woman ask mademoiselle aksakoff to join me here she ordered abruptly the sword had not yet dropped but the hair could not suspend it much longer katinka was in england in london in her house and demetrius what of him why had he not come also leah asked herself these questions with brutal directness resolved to shirk nothing of the imminent danger after the first dash of dismay her nerves braced themselves for the ordeal and she advanced to greet mademoiselle aksakoff with a conventional smile meaning nothing and yet everything this gave place to an amazed look when she beheld the haggard antagonist with whom she had to cross swords mydeargirl what have you been doing with yourself she might well ask katinka was no longer the demure nun but a fierce goaded creature of the feline tribe dressed quietly in unrelieved black hatted cloaked and gloved she presented the appearance of one sorely tried in the fiery furnace of affliction and less lucky than daniels brethren that thin worn face those hollow eyes the wry mouth the dark hair plentifully bestreaked with greyshe was demoralised uncanny and aggressively cruel in a flash the duchess knew that this untimely visitor knew the truth and was prepared to do battle no quarter would be given by katinka aksakoff and leah with a deep breath braced herself for an armageddon duel the contrast between the dowdy russian girl and the magnificently arrayed woman lay entirely in the garb otherwise they were cats of the wildest their faces took on a marked resemblance a stealthy cunning sly guarded expression effaced their ordinary looks if katinkas eyes gleamed dangerously so did those of leah if leah held herself like a pantheress about to spring so did katinka in that splendid room two prehistoric creatures were about to fight over the male here indeed was woman the female of man civilisation was nowhere you know why i have come asked katinka in a voice as hard as her eyes and those might have been fashioned of granite leah with flattened ears so to speak professed ignorance she did not intend to criticise until fully aware of facts a shake of her head conveyed the denial and brought forth one bitter word liar the duchess glanced towards the door remembering that the servants had not yet retired and might be within earshot would you mind speaking in a lower tone she suggested between her teeth for the insult struck home sit down ordered katinka imperiously i prefer to stand retorted her antagonist fighting for the inch mademoiselle aksakoff advanced one step and her eyes probed those of the duchess without words the situation was adjusted and in leahs favour for the russian suddenly sat down with a quick indrawn breath by that action the woman who had done the wrong knew that she was the stronger of the two and a tyrannical instinct to bully the weak rose hotly in her breast what do you mean by coming at this late hour and misbehaving she demanded harshly you know well what i mean pardon me i never profess to understand the vagaries of a madwoman at this brutal speech katinkas hand shot into her pocket but leah did not move a weapon she asked sneeringly that would be quite in keeping with your blatant nationality foreigners are so fond of the melodramatic the girl withdrew her hand quietly you are too poor a creature to kill lady james leah smiled at the old title and passed the remark with a contemptuous shrug later on perhapswho knows who indeed it is impossible to foresee what an hysterical lunatic will do do you propose to shoot or stab me or to blow me up i understand that bombs are favoured in your happy country the crude hostility of the speech was plainly intended to infuriate the slavwoman but it missed the mark aimed at katinka looked at the mocker gravely how afraid you are leah shrugged again the remark was too futile to be commented upon yes you are went on the other a trifle roused else you would have me turned out by your servants later on perhapswho knows repeated the duchess using the girls own words then continued soothingly no i shall not call the servants and make a scandal since your father is my friend your accomplice lady james what an unpleasant word and how very unsuitable for what you did in paris i did nothing in paris to deserve such a word perhaps you mean something else you foreigners know the grammar of english but rarely the meaning of words i remarked the same defect in your father i have no father indeed i have not yet heard of his death your misunderstanding of my meaning is pretence ignorance i assure you and as it grows late and i am tired may i ask you to explain your business i can do so in one worddemetrius katinka rose to give full force of expression to the name and her voice rose with the utterance leah remained perfectly calm and indulged in badinage demetrius oh yes that horrid little man with the waxed moustache a doctor or a chemist wasnt he your lover oh no i have no use for that sort of person if i had i should certainly not pick one out of the gutter demetrius yes she went on musingly but watchful of her enemy i had almost forgotten him he went to st petersburg didnt he and you loved him i remember a queer choice i thought at the time well have you married him it grows late and you are tired mocked katinka successfully keeping her temper and thereby disappointing the duchess we had better not waste time leah yawned it seems to me that we have been doing nothing else since you came in demetrius is in england really how very interesting as doctor or prince as an escaped siberian felon no leahs face assumed a skilful expression of mingled pity and horror poor little man he was mad to go to russia i thought so when i read his letter which i sent you the forged letter dont be silly one would think you were on the stage katinka bit her lip to prevent furious speech and locked her arms behind her as though she feared lest temper should engender violence leah noted her expression however and retreated towards the bell you are talking nonsense she said coldly and much as i respect your father i shall certainly summon the servants to put you out unless you go at once i shall not go and you shall not order your servants to put me out cried katinka fiercely i defy you to press the button of the bell with a feeling that the girl had scored on this occasion leah withdrew her hand making the usual excuse for your fathers sake i spare you the indignity i repeat that i have no father and i repeat that i am tired what do you want you must arrange with me to see constantine who is constantine you know i do not you do their eyes met and this time leah won the victory over a woman obviously worn out constantine is demetrius explained the russian in a fatigued voice and closing her eyes oh my god she dropped into her seat with a low wail and covered her face leah heard the clock strike the halfhour through the sobs of her visitor she was absolutely sure that katinka was at her mercy and wished to dismiss her beaten and crushed but first it was necessary to learn why demetrius had not come also leah moved swiftly towards the broken creature and laid a firm hand on her heaving shoulder my dear she got no further with the elusive spring of a wild animal katinka flung off the hand reared and struck out the blow fell fairly on leahs mouth and she found herself mopping up the blood of a deeplycut lip before she had any clear idea of what had taken place oh you liar you beast you devil cried the russian with the savagery of a kalmuck tentwoman i could kill youkill you mad mumbled leah with the lace handkerchief to her lips i am sane retorted the other swiftly i know all you lured constantine to paris you sold him to my father to hide your iniquity i saw helfmann the spy do you hearthe spy i bribed him it took months to bribe him but in the end i bought the truth my fathershame to my fatherdrugged constantine at your table and helfmann as a sham doctor took him to havre to kronstadt to moscow the grand duke sergiushere she spat when mentioning the hated nameyes he that beast of beasts sent him to siberia for life arrrfor life do you hear judas jezebel animal that you are i followed there i followed the man i loved and who did not love you muttered the duchess rocking with the pain of her swollen and bleeding lips she had seated herself by this time and did not seek to stem the torrents of insults and why katinka flung back her head and her nostrils dilated because you stole his heart that he might do your evil bidding but he loves me nowwith all his heart and soul he loves me now i went to tomsk to aid his escape i followed to sakhalin i waited and waited eating my heart out oh my heart she laid her hand on her breast oh my breaking heart we escapedhe didi did we escaped do you hear you who sold him there were months of terror and sorrow and cruel cold but god was good he was kinder than man more merciful than you who damned a soul to that frozen hell godthe good god whom i adore and worship she fell on her knees striking her hands togetherhe aided us to reach the waiting ship of strange and strange leah rose shaken and sick strange katinka leaped up to face her the man you bribed with six thousand pounds to take your sin on his soul i know all about your wickedness strange knows constantine knows we will tell the world what we know and you shamed disgraced beaten hounded out of your worldah down will you fallfallunless unless leah gripping a chair and swaying looked up unless you come to southend to see constantine i refuse then i tell everything i go to your husband leah in spite of her pain laughed at the idea i go to your police i tell stop i shall come since you insist upon it i doconstantine likewise he is illvery ill his eyes are blinded by the glare of the snows whither you sent him he isoh my poor angel my patient sainthe is stopping abruptly she looked with an evil eye at the woman she had so shamefully marked i will leave you to see the wreck you have made of him you will come the duchess nodded but i can explain all she mumbled explain it then to constantine said her enemy contemptuously i go now meet me tomorrow at liverpool street stationat the barrier we can go to southend by the five oclock train constantine is on board stranges ship which lies off southend ah then you mean to carry you away no you are not worth it leahs indomitable courage quelled for the moment blazed up fiercely she forgot her pain her disfigured mouth and faced katinka in a blind rage youyou she clenched her hands and panted like a spent runner you have said all i agree to all the russian looked at the wounded mouth with a cruel calm smile then sauntered deliberately to the door there she smiled still more serenely pointed a mocking finger at her enemys wry mouth and slipped away without a word and almost without a sound leah sprang to the mirror had this woman marred her beauty the mouth was swollen the lips still bleeding there were wounds within and without and a rather loose tooth leah could have howled aloud at the shame the humiliation of her defeat that she should be struck beaten masteredshe of all women sheshe arrr augh she cried but softly mindful of danger then the thought came to her that she would have to account for her damaged mouth and with the thought came enlightenment passing quickly out of the room she ascended the stairs rapidly to her room halfway up she stumbled and fell the footman hearing the fall ran up and lifted her he saw that her mouth was bleeding natural enoughoh perfectly natural its them beastly long trains explained the footman in the servants hall chapter xxxii never knew you to tumble before leah grumbled the duke next morning when admitted into his wifes bedroom accidents will happen murmured the duchess rather lamely and too much shaken to be original i cant talk jimmy mouth is still sore what can you expect if you go a mucker an th seasons startin too youll not be able to show with that swellin a week at firmingham will put me right katinka aksakoff is coming down also heard she looked in last night what made her call at so late an hour shes

candidly she never could flirt that will be no drawback said his wife dryly go away please what lie am i to tell bout your sickness tell the truth by way of a novelty or if you prefer a lie say that i have appendicitis one must be fashionable even in diseases all right said jim too obtuse to note the irony sorry youre so ill youve made an awfl mess of yourself women will wear such confounded trains goobye at present ill look in at firmingham durin your week of penance and talking himself out of the room jim went about his ordinary nefarious occupations feeling that he had behaved as a husband should the duchess turned wearily on her pillows and winced not with pain for her mouth though still swollen was much less tender it was the prospect before her that hurt in the evening a difficult interview had to be got through somehow and her brain began to forecast the probable result if katinka could be believed it would scarcely prove to be a pleasant one demetrius apparently intended to punish her by blackening an unsoiled character such a nasty revengeful spirit thought leah feeling illused and depressed but after all what could the man say likely to incriminate her seeing that she had moved amongst the pitfalls of the plot as delicately as agag demetrius had conceived and executed the entire scheme and what he could say would only fit in neatly with stranges confession which the public already knew and condemned her hand could not be traced either in his parisian journey or in the drugging of the tea how was she to know that helfmann was a police spy or that the letter assuring her of the doctors intended return to russia had been deftly forged her surface behaviour at least was perfectly honest and would bear even the scrutiny of an interviewer she could taking a broad view of unpleasant circumstances defy the creature but nevertheless felt instinctively that it would be unwise to dare him to do his worst such a plotting narrowminded sneaking beast would ruin himself to ruin her and mud if thrown persistently was apt to stick even to the whitest robe what a shame that this animal should so persecute her how hard on a kindhearted woman whose sin as he called it was merely an error of judgment by the time leah finished her reflections her frame of mind was one of muchinjured innocence later in the day when driving to liverpool street station to keep her hated appointment leah half decided to call on aksakoff but second thoughts assured her that his intervention was quite out of the question were demetrius to be arrested in british waters the radical press would howl and nasty meddling politicians would ask unnecessary questions in the commons it would be wiser after all to fight alone and to the bitter end if demetrius thought she would give in demetrius was entirely mistaken he had yet to learn that she could be as nasty as hitherto she had been nice but he was horridly ungrateful as all men were in this way did the archplotter salve her conscience and compose her mind it was darkish when the brougham arrived at the station and leah glancing about under the electric lamps saw katinka waiting at the ticketbarrier for the benefit of an inquisitive maid and an observant groom she addressed her gaily though it was not easy to speak with still aching lips you are punctual said the duchess pressing an unwilling hand with ostentatious warmth excuse my speaking much i fell on the stairs last night after you left and hurt my mouth i commiserate with you madame replied katinka sarcastically so good of you i hope m aksakoff will not expect me to chatter my father echoed the girl staring hes at southend isnt he said leah impatiently at least you told me so last night i have instructed my maid to go on to firmingham while we travel straight to southend such a cockney place isnt it then we can get backoh about what time say eleven oclock returned the russian grimly she now saw through the clever comedy which was being played you understand marie said leah turning to her maid who was all ears and eyes see that the brougham is sent in time come with me deartheres a reserved compartmentat least i ordered one curl go and look thus prattling to deceive her domestics leah adjusted a very thick veil which hid from the public a face whose expression was quite at variance with her sweet nothings when the two entered the carriage and the train was moving slowly out of the station katinka burst into a harsh laugh i congratulate you lady james you should have been a conspirator so your dear father told me compliments run in your family apparently surely you do not blame me for putting things right with my servants they might think it queer otherwise and one cannot be too careful with such creatures i fail to see what good your exceedingly clever explanations will do constantine intends to speak out what about asked leah chafing and throwing up her veil to manage the girl more easily with her dominating eyes katinka always fiery and with slack nerves after her siberian experiences almost lost what temper she had left need we keep on your comedy madame im sure i do not know what you mean one would think that i wished to deceive people the way you talk and after what i have done for you tooits most ungrateful and pray what have you done lady james dont call me lady james your stupid mistakes get on my nerves done why i pretended to fall on the stair to excuse the state of my mouth had i been a nasty spiteful creature such as you are i should have given you in charge for assault give me in charge now sneered the girl i might dont drive me into a corner you are inconsistent if you have done nothing wrong how can i drive you into the corner you speak of because you are a monomaniac retorted the duchess angrily you seem to think that i am the cause of the doctors exile i of all people who would not hurt a fly you would hurt a dozen flies if anything was to be gained snapped the other irritably you betrayed my constantine i did nothing of the sort as he will understand when he hears what i have to say hearing and believing are two different things lady james leah shrugged away the speech of course you are prejudiced because demetrius loves me mademoiselle aksakoff fetched a long deep breath do not try me too far do you intend to assault me again no i even apologise for the blow i told constantine this morning of my interview and he said that i was wrong it is for him to deal you justice and punishment punishment justice leah laughed aloud in sheer rage at her inability to parry these insults and for what pray constantine will tell you in that case i do not wish a secondhand judgment from you the two glared at one another venomous and defiant as usual the younger womans eyes fell first and she retreated to the furthermost corner of the carriage while leah pulling down her veil tried to face this most disagreeable situation not another word did they exchange until the ducal servants branched off at shenfield junction and they had to be publicly amiable then again silence reigned until their destination was reached by that time leah was more her old insolent self and disposed to be unpleasant will yon drive or walk asked katinka coldly when they alighted on the southend platform walk of course i do not mind at all being recognised since i have come to see your father on board this yacht captain strange would be flattered by your description the duchess laughed contemptuously as they stepped into the street i am scarcely responsible for m aksakoffs notion of a yacht foreigners are so ignorant they are not so clever as englishmenor englishwomen except in trickery and blackmail where they surpass them retorted leah her petty rage insisting on having the last word katinka permitted her the gratification and they walked the whole length of the high street in grim silence at a rude quay jutting from the beach of the lower town they boarded a disreputable boat rowed by two pirates and steered by a third the night was starry but moonless comparatively calm and noticeably chilly leah shivered as the boat made for a vivid green ridinglight which shone an emerald star no great distance from the shore but her shiver might have been an admission of dread katinka took it to be so and smiled in a gratified way as her enemy climbed the side of the steamer which was a veritable gypsy of the sea untidy dirty and decidedly questionable in honest eyes strange did the honours loudtongued and raucous guess it do my eyes good to see your grace was his welcome hold your tongue and dont use my title she replied furiously stranges milk of human kindness turned sour on the instant i aint highfalutin enough i spose pity i aint a dandy skipper of sorts all hairoil an giddy gold tags leah turned her back without deigning a reply and looked inquiringly at katinka the girl with an enigmatic smile on her wan face led the way down some greasy stairs into a stuffy stateroom and opened the narrow door of a sidecabin leah entered and heard the lock click behind her evidently mademoiselle aksakoff did not think it judicious to remain but i daresay her ear is at the keyhole thought the duchess contemptuously she was trying to preserve her selfrespect by heaping obloquy on her rival but scarcely succeeded as well as she desired then she said ugh twice and with emphasis the interjections were not meant for the girls possible eavesdropping but to show leahs disgust at the close atmosphere of the cabin it was a nauseous musky sickly odour which reminded her only too vividly of the monkeyhouse at the zoo neither light nor air entered the den save through the round porthole over the bunk which was unscrewed but even the briny seabreeze blowing softly could not do away with that thick tainted atmosphere which had provoked the visitors exclamations with her handkerchief to her mouth leahs eyes strove to become accustomed to the faint light she saw dimly a heap of blankets but no form was visible beneath and no face was to be seen possible trickery occurred to her until a voice came heavily through the fetid gloom then in spite of its odd strangled sound she felt instinctively that demetrius was buried somewhere under the clothes you will excuse the absence of a lamp madame my eyes are half blinded with the snowglare and very tender how strangely you speak remarked leah involuntarily a sore throat was the hoarse reply siberia as madame must be aware is not a summer climate the wheezy sound ended in a kind of piping whistle i am sorry you have suffered said the duchess at a loss what to say ugh the smell she thought seating herself on a locker and feeling almost too sick to control her faculties madame is too good a dangerous pause ensued while leah wondered what was about to happen the man assuredly was demetrius and demetrius was assuredly extremely ill it was within the bounds of possibility that he might spring up and kill her the thought did not trouble her overmuch so dangerous a business had to be faced undauntedly and she kept down her womanly weakness with masculine strength during those slow minutes she could hear the lapping of the waters on which the vessel rocked hear also the laboured breathing of the sick man this stopped for a moment and then did she hear her own easy breaths demetrius evidently heard them also and had paused to listen he laughed weakly softly clucking like a fowl madame is very brave im frightened to death she assured him to excite his pity your breathing tells me otherwise i am certain madame that your pulse beats regularly and that your nerves are entirely in order is this a consultation she asked coolly it is the farewell of two who loved murmured the hard thick voice muffled by the blankets that is madame of one who loved and of one who did not and therein as m heine truly remarks lies the tragedy of existence demetriusconstantine leah felt that she must come to the point and get rapidly through the interview if only to escape from the sickening atmosphere katinka accuses me of betraying you well madame i did not i swear i did not indeed mademoiselle aksakoff is doubtless mistaken in a way she wishes to save her father from blame as a good daughter should will you explain further madame certainly i came of my own free will to explain katinka told me how ill you were and i could not bear to think you should die believing me to be dishonourable madame speaks hopefully of my dying it would please her perhaps no what do you take me for i never loved you as you wished to be loved but if m aksakoff had not interfered and we had married i should have come to love you you speak of what might have been i suppose so circumstances are altered marriage is out of the question assuredly and i am scarcely fit for a bridegroom what is the matter with you asked leah anxiously demetrius passed over the question besides captain strange informed me that your husband has returned madame was doubtless pleased at that marvellous resurrection so cleverly managed no said leah honestly enough i was not but circumstances made it imperative that jim should return and for me to travel in siberia blame m aksakoff blame m aksakoff she insisted i am innocent be pleased to observe madame that as yet i have brought no accusation against you katinka acted as your mouthpiece you have not my authority to say that then i gather that you do not blame me for your exile how can i with any truth madame seeing that yon accuse m aksakoff i do said leah resolutely in that case i regret that mademoiselle struck the wrong person you know that she struck me i was informed of it this morning and express my regret that she acted so foolishly did the blow hurt you it was most painful i feel it still your lip is cut then both lipsinside luckily so there will be no visible scars but even now a very little would make them bleed such was the profound egotism of her nature that she expected further sympathy from the man she had reduced to such a condition but the doctors stock of polite phrases appeared to be exhausted in place of a compliment came a hoarse chuckle like the cry of an early starling you appear to approve said leah ironically pardon i mentioned before that mademoiselle in my humble opinion was wrong she was very wrong i am not accustomed to deal with wild beasts spare me madame i owe her so much i owe her nothing except revenge for striking me but i excuse that because she is ignorant of the truth i am also ignorant madame you shall hear it nowyes the absolute truth again came the raucous sound which might have been a laugh or a groanleah could not tell which the truth murmured the sick man adding after a significant pause i am waiting madame i went to paris with miss tallentire explained the duchess beginning anywhere in her hurry and mr askew followed followed you certainly not i always detested the boyso conceited he admired miss tallentire and his liking for me was the passing fancy of a shallow nature to arouse your jealousy m aksakoff put it about that mr askew intended to marry me in paris the gossipand it was merely gossipcame to mrs penworthys ears that woman hated me then and hates me now to make mischief she told you you came over to paris there you remember what took place not at our final meeting my last memory of your face is seeing it across the teatable you had a fit of some kind and m aksakoff called up a dr helfmann who took you away in a cab to be cured then i received a letter from you stating that you were going to russia as i fancied you might have settled with m aksakoff about your pardon of course i quite believed it andandi think that is all did you not know that the letter was forged no that the socalled dr helfmann was a spy no that the coffeeor rather that the tea was drugged no how could i possibly know that m aksakoff was using me as his tool if the teait was teawell if he put anything into the tea i did not see him do it it was m aksakoff who gave you into dr helfmanns charge when you were insensible now am i to blame your explanation is eminently satisfactory madame and you believe me it would be impolite to doubt a lady leah was nonplussed she was manufacturing conversation and his comments were trivial if not ironical as she shrewdly suspected she could not quite arrive at his real meaning he avoided answering leading questions and would neither accept not decline her asseverations i have no more to say she remarked with an air of one washing her hands of the whole affair again a deadly silence ensued again she heard the heavy breathing of the creature hidden under the heaped blankets again sounded the drowsy lapping of the water and the faint sigh of the wind this time she resolved to make him speak so that she might learn precisely what he thought but the moments passed and no speech came finally it did come in the unemotional voice of one who speaks in his sleep he discoursed on a subject about which she had no desire to hear parishavrekronstadt said the slow drawling monotonous tone and then the weary journey across the urals oh the cold and the snows and the bitter storms of siberia chains and hunger dirt and rags and alwaysalwaysthe hopeless future none loved me none lifted me up none spoke words of kindness loneliness and sorrow and the constant torment of painful memories the voice died away in a sob leah desperately anxious to defend herself still further would have spoken but her mouth was dry her lips ached tremors thrilled her body as the nerves twittered jumped and quivered over the low bunk she could see the rocking stars as the vessel swung to her anchor what glimmer of light there was revealed faintly the piled blankets and nothing more the face was veiled by almost material shadows and again drearily and heavily rose the thick muddy voice without variance in its tones without the music of feeling it might have been and probably was a voice from the tomb as it surged sluggishly through the fetid gloom st petersburg announced the toneless voice moscow and the farce of a trial the waving of a whitegloved hand and a courtly bow to dismiss me into pain and darkness and to a living grave nijninovgorod and mother volga who takes us convicts to her breast here came the dry chanting of a weird song which made the listeners flesh creep and her guilty soul quail then again slowly wearily demetrius began to name the stations of his cross on the way to the calvary of a final prison kazan pianybor perm the bleak urals that prison wall of the exile ekaterinburg tiumen the doorstep to the barren cell borka dobrouna oshalkathe rough russian names grated on leahs earsyevlevoi and the slowflowing river the prison barge the black bread the bitter biting burning cold tobolsk with its deathly mists and clammy darkness of egypt the charity songthe weary weary miloserdnaya he sang another line or two in a cracked voice and broke out more humanly then the warm sunshine like the smile of the good god and days of those gentle winds we shall never breathe more the flowers and the winds the sunshine and the laughing children samarof sourgout narym he paused to gather strength for the crying of a name which issued with a sob of heartfelt agony tomskoh tomsk those long long days of waiting for what was to be the horrible mercies of the unjust kyrie eleison christe eleison kyrie eleison she saw the convulsive movements of the blankets and knew that he was making the sign of the cross after the crying to god and his son came the protest against the cruelty of man the weary prison of tomsk the roadthe long horrible road to the icebound coast sakhalin the island of pain the hell of the innocent and a human soul lost christe eleison a loving sinning soul for which thou didst die lostlostlost leahs nerves ached and shook and shuddered as the account of the vile journey welled forth smoothly like thick oil with fixed eyes and fascinated ears she took in the terrible odyssey after another sobbing pausethe broken creature was crying bitterlythe voice recommenced droning on one note until leah felt that she could have screamed if only to vary the sound demetrius spoke of the barren wastes of sakhalin in the gulf of ochotsk where the freezing straits of neviski run between mainland and island he told of obdurate cossacks of cruel gaolers of the treacherous gilyak natives who prevent the escape of the mortal damned a note of emotion crept into the voice and in its level tones she discerned a faint hope a smuggled letter and the assurance that help was at hand a corrupted warder a bribed soldier a black starless night and a desperate escape over deserts of snow then came heartrending relations of a drifting boat of suffering and starvation and cold which burnt to the bone leah heard of a brave womanmy lovemy love said the voice tenderlytoiling with a bought japanese fisherman to bring the tiny shallop to a haven beyond the grip of the merciless muscovite the weird tale took her through la perouse straits northward amongst the kurile islands and into the naked lands of kamchatka here again as she gathered the fugitives were in danger of recapture but they fled still further north through the bitter cold and under a bleak sunless sky to herd with the koriaks the tormented voice droned ever on about these filthy savages fisheaters and hunters of the unclean it shuddered through accounts of loathsome diseases and of smoky defiled huts like the hells of swedenborg and the man wailed always ever and again of the danger of being retaken of terrible suspense of shattered nerves and of the eternal strength of a pure womans love the tale ended with painful outbursts of joy at the sight of stranges tramp standing towards the inhospitable siberian coast peace plenty warmth food safety kindness hope love chanted the voice broken up into almost musical gratitude then a pause of infinite meaning ended by a dry clucking chuckle and i lived that i might see you breathed the man she had cast into the hell he had described leahs hair bristled at the roots the speech was so terribly significant but her soul still fought against the inevitable punishment whatever that might be not my fault she panted eagerly horrible horriblebut not my fault oh believebelieve me constantine you have asserted your innocence before murmured the sick man ironically and now now her heart almost stood still so intensely did she listen we must part for ever but youyou i devote what remains of my life to the woman who has saved meto the angel who drew me out of the frozen deeps of hell andand youyou will saynothing this boat leaves here tonight for a place which need not be mentioned i go out of your life for ever and silent oh thank youthank you for what madame since you assure me of your innocence leah felt awkward she had said too much katinka is so prejudiced that i thoughti thought her voice died away the lie would not come forth in the presence of this dying wretch you thought she would be jealous ah no madame demetrius paused and clucked again like a brooding hen she permits you to kiss me with a last kiss no leah half rose and fell again recoiling with a cry of terror at the prospect of setting the final seal on her treachery as did judas in the garden i beg of you my first love one kiss to dismiss me into the silenceto close my mouth for ever and ever so he did doubt her he did not believe all her lies were discounted all his conversation was merely ironical and makebelieve he held her in a vice and release would come only when she submitted to a revolting caress i will noti dare not she stammered shrinking against the wall in an agony of physical fear from an object which a guilty imagination revealed as loathsome to sight and touch youyou have no right to the right of love said the weary voice you have no proof the cypher letters and a lean hand held out a packet drawn from under the discoloured blankets for one kiss madamefor one kiss ugh groaned leah and snatched eagerly packet and hand disappeared swiftly and the voice whistled in a jeering manner one kiss madame one kiss she still fought my mouth is sore i am one kissone kissthe last and the best oror leah writhing against the wall gasped soundlessly in that last word there was the sound of a terrible threat it was the knell of respectability of ease and luxury and of all that makes life worth living a single caress would buy the evidence a touch of her mouth and she would be free for ever and ever and ever one kiss then she muttered and with all her soul crying strenuously against the horror she tottered forward one her lips sought the place where a mouth might be supposed to be waiting two arms flew up and gripped her she could not scream for the arms dragged her down belted her like iron bands her mouth was on his his lips were on hers she writhed silent and agonised in the horrible caress in the abominable embrace trying to free herself in vain demetrius placed his lean hand on the back of her head and absolutely ground her mouth against his own she could feel the wounds break and bleed sanctifying the kiss of judas his arms relaxed she flung backward and the longwithheld scream broke forth shrill and vehement as if in answer to that terrible summons katinka tore open the door and entered with a smoky paraffin lamp with one hand the girl thrust the shaking sobbing woman forward with the other held the lamp towards the face peering out of the blankets oh my god shrieked leah and sprang from the cabin pursued by the cackling of broken laughter she made for the deckfor the sidefor anywhere to be out of the sight of that face that face which would haunt her till she died strange in silence handed her sobbing and whimpering down the black side where the boat received her she dropped in a heap and beside her dropped from katinkas hand a packet of letters above from an open porthole came clucking cackling chuckling laughter insanely gleeful and the silent stars of god shone over land and sea chapter xxxiii so leah won after all she went out with a definite purpose and returned with that purpose achieved yet not fully since what she desired had been flung to her as a bone to a dog in the panicstricken flight from the field she carried with her the spoils of victory and something less desirable the price of her good name the security of her position the entire triumphthese as she well knew had been gained by shameful selfsurrender indeed it could scarcely be called a victory seeing that she had succumbed to the masterful brutality of her enemy neverthelessand she derived comfort from the thoughtit could not be termed a defeat her social glory yet flamed unextinguished her character could not be smirched and she could yet hold up her head to flout the foundout of her sex but something bitter spoiled the flavour of these sweets she had lost her belief in the fetish its spell of good luck was broken her nerve was gone and with it selfrespect all she desired was to hide herself amongst familiar surroundings that their very familiarity might fence in her quailing soul from impossible danger and that the danger could be so described by her intellect revealed a demoralised will the cypher letters attesting her share in the conspiracy she destroyed by fire they were genuinely those she had written and the number was correct so when their ashes floated up the chimney leah drew the long deep relieved breath of one whose chains have been struck off yet even at the moment of release she shuddered to the core of her being the ghost of a futile crime was laid but the ghost might return demetrius had truly parted with all tangible evidence and his unsubstantiated story would be whiffed away as too romantic for belief moreover m aksakoff for the sake of his own good name and that of his government would swear to her innocence of this gross intrigue she was safeabsolutely entirely and wholly safe the world would never know how she had capered on the verge of an abyss or how nearly she had missed her footing but somethingher conscience probablytold her that an unseen judge was summing up her delinquencies that she was being weighed in the balance and would be found wanting even though her kingdom did not pass from her this judge impartial terribly quiet severely righteous might have been god and he was god although she refused recognition her tormented soul inspired her with the dread of an allseeing and condemning eye but she resolutely declined to admit the maker the judge or the unseen in any way shadows should not frighten her for these were not of the eating drinking merrymaking world all the same shadows elusive and unexpected did strike terror to her guilty heart and she reluctantly knew herself to be a broken woman in those earlier hours of safety this knowledge was very insistent the week of her retirement passed pleasantly enough she doctored her bruised lips mended their torn skin and argued occasionally with her shameful soul the quiet life of silent hours in the midst of civilised balms partially restored her courage but not as entirely as she could wish piecing her broken nerves together as best she could she strove to remount the pinnacle of supreme and selfsufficient egotism whence she had fallen but humptydumpty could not be set up again try as she might to replace him during those brooding hours leah recovered much but not all the weeks end found her cured of the skindeep blow and outwardly the same insolent radiant beauty of an adoring world but she knew herself to be a changed being the pantheress had become a hare although less innocent the sword of her tongue was still sharp but the shield of selfrighteousness was broken and a keeneyed antagonist sufficiently assertive could have reduced her to the same moral pulp that the interview with demetrius had left her woe to the vanquished indeed what remained but that she should receive the wooden foil of retirement from destiny and leave the arena for ever her soul protested against this tame submission so with indomitable courage she braced herself to further battle with the world that is not with demetrius his abominable kiss had sapped her forces she could face social enemies she could defy the eternal she could encounter the fiends of hell but not the man who had flung her into the dustwho had trailed her and was still trailing her at his chariot wheels certainly he had steamed into the unknown and she would never behold him more but his black influence remained and made itself felt at untoward moments jim paid his promised visit almost at the end of her seclusion and was disposed to be disagreeable on the plea that his wife had lied unnecessarily being truthful himself when there was nothing to be gained by swerving from the path of rectitude jim abhorred a wasted fib and proceeded to condemn leah for shooting an aimless arrow from her mental quiver it was the most pensive hour of the summer twilight when jim began his sermon and he preached in his wifes sittingroom darby sat beside joan who lay languidly on a sofa what a perfect and touching picture of connubial felicity if only a reporter of backstair gossip had been present to describe this middleclass domesticity of these great leaders of fashion brixton might have learned an edifying lesson from belgravia now i do call it hard on a fellow complained the dukejolly hardthat you cant talk straight leah if i did you would scarcely feel flattered what is it now aksakoff says he was never near southend swore till all was blue that hed never set eyes on that girl for months an months a sad deprivation for so affectionate a father well then he wants to know where she is how should i know replied the duchess indifferently she chose to remain at southend and i returned here alone what were you doin at southend that is my business jim mine also you said something that wasnt true really the accuser of the brethren in the pulpit with a vengeance the duke stared i dont know what you mean i am quite sure you dont stop talking please i am too ill to be worried rats said jim elegantly you look like a picture then permit me the privilege of one and do not ask for replies the duke strolled to the window in a huff and surveyed his property with sulky looks leah sat up on her sofa and pondered as to how much she should say and how much leave unsaid jim had always been under the impression that demetrius had done his dirty work for money and the truth would not probably strike him as amusing leah could easily have conceived and told a pretty fairy tale as she was always resourceful in the way of fiction but the sight of his pink fatuous face filled her with rage why should he be a beast with women and she a vestal with men was not sauce for the gander sauce for the goose also she determined to tell him the whole brutal affair with certain reservations concerning the betrayal of demetrius jim had few moral scruples but what he had would be averse to the betrayal of an accomplice however dangerous yes she would tell him enough to annoy him and shake him out of his aggravating complacency also she wanted some one in whom to confide but how to bring up the subject again without pandering to her husbands desire to be master he gave her the chance immediately like a bulldog jim never let go of anything he had once gripped into his thick head had crept some idea of a mystery connected with southend and with his wifes visit thereto therefore he stared out of the window until he thought she was more amenable to reason and then came back to his seat with the old question why did you go to southend he asked doggedly leah not yet ready fenced i told you why i went no you didnt aksakoff says of course he does did you ever know a diplomatist who told the truth huh that comes well from you considering i never knew that white lies were political privileges besides aksakoff is too ashamed of katinka to tell the truth whats she been doin asked the duke alertly he had the soul of a knitter in the sun for gossip rescuing demetrius answered leah curtly what jim turned white and purple and red and green like a rainbow and spluttered at the mouth his wife eyeing him coldly did not think this exhibition of genuine fear a pretty sight hellwhy helltell gasped jim gulping down an extremely serviceable word which better fitted his feelings than surroundings of course its a question of money i suppose no it isnt but you told me what i chose to tell you i always do was there ever such a trying woman jim gulped down another outofplace oath and strode noisily up and down the room he halted at intervals to tell his wife precisely what he thought of her as the room was isolated and there was no danger of eavesdropping servants he indulged in a raised voice and a flow of language which revealed his very limited vocabulary leah with her chin on her knuckles and a round elbow on the sofa cushion listened unmoved and looked as though she were having her photograph taken jim might have been executing his dance before a graven image for all the emotion she showed ive had enough of this shouted his grace maddened by a disdainful silence just you explain or illwhy hang it ill forget that i am a gentleman it seems to me that you have forgotten oh you would drive a saint mad lionel is perfectly sane and he is the sole saint i have met aint you afraid of my striking you demanded jims bulldog nature horribly afraid cant you see how i tremble poor jim he was quite at the end of his resources mrs penworthy always quailed when he was in his tantrums lady sandal fought fairly and squarely slang for slang but this calm smiling shefiend only sat like a dummy waiting for him to do what she very well knew he would never dare to do i wonder if youre a woman groaned the duke returning beaten and baffled and completely exhausted to his chair i wonder too seeing what you have made me put up with come now ive always treated you well and other women better what other women growled jim on his guard you know very well i dont i know nothin not even why youre bullyraggin me i swear cried jim pathetically to the ceiling that its uncommonly hard for a cheery chap like me to be tied to a woman whowhowho here words failed him and he gasped go on i admire your descriptions of my personality they are so extraordinarily vivid and true who aint what she ought to be leahs opportunity to break the ice had come and locking her hands together she gazed pensively at the duke who wriggled uneasily on his seat how did you guess jim guess what demanded the tormented man that i am not what i ought to be the duke stared aghast then you aint t he shouted dr demetrius might say so leah he sprang up with clenched fists and his face took on a direfully black expression which rejoiced her heart jim i believereally i believe that you have some love for me after all oh hang your fine talk demetrius i have kissed him he dared to kiss you i dared to kiss him you devil he suddenly raised his fist leah never winced although he towered over her with his mouth working and his eyes animal in their unconsidering passion it was impossible to strike although his heart cried out that she ought to die with an oathit came out savagely this timethe fist dropped ill have a divorce muttered jim and plunged for the door because i kissed a man nonsense kissin doesnt stop at kissin not with you perhaps leah he turned and reclosed the door which his rage had wrenched open i know youve got a beastly tongue and all that but i could have sworn that you were as pure as my mother well and so you can what after you confessin that you kissed demetrius ugh leah shuddered as a picture after the style of wiertz rose to her minds eye i kissed a thing which was once demetrius is he dead then better if he were ugh that kiss was the most horrible thing i ever had to do in my life why did you do it then i was forced to she said faintly and nausea made her place a handkerchief suddenly to her lips the duke returned for the third time to his seat and looked into her changing face with round inquiring eyes theres somethin in this i dont catch on to he muttered then with gruff tenderness and a timid caress from which leah did not shrink what is it old girl the duchess laughed it was amusing to find her husband playing the spring bachelor i believe you love me said she recovering her colour you know i do only you keep me at arms length have i not cause you wouldnt have if you behaved as a fellows wife should said the duke bluntly drop skirtin round the bush and plunge in leah admired and respected him in this peremptory mood and for once showed no disposition to use her sharp tongue instinct told her that she had at length reached the end of jims tether and that her easygoing bulldog was inclined to curl his lips therefore did she relate picturesquely and halftruthfully all her doings since the beginning of things in the gallery for the time being her story broke off with the return of his grace jim listened with praiseworthy selfcontrol he certainly growled and scowled at the relation of that early loss which had bound demetrius to the service of the woman who betrayed him but her artless confession robbed the butterfly caress of half its iniquity sometimes he grunted admiration of her pluck during the perils of his absence and grinned when she detailed the melodramatic interview with strange most of the time his eyes searched her face to make certain that she was telling the truth he believed she was although she kept back the precise way in which demetrius had departed for siberia but she laid enough of this particular blame on aksakoffs back to make jim swear the mean dirty foreign hound cursed jim between his teeth i dont pretend to be an angel but if id dropped to that he shook his fist with a scarlet face an to think aksakoff should dare to make use of your roomthe rotten cur ill tell him what i think better not jim let sleeping dogs lie sleepin mongrels muttered the duke all right but dont you ever speak to him again do you hear he blared out the order in a regimental manner and leah nodded yes dear she said meekly we must draw the line somewhere jim nodded and gloomed and rumbled something about aksakoff that certainly was not a benediction then he harked back to his leading question which had not yet been answered why did you go to southend katinka who had rescued demetrius from sakhalin island made me go to see him i had to obey else there might have been trouble the man was ill on board stranges steamer strange thought we paid the cad we did leah frowned at the recollection of the sum but he had some liking for demetrius and helped him to escape worse luck come now dont say that siberia jim shuddered beastly place siberia nonsense the climate is quite decent if you make up your mind i dont believe those convict creatures suffer so much as they say she told the lie without sign of emotion but all the same felt an inward qualm at the memory of the doctors terrible narrative the duke chewed his moustache meditatively an you saw demetrius ugh leah covered her face and rocked to live with that in my thoughts and to think that i kissed it why did you demanded jim furiously to get the cypher letters connected with the insurance plot she replied looking up then detailed with necessary suppressions the greater and least repulsive part of her nauseous visit to the tramp steamer the story sounded by no means pretty and all her courage was necessary to enable her to arrive at finis when she did the duke sprang up in a pelting rage my wife to be treated like that oh the treatment was not so bad lied the duchess easily of course my mouth was sore with the fall on the stairs but i managed to touch the lips of thatthat ugh ugh ill go to southend tomorrow announced the duke frowning i cant thrash demetrius poor devil but ill hammer the life out of that secondhand skipper you wont find the boat there jim i made inquiries and learnt that it left as demetrius said it would shortly after my visit and we are quite safe that kiss leave the kissin alone cried jim turning on her fiercely of course i see you couldnt quite help it but no but at all contradicted leah sharply if i hadnt bought back those cypher letters in that way the whole story might have come out and then jimwell you know i doi do jim groaned and dropped on the sofa beside her oh what fools we were to go into that insurance business it was my fault dear dont worry demetrius will die soon and strange has his blackmail we are entirely safe katinka oh said the duchess with a flippancy she was far from feeling i suppose shell sit by the grave of that man for the rest of her days youre sure hes dyin yes she turned pale and her voice quavered such an object could not possibly live it would be aasin whats his trouble i dont knowi cant say i dont want to say itsits too beastly for words ugh he lookedlookedoh leahs mouth worked like a rebuked child and she burst into tearsinto real womanly tears of shame and terror and outraged modesty that horrible kissoh that horrible kiss she wailed pinching his shoulder in her hysterical emotion poor old girl said jim softly and put his arm round her for once she appreciated marital sympathy and learned that woman was not made to live alone leaning her cheek thankfully against the rough tweed of his coat she sobbed vehemently a frightened and crushed creature jim felt that he was a married man after all and administered gruff consolation it worried him to see this highspirited woman break down so utterly there there said he tenderly its all right old girl youve got me thank god murmured the beaten atheist jim thought she must be going out of her mind whats that that she should thank a god she did not believe in and for a husband whom hitherto she had always scorned quite frightened him whats that leah he asked again thank god for you sobbed the duchess brokenly oh my aunt muttered the startled husband then proceeded to fresh consolation well then ill break the head of any bounder who dares to say a word against you yes but im afraid were wicked jim other people are as bad said the duke stoutly though i dont suppose wed get a sunday school prize course it aint much good racin in blinkers were a bad lot the pair of us ive behaved like a rotter and worse while youre like something i cant think of seems to me leah weve been runnin awfly crooked lets make a fresh start from scratch and go straight for the future tandem y know suggested jim ill be wheeler as usual we must make the best of things i suppose whimpered leah drying her eyes and still too much unstrung to realise her regeneration thats about it well give sin a rest for a bit ill chuck that woman and be your husband i swear leah ill be a methodist parson sort of husband no dont said the duchess alarmed its a mistake to overdo things jim laughed and she laughed well i dont suppose i could keep on that game for long said her husband but i mean that ill be awfly square an footle after you round the town its th sort of thing good husbands do y know give us a kiss old girl an well begin our married life all over again leah obeyed very contentedly and nestled in jims strong arms like an innocent schoolgirl she felt wornout and tired and drowsy from excess of emotion felt also that here was a muchdesired haven for a worried woman dear old jim she sighed and jim kissed her again the light was dying out of the sunset sky and the room filled with pale warm shadows the reconciled pair sat silently on the sofa in the gathering darkness locked in a close embrace the remorseful jim felt that they were prisoners in the same dock and anxiously paved a certain place with the very best intentions leah went to sleep thanks to a less tender conscience to the world these two were the prosperous and happy duke and duchess of pentland to themselves a misguided couple driven to do wrong by circumstances but to godwhat did they appear in gods sight remorse is not repentance and remorse was the sole feeling of which they were capable leahs sleep was the slumber of the wornout jims selfpromised reformation the result of shame shallow beings miserable creatures they could not plumb the depth of their wrongdoing to them sins were faults and they were governed less by the sermon on the mount than by the laws of society indeed it is questionable if either one of them was aware that such a sermon had been preached but both knew to a hair how far they could go without being ostracised jim was the better of the two for the cold brutal story told by his wife made him hot with the publicschool shame of having done things which no fellow could do the drastic codes of eton and harrow and rugby and winchester came to his mind and he saw how he had sinned against the primitive laws of honour without oaths he swore to lead a better and cleaner life with leah to help him he would be charitable and a good landlord and take the chair at public dinners and speak in the lords and chuck lady sandalwho was too expensiveand drop gambling to a certain extent and not swear more than necessary andanddo what a man in his high position ought to do it will thus be seen that poor jims ideas of reformation were crude he felt this himself poor man in his narrow brain and like the child he really was looked down to ask his clever wifes advice he had no time to consider the irony of the thing even if it had occurred to him for discovering that leah was sound asleep he wondered hugely from the placid expression of her face it was very plain that her crimes had not followed her into dreamland jim whistled softly marvelling that she could slumber so immediately after what she had told him laying her gently back on the sofa he summoned her maid and went about his own business this was to begin reformation without loss of time i must help leah to be good said the new broom but first he had to reform himself and set about the first step or what he conceived to be the first step with the enthusiasm of the very bad person made uncomfortable by remorse the vicar of firmingham received a visit from his patron just as he was about to enjoy a wellearned dinner lionel said the duke nervously im comin to communion in a month could you get me whitewashed in that time lionel stared and looked upward strange to say the heavens did not fall chapter xxxiv were a purblind generation convinced of the invaluable blessings of sorrow trouble would be robbed of its sting ignorance and fear make the unenlightened bemoan their burdens or shirk bearing them as they should be borne with the strength of hope chastening is the gift of the eternal love and those happy few who know this submit with joy to the improving rod but worrying is not submission nor is grumbling a recognition of curative effects to be manful to be daring to be so entirely wise from the learning of the lesson as to extract the sweet from the bitter thus do we prove ourselves worthy of that suffering which god bestows in mercy and in pity troubles if rightly understood deepen the most shallow character purify the most soiled soul they begin in woe but they end in joy when the lesson is learned then comes the holidayor more precisely the holydayof peace and gladness jim in his simple way understood that out of apparent evil great good had come to himself and leah never before had they understood each other so well never before had they forgathered with less friction the dukes reformation was as genuine as his embryonic soul was capable of making it he felt desperately ashamed of himself at the communion table and shame of self provided the physical ego be not considered is the beginning of repentance which leads to hope which brings pardon and solace to the uneasy sinful heart jim did not become a saint by any manner of means but he tried by fits and starts to be a better man and so with true though faltering zeal advanced towards the light and it was much gained that so once selfsatisfied a man should acknowledge himself to be at all in need of improvement the recalled code of schoolboy honour helped him to amend the less drastic rules of the society man could jim have only gone still farther back and remembered helpful nursery prayers and childish faith he might have seen even more clearly how to utilise his mistakes but he was yet a spirit in embryo and his receptive powers were not great leah did not keep pace with her husband on the upward path when the danger was brought to naught and her nerves became more normal she forgot everything with the alacrity of a hardened heart the wind of the spirit had but troubled the surface of her nature its depths remained undisturbed within a fortnight her dear devil of egotism returned and she tore out of her book of life the disagreeable page which she declined to read for the second time certainly she retained so much grace and memory as not to laugh at jims efforts to be good and she was less ready than of yore to see and comment upon his obvious failings but she secretly wondered that he should try to be pious when there was no worldly advantage to be gained by such dullness besides jim with the zeal of the newly converted began to preach in a stammering shamefaced way about the duties they owed to themselves in particular and to society at large he even looked up noblesse oblige at the tailend of the dictionary and quoted the platitude to leah on that occasion she had laughed consumedly but truth to say jims sermons bored her immensely she preferred those of lionel who as a professional guide to glory knew his business whereas poor dear jim was hopelessly muddled therefore while the duke laboriously tried to be good and succeeded but doubtfully leah was coquetting deliriously with the world the flesh and the many agreeable devils of her acquaintance she improved her former extravagances into something worse and revenged herself for being agreeable to jim by letting both friends and enemies have the full benefit of her witty cruel tongue the few who did not come under its lash were in ecstasies at her sparkling conversation and the many who did made themselves pronouncedly pleasant out of mortal fear leah danced and sang through the season with the insolent glee of a woman who knows her position to be unassailable jim wondered at her short memory and tried to refresh it but that she would not endure and declined even to hear the name of demetrius moreover as m aksakoff had been translated to copenhagen there was no need to smooth matters over between him and the duke everything was safe everything was ripping and she felt that her latest pas de seul was being executed on firm ground she had skipped in the very nick of time from that dangerous old mount which had erupted so feebly and no one could say but what she did her best to be amiable late in the season she met and congratulated mr and mrs askew she told lady richardson how she admired her courageunderlinedin marrying that handsome pauper captain lake and forgivingly did she condole with mrs penworthy when the unexpected death of freddy from overwork left that evergreen hack a widow whom no admirer wished to marry lady canvey was most tenderly considered and wallace the globetrotting cynic on leahs introduction amused the stayathome old lady by special command the sedate hengists thought even more of the duchess than they had done of lady jim and she was often asked to bore herself in their protective company she gave sir billy richardson a smiling time at one of the ducal seats and invited joan kaimes to curzon street for a week of shopping and frivolity also bazaars and charity concerts and meetings about the unemployed aristocracy took up her attention the fashionable congregation of an exclusive church beheld her regularly in its midst and heard the audible admission that she was a miserable sinnera most touching confession for a truly good duchess to make then she befriended a bishop who was not too straightlaced and induced him to preach a scientific sermon in lionels church of which lionel very nastily did not approve oh it was a merry time when the grapes were ripe and the firstfruits of her ducal harvest were being gathered in the duchess of pentland won golden opinions even from the censorious things could not have been better managed by the discarded fetish and leah admitted that in this respectable orgy the birthday of her life had come during this meteoric career it surprised every one that she should choose to retire suddenly fashion clamoured at her closed doors society journals wondered and lamented individual friends expressed themselves puzzled and in print and conversation the freak of a duchess who chose to disappear was freely discussed it was as though the noonday sun should set unexpectedly leahs radiant orb had blazed triumphantly for a few months paling the lesser stars of society and thenhad vanished the duke when applied to for an explanation stated that she had gone abroad because her health washumhumhum she crossed the channel alone too which looked odd people began to talk and to invent reasons to explain the inexplicable but not even the most daring hinted at a connubial disagreement jim would have stopped any such rumour at once with high words not that it could arise seeing that he thanked god publicly every sunday for possessing a wife whose price was far above rubies but whatever had happened whatever might be the reason it was indisputable that the beautiful and wealthy and clever and popular duchess of pentland had retired from the world in her heyday of social success lionel was the first to hear of her when she returned unexpectedly to firmingham after a months sojourn on the continent one day in the chilly grey autumn weather he received a note asking him to call at four oclock and went unthinkingly to pass through what he afterwards remembered as the most painful hour of his life he fancied when setting out that leah merely wished to see him about the duke it might be that jim with the old adam leaven still working within had broken out again and that lionel was summoned to call the sinner a second time to repentance but the duke as he gathered from old colley was vegetating at hengist castle it was impossible that the old adam could emerge from his penitential cell in so respectable and moral a neighbourhood leah received her cousin in the sittingroom of her lady jim days where they had twice talked seriously later on it appeared that she had a special reason for selecting an apartment sanctified by the vicars endeavour to improve her into a moderately presentable angel it was a charming and tastefully decorated room and the duchess was as tastefully decorated and as charming as her surroundings she sat in a deep chair by a brisk fire dressed with that perfect choice of colour and material which always distinguished her the delicate blue of her frock and a selection of certain filigree silver ornaments matched marvellously with her splendid red hair and sapphire eyes lionel noted an unusual pallor but thought that he had never seen her look more lovely apparently she had been reading for she dropped her handkerchief over an open book on the small table at her elbow when she rose to shake hands he mechanically wondered at the trivial action and learned its significance later so very kind of you to come lionel said the duchess pressing his hand cordially i know how busy you are with your parishioners you are one of them smiled the clergyman at odd moments certainly but we globetrot for our places of worship nowadays sit down she indicated a convenient chair opposite her own now tell me the news of your small world is joan quite well could not be better considering the circumstances i am so glad when do you expect the happy event in a month please god leah looked pensively into the fire i hope it will be a boy i shall be more than content with a girl why a boy particularly why not when an heir is so important you succeed jim and a new marquis of frith my dear duchess you and the duke are young there is little chance of my succeeding i may be congratulating you some day no cried leah almost fiercely such a thing can never be thank god lionel stared why thank god oheri hardly know of course i should hate to be pestered with children the nursery is an obsolete institution here and will remain so unlessshe hesitatedunless jim marries again duchess why not leah if it will please you but why talk of jims marrying again when you are in the best of health and spirits she shrugged indifferently one never knows i might go first i sincerely trust not does that imply that you wish me to be a real widow after posing as a sham one of course not but you talk so strangely and so honestly remember i have always paid you the compliment of being plain even to rudeness lionel tried to read her face but in vain and could not arrive at the meaning of her apparently aimless conversation the slanting rays of sunset made a radiant glory round her as she half sat half reclined in the chair and her beauty could bear even that merciless test youth health money charm lovelinesswith these desirable blessings at her command what else could she want i do not quite understand said the perplexed man understand what she asked absently then became more alive to his question oh my chatter you will before we part i am no sphinx to propose riddles every woman is a sphinx without a secret that is why you men find us so difficult to comprehend i confess to the difficulty at this moment what a complex mind i must have yet i am a very ordinary butterfly of fashion something with wings at all events though not entirely an angel her visitor laughed am i to pay you a compliment or rebuke you for frivolity you can do both or either the sweet first will counterbalance the bitter last but i sicken of compliments even when genuine they never are men say things they dont mean to women out of traditional reverence for the exploded idea of the weaker vessel when you meet a child your first thought is to give it sweets when you talk with us the same thought is translated into polite lies and we never believe younever leah assured him plain or beautiful vain or humble we price the words directly in no case have i found them to be of value you make us out to be fools one must be truthful at times of course i always except you lionel as you are more man than parson cannot i be both oh yes when miracles occur lately i heard of a parson who laboured solitary and freezing amongst the snows of labrador for a poor eighty pounds a year he was emphatically a man and a parson supplemented the vicar so you see miracles do occur a warm colour crept into leahs cheeks and she looked piercingly at her companion do they nowadays i mean i am not using a mere phrase believe me honestly now could those gospel miracles occur in this twentieth century lionel mused and considered a careful reply our master was given the spirit without measure as a man because he was the son of the most high by that wisdom did he work his marvels but the apostles in his power also prevailed over the apparently natural showing signs and wonders to the glory of the risen lord and his father with faith ye can do all things said the blessed jesus himself yes leah i reverently believe that with purity faith and a humble trust in the father by the merits of the son and by the power of the holy ghost miracles could take place today then why dont they she asked abruptly the vicar sighing dropped into the highpitched singsong of the pulpit a faithless and perverse generation a scientific generation you mean i dont believei cant believeand i wont believe prove the power of your master you have faith you are good you no no you go too fast i assuredly try to be good but i am sadly wanting in many ways i have faith but how weak how faltering who am i to claim that the lord should select me to reveal his strength unto men i can work no miracle leah would to god that i could if only to convince you would to god that you could she echoed with something like a groan and the faint flush disappeared like the dying out of a hope why do you a sceptic ask about these things leah possessed by the spirit of the perverse laughed maliciously jim is trying to be good why should not i try also since a wife is bound to follow her husband according to st paul who by the way was a bachelor but her mood shifted jim has a tinpot sort of faith which is better than nothing i have not and so like your unbelieving jews require a sign lionel became professionally interested descrying intimations of a changed heart i believe that you will yet find the kingdom he said hopefully dont you make any such mistake she retorted i have not yet set out to find it and never will unless i see some of those wonders about which you talk so glibly but believe me i do though not to the extent of bible magic you hypnotise yourself into crediting the impossible i wish you could hypnotise me oh i wishi wishi wish she ended passionately faith is not hypnotism argued lionel the word grated on his ear it isit isit is leah was vehement in her denial science can explain everything why do you come here to prate of miracles when you know in your own heart that such things never were and never can be they were and they can be and they will be while christ reigneth asserted the vicar firmly nothing is impossible to god then call upon him and work your marvel i am not worthy you are not able rather and she taunted him as did elijah the priests of baal their god kaimes wondered at her restless moods and wondered still more when she abruptly left the serious subject they were discussingand on her own initiativeto talk most frivolously i have heard you preach went on this weathercock and i am no more to be persuaded than was agrippa you and your shadowsshe whiffed these away pouf let us talk of real things and a toss of her head dismissed the spiritual for the purely temporal i had such a ripping time this season rattled on the nature set upon pomps and vanities leah leah how can you change so rapidly oh my good man i am a twirlmagee woman ever seeking variety religious conversation is neither amusing nor convincing its much more fun to talk of ones friends and abuse their failings i decline to join in said lionel dryly and feeling nonplussed because you have no sense of humour what a dull time of it joan must have poor child she does not complain he objected stiffly oh lord what is the use of complaining i never whimper about jim though his goodness is even duller than his badness i have tried george drunk i have tried george sobershe was quoting an epigram of charles iiand there is nothing in george you are unnecessarily personal rebuked kaimes annoyed thats right tramp on your little corns and you howl he intimated that he desired to leave my time is valuable oh i know yon are a millionaire of seconds and hours how disagreeable you are when i want to be amused you have just informed me that i am dull he reminded her pointedly so you are all honest men are dull why i dont know unless it is that honesty and wit match as ill as beauty and brains now dont look at your watch again i have something to tell you that will make your clerical hair stand on end what could one do with such a whirlwind woman the vicar replaced his watch and shrugged resignedly she was what she had always been freakish and uncertain but on this occasion more so than usual an april lady whimsical and irresponsible decidedly rude and aggravatingly amusing but kaimes instinctively felt that at the back of these volleying drifts of smalltalk lurked something serious which she feared to handle hoping that in time it might be manifested to his intelligence he waited patiently while leah scrambled on verbosely in her gabble of nothings you need a london month to pull you together dull country dull man dull man awful bore get a parish in the west end youll have howling larks converting dives and jezebel of the drawingroom i do not look upon conversion as a lark i do especially with jim oh lord to think that he of all people should turn goodygoody you are pleased of course the sight of the lost black sheep trotting home to fodder to the fold is i really cannot listen to this talk said lionel rising quickly yes you can ill shock you more before ive done kaimes resumed his seat blankly but your reason leah jumped up as her visitor sat down and addressed nothing in particular he asks for reason and from a woman she exclaimed so like that lame lord esbrook he always asks what he should not and what he is never likely to get reason from women and from men who have still less to spare but thats his way have you met lord esbrook such a funny walk as he has dot and carry onewooden leg you know dot and carry onejust like this only much worse and leah limped the length of the room mimicking an extraordinary gait so cleverly that lionel laughed openly though you shouldnt mock at peoples infirmities he coughed why not esbrooks a holy show and with the spite of the cripple he spares no ones feelings hes the cracked black pot snarling at the kettles he can never hope to be with his dot and carry one dot and carry one and back she came swinging and grunting with provoking cleverness in her gyrationsit seemed from her imitations that lord esbrook gyratedshe overturned the table upon which rested the covered book leah pounced to pick up the volume as did kaimes out of courtesy when he had set the table on its legs he could scarcely refrain from glancing casually at the book its exterior was familiar the bible exclaimed an amazed man leah flung herself into the chair laughing noisily oh what a face she mocked pointing a jeering finger look at yourself do wereyoureading the bible asked the vicar too astonished to note the poor attempt she made to force humour why not said she defiantly but with flushes and quick breaths you only mock the opportunity is so alluring was her reply theres such an awful lot of rot in that history of the jews and hundreds of impossibilities here she seized the bible and rapidly swept the pages what was i reading when you entered the thin leaves flew and flickered beneath her fingers oh yes something quite too absurd in matthew st matthew mister st matthew if you will there she presented the book you read so beautifullyreally you do without flattery i will not read for you to mock her face flashed into crude anger read she commanded harshly the vicar would have declined again but that his eye fell on the verses she had indicated a memory of their earlier conversation coupled with her unnecessary vehemence made him obey without further hesitation it might be that here was the key to the problem of her jerky speech his mellow voice rose like the music of a solemn bell and the glorious words rolled majestically through the room when he was come down from the mountain great multitudes followed him and behold there came a leper and worshipped him saying lord if thou wilt thou canst make me clean and jesus put forth his hand and touched him saying i will be thou clean and immediately his leprosy was cleansed and immediately his leprosy was cleansed breathed the duchess gripping the arms of her chair to lean forward why not her leprosy lionel laid down the sacred volume it was a man who came to ask mercy of our lord said he obtusely leah threw herself back in the chair with the pettish cry of a misunderstood child oh you fool something in her voice startled him yet he was far from gathering her meaning what is it he demanded entirely bewildered there was no light in her eyes now from luminous sapphires they had become pebbles dull orbs of lapislazuli when she spoke her voice creaked and wheezed if your master lived today i would go to palestine she said looking very directly at him what on earth for he asked blankly can you not understand her look was that of medusa and flickering lights came and went in her halflifeless eyes their glare rather than the toneless notes of her voice made him faintly understand the chosen passage out of st matthew taken in conjunction with her earlier chatter of miracles and her late reference to palestine engendered in his brain a horrible a terrible an impossible thought and yet what are you talking about he asked harshly the cry of a soul on fire broke on his ears you brute when i suffer so does it need words does what need words she dashed her hand on the open page of the bible thisthis augh he rose and sat down with cold hands and a white face the meaning of what she meant crashed like the blow of a bludgeon and his brain spun to the shock leah he heard himself say in a faraway voice like a telephone whisper then he stopped to stare at the quiet woman who sat upright with rigid features and tightly clasped hands leah he muttered again and some indefinable feeling made his hair crisp at the roots yes that was all she said and her lips hardly moved in the saying kaimes looked aimlessly round the room and noted the pattern of the windowcurtains only the whistling of the coals spouting smoke and jetting flame broke the stillness his eyes returned to her face fair and stainless imposssible he jerked his voice entirely beyond control im then his nerves vibrated and his skin crept three doctors in london five doctors abroad assured me that it is not impossibleunfortunately they were like two pale ghosts sitting in the shadows said one ghost to the other but have youare you a his tongue refused to form either terrible word leah unexpectedly flung up her arms with a scream then brought two shaking hands across her mouth to stifle that wild note of human pain right and left up and down did she look as though to be certain that no one was within earshot but the vicar it will never do to let the servants hear said the rapid action lionels benumbed brain could not yet take in wholly the appalling truthif truth it was the leper dropped her hands and looked at him heavily you lying devil said leah slowly what what what babbled kaimes incoherently she groaned and rocked with hands palm to palm between her knee i will be thou clean i will be thou clean over and over again did she moan the words till they bored into the listeners brain god have mercy murmured the man trying to be a man the creeping paralysis of the horror almost struck him dumb but he managed by a violent effort to wet his lips with a stiff tongue and made it form certain words are you sure of this three doctors went on the duchess rocking and droning as demetrius did aforetimethree doctors five doctors eight doctors in all they said the same thingughsuch a beastly thing it was the truth though doctors never lie like parsons and that book with its falsehoodsthat she lunged forward without rising and grabbing the bible pitched it into the fire lionel snatched it from the flames leah struck it from his hands and then ensued a silent struggle uncanny savage in which some leaves were torn all at once she relaxed her grip and lay back crying quietly its a shame a shame she wept softly just when everything was going on so well and it cant be cured all the money in the world cant cure me i must diein bits her voice soared shrilly and she crouched as though being beaten ugh that kiss that beastly kiss leah how did you get this disease the woman took no notice but sprang up as though moved by springs flinging wide her arms and looking upward in wild rebellion i wont diei wont i refuse to give ini refuse she tore up and down the room speaking in angry undertones as one always mindful of possible listeners i have always had my own way was her whispered argumentalwaysalways why cant i have it now there can be nothing up there no nothere cant be if he does exist he would not have let me go so long on my own i am strongi have never met any one stronger i must wini have always won i will win her voice rose tyrannically i am myself who can be stronger than myself and yet this thinga strong shudder shook her into weaknessthis vilevile ugh ugh i believe there must be something can you tell me youyou who assume to know the secrets of the stars she lurched forward in a frenzy of deadly fear cannoned against lionel and dragged him down into his chair clasping his knees and knocking her forehead against them where is your master she whimpered tell him im sorryreally i am sorry he may cure me then as he cured that man long ago gentle jesusthe children call him so he cant be cruel to meto me he cant be cruel to any one so they sayah they say they say but how do i know its not true it isnt true and yet if it wasif it lionel she broke off with the squall of a terrified child hiding her eyes pitifully ill be goodill be good if onlyonly he will do this its a little thingoh a very little thing and you said that he couldthat he your master i mean oh oh oh with sobbing breath she unwound her arms and fell back beating the carpet with open palms murmurings went rhythmically with the padding sound i want to be clean i want to be clean i want to be clean kaimes tried to lift her let me summon help with a bound she was on her feet pushing him back do that and i kill you she panted clenching her hands and facing him furiously no one knows but these doctorsyes and katinka and that fiend demetrius strange also if i had strange here she hammered with closed fists on the vicars shouldersi would cut him into bits i would blind him somehow i wouldi wouldoh what would i not do why couldnt he leave that infected beast to die in siberia oh thethethe she poured forth a torrent of words which made the listener grow hot and cold with shame then again she collapsed as the chill of a deadly fear struck at her heart i dont want to diei dont want to die and against the wall she rocked with arms held crosswise over her eyes swinging ever swinging the scene was like a nightmare but by this time lionel had the grip of his emotions leah he said firmly and advancing close to the writhing creature you must tell your husband you must out came her arms with a circular swing and struck him fair across the eyes jim doesnt know jim must never know he was almost blinded but persisted leah something must be done her voice sank and with it her rage something must be done said she faintlysomething shall be done andsoon what do you mean he asked half under his breath and half catching at her intention she took no notice sit down please said leah quietly and kaimes obeyed since to summon assistance would only be to precipitate a still more dreadful scene the duchess looked into the mirror and arranged her hair also she dabbed her eyes with a handkerchief and smoothed her wristcuffs when she did speak it was in the smooth voice of a society hostess asking a visitor if he took sugar in his tea i have made a fool of myself lionel but you must admit that i am rather severely tried just now oh you poor soul his tone and look were pitiful reserve your sympathy till you hear what i have to say but first tell me honestly can christ cure me yesif it is his will then let him you must have faith faith in what in his power and will to heal how can i believe when i do not believe he died for you on the cross he did not that was purely a political matter because the jews feared the romans i have read strauss i have read renan the four gospels also you cant puzzle me he was a good man a very good manquite a saint if you will butthe son of god she shook her head with a hard frown of disbelief lionel was at his wits end then you cannot be cured no she looked at him steadily an awful smile curving the corners of her mouth i thought you would fail me at the last but how can i you cant so theres no more to be said she sat down with a little sigh dear me how very hot this room is would you mind opening the window kaimes did not move leah go to bed and let me send for one of those doctors you consulted useless useless she waved him aside calmly they have spoken i know the worst i am prepared to face the worst are you hold your tongue she added peremptorily as he opened his mouth listen from beginning to end did she relate the whole fraudthe sham death the stolen money the betrayal and the punishment of the kiss her voice was perfectly calm her posture easy and her selfcontrol admirable the listener grew white and red became nervous and angry quivered with disgust recoiled with loathing as she unfolded the brutal tale of her sin and treachery leah spared him no detail however painful she even made herself out to be worse than she really wasif that were possible from the buying of demetrius by that butterfly kiss in the picturegallery to the revenge of demetrius in that stuffy cabin when she struggled in the arms of one who had been what she now was she related the whole without a blush without a tremor in a quiet level voice unmoved and utterly shameless the horror of her position seemed to remove her from the region of human emotions and morals it was the unveiling of original evil lionel did not interrupt but closed his eyes with a sick feeling as she drew to the end i first noticed that something was wrong when my hands burned as i washed them i thought nothing of it at the time but the feeling became so painful that i saw my doctor he saidwell you can guess what he said i consulted another and another the same diagnosis i went abroad but the doctors in germany and france told me the same thing i knew it was true i felt in my heart it was true ugh she paused there is no curenone none then she finished with a nervous titter pleasant for me isnt it dont gasped the vicar leaning his head on his hand and much too qualmish to speak oh you neednt look like that i have to suffer not you i kept wondering how i got the beastly thing and although i fancied it might be that kiss i could not be quite sure katinka enlightened meshe was always a goodnatured girl after the death of that little reptile she returned to england and watched me seeing that i went to doctorsshe must have watched very closelyand then abroad she wrote a lettersuch a nasty spiteful letter but i always thought katinka was a cat would you like to no no i have heard enough and you call yourself a manpooh you must hear i learned from the letter that demetrius contracted thethewell what he suffered from amongst the natives of kamchatka he intended first to show me up but when that horrid girl told him how she had hurt my mouth he knew that by a kiss he couldahrrr he was a doctor you see and the skin being broken it was easy for him knowing what he did to do what he wantedthe brute that was why he kissed so hard and stop stop it is beastly isnt it thats all i think she was examining her fingernails when next lionel stole a glance at her he scarcely knew what to say her treachery and the result of her treachery were both abominable that a beautiful woman gently born and bred should sin so vilely seemed incredible for beautiful she was sitting there calmly under the uplifted sword of azrael the angel of death and vile she confessed herself to be yet he could hardly accept either the physical degradation or the moral turpitude you may be mistaken after all he stammered vaguely because i am not an object she replied with a shrug how like a child you are to require proof i dont intend to become an object i can tell you but if there is no cure there is another way of course it is disagreeable but what is one to do in such straits the vicar guessed her meaning and violently threw off the weakness with which her story had infected his manhood i forbid you to heap crime upon crime said he firmly and insistently i shall do what i like do not dictate to me if you please but god i dont believe in god you do you must does not this shameful punishment which has overtaken you in the hour of triumph declare the anger of a great and terrible god no her expression was mulish woman woman kneel and ask for mercy i wont ask for mercy when im being treated so badly never never just when things were going so smoothly too the money coming in by the bushel and demetrius out of the way i call it a shame its mean spiteful cruel i intended to have such a jolly time and nownow her voice faltered and broke she swung with a groan to one side of the chair hiding her face and breathing heavily that deadly fear of the inevitable would grip her do what she would leahkaimes voice shook a triflegod is very good to you her eyes stared at him bleakly very good we are put into this world not for the pampering of the flesh but that we may learn through trouble how to become more spiritual our souls are of god and to god they must return rising through much tribulation to his necessary perfection sorrows are sent for the flesh to bear not as punishments but as lessons to be learned of our vices says st augustine we can frame a ladder to ascend heavenward if we but tread them beneath our feet this you have never known and i do not know it now from your dreadful trouble will come the knowledge in this way alone can humility come god out of loving pity for your unbending pride which prevents the holy spirit from entering your heart has beaten you to your knees on your knees then ask for mercy for light for purification of your unclean soul gods staff which he gives to all in lifes pilgrimage has changed into a rod he gave you all things and you used his gifts to glorify the flesh now in his infinite love has he sent trouble ive brought that upon myself for your amendment it was permitted that you should do so out of your pleasant vices have you made whips to lash yourself the wages of sin is death you have sinned and the wagesoh leah leah bitterly cruel as it may seem to you i rejoice that the wages should be so paid you are a jobs comforter i must say said the duchess sullenly because i can see how this tribulation of the flesh can save your soul alive god might have struck you dead in your wickedness and with justice for your wilful sin instead of doing so he has given you a lingering disease that you should be brought to acknowledge his power and also have time to repent there is nothing to repent of shame shame even from a worldly point of view you have sinned grossly how much blacker then are your deeds in gods sight but they can be made white the past can be wiped out by sincere sorrow leah twisted her hands above her head with a cry of impotent rage how can i repent when i do not even feel sorry you will not ask christ to help you repentance is a gift as is faith he will give both and his undying love if you will but confess your sin i have done soto you who am powerless confess it to christ weep as did mary at his wounded feet hard as is your heart he will melt it soiled as is your soul he will cleanse it nownow when human aid is vain now is the appointed time repent and be saved if i try to will hewill he cure met that question i cannot dare not answer his mercy is infinite you say that to me knowing what i suffer i say it to you who suffer in no other way could the spirit have brought you to the mercyseat he has not brought me now she persisted obstinately lionel fell on his knees and caught her restless hands oh your poor sinful soul for which christ died he cried passionately to whom can you go but to god doctors cannot cure you he can if it be his will he may even make your flesh clean ah and that question you declined to answer a minute or two back besides you denied that miracles could take place i did not no one ever came in vain to our blessed lord when he walked the earth some two thousand years ago as was his power then so is it now he loved in those days he loves now sitting on gods right hand he is ready to succour the vilest his arm is not shortened his pity is not exhausted in mercy he may even cure you of this dreadful disease as he cured the afflicted man we read of only acknowledge that god is mightier than you are only bow to the rod only admit your sin only cry for pardon if he will cure me she began wavering that you must leave to his love and wisdom cure you he may permit you to suffer he may see fit but save your soul he can that much i can swear to i want this horrible thing cured she cried passionately to continue in your sins to soil your soul anew no no if i repent repentance includes submission god may not see fit to cure you it may be your punishmentand i think it isto bear this woeful cross which if rightly borne may lead you to the light of lights the flesh the flesh you but think of the flesh of the passing world of the vanities of life of the enjoyment of the senses from these things god would lead you away to contemplate spiritual realities and the appointed path has been made known bear your crossoh my dear bear your cross and endure to the end that you may be saved terrible as it may seem this evil whence good will arise has removed you from temptation if you live secluded dying piecemeal she cried in a frenzy of anger and wrenched away her hands no no i will not live i will diedie at least i can do that as did judas leah if you cannot bear your punishment in the flesh how will you endure it in the spirit live for christ and what matters the world everything everything i know what i am i do not know what i may be herein this tangible worldwe are safesafe from god can you say that when his hand has struck you down i tell you poor sinner that thus does he show his mercy as is your crime so must be your punishment but christ can pardon your iniquities and christ will if you only plead for mercy and for grace leah rose crimson with rage youll drive me mad i dont want your spiritual life your next world of shadows and moonshine give me lifelifelife the cry of the flesh was so insistent so futile so blind in its desire that lionel shuddered still on his knees he began a fervent prayer the miserable woman walked rebelliously up and down the room fighting against the conviction now slowly being driven home to her understanding that he whom she had mocked and defied was indeed the most high god but she still fought against a submission she knew well would have to be made beg for mercy she would not her heart could not feel her intelligence could not grasp but somehow she knew a dreadful thing had reduced her to impotence and the ego could not battle against the something it had hitherto flouted but now furiously admitted might exist there remained but one thing to do but one dark way to take do it and take it she would but lionel more than suspected her intention lionel would thwart her and she would be compelled to livelive on an object of disgust and pity no no was her inward cry as the imploring voice of the vicar rose and fell and died away in a last tremulous amen for the last time therefore did she set her wits to plot for the ego lionel said she hesitatingly will you send for jim the vicars face lighted up he saw in this request what she meant him to see a sign of yielding you will let me tell him leah nodded there is a doctor in vienna she whispered inventing recklessly with the cunning of one driven to bay he has found out a cure i hear if jim will take me over ill telegraph to hengist castle at once cried kaimes making for the door impetuously and come back to dinner said she following i cant pass the evening alone i shall come but you wont frighten me any more with this religious talk lionel pressed her hand sadly i have done what i could leah only the holy spirit can bring home conviction to your heart try and pray yes assented the duchess submissively it is all that is left then the better part which cannot be taken away is left he went away quite deceived since she had suggested the viennese physician so calmly he thought that she still hoped desperately and for all he knew the hope might be fulfilled seeing the presentday resources of science certainly he never dreamed how she had hoodwinked him and so sped on his errand of mercy leaving behind him a woman too broken to exult in the success of her final piece of trickery it was all over man could do nothing god would do nothing as demetrius had been smitten for the crime she had induced him to commit so was she being punished for the evil she had called into being lionel had talked nonsense of course but he left behind him a feeling in her mind that the god he worshipped did exist how the belief had come into her heart she could not say but it was certainly there try as she might with all the strength of her brilliant intellect she knew that never again could she be an atheist god existed to her comprehension at last but the newlyconceived deity was not the father of love and light rather did he appear an omnipotent tyrant who had driven her to bad courses by giving her tastes she was unable to satisfy and who now punished her for acting as the nature he had given her dictated she was like a mouse in the claws of a cat and could no more escape than could the tormented little beast only to the height of acknowledging that something much stronger than herself existed could she rise and her submission was as that of caliban to prospero wrenched violently from the egotistic wrappings of her soul shethe true self the immortal spiritstood naked and shamed yet defiant she submitted because only submission was left but all her flesh shouted furiously against its victor then again as the tormented soul strove to overcome the lower material self did she recall lionels words god was love he declared and in love had god broken her shield of self snapped her sword of desire certainly now that this world could do nothing for her she would be forced to seek the other there she might learn how to rise from darkness into light that the spiritual existed she was now reluctantly convinced that a study of its meaning would bring her peace she could not be certain of course it was early days yet she had gained a great step by the admission that god reigned even though he had proved it to her so cruelly it might be that by endless striving she would learn something of his love before death ended her intolerable sufferings god ordered her to fly was it worth while to trust to him for wings the struggle of the soul wavering between hell and heaven might have ended in the victory of the latter and leah might have consented with bitter tears to bear the cross laid upon her shrinking shoulders but while wearily pacing the room a chance glance showed her in the mirror that beauty of which she had been and was so proud leaning her arms on the mantelpiece she examined every detail lovingly and long could she bear to see that gradually disappear could she accept life as a thing and not as a being those blue eyes would grow dull and animal that glorious hair would drop off that complexion of cream and roses wouldwould ugh ugh no no no the rebellious cry of the flesh ascended to the stars it must never benever all that she knew herself to be revolted against the slow wasting agony that would most surely come to reduce that splendour of her beautiful body to the dust dishonoured and shamed to save herself from such infamy it but needed an overdose of chloral then in the pride of her loveliness she would pass away painlessly without disfigurement triumphant in a minor degree at least with all the indomitable strength of a will that had been only thwarted by him who had created that will did she resolve to snatch this one poor laurelleaf from the almighty victor turning from the mirror she felt that her mind was steeled that self was not entirely defeated after all her unconquerable will would win tonight she whispered to her shivering soul when i go to bed an overdose of chloral and then when i awaken she stopped with the chills of death at her heart oh was her despairing admission you are the stronger it was the cry of the flesh making sullen submission in vain did the soul piteously beg that its tabernacle might yet hold it a little while for the purging of its sin the flesh would not hear beaten conquered shamed tormented its petty triumph could yet be obtained in this hour of defeat and the terrified soul sobbing unheeded waited for the rapidly approaching hour which would send it forth disembodiedwhither chapter xxxv we regret to announce to our readers the unexpected demise of the duchess of pentland at firmingham essex according to the rev lionel kaimes who dined with her grace on the evening of her death she was in the very best of health and spirits the unfortunate lady retired at a comparatively early hour and was found dead in the morning by her maid a brief examination proved that death was due to an overdose of chloral which her grace was in the habit of taking when suffering from sleeplessness the duke of pentland who was expected at firmingham arrived shortly after the painful discovery to be greeted by the disastrous intelligence the loss of this highly popular lady will be greatly felt in high circles her beauty and wit were exceptional and only to be surpassed by her truly kind heart it may be well said that she lived to make others happy to the unfortunate her purse was always open and to the afflicted her soothing presence was a welcome relief again and again did she sacrifice herself in the cause of charity and in many ways unknown to the public did she do good by stealth her graceful presence will be much missed at various great functions during the coming winter season but it is the poor and needy who will most keenly feel the loss of one whose large heart was ever ready to aid them in trouble much commiseration is expressed for the duke of pentland who was most tenderly attached to his beautiful consort a brilliant star has disappeared from the social firmament but what is more lamentable a noble religious charitable lady has gone leaving a place which can never be filled the funeral which will take place at firmingham next tuesday will doubtless be largely attended by those who loved her and knew her worth the world can ill spare such a one who illustrated in her conduct and qualities the highest attributes of womanhood she was a great lady a true tender woman a sincere friend and a model wife what words could better befit her untimely grave than that eulogy on dorcas set forth in the acts this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did finis
