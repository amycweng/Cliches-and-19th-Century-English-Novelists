believes that he is saying something undeniably smart good lord i retorted twisting the motor car round a corner since when has the british subaltern given up his leisure to reading beaconsfields novels cannington serenely puffed his cigarette into a brighter glow i dont know what youre talking about old chap said he indifferently i talk of ixion in heaven orif you prefer itof coningsby beaconsfield was so enamoured of his apothegm that he inserted it in both tales i dont know what youre talking about said cannington again and his puzzled look proved that he spoke the truth a chap called marr wrote that in my sisters album and told her it was his own i daresay more ideas are stolen than pockethandkerchiefs according to balzac and after all beaconsfield may have cribbed the saying oh i see what you are driving at marr copied it out of a book undoubtedly unless he lived before coningsby and ixion were writtensomewhere about the beginning of the nineteenth century oh marr isnt so old as that protested the boy chuckling although he isnt a spring chicken by any means what mabel sees in him i cant for the life of me imagine humph you were never renowned for imagination cannington i said kindly and in your particular case it doesnt much matter youre the man behind the gun and all you have to do is to fire against the seen enemy huh why half the firing is against the unseen enemy if i havent got your rotten imagination vance ive got commonsense and thats what you jolly well need rash youth to speak thus to the man at the wheel dont you know that with a little dexterity i could shoot you into yonder ditch youd travel with me he sniggered why not it would be an excellent advertisement for a popular playwright playwright be hanged you only write beastly melodramas precisely that is why i am popular and if im not a playwright what am i a carpenter you collar other peoples ideas like your friend marr i interpolated and knock them into weird shapes for secondrate theatres not at all i rejoined tartly for the criticism piqued me i scour the country in search of flesh and blood tragedies and improve them into moral lessons for the british public but youre talking all round the shop my lad who is this marr of whom your sister approves and why does he write down other peoples ideas in her album wentworth marr cannington lighted another cigarette and explained hes a wellpreserved old buck ofi should sayfifty and looks forty unmarried with heaps of tin and no family mabel likes him and he likes lady mabel or loves her which is it wellcannington drawled this out reluctantlyhes in love with her sure enough and of course mabel is as poor as i am and marr having no end of shekels you see what about dick weston i broke in abruptly oh hes too much taken up with his inventions to bother about love poor mab feels it sighed cannington so she flirts with marr to keep her hand in i suppose shell burn her fingers tell me all about it boy if it will relieve your mind i have told you all mabel wants to marry dick weston and i think he wants to marry her only hes too much taken up with his airship to trouble about proposing wentworth marr is wealthy and a gentleman and all that and wants to make mabel his wife she likes him but she doesnt love him still theres the money you see vance weston is also rich i suggested well i know that snapped cannington testily but hes an absentminded beggar who lives in the clouds along with his bally airship and wont come up to the scratch i say he broke off dont secure a paragraph for your confounded transpontine plays by running over that child little beast the child in question was playing whos across first and i had considerable difficulty in dodging him however i just managed to avoid a coroners inquest and swung the machine along the straight roman road while the escaped infant shouted insultingly behind cannington giggled but i was too much taken up with steering the rippler through a somewhat crowded village street to tell him that he was several kinds of ass i had known the boy since he was a forward brat at eton and we were intimate friends as can be judged from the way in which he confided in me at the present moment i was conveying him from gattlingsands to murchester as he had been stopping at the former place for some days and now sought his own mess previously i had motored from london to remain the night at tarhaven which is four miles from gattlingsands and thus was enabled to save cannington a train fare considering that he and lady mabel watton had about sixpence between them he was duly grateful although pointedly saucy i was always sorry for canningtons poverty as he was a thoroughly healthyminded sporting boy who keenly enjoyed such good things of this life as he could lay hands on a pauper commoner is an object to be met with everywhere but a pauper lord is a more unusual spectacle certainly the boy was not yet knocking at the workhouse door but for his position he was assuredly desperately hardup and thinking of these things i made a remark when clear of the village you must marry a dollar heiress cannington o lord what rot whod marry a pauper with a tumbledown family mansion next to nothing a year and several hundred waste acres you have forgotten one asset i said dryly your title huh who cares for that in these democratic days heaps of rich spinsters american colonial and otherwise besides youre not altogether as ugly as sin though you might be betterlooking thanks awfully but would you mind being less personal i kicked his ankles if i am to advise you i must quote your looks your title your qualities and all the rest of it youve got precious little money and as a gunner subaltern it will be ages before you get promotion why not use what advantages you have and exchange them for an income a rich wife not much interrupted the boy with a flush i fancy i see myself living on a woman besides im having a jolly time now and see no reason to tie myself up when i do it will be a girl i can love no end didnt know you had got that far well i havent but one never knows i agree at four and twenty one never knows oh stop your rotting vance said he crossly i havent been through the shop and out in the cold world for nothing one would think i was an idiot which i certainly am not dont you bother your silly head about me its mab im thinking about she wants money as i do but i should hate to see her marry a fellow old enough to be her grandfather just because hes rich i wish youd see her and drop a hint he ended hesitatingly my dear cannington i know you better than i do your sister she might resent my hints if you really dont want her to marry this man marri never heard of him for my partshake dick weston into a proposal and he can take his wife in his new airship for the honeymoon it would end in a funeral grinned cannington cheerfully dickys always having smashes i dont want him to experiment with mabel you know old chap hi heres murchester and yonders a policeman slow down vance you cant romp up the high street at thirty miles an hour i dont see why not i retorted obeying orders for the policeman really looked a suspicious character there were crawling along like a condemned snail if thats what you want i want my tea said cannington irrelevantly dont you no ill drop you at the barracks and travel on to clankton there i put up for the night and go up norfolk way tomorrow whats your objective i havent got one that is i am simply looking round to see if i can poach on real life for a melodramatic plot adventures to the adventurous cannington nodded i thought old marr wasnt clever enough to have made that up out of his own blessed head but i say how do you expect to find your plot in a motor car the latterday vehicle of romance my boy formerly your knight rode a horse and went into the unknown in search of the unexpected now hethats me you knowtakes out his machine and looks for the expected in the known you understand no confound you what do you hope to run across an adventure what sort of one how the charles dickens can i tell yet you said that the known cannington you wish me to spoil my epigrams by explanation i decline to satisfy your morbid curiosity all i know is that the fountains of my imagination are dried up and that i cant write a play which ought to be written if i am to earn enough to keep this car in petrol i am thereforelike balzacchasing my genius and who knows upon what glorious adventure i may stumble cannington laughed scornfully all the adventure youll drop across will be in running over some old woman or in exceeding the speedlimit i care not was my reckless reply i am prepared for anything dont be an ass urged the boy politely as we spun through the barrack gates stop here for the night and ill put you up then we can go to london tomorrow and have a ripping time what its good of you cannington and if i hadnt an income to earn i should accept with pleasure as things arei stopped the car before the mess dooryou can get down and send out a man to carry in your portmanteau have a cup of tea anyhow said cannington slipping to the ground i looked at my watch no thanks its nearing six and i have some distance to go dont delay me boy oh very well confound you wait till i get my baggage and then you can buzz off when am i to see you again the fates will arrange that ill turn up sooner or later if you arent smashed up or locked up meanwhile said the boy swinging his portmanteau off the back of the car ill keep an eye on the police news for the next few days i daresay ill have to bail you out well he gave my hand a grip thanks awfully old son for bringing me over only too pleased i muttered beginning to move away goodbye i had been to murchester before and knew the locality moderately well therefore after leaving cannington i spun through the barrack grounds and emerged on to a somewhat suburban road which led towards the outskirts of the town a dampish august twilight filled the air with rapidly darkening shadows and a marked chill in the warmth hinted at the coming night the sun had already withdrawn behind a bank of western clouds before vanishing over the verge of the world i drove the machine at half speed as there were many country carts about and ran down a lengthy sloping hill towards a distant glimpse of green clankton which is a fishing village rapidly rising into notoriety as a seaside resort was over thirty miles away so if i wished to be seated at my dinner by seven oclock it behooved me to use all the power of which the rippler was capable hunger forced me to increase the pace motoring was the one form of amusement which i truly enjoyed and which a somewhat limited income earned by hard brainwork enabled me to indulge in but the indulgence precluded my partaking in many other pleasures of this luxurious age for the rippler had cost much to buy and cost a considerable sum monthly to keep going but motoring is less expensive than horseracing and doctors bills and the fresh air after enforced sedentary deskwork swept away possible illness as a moderately popular playwright i made a tolerably good income although less than i was credited with earning still by devoting myself to two machines a motor and a typewriter one for play and the other for work i managed to keep out of debt and keep my rippler at the same time but because the machine was a smart one and because i was constantly on the move between whiles of manufacturing melodramas people declared that i was a literary millionaire as though any writer ever became a croesus i must say that i had greater ambitions than to write cheap sensational plays and that i did write them at all was dueas it would seemto mere chance after i left oxford my parents died andowing to their extravaganceseverything was sold i came to london with an income of fifty pounds a year i could not exactly starve on one pound a week but i had a sufficiently bad time and tried to supplement my income by writing for the papers an old actor boarding at a house wherein i had taken up my abode suggested that i should attempt a melodrama i did so with his assistance and between us we managed to get it staged at a small theatre in the east end to my surprise the play was a great success being sufficiently lurid to capture the tastes of the somewhat rough audience since that time i had been committed to this particular form of entertainment and try as i might i could not escape from the memory of my first hit but i did not surrender my earlier ambitions as i have before stated i worked hard at the cheap sensational plays which were produced at secondclass theatres and saved all the money i could in the hope of gathering together sufficient principal to give me an assured income of five hundred a year when independent i determined to devote myself to writing really good playshighclass comedies and poetic dramas for choicebut meanwhile served my apprenticeship to the writing craft under the eye of the public on the whole i had very little to complain about and my portion of the viands at lifes banquet was moderately tempting if not superlatively delicate i do not think there is anything more to explain about myself save that i was not handsome that i had never been in love and that i occupied a tiny flat in west kensington where the rents are moderate as a rule i wrote furiously every day until a play was completed then attended to the rehearsing and saw the production afterwards i took to my motor and scoured the country partly to get fresh air and partly because i had a chance of stumbling across incidents in real life which afforded me material for plots situations scenes and characters at the present moment i was in search of the new and the real intending to weave actual facts into the sort of melodrama for which cyrus vance was famous or shall we say notorious as the pennydreadful success i had won could scarcely be dignified by an adjective applicable only to the career of napoleon or csar but i little thought when leaving murchester that i was also leaving the long lane of petty success down which i had plodded so soberly and that the new road opening out before me was one which led tobut i really cannot say just now what it led to and in this last sentence you will see the cunning of the storyteller who desires to keep the solution of his mystery until the last chapter but i am a playwright and not a novelisttwo very different beings destiny is writing this tale and i am simply the amanuensis therefore you will see how infinitely more ingenious is the goddess than the mere mortal in constructing an intricate scheme of life and in dealing with the puppets entangled therein so in this lifestory which starts in the middle as it were and travels both ways to beginning and end blame destiny for whatever does not please i merely recount what happenedsimply describe the various scenic backgrounds and rough out the characters but destiny weaves the happenings brings about the unexpected and solves the mystery which is of her ingenious contrivance and throughout i am only the clay which she the potter moulds at her will in a motor car it is much easier to go wrong on the outskirts of a town than amidst any other surroundings that i know of when in the open one can rise in the car and see ones way but bewildered by streets and houses and traffic and wary policemen and misled by those who do not know their own locality overwell one finds a town somewhat perplexing making for the west you get twisted round and emerge into open country towards the east a single wrong road in the suburbs will lead the complete motorist astray and will introduce him to a new country of whose geography he is entirely ignorant therefore some miles beyond perplexing murchester i became aware by questioning an intelligent rustic that i was going away from clankton after some swearing and a close examination of the map i lighted the lamps and turned on my tracks having gone so far out of my way i had unnecessarily used up a lot of power and then the inevitable happenedi discovered to my dismay that i was short of petrol in the tank i had no further supply worse luck and unless i could obtain some i began to see that i should have to camp in the fields or at all events in the nearest village but thanks to motoring petrol is fairly plentiful in unexpected places if i could discover some village i made sure of chancing upon a shop wherein to purchase petrol and therefore was hopeful but as i drove the machine slowly onfor the motive power was dwindling rapidlyi found that the necessary village was conspicuous by its absence i crawled up narrow lanes the twists and turns of which necessitated careful steering i dropped down the inclines of wide roads i skirted stagnant ponds weedy under dank boughs and worked my slow way past mouldering brick walls which shut in lordly parks it grew darker every minute and was long after six oclock so i soon became unpleasantly aware that i needed food as much as the rippler needed petrol i seemed to be in for some kind of adventure and as i had come out to look for one in the interests of the british public i had no reason to be dissatisfied but i sincerely trusted that it would be a romantic one out of which i could weave a sufficiently good plot to recompense me for the damnable circumstances in which i found myself the rippler feeling hungry as i did groaned complainingly up a gentle ascent topped the rise and stopped dead after proceeding a few yards and now mark the cunning of destiny if she had not brought me to my goal she had at least led me to a place where i could obtain motive power for in front of me i beheld a tiny oldfashioned house of weatherboard walls shaded by a mellow redtiled roof it stood directly on the road and was backed by a circle of high treeselms i fancy they were a quaint odd drearylooking cottage which had been awkwardly converted into a shop taking one of the lamps i flashed the light on to a narrow door which stood open on to a small window to the left of the door and on to a righthanded wider one behind the glass of which were displayed the various goods which one usually finds in these village stores but the sight amazed me especially when i saw the name of anne caldershaw inscribed on a broad board over the window for i could espy no village why did anne caldershaw set up her stall here where there was no one to buy and why was her shop not lighted up seeing that the door was open for any chance customer i could not answer these questions and became aware that here was the start of a promising adventure i felt like alice in wonderland for such a shop in such a lonely woody locality was just such a thing as alice would have chanced upon however i had no time to bother over the romance of things for i wanted petrol and luckily saw a red board on which it was announced in black lettering that petrol was for sale stepping into the dark shop with my brilliant lamp i rapped on the mean little counter no one came although i called out as loudly as i could there was still an eerie silence so i walked towards a small door set in the inside wall and knocked as there was still no answer i tried to open the door and found that it was locked a flight of steps narrow and rude ran up the side of the wall to some upstairs rooms and i sang up the stairs as this final shout produced no better result than the others i made up my mind to waste no further time but to fill my tank with petrol and leave the money on the counter but even as i searched for the liquid i kept marvelling at the strange silence of anne caldershaws shop there was not only no one to buy but there was not even anyone to sell the circumstances were odd in the extreme and i scented the unexpected in the damp air my part of the adventureas it seemedwas to fill my tank and get the rippler ready to start whether destiny who was arranging details would permit her to get under way or me to reach clankton in time for dinner was quite another matter however i was actor and not author so i fulfilled my partmy appointed part i presumedby searching for the petrol i soon discovered the orthodox red case and having unscrewed it with some difficulty i walked back to the car which stood some little distance away directly in front of anne caldershaws shop it took me some minutes to fill up but during that time i did not hear a single sound and yet as i conjectured while replacing the cap of the tank there must be some house or houses about since the shop argued customers perhaps when i turned the cornerfor the shop stood just on the angle of the roadi would find a collection of cottages not likely to be so deserted as anne caldershaws emporium shortly the tank was filled and after seeing that all was ready to start i took the empty can back to the dark house and placed the necessary money on the counter i would have shouted again but that it seemed useless as apparently no one was about for my former cries would have awakened the dead for one or two minutes i stood in the darkness listening for some sound in the house and stared through the open door at the streams of light from the acetylene lamps of the rippler there was something very weird about the situation suddenly i heard a soft faint moan which seemed to come from behind the locked door at the back of the shop on the impulse of the moment and with rather a grueas the scotch call it for the sound was sinister and unexpectedi sprang forward and gripped the handle of the door to my surprise the moment i twisted it the door opened at once and yet i swear that it was locked when i had last tried it i looked into a dark room and could see faintly to the right a barred window which showed against the fast darkening evening sky no further moan could i hear although i listened with all my ears wondering if i had been mistaken and yet uneasy about the now unlocked door i stepped into the back room holding on to the inside handle as it afterwards turned out the floor of the room was lower than that of the shop and reached by three shallow steps i therefore stumbled and pulling the door after me with some violence so that it clicked to i fell sprawling and bruised my elbow somewhat painfully still i heard no sound but seated on the floor to collect my sensessomewhat dazed by the unexpected falli put out my hand to explore the darkness it fell on soft flesh warm to the touch and on rough tangled hair thoroughly startled and with every excuse i withdrew my hand and fumbled in my pockets for a match regretting that i had not brought one of the lamps i had half a mind to go out and fetch it but my curiosity was so great andto be plainmy nerves were so unstrung that i struck the lucifer anxious to know the best or the worst at once as the pale tiny light grew stronger i beheld the form of a woman lying on the stone floor face uppermost and that facei shuddered as i looked for it was distorted into an expression of pain with a twisted mouth and glassy expressionless eyes framed in loose masses of irongrey hair it glimmered milky white and bore the stamp of death on every feature the woman was dead and judging from the moan i had heard and the still warm flesh she had just died while i stared the matchlight went out and i fancied that i heard a faint click i lighted another match hastily looking towards the door leading to the shop it was still closed and i turned again to gaze at the dead woman who was old illfavoured and eminently plebeian at that moment i heard the buzz of the rippler at once in astonishment and alarm i sprang towards the door it was locked and i was a prisoner while i was still trying to grasp this astounding fact the drone of my motor car died away in the distance chapter ii the beginning of a mystery here indeed was an adventure less romantic than tragical i was locked up in the back room of a village shop in company with the corpse of a dead woman and some thief had gone off with my motor car undoubtedly the person who had stolen the rippler was the one who had locked the door indeed it would seem that the person had laid a trap for in the first instance the door had been locked in the second it had been open and in the third it had been locked again but the individual who had gone off with the caras presumably was the casehad not lured me into the trap since the moan of the now dead woman had led me on to exploring the back premises but the unknown might have counted upon that if such was the case why thenhere in the darkness fumbling for the handle of the locked door a terrible thought flashed into my mind a vague elusive thought which i could not put into words with a sudden terror knocking at my heart i shook the door and cried for help hi whats that asked a rough uncultured voice in the shop whats wrong wi ye mrs caldershaw open the door i shook the flimsy boards again open the door there was a grunt of astonishment and i heard the key turn in the lock a moment later and the door opened when at once i flung out past a burly man who was blocking the way he gripped me before i could pass him and i heard hard breathing in the darkness not so fast said the man harshly what are you doing here in mrs caldershaws shop and dont stop me dont confound you i interrupted and wrenching myself away i ran to the door of the shop crying out explanations someones gone off with my motor car theres a dead woman in there and this time it was the man who interrupted and with something more than words as i dashed into the deserted road looking up and down in the darkness for my rippler my liberator plunged after me and gripped me again before i could say a word or make a movement he had borne me to the ground by sheer strength of muscle and holding me down hard and fast bellowed at the pitch of his voice an ominous word murder murder murder shouted the man with surprising volume of tone again the fear knocked at my heart for now the elusive thought had been put into concrete form by this yokel as i took him to be from his roughness and accent anne caldershawi believed the body to be hershad been murdered by the assassin who had escaped with my motor car hei naturally thought of the assassin as a hehad waited until i was bending over the corpse of his victim and then locking me in had made use of the rippler by this time he would be beyond any chance of recapture and here was i placed unexpectedly in a compromising situation with the chanceand upon very good circumstantial evidenceof being accused of the crime and yet as even then i thought confusedly there was nothing to show that the woman had really been murdered as i had seen neither wound nor blood let me up i gasped striving to throw off the dead weight of the big man but he only continued to roar for help gripping my arms and pressing his knee into my chest had not the villagers arrived i verily believe that there would have been a second if unconscious murder so brutally did the fellow bear on my prone body but i heard distant cries and shortly there came the flash of lanterns borne by men and women running round the corner of the road as by magic i was surrounded by an alarmed crowd all asking questions at once and turning their many lights on to my face my captor gave a breathless explanation murder murder he shouted still dwelling on a top note i found the devil locked in the back room without a light and the shop he pointed across the way is without a light also he comes out yelling that there was a dead woman left behind its mrs caldershaw for sure and hes done for her murder murder wheres the police almost before he finished his explanation which was not quite a full one since he gave no account of my motor car being stolen the men and women were running into the shop my captor jerked me roughly to my feet on which i could scarcely stand so roughly had he handled me and so sore were my bones come along he shouted much excited and dragged me across the road and into the shop look on her as youve done for dont be a fool i protested im a gentleman but a murderer none the less he retorted and pushed me furiously down the three steps into the back room which was now filled with men and women some of the latter were on their knees examining the body which i now saw to be that of an elderly person plainly clothed in a marooncoloured wincey dress with a belt round her waist whence dangled a bunch of keys and a cheap lace collar fastened with a gaudy cairngorm brooch what with the disconcerting way in which my captor handled meit seemed vain to resistand the restless light of the lanterns i could not see much more one of the men looked up why did you cry out murder giles he asked the roughlooking man who held me there isnt a wound on her body its a fit i believe the man giles loosened me if ive been mistaken he began when a cry from a little woman cut his speech short her eyes out her eyes outthe left one look look and she seized a bystanders arm in terror sure enough the left eye was missing and i wondered why i had not noticed that such was the case when i examined the body by the light of the lucifermatch i remembered distinctly the glassy expressionless eyes and yet now there was only one as i now saw plainly enough doubtless in the flickering light of the match and in my agitation i had omitted to see that there was but one eye even at so critical a moment i began to wonder how i could have overlooked so obvious a fact and then recalled the story a friend had told me of a man he had met with in the states and to whom he spoke for five minutes thinking there was something odd about his appearance before he saw that both ears were missing so easily as i considered even when placid can we fail to notice what is plainly apparent much less when unnerved as i was when examining that dead face in the matchlight it was an odd thought at the time considering that i stood in such peril had this cottage been in america i daresay i should have been lynched by the rough crowd of villagers around me its not murder maybe growled giles seizing me again but this devil has torn her eye out so theres no blood said another man wisely if the eye had been torn out it was a glass eye breathed a stout dark woman with a heavy face anne told me as much when we had tea together she didnt like it to be known poor soul being proud like and took great pains to get the best eye she could but its gone sure enough she peered into the dead face and then at me perhaps this gentleman will tell us why he took it by this time since apparently anne caldershaw had not been murdered and the eye was merely glass the current of popular feeling was running more in my favour i might be a thief with the eye in my pocket but i was not a murderer so the villagers gave me time for explanation i quite understand that things look black against me i said hastily but i know nothing about the matter i arrived in front of this shop in my motor car and stopped to get petrol after i filled up and left the moneyyou will find it on the counter if you looki heard a moan and stepped into this room to see what was wrong while looking at the body after lighting a match someone locked me in and ran off with my motor car the villagers looked at one another and apparently thought that my explanation was a lame one but giles who had treated me so roughly grudgingly admitted that he had seen the motor car i came round the corner to get a pound of bacon for supper said giles reflectively and i saw the engineso he phrased itbefore the door a lady was stepping in a lady i interrupted are you certain yessir he said giving me the polite address doubtfully i saw her plain enough in the light of them bright lamps she had a long white sort of gown on and a cap with a veil flying behind on her head i just caught a glimpse of her when she went off as hard as she could in what direction murchester way if you want a good big town to go by said giles then send for the police and tell them to telegraph to murchester to stop the car its a rippler no z and belongs to me the woman has stolen it i tell you where are the police theres no policeman until we get one from arkleigh and the telegraph office is there also now you sir must wait until the police come of course i assented readily i quite understand that you look upon me as a doubtful character lock up this house until the police arrive and take me to your inn if you have one i want something to eat and drink but the eye said the heavy dark woman give back the eye i havent got the eye i snapped for with hunger and thirst and excitement and the unpleasantness of being unjustly suspected i was not in the best of tempers you can search me if you like the dark woman would have done so readily being evidently of a meddlesome nature but giles interposed let the gentleman alone mrs faith he said gruffly i caught him and ill keep him till warshaw comes i daresay its a mistake on my part and im sorry if oh i dont blame you mr giles i interposed easily and lighted a cigarette to show my nonchalance i should have acted in the same way myself so come along and take me to gaol a relieved smile made the mans rugged face quite pleasant to look at as my exculpation of himself and my ready offer to be searched evidently reassured him greatly in his eyes at all events i was not the desperate criminal he had taken me to be but his fellowvillagers still looked dubious mrs caldershaw had heaps of money hidden away ventured one little rat of a man with a squeaky voice search my pockets then i said again with open impatience all i have told you is correct my name is cyrus vance and if you send to the artillery barracks at murchester my friend lord cannington will have no difficulty in identifying me as i thought it would the title acted like a charm and the tension somewhat slackened giles who appeared to be the most sensible of the lot beckoned me into the dark shop leaving his friends to guard the house and look after the corpse of the unfortunate woman i walked beside him round the corner and sure enoughas i expectedcame upon the twinkling lights of quite a dozen houses the late mrs caldershaw had customers after all it would seem whats the name of this place i asked abruptly mootley replied giles now less suspicious and more human it aint a very large village but weve more cottages than these here scattered along the road up yonder and he jerked his thumb to the left where a lane ran from the highroad towards a woodland its too dark to see anything i said idly but tomorrow you can show me round i daresay i shall have to pass the night at your house mr giles unless you think that i may rise in the night to kill you by the way i added with a bantering air you dont hold my arm arent you afraid ill bolt no sir said the man now perfectly polite i see that i have made a mistake i know your name if youre the mr vance who writes plays i am but that is odd knowledge for a villager in these outoftheway parts to possess oh i havent lived at mootley all my life sir although i was born here forty years ago i went to london and stopped in southwark for years id a greengrocers shop there and did fairly well but london didnt suit my wifes health sir so i sold up some time back and bought a cottage and an acre of land here with my savings i know your name sir because ive seen one or two plays of yours at the elephant and castle theatre and very good plays they were sir too humph it seems to me mr giles that i am now the wrongly suspected hero of a much more mysterious and lurid melodrama than any i have written it is strange admitted giles with a side glance i saw the glance by the light which gleamed from a cottage window my murdering mrs caldershaw i inquired coolly we dont know yet that she has been murdered he replied quickly then my stealing that glass eye of hers no sir but your being locked up in the dark with the corpse she wasnt a corpse when i entered mr giles her moans attracted me into the room while i was seeing by matchlight what was the matter someone locked the door and bolted with my motor the lady i saw sir no doubt since i did not bring a lady with me i wonder if she got the eye muttered giles half to himself she must have got something that wasnt hers else she would not have made use of my car to escape then she must have taken the eye giles muttered again what the deuce are you talking about why should she steal a glass eye thats what id like to know sir its an odd thing to steal and i never knew that mrs caldershaws left eye was a glass one though she told mrs faith about it well its gone and the lady who stole my motor car took it at least it seems so but i tell you what mr giles im too hungry to discuss the matter just now the whole business is a mystery to me and destiny has dragged me into it in a most unpleasant way giles nodded its easy seen youre innocent sir he said with an air of relief you wouldnt talk so if you werent i dont know so much about that guilt can wear a mask of brazen innocence if necessary how do you know i havent murdered mrs caldershaw and at this moment may not have the celebrated glass eye in my trouser pocket we dont know yet that shes been murdered mr vance there was no wound pooh she might have been poisoned why do you think so sir asked giles quickly because i write melodramas and always look on the most dramatic side oh this is your cottage is it quite a stage cottage with plenty of greenery about the porch giles did not know what to make of my chatter youre a funny gent sir a hungry one at all events my friend is this your wife how are you mrs giles i am your husbands prisoner and for the time being your cottage is a gaol mrs caldershaws dead and ive stolen her glass eye mrs caldershaw dead gasped mrs giles a rosyfaced little woman who turned pale at the sudden announcement what does the gentleman mean sam sit down sir said giles pushing forward a chair then turned towards his astonished and somewhat terrified wife to explain in a few minutes mrs giles was in full possession of the facts which had led me to her abode she listened in silence her face now quite white and drawn what does it all mean sam she asked under her breath thats what weve got to find out sarah warshaw has been sent for from arkleigh and when he comes well see what is to be done warshaw and caldershaw i murmured rather similar names i hope your policeman friend will wire to murchester about my car theres no telegraph office hereabout sir i expect hell send in a messenger to murchester for the inspector and for your friend sir lord cannington oh yes he can identify me as cyrus vance what said mrs giles who was recovering her colour the gentleman who wrote them lovely plays the same i assented and the gentlemans very hungry you shall have supper in a few minutes cried mrs giles much impressed with the angel she had hitherto entertained unawares sam did you bring back that bacon nor i didnt my dear cos there wasnt anyone to sell the bacon mrs caldershaw being dead ugh shuddered the little woman ill never be able to eat another thing out of that shop a murder we dont know that its a murder interposed her husband hastily i laughed you shouted murder lustily enough when you had me down giles the man looked sheepish i made a mistake and thought you was a robber until i saw you were a gent well a gent can be a robber you know many gents are they steal something more valuable than glass eyes sir i rather liked giles who was a burly heavyfaced animal man with as i said before a most engaging smile his jaw was of the bulldog order but his eyes were extremely intelligent so i judged that his native wits had been considerably sharpened by his sojourn in the borough of southwark such a man could easily master the less travelled villagers and i found that such was the case giles acted as a kind of headman of mootley and his opinion carried great weight in the village councils it was just as well that i had fallen into the hands of such a man otherwise unable to see that i was innocent of assault and robbery i should have been less hospitably treated as it was i found myself extremely comfortable mrs giles bustled about in a cheery way although the news of mrs caldershaws death seemed to have somewhat scared her while getting the supper and laying the cloth and attending to the kettle she would frequently pause to consider her husbands story i rather think she expected it said mrs giles putting a pot of jam on the table expected what sarah asked her husband guessing what she alluded to death sam death she told me once that she was sure she would not die in her bed then you think that she has been murdered i questioned yes i do think so sir else why should she speak in that way and in church she always said that part of the litany about being saved from battle murder and sudden death louder than any there was no blood and no wound muttered giles turning this speech over in his mind frampton said he thought it was a fit but come and draw your chair in sir were humble folk but what we have is at your service youre very kind folk i said obeying the invitation frampton and mrs faith would have tied me up and starved me ignorant people sir who dont know any better bread sir jam sir yes sir he was really most polite for a greengrocer and i grew to like him more and more as i did his busy brightfaced little wife the supper was homely but very nourishing and i drank tea and devoured bread and jam until my hunger was quite satisfied during the meal the husband and wife told me that mrs caldershaw had kept the corner shopso they called itfor the last five years and had never been popular amongst her neighbours it was believed that she had miserly tendencies and had much money tucked away in a stocking her age was sixty but she was an active woman for her years and lived entirely alone it seemed that she had been born in mootley but had been absent for many years out at serviceso she said although she spoke very little about her past with her savingsagain this was the story of mrs caldershawshe had returned to die in her native village and for the sake of something to do had opened the corner shop did she have many callers i asked mentally noting details she never said so remarked mrs giles who being somewhat of a gossip took the lead in the conversation she was a close one she was and the shop being round the corner sir wei presume she meant herself and the other gossipscould never see who came or went she lived quite outside our lives sir owing to the position of the shop and her own way of keeping to herself once she did say shed never die in her bed and thats what makes me think as she may have been done away with but i never knew sam that shed a glass eye i didnt know either said sam who was devouring huge slices of bread and butter she told mrs faith though ive seen her heaps of times but i never spotted that one eye was living and the other dead and why it should have been stolen by that lady who went off with your motor mr vance sends me fair silly what was the lady like sam i cant exactly tell you sarah as it was growing so dark she was tall with a long white cloak a cap and a veil thats all i know hullo he started from his seat as the sound of excited voices was heard a moment later and the cottage door was violently flung open to admit the stout darkfaced woman whom giles had addressed as mrs faith she was half leading half supporting another woman small and wizen and weaklooking behind came a disorderly crowd of women and men evidently mootley unused to sensational happenings was making the most of this one its a lady as come in a cart sir began mrs faith excitedly when frampton looking over her shoulder interrupted a trap sir a trap driven by another woman o dear me moaned the little creature who had now been deposited in a capacious chair where am i now with friends dear with friends said mrs giles stroking her hands sam get the whisky its in the cupboard near the fire and all you people clear out shell never get well if you stop here upsetting her ill see to it cried mrs faith and forthwith in a most masterful way bundled the crowd outofdoors they would not have gone so easily had not the magnet of the shop containing the corpse drawn them but go they did and mrs faith closed the door warshaw has arrived she explained dramatically and is examining all the place hell be along here soon sir to take you in charge this lady she waved her large hands towards the little halfunconscious woman came along in a cart with another one driving another lady i asked curiously another woman snorted mrs faith contemptuously and only one horse the cart had for cart it was though frampton called it a trap but she came along sir she continued officiously and said as she saw your motor engine run into a field it smashed a gate it did and stop cried the little lady opening her eyes and half rising ill tell the gentleman all about it miss destiny sir miss destinymy name and she curtsied chapter iii after events here was a freakish thing i had talked about destiny as a dea ex machina and the goddess personally had come to superintend the drama in which i was supposedas i shrewdly suspected by this timeto take a leading part however as open confession is good for the soul i may as well state and at the eleventh hour that this story was written when the mystery was solved and justice had been donei threw it as it were into a fictional form thus as i knew the odd name of the little lady when writing i played upon its oddity and saw in her the incarnation of the goddess who maps out the future you can take this explanation with or without the proverbial grain of salt as you choose meanwhile here we are on the threshold of a mystery and a flesh and blood creature with the significant name of destiny appears on the scene when the newcomer stood up and turned her face to the light i had a better view of her she was even smaller than mrs gileswhat one would call a tiny womanand was perfectly shaped not quite a dwarf but very nearly one and her face pointed wrinkled and of a parchment hue looked as old as the pyramids the most youthful thing about her was the undimmed brilliancy of her eyes these dark piercing unwinking and marvellously steady blazedi use the word advisedlyunder a marie antoinette arrangement of wonderfully white hair like spun silk her hat had been removed by the officious mrs faith so i could take in her looks very easily she wore a shabby black silk dress much worn an equally shabby black velvet mantle oldfashioned and trimmed sparsely with beads and had cotton glovesblack oneson her skinny hands with cloth boots on her tiny feet from her general appearance she might have stepped out of a childs fairybook as a representation of cinderellas godmother as her first faintness had passed awaythanks to mrs giles whiskyshe was now wonderfully composed and stood before me dropping elfish curtseys without a tremor of the face or a blink of the eye miss destiny she said again and you sir cyrus vance i answered at present in custody as a suspected robber giles murmured something incoherent to the effect that this was not so but miss destiny paid no attention to him robber of what sir of mrs caldershaws glass eye o dear me the little lady sat down promptly do you mean to say that she has lost it at last and that you took it i did not take it madam although i am credited with the theft but it is assuredly lost but whyat last miss destiny moved her hands in the shabby black cotton gloves nervously and swallowed somethingpossibly the truth although i had on the face of it no reason to suspect her of lying i was on my way to see anne caldershaw she said timidly what mrs faiths dark countenance lighted up with curiosity you knew heryou knew her intimately replied miss destiny somewhat primly she was my brothers housekeeper at burwain for years then he died and anne came here burwain which is between gattlingsands and tarhaven is subject to fogs explained the little lady and anne believed that clear inland air would suit her chest better i knew burwain as a somnolent hamlet set in a flat country and muffled with woods and tall hedges this very day had i passed it in the rippler when conveying cannington to murchester it was odd that this little woman should mention it of all places you know that mrs caldershaw is dead i ventured to remark miss destiny threw up her hands the shock of it she whimpered i was coming to see her and remain for the night my servant lucinda drove me from burwain in my trap cart struck in mrs faith vehemently while giles and his wife standing near the fire held their peace it is a cart admitted miss destiny which i have turned into a trap as i am very very very poor her voice ascended to the last word yesterday morning i started and stayed last night with a friend at saxham which is half way to murchester this morning we drove on again and were approaching mootley when the motor car nearly smashed my trap my motor car i asked quickly i heard something about its belonging to a gentleman said miss destiny it was however driven by a woman in a long white cloak the lady i saw murmured giles of whom miss destiny took no notice she drove headlong down a steep incline and came within a handbreadth of the trap mr vance then she swerved round and went smashing through a wooden gate not too securely fashioned into a field i was very much upset and lucindaalways mindful of my comfortdrove on to mootley as quickly as possible theremiss destiny rose and became quite dramatici was met with the news that anne caldershaw had been found dead the news upset me so that i nearly fainted but this good woman she indicated mrs faith with a gracious bend of the head brought me here and i am obliged to these honest people she nodded towards giles and his wife for reviving me where i am to stop the night i dont know as anne informed me in her letter that there is no inn here theres a publichouse put in giles reflectively but it isnt fit for a lady like you if you will stay here maam for the night if its not very expensive interrupted miss destiny it will cost nothing maam said giles curtly im none so poor but what i cant give a bite and a bed to a stranger then i accept with pleasure replied miss destiny and really seemed delighted at the idea of getting bed and breakfast for nothing either she was very poor or she was avaricious i could not decide which but gave her the benefit of the doubt and looked upon her as a reduced gentlewoman what about me giles i asked when this was settled its early yet sir so if you will wait here until lord cannington comes from murchester you can go back with him after seeing warshaw oh i dont want to go back i am anxious to see the end of this tragedy in that case sir the missus can put you up too if you dont mind a shakedown theres room enough for all i can make you comfortable in the parlour said mrs giles thinking of ways and means the lady can sleep in the spare bedroom with lucinda put in miss destiny she is outside with the trap and if you will see that the horse is put into some stable and that lucinda is brought in to have supper you will be conferring a great favour on me i really couldnt sleep without lucinda as my nerves are not what they ought to be and this dreadful occurrence has upset them greatly giles who seemed to be singularly generous and hospitable nodded and went out to see after lucinda and the trap while mrs giles boiled a couple of eggs for the visitor who had so unexpectedly appeared mrs faith with her hands on her hips and her dark face alive with curiosity stared hard at the frail figure of the shabby little lady about the glass eye she asked eagerly with a side glance at me which this gentleman took i didnt take it i said sharply for the way in which the woman assumed me to be guilty was unbearable so far as i remember mrs caldershaw had two eyes when i saw her body though to be sure i might have been mistaken seeing i had only a match and i was mistaken i added vigorously for if the woman who stole my motor car took the eye she must have done so before i saw the corpse but why should the eye be stolen i looked at miss destiny for an answer the little old lady shook her head its the oddest thing she said at length and in a lively manner when anne was my brothers housekeeper it was well known that she had a glass eye to which she appeared to attach a ridiculous value she often declared that she would not lose it for a fortune what she meant i cant say but since the eye has been stolen she must have meant something its remarkably strange i muttered for the mystery of the eye was beginning to attract me have you no idea i know nothing more than i have told you said miss destiny sharply by the way how did anne die no one knows said mrs faith determined to join in the conversation and restless at having kept silence for so long frampton declared that she had a fit nonsense anne so far as i know never had fits a lean spare woman such as anne was could not have a fit lean people may have fits as well as fat ones said i wisely i am not doctor enough to say said miss destiny wearily and i am very tired with the journey and the news i have received poor anne she was a good and faithful servant she wasnt popular here said mrs faith tartly she kept very much to herself said mrs giles placing the eggs before miss destiny a very close woman anne never was one for gossip observed miss destiny sipping a cup of hot tea none knew her better than i tell us all about her said mrs faith curiously miss destiny shook her head i am too tired she confessed and after i have had my supper i shall go to bed if this honest woman permits tomorrow i shall tell the police all i know the police said mrs giles with a start certainly miss destiny looked hard at the greengrocers wife as anne is so mysteriously dead and as her glass eye is missing and as this gentlemans motor car has been carried offso they told me at the shopthe police will certainly ask questions i shall answer them mrs faith struck in again but can you give any reason i shall say nothing at present interrupted miss destiny with quite a grand air of rebuke oh lucinda the door had opened while she spoke and a gigantic figure whether of man or woman stepped cumbrously into the room i doubted the sex because although lucinda wore petticoats she also wore a distinct moustache and displayed a rugged flat face masculine in contour with a mans cap on her scanty drabhued hair and a mans peajacket clothing her spare body with large drivinggloves and a red muffler and nothing feminine about her save a short dress of light blue beneath which appeared a pair of large laceup boots i may be excused for my doubts her eyes were grey and small and tiredlooking but they lighted with tender love when she beheld her mistress miss destiny looked smaller than ever as the huge woman strode towards her to speak in one of the sweetest voices i have ever heard these nightingale notes proceeding from a kind of female blunderbore were scarcely in keeping with the coarse exterior are you rested mistress have you eaten is your head bad are your feet cold demanded lucinda in a breath and with a voice of an archangel i am much better lucinda said miss destiny wearily but i should like to go to my room and she closed her bright black eyes ill take you there mistress said the amazon and picked up the little woman like a feather turning to address mrs giles as she did so wheres the bedroom mum ill show you said mrs giles and conducted the odd couple into an inner room with an air of amazement which showed that lucinda had startled her also by the mixed sexual appearance she presented i could not help thinking that giles and his wife were a singularly goodnatured couple to allow the house to be stormed in this fashion what do you think of it all asked mrs faith when we were alone i was beginning to dislike the woman for her unwarrantable curiosity it is amusing amusing she stared aghast the unexpected is always amusing said i but come outside and well see giles i want him to take me to mrs caldershaws shop again it is necessary for me to see warshaw and tell him my story i dont want a garbled version to reach him as it is hard to remove first impressions mrs faith keeping a jealous eye on mei verily believe that she still credited me with knowing more about the death that i would confessshepherded me round the cottage into a small stable where giles was attending to the horse after delivering me into his charge with the air of a police officer she remarked that she would go home and drink a cup of tea i was glad to see the back of the inquisitive woman and said as much to giles ay he remarked smiling quietly shes a rare one for other peoples business is mrs faith well sir whats to be done now i want you to come with me to mrs caldershaws shop as i must see the policeman and i say giles i added as we turned out of the yard and walked along the dark damp road its ridiculous all of us using your cottage as a hotel in this fashion if miss destiny doesnt pay you i shall do so and in any case i shall pay for myself youre of a forgiving nature mr vance seeing how nearly i broke your neck sir said giles smiling again pooh i would have done the same myself seeing that i was taken as it were redhanded by the way you heard of the way in which this strange woman has run my motor into a field yes sir lucindashe told me her nameexplained what had happened i hope my car isnt smashed up i grumbled turning up my coat collar for the night was growing chilly i dont suppose that thief of a woman could drive for nuts well well its a queer business altogether i wonder how it will all end we must wait and see mr vance these things are in the hands of providence you know said giles soberly and then i gathered that the retired greengrocer had a strong religious veinevangelistical for choice or in the hands of miss destiny i murmured for i still held to the fantastical belief that the shabby little woman had come from olympus during the two hours which had elapsed since giles took me into custody law and order had been established in and about the tragic shop warshawas i afterwards learnedhad come posthaste from arkleigh which was no very great distance away and had brought with him a brother constable this last was on guard at the shop door before which a group of people were chattering excitedly and warshaw himself attended to the inside of the house a few words to the cerebus gained giles and myself admission and we were informed incidentally that a messenger on bicycle had been sent to the murchester inspector with details of the death and of the loot of the motor car shortly said the policeman at the door the inspector would arrive to take charge of the case warshaw proved to be a lean redhaired sedate young constable who had been in the army and who knew a gentleman when he saw one he was therefore extremely civil to me and heard my story with great gravity afterwards he questioned giles and then logged both tales in his pocketbook he did not seem to suspect that i was guilty of assault or robbery but intimated politely that it would be just as well if i remained in his company until inspector dredge arrived from murchester then i offered him a cigarette and we began to chat what do you think of the case i asked lighting up i dont know what to think of it sir he replied with a doubtful air the deceased is dead but not being a doctor i cant see how she came by her death her left eyewhich i believe was a glass oneis missing and a man said it was in her head at five oclock when she attended to him in the shop yes he shook his closely cropped hair its a queer case do you think she was assaulted and rendered insensible for the sake of this glass eye i cant say sir and if i might suggest to you sir it will be best to ask no questions and to say nothing on your part until inspector dredge arrives i shall only ask one question warshaw has anything been stolen no sir it isnt a case of burglary i swear after warshaws hint of course i held my tongue we were in the back room and the corpse of mrs caldershaw was still lying on the floor with a rug over it until dredge and a doctor arrived the local policeman wisely decided to leave it as it had been found i shuddered a trifle at the cold clay of the unfortunate woman which i knew lay under the gaudy rug and glanced round the room it was of no great size and furnished in a plain waycomfortable enough but not luxurious the walls were adorned with a flamboyant red paper scrolled aggressively with some unnatural green vegetation and on the floor a diapered black and white linoleum lay under a whitewashed ceiling the furniture consisted of an early victorian horsehair mahogany suite adorned with vividly tinted antimacassars a stickylooking varnished sideboard upon which stood a decayed weddingcake top under a glass shade a moderately sized round table covered with a blue cloth and over it a homemade swing bookcase containing antique and uninviting volumes chiefly concerned as i discovered with religion also there was an oldfashioned grate in which a diminutive fire smouldered a grandfather clocknow indicating the hour of nineand finally on the glaringly covered walls a few cheap oleographs apparently taken from the christmas numbers of illustrated papers a tall brasspillared lamp giving out an exceedingly bad light stood on the round table and but faintly illuminated the homely apartment later my attention was attracted by a photograph on the mantelpiecea sumptuous photograph by an artistic london firm set in an ornate silver frame far too expensive for the late mrs caldershaw to have purchased herself i struck a match to examine it out of the semidarkness flashed a truly lovely face with the sweetest smile i had ever beheld in the flickering light i saw the head and shoulders and bust of a girla lady a goddess i might say she was arrayed in an evening dress of the simplest kind untrimmed and unadorned in any way not even a necklace appeared on the swanlike grace of the neck and no bracelets accentuated the outline of the finelymoulded arms and the facei fell in love with it at sightwith its haunting eyes and grave tender wishful smile the hair was dressed in the plain greek fashion and the head being turned a trifle to one side ravished me with its chaste loveliness doubtless the picture represented a modern young lady but to me it gleamed forth from the darkness as a revelation of diana but not of the ephesians no here was the virginal huntress who slew actn who solaced the dying hippolytus and who came to endymion in dreams on mount latmus i was no raw boy andi have confessed it beforei had never been in love but this exquisite face captured my heart my fancy my psychic senses and all that there was in me to respond to the mystery of sex love at first sight was a mighty truth after all here wasmy wife nonsense said i aloud at this point and the match went out after burning my fingers the men looked up inquiringly and keeping well back in the gloom i coloured warmly its nothing an idle thought passed through my mind i wonderhere i hesitated as i was on the verge of asking the two what they knew about the portrait but an inexplicable sense of nervous shame kept me silent on this point and i finished my sentence in another way i wonder when the inspector will arrive said i with a yawn at that moment as if in answer to my question the sound of approaching wheels was heard and we sharply walked into the shop to see a trap halting before the door a tall militarylooking man descended and stalked forward followed by a policeman and a cheerful redfaced individual who looked what he wasa country practitioner a carefully cultivated habit of observationinvaluable to playwright or novelisthas quickened my comprehension so i guessed the doctors profession the moment he entered the shop dredge was grim and hardmouthed and steadyeyed and sparing of words on all occasions he listened to warshaws report without committing himself to speech and then tersely asked the doctorscoot was his queer nameto inspect the corpse in his presence i remained with giles in the shop as i had no desire to participate in the gruesome examination the policeman who had come from murchester took up his station at the door along with his comrade and to him i addressed myself do you know if the messenger who came to see inspector dredge went on to the barracks i asked for i was wondering why cannington had not arrived yes sir said the officer saluting as soon as the inspector heard of the murder he sent him on and then we drove here strange i murmured for i knew that cannington was not the boy to let grass grow under his feet when a friend was in trouble as it was still early he would not be in bed and as some hours had elapsed there was ample time for him to arrive indeed i had expected him to precede the police giles frowned and shook his head i think ashley was sent he said in his rough voice and hes but a wastrel i only hope he has gone to the barracks and is not drinking in some publichouse news of a murder will get him many free drinks i shrugged my shoulders that may be the case giles however it doesnt matter i can stay with you and tomorrow we can send a more reliable messenger to lord cannington oh his lordship may arrive yet ventured the exgreengrocer perhaps but i doubt it he would have arrived before had he heard of my dilemma ah heres the inspector dredge looked more gloomy and forbidding than ever i understood although he did not inform me that dr scoot was still examining the dead body and that dredge had come to ask questions i was right in my latter surmise at all events for he examined me thoroughly and set down my replies in a book then he gave me a piece of information your motor car sir is standing in a field some distance from murchester abandoned we saw it through the broken gate when we drove past a hasty examination showed us that it has not been much injured before i could reply the agitated voice of scoot was heard calling for the inspector i followed dredge into the back room the doctor had opened the dead womans bodice and was pointing to a gleam of blue glass see see he said loudly the head of a hatpin he drew it out yes this poor wretched woman has been murdered by having a hatpin thrust into her heart i thought of the whitecloaked female who had stolen my car but said nothing chapter iv facts next morning brought cannington in a towering rage to mootley he arrived in a motor while i was breakfasting at nine oclock and explained with many apologies that he had become aware of my difficulties only one hour previously that silly blighter you sent said the boy volubly never came to the barracks last night after telling the police what had happened he started to come to methis is his story rememberbut on the way dropped into a pub there he talked about the murder and was supplied with so many free drinks that he wasnt in a fit state to leave humph said i going on with my breakfast giles was right it seems this ashley animal is a wastrel well well echoed cannington fuming there is no well about it the intoxicated beast only turned up this morning at nine oclock i was in bed when my servant brought in the message and when i saw him i told him off confound him for a silly ape then i got trent to loan me his car and came along here as soon as i could bathe and dress have you had breakfast oh damn breakfast no well sit down and have some if mrs giles glanced at the little woman who was hovering round the fire permits ill set another cup and plate at once sir she said evidently fluttered at the idea of entertaining a real live lord but im afraid sir that eggs and bacon and tea aint what the young gentlemans used to i dont know anything better said cannington graciously and soon was occupied industriously in filling up and i do call it beastly he said between mouthfuls that i should have been out of all the fun if id only come along with you vance youd have been arrested as i am i finished oh come now thats a bit too thick you didnt rob this woman or murder her for one of your melodramas did you who said she was murdered i asked taking another cup of tea that blighter who came this morning how the deuce does he know the murder was only found out after he went to murchester everyonemyself includedthought that it was merely robbery of a glass eye a glass eye cannington stared who the deuce would steal a glass eye the woman who annexed my motor car and who murdered mrs caldershaw by sticking a hatpin into her heart stole it whose glass eye was it mrs caldershaws who is she the dead woman cannington gulped down a cup of tea and requested particulars you see i was in such a rage that i heard very little from the messenger he explained apologetically all i gathered was that some woman had been murdered and robbed and that you were suspected i hurried along to tell the police that they were idiots and oh not such idiots said i pushing back my chair and lighting a cigarette you see i was caught redhanded by mrs giles husband oh sir put in the greengrocers wife deprecatingly begin at the beginning commanded cannington who was still eating with the healthy appetite of a young animal and go on to the end im not clever enough to make up a story out of scraps thus adjured i detailed all that had taken place from the time i had left him at the messroom door on the previous day he became so interested that he ceased to eat and at the conclusion of my narrative jumped up from his chair with an ejaculation by jove said he recalling our conversation in the rippler adventures are to the adventurous arent they this real life business beats any of your melodramas i agree truth is always more impossible than fiction an epigram doesnt meet the case snapped cannington it sums it up my boy who could ever invent such a situationi speak as a playwright you understand i could never have imagined the tragedy of an old woman killed by a hatpin for the sake of her glass eye much less the implicating of an inoffensive stranger and the theft of his motor by the murderess you are sure she is guilty certainly who but a woman would use a hatpin to slay and who but a woman would have a hatpin to use but why should she kill the old woman that question can only be answered when we know more about the lady in the white cloak who bolted with my car who is she helen of troy for all i know what silly questions you ask cannington im not sherlock holmes he retorted and i did come on straight to help you through this business forgive me boy youre a brick what about your duties i got leave from the adjutant thats all right whats to be done now we must see inspector dredge and look after my motor which is still piled up in the field where the lady left it clever woman that she knew that she might be traced by the number and so got rid of the car i daresay she footed it to murchester and went on to london by the night train in a white cloak shed be traced if she was fool enough to wear it said i dryly but i daresay well find that white cloak packed away in the car come along and let us see cried cannington greatly excited one moment mrs giles what about miss destiny and her servant shes not up yet sir and lucinda has taken in her breakfast is she returning to burwain today i think so sir but sam told inspector dredge of what she said last night and he wishes to ask her questions about mrs caldershaws past i nodded no doubt in mrs caldershaws past will be found the motive for the committal of this strange crime that glass eye was a dangerous possession mrs giles lor sir do you think that has anything to do with it everything if you remember what miss destiny said about the value mrs caldershaw attached to that glass eye she is dead and evidentlysince the eye is missingwas murdered for its possession depend upon it mrs giles when inspector dredge learns the history of that eye he will be able to lay his hand on this lady who so ingeniously escaped but after all said cannington looking back from the door you really arent arrested vance are you you can put it that i am under surveillance boy what rot come and tell dredge so said i taking his arm ill be back soon mrs giles so tell your husband and with a nod i went out we found canningtonsor rather trentsmotor at the door and got into it to proceed to the shop round the corner here we found inspector dredge surrounded by his myrmidons and i explained to him that my friend had come to vouch for my respectability also that i desired to go in search of my rippler the inspector although as grimfaced was less taciturn than on the previous night and received my explanation most kindly assuring me that there was little need for lord cannington to state my honourable qualities although he added his lordship is welcome to depose to your position as a matter of form oh mr vance is all right said cannington cheerily he only commits murders on the stage i dont think even on the stage i ever committed so ingenious a murder as this one seems to be i retorted dredge nodded yes this unknown woman is singularly clever then you think she is guilty what else can i think mr vance said dredge raising his eyebrows from what you tell me i am inclined to think that she was hiding in an upstairs roomthere are twowhen you entered the shop possibly the sound and appearance of your car drove her there after she had murdered the unfortunate mrs caldershaw you did not enter the shop immediately well no i was a few minutes looking into things connected with the car and the shop was in darkness complete darkness i thought so this woman heard your car coming and later on saw it she doubtless slipped out of the back room where she had just stabbed her victim and had the eyethis seems to be the motive for the commission of the crimein her pocket she could not walk into the road without running a chance of meeting you so she sprang up the stairs yonderhe pointed to the steps which clung to the wall on one side and had a light railing on the otherand took refuge in the bedroom when she heard you enter the back room she came down turned the key and ran away with your car humph said i after a pause permit me to put you right on one point mr inspector i believe that the woman was in the back room when i entered the shop for when i tried the door in order to find someone it was locked really dredge made a hasty note was the key on the outside i dont remember all i know was that i could not pull open the door she would not have had time to change the key from the inside to the outside mused the inspector i daresay the key all along was on the outside as it is now he glanced at the door leading into the back room and sure enough there was the key possibly she shot the boltthere is one on the hither side of the door as i noticed well well while i was filling the tank of my car with petrol she must have emerged andas you sayunable to escape without observation by the road she must have slipped upstairs when i found the door open on trying it for the second time i entered the back room attracted by the last moan of the dying woman then shethe murderess i meanmust have come down and after softly turning the key have gone off in my car but why should she leave the car in a field asked cannington to the more easily escape said dredge raising his eyebrows a car with a number could easily be traced she took it as near murchester as she dared then abandoned it and walked to the town that is my theory and then she could either remain in murchester or take the train to some other place it will be a hard matter to find her as she has concealed her trail very successfully she might have left some evidence behind in the car i suggested dredge shook his head i examined the car myself this morning he remarked there is not a vestige to show that any woman occupied it she has not left even so much as a pin behind pardon me she left a hatpin yes said the inspector grimly in the heart of the unfortunate mrs caldershaw but your car is still in that field near murchester mr vance and i shall leave you to take it away i dont know how much it is injured last night you said that it wasnt much hurt i said hastily quite so sir said dredge imperturbably but last night my examination was necessarily perfunctory as i was in a hurry to reach the scene of the crime this morning i examined the car more carefully and i am not sufficiently an expert to see what damage has been done remember it was driven violently through a wooden gate on purpose asked cannington quickly the inspector cast a side glance at his freshcoloured face i cant say my lord i think not the woman driving down the incline nearly ran into miss destinys trap to avoid a complete collision she may have turned the steeringwheel too completely round and so probably dashed by mischance through the gate indeed i think that is the true explanation then but for this accident said cannington pertinaciously she would have driven the car to murchester i really cant offer an opinion on that point my lord we are working in the dark just now and all i have said is mere theory founded upon circumstantial evidence however mr vance he turned to me you can go and see after your car and tell me what you think that is he glanced at his watch sharply after i have examined miss destiny i am told by giles that she knew mrs caldershaw and was coming here to pass the night you want me to be present if you will so far oblige me i shall be delighted i wish to hear of everything connected with this most interesting case do you mind if lord cannington is present also not at all said dredge graciously and shuffled his notes which were lying on the counter miss destiny will be here in a few minutes and we can go into the back room where the crime was committed where is the body asked cannington abruptly it has been laid out in one of the bedrooms upstairs do you wish to view it my lord oh hang it certainly not gasped cannington hastily and with all the repugnance which the upper classes exhibit towards such morbid sights i was only asking as i dont wish to sit in the room with a corpse the inspector threw open the door to display the back premises you see he said inviting us by a gesture to enter the body has been removed in the grey daylight for there was no sun to graciously soften crudities the room looked forlorn and chill and lonely cannington stepped at my heels with a nervous shiver for he was somewhat impressionable i now noticed that there were two windows in the outer wall which looked on to a kind of fenced clearing sown with cabbages potatoes and leeks these jostled each other in a disorderly fashion and the paths between the beds were so grassgrown that it was apparent but little interest had been taken in her garden by the late owner of the corner shop the paling fence unpainted and broken which surrounded the oblong of the cultivated ground seemed to push back the encircling elms forming a small untidy wood behind there was no gate in the fence so the sole means of egress was through the shop between the windows was a door leading into this dismal garden standing cheek by jowl with a cumbersome chimney the back door was locked we found it like that last night exclaimed dredge now more communicative and less grim the odd thing is that the key is missing perhaps mrs caldershaw never went into her garden i remarked it does not look inviting oh she must have gone out of that door sometimes insisted the inspector for there is a small shed filled with coals and wood outside she must have replenished her fire occasionally you know mr vance well then she probably had locked the door for the night when she was murdered by this whitecloaked woman i daresay but why should the key be missing cannington made a suggestion the woman locked it when she escaped she escaped through the shop after locking mr vance in retorted dredge so why should she have troubled to steal the backdoor key which on the face of it she did not require huh said the boy she seems to have a weakness for taking queer things mr inspector witness the glass eye dredge nodded i hear miss destiny knows something about that at this moment as if in answer to her name the little old lady stepped daintily into the back room she looked as shabby and frail as ever but she undoubtedly was a gentlewoman and her eyes still revealed a strong vitality with a curtsey to me and to cannington she addressed herself graciously to inspector dredge my trap is at the door sir and i am anxious to return to my home at burwain since this poor woman i came to see is unfortunately dead murdered said dredge laconically miss destiny blinked with her wonderfully youthful eyes and recoiled with a nervous gesture of her hand murdered she whispered half to herself they did not tell me that who did not tell you maam demanded the inspector brusquely lucinda my servant mr giles and his wife she replied brokenly how was she murdered sir an ordinary hatpin with a blue glass bead for a head was thrust into her heart maam she must have died immediately how dreadful but why should she be murdered poor soul so far as i can gather on account of her glass eye which is missing i should like to hear what you have to say on that point maam and dredge fixed his stern eyes inquisitively on the little old lady miss destiny sat down quietly and appeared to make an effort to recover her composure which had been sorely shaken and very naturally by the news of the strange murder all i can say is that anne had a glass eye to which she appeared to attach a ridiculous valueat this point i became aware that she was repeating word for word her speech of the previous night and certain of it when she continued anne often declared that she would not lose it for a fortune now it is lost and she is dead dear me it has been stolen and she has been murdered corrected the inspector smartly i should like to know why mrs caldershaw attached such value to the eye i cant tell you that mr inspector because i do not know anne was always very close and kept her business to herself who is the woman asked dredge impatiently who was the woman you mean sir corrected miss destiny smartly in her turn i can tell you that she was my brothers housekeeper at burwain for many years when he died five years ago more or less added miss destiny precisely she retired with her savings to this place which was her native village and here set up this shop have you seen her since she came to live here at intervals sir anne was a valued old servant whom i respected and at timessay once a year i came over to stay the night with her had she any enemies not to my knowledge sir was she happy here as happy as a grumbler like anne could be for there is no denying poor soul that she was a grumbler ended the little old lady regretfully what was your brothers name maam said dredge producing his notebook gabriel monk sir he was a bachelor and lived at the lodge burwain i kept house for him with anne as our servant until he died then anne came here and i took a small cottage in the village where i now am and the lodge asked dredge somewhat irrelevantly i thought his brother walter monk inherited the lodge and the money of his deceased relative he lives there now with my niece oh the inspector here saw a point which in my opinion he ought to have noticed before then gabriel monk was not exactly your brother i called him so because i looked after his house for him but he really was not sir your brotherinlaw then not even that mr inspector let me explain my sister married walter monk the brother of gabriel and became a widower with one child a girl gabriel took gertrude the girl to live with him when she was a small child and asked me to take charge of her i did so and therefore fell into the habit of calling gabriel my brother but as you see he was no relation and pardon me mr inspector but i do not see what all this private business has to do with the murder of anne caldershaw dredge snapped the elastic band on his closed pocketbook i wish to learn all i can about the dead womans past he said gruffly and so ask you to tell me all you know i have told you all i know said miss destiny rising and now may i take my departure as i have a long way to drive dredge nodded you may have to return for the inquest he said abruptly and in any case i shall come over to burwain to ask questions by all means anyone will tell you where i live said miss destiny with dignity and i trust that my expenses will be paid should i be required as a witness at the inquest here i noted she again revealed a miserly tendency oh yes thats all right said dredge and miss destiny again making her queer little curtsey to cannington and myself was about to depart when i stopped her with a question will you please tell me the name of this lady i asked indicating the photograph in the silver frame miss destinys eyes were too keen to require glasses and she recognised the face at once dear me it is a photograph of gertrude your niece certainly anne nursed her you know and gertrude was always greatly attached to her she will be distressed when she hears of this tragedy dear me i never knew gertrude had given anne her portrait and in such a very expensive frame waste waste but why do you ask about it sir i coloured i thought the face was so lovely was my reply made in a low and somewhat awkward voice miss destiny gave me a piercing glance and nodded in a friendly manner evidently amused by my embarrassment gertrude is as good as she is beautiful she said smiling goodday gentlemen and she left the shop to mount the trap lucinda wrapped the rug carefully round her knees and the oddly assorted pair drove away meanwhile canningtonwho was always much too clever when dulness would have been more diplomaticlaughed meaningly and whispered adventures are to the adventurous said cannington wickedly so you said before and the remark isnt original in any case i answered tartly what you mean oh of course he chaffed softly i havent got eyes in my head and youre a joseph where a pretty girl is concerned and she is prettyhe turned to look at my goddessshe is oh shut up i interrupted crossly mr inspector i am going to look after my motor car and the inquest will be held in this house tomorrow at ten oclock this settled matters for the time being and i departed with the boy who still chaffed me like the silly young ass he was old vance in love ho ho said this annoying boy chapter v an important discovery on examination the rippler appeared to have suffered but trifling hurt either by accident or design the flying lady had driven the machine straight through an ancient fivebarred gate which fortunately was much too decayed to present any serious obstacle across a stubbled fieldas the ripping and ploughing of the grounds showedthe car had reeled drunkenly until by its own weight it was bogged in the friable furrows here it had been deserted with smashed lamps a slightly damaged front and with a considerable amount of paint scraped off but an immediate test showed that the machinery was in excellent working order it was no easy task to restore the derelict to the hard levels of the highroad but cannington collected a gang of agriculturals from unknown quarters and we set to work with spades and crowbars broad weatherboards from an adjacent incomplete building as temporary tramlines and a towrope from trents machine to mine we managed the job fairly expeditiously considering the environment with water from the nearest pond for the outside of the car and oil and petrol for the interior i managed to get the rippler into working order although she was more or less shaken and did not run very smoothly fortunately the lady had abandoned her loot within half a mile of murchester so with careful driving i contrived to get over that distance in safety after storing the rippler in a convenient garage to be repaired and overhauled i went on to the barracks with cannington in trents motor here i proposed to put up until the inquest was at an end and i was free to leave the neighbourhood it was rather a nuisance to be thus publicly housed as one might put it for everyone from the colonel to the latestjoined subaltern asked questions and aired impossible theories my intimate connection with the affair made me an object of interest to one and all and small wonder that it should be so for the mystery of the affair was most enthralling on the way to his quarters canningtonperhaps to distract my thoughts from more immediate troublesmentioned casually that wentworth marr had left a card for him at mess just before we had arrived on the day of the murder i did not take any interest in marr as i had never seen him so it was a matter of indifference to me whether he had called or not but the boy fidgeted over the matter as he made sure he was about to be asked a knotty question officially as the head of the wotton family i am certain that marr wishes to know if i will agree to his marrying my sister said cannington irritably and i dont know what to say refer him to the lady i suggested absently i shant hes too old for mabel and i dont want her to marry him in any case i wish weston would come up to the scratch for he told me that he loved mabel and i was quite pleased westons no end of a good sort and wethat is mabel and ihave known him almost as long as we have you vance marrs all right and deuced rich from all one hears but i dont want such an old chap as a brotherinlaw for all his thousands of pounds oh very well then said i ungraciously tell him to keep off the grass or youll punch his head is he stopping at murchester i suppose so his card has the lions headthats the best hotel herepencilled on it he called somewhere about three yesterday before we arrived and he said hed turn up again i expect to find him waiting for me now and im hanged lamented cannington if i know what to say but as after events proved the boy was worrying himself needlessly for wentworth marr did not reappear at the barracks on inquiry we learned that he stayed only the one night in murchester and then went back to london in his motorfor he also travelled in the latest vehicle of transit i only mention these apparently trivial facts because they form certain links in the chain of evidence which led up to the discovery of the amazing truth meanwhile not foreseeing the importance of trifles i was rather annoyed with cannington for babbling my mind was far too much taken up with the mystery of mrs caldershaws murder and withi must confess itthe face of gertrude monk to permit me to think of lady mabel wotton and her wooers elderly or otherwise lady mabel herself appeared a day or so later and at an inopportune moment for her brother and i were greatly fatigued with what had occurred during the interval however we returned from mootley in my renovated rippler on the third day and found her waiting impatiently for afternoon tea in canningtons quarters she was a tall freshcoloured dashing girl amazingly like her brother and if he had worn her tailormade dress instead of his khaki i do not think anyone unless a very close observer would have been the wiser i had known the family for more years that i cared to remember and liked lady mabel immensely as she was outspoken and companionable and did not want a man to be always telling her that she was a goddess all the same she could flirt when inclined although she never did so with me it could not have been my age for i was younger than this confounded marr she came to talk about so i presume she looked upon me as canningtons elder brother at all events our friendship was always prosaic and matter of fact we had tea while lady mabel presided and told us that she had just come down for an hour and that she was very miserable and that cannington ought to have written her and that she did not know what to do though cyrusthat was memight give some advice and i never give advice i interrupted hastily im not clever enough i never said you were she retorted but you are slow and sure thanks lady mabel i think youre just horrid and why you should be so stiff with me i dont know seeing that you knew cannington and myself since we could toddle oh come now im not so old as all that you are and ever so much older youyou bachelor i cant help that since you refuse to marry me i said smiling youve never asked me tonot that i would accept you she replied promptly all the same you neednt call me lady mabel as if you were keeping me off with a pitchfork well thenmabel thats better she gave me a friendly pat on the shoulder you know that i look on you as a good sort cyrus and the oldest friend we have i wriggled why do you emphasise age so much cannington laughed and i knew that he was thinking of my admiration of miss monks photograph vance doesnt like to be reminded of his agenow why now questioned lady mabel suspiciously oh never mind i said crossly what do you want my advice about our fair companion put down her cup in despair havent i been telling you for the last half hour mr marr wants to marry me he asked me four days ago and then came down to enlist cannington on his side huh said the boy sagaciously that sounds as though you had refused him no i didnt then you accepted him no i didnt she said again i left it an open question until i consulted you and cyrus after all he is rich and not badlooking oh mabel cried cannington rising to perambulate the narrow room you know very well that you love dickey weston whats the use of loving a man who wont speak his mind dickey always lives in the moon and i only love him from habit you never loved me from habit i remarked lazily mabel put her head on one side and surveyed me critically no i never did she said candidly and yet youre betterlooking than dickey but hes got a way with himi dont know what it is absentmindedness suggested cannington may we smoke mab oh yes and you can give me a cigarette also if theyre egyptian thanks awfully she accepted one and i struck a match for the lighting of course dickey weston is absentminded and selfish she continued frankly all the same i love him and i dont mind anyone knowing it every one does except dickey said i with a shrug i suppose you think thats clever its the truth after all i dont see why you need be shy with a man you have known for centuries why not go to dickey and tell him that you want to marry him and go trips in his airship dickey would agree and never know what had happened until he found me breakfasting opposite to him without a chaperon well whats to be done she leaned back and placed her hands behind her head dickey wont ask me to be his wife and mr marrwho is richwants me to marry him right away do you love marr mabel asked cannington seriously no she said promptly then refuse him hes too rich to refuse mabeli spoke this time and severelyyou are much too nice a girl to make such a sordid match and with a man who might be your father chuck him and chuck it and make dickey weston do his duty which dickey will be quite willing to do said cannington amiably especially as he told me that he loved you mab oh the girl jumped up and with a fine blush threw the halffinished cigarette into the fireplace why didnt you tell me that before cannington i know what ill do she reflected for three seconds ill tell mr marr that he shall have his answer as a christmas box and meanwhile ill see if i cant make dickey jealous cannington you are sure that dickey said what you say he said quite sure he said it twice then he must mean it cried mabel energetically so i can hold off mr marr and make dickey jealous by pretending to flirt with him after all i love dickey and dickey loves me so why shouldnt we marry i am sure said i cynically that if you put the position clearly to weston in that way he would do his duty i dont want him to do his duty just as if i was driving him to the altar she said much exasperated i wouldnt marry dickey if i didnt love him not if he were twice as rich what about marr she wilfully chose to ignore my hint he can remain as a second string to my bow cyrus after all i must marry money aunt lucythis was lady denham the late earls sisteris always grumbling about my dresses andandandoh well then never mind i must be getting back to town she looked at her bracelet watch theres a theatre party and supper at the ritz tonight so i havent much time and the situation asked cannington helping her on with her cloak ill temporise and give dickey a chance which means that marr will have none i said gravely thats not fair mabel shrugged her shoulders and made the truly feminine answer youre a man and dont understand oh she stopped at the door suddenly by the way aunt lucy told me that your name was in the papers cyrus about some murder ive just thought about it arent you accused of sticking pins into some one tell me all about it on the way to the station it will amuse me you know this refreshing candour made me laugh right out as we descended the stairs i am glad that you have even an afterthought of my amusing position said i very drily she had the grace to colour oh i didnt quite mean that cyrus but after all i cant think of everything at once cannington did that mabel he has been a brick and but for his assistance i should never have pulled through what rot muttered the boy but he was secretly pleased then you are in danger cried mabel startled i have been i replied with emphasis as i discovered the body but my own spotless reputation and canningtons asseverations of my honesty prevented my being arrested im so glad cyrus such a horrid thing for ones friend being arrested for a nasty pinsticking crime horrid indeedfor the friend where did you hear of the murder mab questioned her brother oh the papers yesterday and this morning were full of it aunt lucy drew my attention to them as she knew that i knew you said mabel incoherently you were at the inquest werent you cyrus and gave evidence tell me all about it as i only read scraps theres very little to tell i answered yawning for really i felt extremely tired i found mrs caldershaw dead in the back room and a woman in a white cloak presumably her murderess ran off with my motor car i read all that what else nothing else save that we found the car and not the woman a jury of twelve good and lawful yokels brought in a verdict of murder against some person or persons unknown but i thought you said this woman was guilty it is presumed so since she bolted with my car and hasnt turned up her name is unknown so the verdict is quite right but persons persisted lady mabel inquisitively a mere graceful addition to round off the sentence i believe that this woman stabbed mrs caldershaw with a sapphireheaded hatpin sapphireheaded she must have been rich oh vance is drawing on his theatrical imagination struck in cannington impatiently the sapphire he talks of was only blue glass oh that reminds me that the papers said something about a glass eye i expect they said a very great deal about it i assented gravely catch your journalist missing a chance of hinting at mystery is it a mystery asked mabel walking before us into the station more or lesspossibly more mrs caldershaw was murdered by this unknown woman presumably for the sake of her glass eye but why cannington laughed thats what the police are trying to learn not that they ever will i believe the truth will never be discovered are there no letters no papers is there no gossip likely to i interrupted impatiently for the absence of circumstantial evidence bothered me greatly inspector dredge looked over all the papers and letters of the dead woman and found nothing likely to lead to the discovery of the guilty persons name as to gossip it appears that mrs caldershaw kept to herself in the corner shop and little was known about her she came to mootley five years ago with her savings having been the housekeeper of gabriel monk of burwain near gattlingsands there she started a shop and at times received a visit from miss gertrude monk whom she nursed and from miss destiny who is the young ladys aunt two women breathed mabel facing me do you think that either one is guilty i interrupted again and somewhat sharply no i certainly do not miss destiny was on her way to stay the night with mrs caldershaw when the crime was committed and at the inquest she stated that she left her niece behind at the lodge burwain you neednt be so cross about it said mabel staring at my acrid tone i only suggested possibilities what are you laughing at cannington nothing said the boy untruthfully and looked hard at me the fact of my admiration for miss monks pictured facewe had discussed her several times before and after the inquestwas in his mind as i well knew but he had grace enough to keep this to himself and not set lady mabels too ready tongue chattering i wish you wouldnt giggle cannington she said accepting the excuse its growing on you well she faced me and what are you going to do about what if you please about this murder what the deuce should he do cried cannington openly surprised hes well out of an awkward situation so theres no more to be said i daresay hell write a melodrama on the case and solve the mystery in the wrong way i am not so sure said i pointedly that i wont try to solve it the right way what do you mean by that asked my friend staring i mean that the mystery of mrs caldershaws glass eye fascinates me and that i intend to follow up what clues there are there arent any said cannington promptly you heard what inspector dredge remarked at the inquest he admitted that he could find no evidence it is true but that doesnt mean to say that evidence is not to be found are you about to turn an amateur detective why not now why are you laughing oh hes crazy said mabel disdainfully here comes my train ill have a rush to reach town and dress aunt lucy is always so punctual im sure to get into hot water ask mr wentworth marr to get you out of it said i jokingly he could she replied seriously leaning out of the carriage window aunt lucy thinks no end of him and would be glad to see me his wife dont you do anything in a hurry mabelbegan cannington when his expostulations were cut short by the departure of the train when the ruddy tail light of the guards van disappeared he took my arm with a friendly hug i didnt give you away did i vance theres nothing to give away i said gruffly oh oh oh said cannington in three distinct keys what about love at first sight old man you intend to follow up this case so as to get into touch with the original of that photograph rubbish you are jumping in the dark dont you jump advised the boy shrewdly your fancy has evidently been caught by miss monks face and if you meet her theres no telling but that you may be a married man before christmas i denied this hotly and proceeded to show that my interest in the case was more or less official mystery piques every man said i insistently so i mean to learn why mrs caldershaw was murdered and why she attached such value to that glass eye of hers cannington laughed and declined to believe but being a thoroughly good fellow ceased to chaff me when he saw that i looked annoyed all the same he remarked as we strolled back to his quarters i shall keep an eye on you vance youre too inflammable and i dont want you to marry in haste and repent at leisure of course i laughed uneasily maybe for cannington was right in the main i certainly was anxious to solve the mystery but i doubted if my zeal would have been equal to so arduous a task had not the memory of that lovely face lured me onward like a willothewisp i had long since wished to secure the photograph so as to have the image of my divinity constantly before my eyes but dredge very reasonably declined to permit the illegal annexation mrs caldershaws will which had been found by the inspector amongst her shop accounts left all she died possessed of to her nephew joseph striver he proved on inquiry to be a burwain gardener in the employment of mr walter monk if striver will give or sell you the portrait said dredge with official phlegm i have no objection it isnt my property the policeofficer was much too grim and unromantic to guess why i sought to possess the photograph and needless to say i did not tell him also he was considerably annoyed by his failure to solve the mystery of mrs caldershaws murder since its solution would have procured him both praise and promotion so no one but cannington guessed my silly infatuation which assuredly was silly for who but an idiot would fall in love with a pictured face on the instant but there was no denying it that i was in the toils of venus so although angered by such unaccountable weakness i was bent upon meeting the original thenah well the future is on the knees of the gods however since i was minded to trace out the truth of the crime it was necessary to find some clue to start the trail all that evening after dinner and later in the billiardroom where i played snooker with sundry young officers i inwardly wondered how i could and should begin the hatpin revealed nothing as every woman uses hatpins and such with blueglass heads were probably common enough the missing eye might have thrown some light on the darkness but that was safe in the pocket of the assassin it will be noticed that in spite of the open verdict of the jury i clung to the idea that the whitecloaked woman was guilty not only had she fled with my car but she had locked me in with her victim to prevent immediate pursuit also the abandonment of the motor pointed to guilt she had been seen by giles by miss destiny and by lucinda but from the time my machine had been sent crashing through the fivebarred gate by her reckless or intendedly reckless driving she had vanished as completely as though the earth had opened to swallow her up yet she might have guessed that the aggressively striking white cloak would betray her in my opinion a woman who had so cleverly engineered her escape would scarcely be foolish enough to risk detection by her dress so i conjectured that she must have got rid of the cloak as she had got rid of the rippler with this idea in my head i settled without telling cannington to explore the field wherein the machine had been abandoned when at rest for the night i remembered that mrs giles who had not been called as a witness had stated how mrs caldershaw entertained the idea that she would not die in her bed i had questioned the greengrocers wife on this point but she could tell me nothing more mrs caldershaw gave no hint of any enemy or even of the possibility of a tragic death all she had done was to make the above statement to mrs giles in a burst of confidence and to shiver when the litany mentioned murder and sudden death mrs giles was particular about this point i was sitting next to her in the same pew said mrs giles insistently and she shivered and shook and looked over her shoulder apprehensive like it happened three times and that was what made me observe it im sure she was frightened of something or of someone this might have been the case but mrs caldershaw never explained and carried the reason of her fright in silence to her untimely grave connecting mrs giles story with the remark of miss destiny as to the value set on the glass eye by the woman and with the sinister fact that the glass eye was missing i felt certain that the way to begin the search was to take the eye itself as a clue local gossip in mootley revealed few useful facts as mrs faith appeared to be the sole person who had been told about the eye by its owner and none of the villagers seemed to know that one eye had been different to the other but in burwain where mrs caldershaw had lived for years as gabriel monks housekeeper and as nurse to his niece the truth might be found by careful inquiry if i could learn where the unfortunate woman got her glass eye and what accident had brought about the necessity for a glass eye the chances were that i might learn something which would enable me to trace the truth therefore i determined to go to burwain and hunt out all information about mrs caldershaws past meanwhile there remained the field near murchester to be explored next morning cannington was engaged on some courtmartial so i was left to my own devices although he wanted to hand me over for entertainment to a less busy brother officer i excused myself on the plea that i wished to walk off a headache and so contrived to leave the barracks unhindered it was nine oclock when i set out and the morning was wonderfully clear for misty august the field as i stated before was only half a mile from murchester so i speedily arrived therein i left the middle of it where the rippler had been stranded severely alone and skirted round the sides to examine the hedges these were ragged and untrimmed with deep ditches on their inner sides and consisted of holly bramble hawthorn and various saplings i scratched myself more or less severely for quite one hour but without discovering any sign of the white cloak perhaps i thought much discouraged the woman had risked wearing it after all yet i could not believe that she had been such a fool seeing how cleverly she had manipulated her escape then i noticed that there were two gates to the field one with the broken bars through which she had entered from the highroad in the car and the other on the far side to the righthand looking from the road it then occurred to me that the flying lady scared by meeting miss destinys trap and perhaps afraid lest she had injured it and would be stopped for damages might have left the field by this last gate i immediately walked towards it and found that it opened on to a narrow lane which in winter must have become a stream of mud the hedges were very ragged and tangled here and the gate was nearly hidden a common fivebarred unpainted gate in a worse condition than that opening on to the road i knew that i had struck on the flying womans trail almost as soon as i arrived at this hidden gate on one of the brambles a filmy scrap of gauze fluttered in the wind apparently while getting over the gate in her hurried flight the womans veil had caught in the thorns and she had twitched it irritably away leaving the scrap unthinkingly behind as evidence i secured the same and placed it in my pocketbook then made a thorough examination of the gate on both sides no further evidence was forthcoming until i searched the ditch which in this instance was on the farther side of the hedge there hidden amongst the dank weeds thrust into a convenient rabbithole in the crumbling clay bank was the cloak itself i drew it out with a sensation of triumph and from it was wafted the torn veil i had the outfit complete save for the motoring cap evidently the rending of the veil had drawn the womans attention to the eccentricity of a white cloak worn on a chilly autumnal evening acting promptly as was her customi guessed that from the theft of my carshe had concealed cloak and veil and then had vanished down the muddy lane heaven only knows whither but i had now the evidence it was a white cloak of good and even expensive material round the neck down the front and along the hem two letters were embroidered repeatedly in blue silk so as to form a pattern they were g m i dropped the cloak and gasped with dismay g m in twisted fanciful letters formed the running adornment of the cloak worn by the woman who had stolen my car and who had to all appearances murdered mrs anne caldershaw and the name of the child she had nursed of the woman with whose portrait i had fallen so unexpectedly in love was gertrude monk its a lie i said aloud to nobody in particular i dont believe it all the same the accusing initials were there g mgertrude monk chapter vi my rival had i not been in loveand with a face instead of the flesh and blood womani suppose i would have gone off at once to dredge to announce my discovery and show what i had found but in spite of evidence to the very strong contrary i could not believe that gertrude monk was guilty of her old nurses murder she might have locked me in she might have run off with my car and practically wrecked it and she might have hidden in the hedge these incriminating garments but she assuredly had notin my now terribly biassed opinionthrust the hatpin into mrs caldershaws heart unless she confessed her guilt to my face i resolutely declined to believe that she had perpetrated a sordid crime however it was useless to stand in that chilly field weighing pros and cons when i knew nothing of the woman save that she was exquisitely lovely and had captured my fancy against my will as it were i had a natural revulsion of doubt then believed in her more than ever even to the extent of vowing that if by chance she were guilty she should never go to the scaffold through me but if i wished to prevent that there was no time to be lost in getting rid of that infernal cloak and veil for inspector dredge with unexpected insight might come nosing about the field not that i credited him with such perspicuity butas i swiftly determinedit was just as well to be on the safe side i therefore rolled up veil and cloak into as small a compass as possible and thrusting them under my overcoati wore one as the morning was breezyi regained the road and hastened my return to murchester barracks i felt that i was compounding a crime one minute and exulted the next that i was saving the life of an innocent woman and yet on the face of it she was surely guilty luckily when i arrived at canningtons quarters he was still absent on duty so i unpacked a portmanteau which had been sent down from london and stowed away the incriminating evidence at the bottom of some books manuscripts shirts and pyjamas then i strapped and locked the portmanteau so that canningtons soldier servant should not officiously wish to pack my belongings he could use the other portmanteau i thought just as i completed my task cannington entered unbuckling his sword ouf i am tired said he pitching himself into a chair what a bore it is sitting on courtmartials what was the punishment i asked lighting my pipe and asked more for the sake of regaining my selfcontrol shaken by my discovery than because i took any interest in private tommy atkins five days c b it was only a drunken fight throw me over the cigarettes vance thanks awfully he fielded the case deftly wait till i change and well go to luncheon im shockingly hungry where have you been fighting with the barracks cat i should say from the scratches but i did not intend to say too much even to cannington i went for a crosscountry walk i answered carelessly and met some brambles on the way what are you doing after luncheon well i was just coming to that said the boy who was now busy changing his kit smoking the while i have to run up to town for three or four hours as my lawyer wants to see me im trying to raise some cash for a christmas spree he grinned hope you wont mind my leaving you but theres trent of course who can look after you oh hang it im not a child to require a nurse i snapped for my nerves were worn thin with the situation you leave me alone cannington and ill attend to myself all right old son dont get your hair off i believe this murder case has got on your nerves it has i confessed very truthfully sorry i spoke like a fractious brat to make amends ill let you take the rippler to town oh that will be frabjious said cannington who had lately been reading alice through the lookingglass wont you come too thanks no im walking out to mootley this afternoon huh i should think you had enough of walking whats on mrs caldershaws funeral they arent losing much time in planting her said cannington with a shrug its only five days since the death but i say old son dont you think you might give this business a rest its getting on your nerves you know and isnt good goods at the best oh thats all right i only want to see the last of the poor woman and then canningtons tone was highly suspicious ill go over to burwain after that girl i scratched my chin and eyed him severely see here im not quite the infant you take me to be miss monks face attracted me i admit but that doesnt mean i am in love with her you talked enough about her anyhow all the more reason that you shouldnt talk i retorted i can say all i want to say for myself do stop rotting cannington nodded with an air of resignation i shant say another word vance didnt think you were in earnest i am in earnest about searching out this mystery if that is what you mean and i go over to burwain tomorrow to make a start with miss monk yes i replied feeling qualmish she was mrs caldershaws nursling and may be able to throw some light on that glass eye i feel convinced that therein lies the solution of the mystery the worst of you literary men said cannington addressing the ceiling is that you talk too much like a book touched wood touched wood he fled for the door as i swung up a chair cushion dont disarrange my hair but come along to luncheon i obeyed but dont tell anyone that i am going to mootley said i hastily right oh ill take the rippler and light out for town at two oclock i shall meet you at dinner and then you can tell me all about the funeral so it was arranged and we made a very good meal at least the boy did being unworried with secret disagreeables but i did not eat much myself the knowledge of what was hidden in my second portmanteau lay heavily on my mind and i fear i betrayed my discomfort for cannington remarked it it occurred to me that a murderer would have to possess amazing nerve to conduct himself as an ordinary human being seeing that i with no crime on my mind was so easily discomfited of course under the circumstances i should have thought of a guilty she rather than of a guilty he but i really could not bring myself to believe that diana of the ephesians had murdered her old nurse cannington did not waste the rippler on himself he invited a cheery subaltern to join him and the two boys went off in the highest spirits with his lordship spanchelled between the seat and the wheel i resisted a kindlymeant invitation of trent to play stickey and turned my face in the direction of mootley thankful to be by myself during the few miles to that village i had ample to think about and could not help wondering at the strange whirl of circumstances which had gathered round me during the last week i had come out to seek an adventure and had found one with a vengeance how it would end i could not tell the sun came out during the afternoon so i found the walkbut for disturbing thoughtsextremely pleasant on passing the field i congratulated myself that i had emptied it of its incriminating contents whatever inquiries dredge made on the face of it he could learn nothing as i alone possessed a tangible clue and as that clue so far led to miss gertrude monk and a thorough explanation would have to be forthcoming before it could go past her it was just as well for her own peace of mind and mine also that she should give it to a friendlydisposed inquirer thinking of this and wondering how she would explain her flight from the corner shop in my motor car i drew near the outskirts of mootley the famous shop which had appeared in several illustrated daily papers was closed so i did not pause but went on directly round the corner i met mr sam giles the exgreengrocer who greeted me in a most friendly manner youre just too late sir said he touching his hat and quite ready to give all information shes planted mrs caldershaw yes sir it was quite a pretty funeral with plenty of mourners and wreaths for the coffin we made a holiday of it this morning and i dont think sir that theres much doing this afternoon as the excitement was too great i could not help smiling in spite of the gravity of my errand at the idea of the villagers extracting pleasure from such a dismal affair as the funeral of a murdered woman but giles apparently had the morbid love of his class for such things and went on supplying information in high spirits a heap of gentlemen of the press came from london he said importantly and they photographed the grave what with motor cars and bicycles and traps and carts the place was like a fair it will advertise mootley a lot and i shouldnt wonder if land went up in value hereabouts i nodded mrs caldershaw has been quite a benefactress to the village mr giles by the way did miss monk and miss destiny appear at the funeral no sir and none of mrs caldershaws burwain friends came to see the last of her poor soul which was unkind i take it only mr striver put in an appearance but to be sure he could not do less added giles thoughtfully since she left him all her property striver striver thats the nephew yes mr vance and a handsome young man he is a gardener i believe who works for mr walter monk at burwain not that hell do much work now for i daresay his aunt has left him enough to live like a gentleman her lawyerhes a murchester man in a small way of businesstold me that there was over five hundred pounds in the bank besides theres the lease of the shop for two years and its contents lucky mr striver and its all left to him i bantered yes sir along with the glass eye i had set my face towards the village but wheeled at the last word why the dickens did she leave him the glass eye goodness only knows mr vance but leave it she did mr strivers quite annoyed he hasnt got it and intends to offer a reward for it hell have to find the guilty person first i said grimly the whitecloaked lady sir i winced she may not be the guilty person after all there there i went on hastily as giles showed a disposition to argue i know nothing more about the matter than you dothis was an absolutely necessary white lie considering the circumstancesbut tell me mr giles does this young man know why his aunt valued her glass eye so greatly no sir he told me that he couldnt guess why it was left to him he is all on fire to find out and that is why he intends to offer the reward at present hes in the shop looking over things does he intend to give up his gardening and turn shopkeeper i asked i dont know sir nothing has been settled but he returns to burwainso he told methis evening im going to murchester myself sir on an errand for the wife so if you will excuse me one moment giles has anything fresh been discovered no sir and you mark my words sir nothing more ever will be discovered the woman in the white cloak has vanished entirely glass eye and all you are taking an interest in the case mr vance can you wonder at it seeing how i am mixed up in the business i want to solve the mystery if i can out of sheer curiosity heres my address mr giles i hastily scribbled it on a card and if you hear of anything new let me know at once giles took the pasteboard and promised faithfully to keep his ears and eyes open and his mind on the alert then he moved away down the road to murchester with a parting advice that i should inspect the grave its a pretty grave said giles cheerfully with a lovely view but i did not go to look at the grave or at the view which the corpsei presumewas supposed by giles to appreciate for it struck me that striver being in the corner shop it would be an excellent opportunity for me to gain possession of the photograph i therefore turned back and in a few minutes was knocking smartly at the closed door shortly it was thrown open and on the threshold appeared one of the handsomest young men i had ever seen there were signs of good breeding about him also and in his navyblue serge with a tweed cap and brown bootsrather an odd dress for a funeral i thoughthe looked less like a gardener and more like a smart city clerk and yet in his bearing there was a smack of the westend mr joseph striver was moderately tall and perfectly madeslim in figure with the alert poise of an athlete his hands and feet certainly betrayed the plebeian but no one could deny the beauty of his cleanshaven face i say beauty advisedly although it is an odd adjective to apply to a man it was a greek face and a greek head cleancut and virile of the fair golden saxon type yet more intellectual than the same generally is a fashionable lady might have envied his transparent complexion his blue eyes and the curve of his lips his form also was irreproachable and his small head set proudly on the white column of his throat possessed a snakelike grace on the whole mrs caldershaws heir was a singularly handsome young fellow and with her small fortune added to his personal advantages would be certain to succeed in life it seemed quite a pity that so splendid a youth should be a mere gardener yet the employment is eminently respectable since father adam originally took up the profession he looked inquiringly at me so i opened the conversation my name is vance mr striver and oh he interrupted in a very pleasant and somewhat cultured voice you are the gentleman who gave evidence at the inquest come in please he stepped aside to let me past i am very glad to see you as i wish to ask you some questions i proceeded him into the shop while he closed the door i said all i had to say at the inquest i answered quickly i read all about it in the papers mr vance you did not come to the inquest then no you might have guessed that seeing you were present i only came over to the funeral when i heard that my aunt had left me her moneynot in very appropriate clothes i fear though but i had no time to get an outfit you see now i am looking into things we were in the back room by this time and a heap of letters and papers lay untidily on the floor miss monks photograph still smiled from the mantelpiece and i stole a glance at it which left me more enthralled than ever you wont mind my going on with my sorting said striver placing a chair for me and dropping on his knees but i want to get things straight before dark as i have to return to burwain for a few days he was so amazingly cheerful that i could not help saying so he looked up smiling you cant expect a poor man who has come in for money to be miserable said striver with much truth besides my aunt never did care for me and i was quite surprised to learn that i was her heir had we been at all attached to one another i should have come to the inquest and even before seeing she met with so dreadful a death but there wasnt much love lost between us mr vance so only as her heir did i come to the funeral i cant pretend to feel very sorry that sounds rather heartless seeing how you have benefited by her death striver shrugged i daresay but i never was a hypocrite put yourself in my place if a disagreeable old woman left you the money she could no longer use would you break your heart i laughed no i cant say that i would very well then he reiterated coolly put yourself in my place im sorry of course as i would be for any human being who was murdered otherwise he shrugged again well theres no more to be said there came a pause i believe you hinted that you wished to ask me some questions striver straightened himself well yes have you any idea who murdered my unfortunate aunt not in the least what about the lady in the white cloak appearances are against her all the same she may be innocent the young mans blue eyes flashed like sapphires i doubt that else why should she run off with your motor car and lock you in well i drawled not very sure of my ground she may have found your aunt dead and in a fright oh that wont wash he interrupted in a somewhat common way you swore at the inquest that you were attracted into this room by a groan from my aunt in which case she could not have been dead when this lady went up the stairs that is true i admitted but i dont hold a brief for the escaped lady remember you speak as though you did he retorted and went on with his sorting has anything been heard of her nothing i found my motor car in the field but the lady has vanished dont you think striver raised himself up to ask this question that she could be traced by means of that white cloak i shrugged in my turn and fenced as i was not going to admit the truth i daresay the cloak was noticeable enough all the same she has not been traced now she never will be i should not be surprised if the police gave up the case the young man rose quickly no he said promptly i intend to offer a reward ah you wish to have this lady hanged if she is guilty why not he asked bluntly but if you will have the truth mr vance i dont care either one way or the other about a possible hanging i want to find the glass eye and you think the lady has it iii suppose so he muttered in a hesitating manner then burst out yes indeed i do want to find the glass eye theres a fortune connected with it mr vancea large fortune oh i could not help betraying surprise so this was why mrs caldershaw attached such value to it exactly in some wayi dont exactly know howthat eye reveals the whereabouts of the fortune i speak of humph do you mean to say that mrs caldershaw concealed her money and concealed its whereabouts in her glass eye yes i do in a way that is this fortune does not consist of my aunts savings i have those and the shop also but when she lived at burwain she talked of a large fortunesome fifty thousand pounds she mentioned on one occasionwhich was concealed somewhere whose fortune was it i cant say but my father her brotherhes dead nowwas always bothering her about the money she never would tell him anything but said that when she died he could learn all he wanted to know from the glass eye as my father has passed over of course the glass eye along with the money comes to methe fortune also fifty thousand pounds he raised his arms with an ecstatic expression what couldnt i do with such a heap of coin mr vance why i could marry he halted cast an uneasy look on me and again began to sort the letters oh youre in love i said smiling a man of my age is always in love he remarked curtly but never mind about that i want to find some clue to the glass eye and he tossed over the papers feverishly to its whereabouts no i know that much the person who murdered my aunt has the eye and killed her for the sake of learning the secret but my aunt may have left some letter or paper or description saying how the eye can reveal the whereabouts of the fifty thousand pounds can you imagine he sat back on his hams how the eye can be the clue no i said after a pause unless there is a piece of paper hidden in it oh thats impossible do you know what a glass eye is like well no i have never seen one unless fixed in a persons head striver laughed i had the same idea about a piece of paper he explained carefully and went to an optician in tarhaven to examine an eye i suppose you thinkas i didthat an artificial eye is the shape and size and the fatness of an almond something like that i admitted with the paper enclosed within striver laughed again its shaped exactly like a small seashell simply a curve of thin glass convex and concave and fits into the socket like aawhat shall i saylike a cuppingglass humph in that case it would be impossible to conceal a piece of paper behind it without damage of course taking also into consideration the smallness of the eye the only thing i can think of he added half to himself is that there is a plan or some writing on the back part which reveals the whereabouts of this money but theres no space to write in i objected considerably interested why not writing done with a magnifyingglass you know i have seen the lords prayer written on a sixpence i nodded there may be something in what you say i admitted and as it appears that mrs caldershaw was murdered for the sake of the eye it must have some value perhaps i added with a brilliant afterthought she hid a diamond behind it it would have to be a very large diamond to bring in fifty thousand pounds said striver seriously no i believe that the eye is simply a clue to this treasure treasure well money jewels gold banknotes what not all i know is that my aunt certainly mentioned fifty thousand pounds to my father why didnt she secure the treasure herself perhaps she did and has buried it somewhere well never mind he turned over the papers again come what may i must find the eye you wont find it there i said rising to take my leave and with one eye on miss monks photograph better get the police to trace the whitecloaked lady since you believe she has taken it i dont see who else could have committed the murder and have stolen the glass eye said striver decisively in one way or another she must be found somehow and then then she must deliver up the glass eye and be hanged i dont want to go so far as that he muttered nervously of course she is a woman and being so is clever enough not to be caught i daresay she will learn the secret of mrs caldershaw procure the fortune and bolt to america i moved towards the door and striver straightened himself to show me out then with an apparent afterthought i drew his attention to the smiling face of miss monk i admire that said i pointing the effect was somewhat unexpected why he asked roughly and flushed scarlet through his fair skin looking more handsome than ever why i stared at him in surprise why not you should ask it is a very lovely face and i admire it as a work of art oh as a work of art thats all right he retorted quickly but it happens to be the photograph of a real person miss gertrude monk how do you know that demanded the young man again flushing angrily miss destiny told me that the photograph was one of her niece i suppose mr striver you would not mind my buying it ill see you hanged first he retorted vehemently and clenched his fists what is miss monk to you i have never met her mr striver so calm yourself but you display such heat at my apparently simple question that i must ask what is she to you striver stared at me and his eyes were as hard as a piece of jade i love her he said defiantly i was taken aback by this statement and flushed in my turn making the not very polite reply nonsense and why nonsense shouted striver who had by this time completely lost his temper how dare you say that even though i am a gardener i have the feelings of a human being but your difference in rank i exclaimed hotly love levels all ranks indeed then i take it that miss monk favors your suit mind your own business mr vance i intend to make it my business i snapped now as angry as he was for it did seem ridiculous that this claud melnotte handsome as he was should aspire to the apple on the topmost bough youre talking damned rot and damned insolence if you have never seen miss monk you cant possibly be in love with her he raged furiously i said nothing about love but that photograph took my fancy and i wish to buy it if possible striver snatched the photograph silver frame and all off the mantelpiece to cram it roughly into his pocket there he cried vehemently thats all youll ever see of it then i must seek out the original said i walking into the shop he was after me in a moment if you dare to come interfering he growled in a voice thick with passion ill break your neck that is easier said than done i jeered now being content that the young man was my rival and a dangerous one at that let me pass striver paused irresolutely then did as he was asked i left the shop leisurely and glanced back when some distance down the road mr joseph striver drew the photograph out of his pocket and insolently kissed it apparently to intimate that i was odd man out chapter vii a friend in need i returned to murchester rather annoyed to find that i had a rival even though he was but a gardener there was no denying that the fellow was uncommonly handsome and thus might captivate the affections of a woman above him in stations as i have said before i can lay no claim to good looks so if miss monk was a young lady whose heart was in her eye as the saying goes i stood rather a poor chance certainly striver while professing that he loved her had not ventured to say that there was any response to his daring still for all i knew the romance might be a reversal of king cophetua and the beggarmaid in which not unlikely case a journey to burwain would certainly destroy my peace of mind if i loved the picture of the goddess how much more would i love the goddess herself when she became flesh and blood to my hungry eyes when searching for an adventure i had not counted upon this entanglement however on reflection i did not see why i should not stand as good a chance as the gardener he assuredly was betterlooking and younger possessing a certain amount of money if not a man of any exalted rank i was a gentleman in the prime of life and well on the way to make a comfortable income if not exactly a fortune also i possessed a recognised position as a rising dramatist and i had a large circle of pleasant welltodo friends to whom i could introduce my wife so i made up my mind to stick to my guns or in other words to see miss monk and learn how the land lay of course if she loved young striver there was nothing more to be said but if she did not and the love was all on his part i could then try my luck and at this point i recalled the memory of that infernal glass eye if good looks did not tempt the lady fifty thousand pounds might do so and should striver become possessed of the glass eye he stood a remarkably good chance of securing that fortune so far we were equal for i knew as much about the case as he did nay i knew more since i had found the famous cloak with the initial embroidery i wondered whether it would be better to tell miss monk nothing about my discovery or dare the utmost and show her that she was in my power she certainly was as the mere production of the cloak would result in her arrest with regard to possession of the goddess i was therefore in a stronger position that mr striver and yet i did not see how i could make use of the weapon i had in my hand a man could not very well force a lady to marry him because he could hang her if she did not moreover she might be able to exonerate herself completely although i did not see how and then would scornfully refuse to have anything more to do withlet me put it plainlysuch a blackmailing ruffian no come what might i decided to play the game fair not only that but i decided to use my information as best i could to protect miss monk from the gardener in making inquiries he might possibly chance upon a clue which would reveal the fact that miss monk was the heroine of the missing motor car in that case it might be that he would use his knowledge to insist upon the unequal marriage i could then intervenei did not see very plainly at the moment to what purposebut at any rate i could offer myself as the ladys champion but thenhere was the crux of the matterfor all i knew miss monk might be as much in love with striver as he apparently was with her only a visit to burwain and a personal interview with my goddess would prove the truth of that then another thing occurred to me while i slowly dressed for dinner if miss monk had stolen the motor car and had locked me in the back room along with the dead mrs caldershaw she must necessarily be the possessor of the glass eye on the face of it she appeared to be guilty but i could not bring myself to condemn her yet she could scarcely have the glass eye unless she had murdered her old nurse with that damned hatpin which was so grave a proof that the assassin was a woman but the eye was the clue to some concealed treasurethis appeared to be plain enough from what striver had said of his late aunts babbleso if miss monk became unexpectedly wealthy it would prove that she was a thief if not a murderess it seemed to be that there was nothing to be done but to take up my abode in burwain meet the lady if possible and then play a waiting game whether mr striver or his masters daughter got the fifty thousand pounds her guilt would be manifest since he could only get the glass eye from her to learn the clue to the treasure and if she had the glass eye she must have no no no i said aloud at this point and startled canningtons servant who was valeting me its nothing johnston i said and went on mentally with my defence of miss monk although i could not deduce a single particle of evidence in her favor she cant be guilty my thoughts ran furiously she is much too lovely to be guilty there must be some mistake she undoubtedly will be able to explain and yetand yetoh hang it ill not decide the question either one way or the other until i see her this being settled so faralthough i unsettled my mind again and again through the long nighti went to mess and made a pretence of eating cannington and his friend had not yet returned which made me believe that the two featherheads had smashed my car if so it was a great nuisance as i wanted the rippler to drive over to burwain on the morrow however the two arrived about midnight with a long account of a police trap which had detained them and i went off to bed leaving them to their supper cannington came to my bedside to relate his london adventures but i used such bad language that he retreated promptly next morning i departed immediately after breakfast more puzzled than ever over the problem i was setting out to solve had miss monk the glass eye if so was she guilty if she had not the glass eye who had did she love joseph striver would he find the glass eye and consequently the fortune if he did would he marry miss monk etc etc etc my brain was an absolute chaos well goodbye old chap said cannington taking leave and looking very spic and span in his uniform tell me all about it in london tell you what i may not mention her name he said and winked solemnly dont be an ass i retorted leaning down to whisper things are much more serious than you guess what have you learned anything about shut up when i return from burwain to town i may need your assistance right oh said cannington looking grave for he saw i was in deadly earnest and dont tell anyone where i am going no youre supposed to be on your way to london but i say oh i cant stop to chatter hold your tongue and wait until i see you again boy understand yes that is he would have detained me for i had very cruelly perhaps raised his curiosity immensely but i gave the steeringwheel a twist and the machinery being in motion glided away before he could ask further questions i glanced back to see him shake his fist at me and then spun rapidly through the gritty square of the barracks down the road into the street and finally emerged through a steep lane into the country proper a long smooth roman road without twists or turns lay before me and as there was no policeman in sight i let the rippler go up to her full speed of forty miles an hour the motion somewhat relieved my mind which was considerably worried i wondered if i was held up for exceeding the speed limit and if my second portmanteau was examined what the police would say i knew very well what they would do that is lodge me in the nearest jail as an accomplice of the lady in the white cloak fortunately the luck held and i got through safely i cant say that my drive was overpleasant as the rain came on just after i left murchester and it poured steadily throughout the day then as the wheels would not bite in particularly soaked and slippery places the car skidded considerably also the gear jammed on two occasions and once i ran short of petrol never was there such a series of accidents and my temper was none of the best when i struck tarhaven here i halted for luncheon and went to the postoffice to see if any letters awaited me i found only one from my agent but as that contained two weeks fees for my new melodrama it proved to be most acceptable a visit to the haberdashers took up some of my time and it was late in the afternoon when i turned the rippler in the direction of burwain however the distance from tarhaven was but a short one and i soon slowed down before the one hotel of the village i call it an hotel but it was really a tumbledown inn quaint oldfashioned and comfortable with a robin redbreast for its sign burwain is an isolated little place lying low in a hollow depression of the land some distance from the sea on its outskirts the road ran through levels of stunted shrubs not big enough to be called trees and there were also tall hedges which muffled the village as though it were wrapped in cottonwool by reason of this the place is stuffy and the air seems to be twice breathed the streets stretch to the four quarters in the form of a crooked cross and there was a tolerably wide green in the centre which is faced by the robin redbreast inn i pulled up and jumped out to meet the landlady in the passage and receive a great surprise cuckoo i said halting in much astonishment well im blest mrs gilfin now master cyrus said the old lady as amazed as i was well well to think that you of all gentlemen should come here its fate said i for i knew that from mrs gilfin if anyone i could obtain all necessary news unless she had changed her gossiping habits which i did not think at all likely still exclaiming at our unexpected meeting mrs gilfin led the way to a small sittingroom and we faced one another to talk over the past mrs gilfin had been my mothers cook when i was a schoolboy and then we had been the greatest of friends as a child i had always called her cuckoo from some dim association with her employment and many a time had i been indebted to her for titbits when the home was broken up she had vanished into the unknown but now reappeared in the character of a married woman and the landlady of this oldworld inn she was a fat little woman with a puddingface who wore spectacles behind which sharp little pigs eyes twinkled knowingly in old days she had always been a great talker and did not seemed to have changed in this respect a cause of rejoicing to me since i hoped to learn all i could about miss monk and her dead nurse what brought you to burwain master cyrus asked mrs gilfin when we had complimented each other on the gentle way in which time had dealt with our looks i had already arranged what to say as if i wanted mrs gilfins assistance it was necessary to take her in some degree into my confidence moreover i knew of old that she was a very worthy and silentwhen it suited herwoman love brings me here cuckoo i replied and love will keep me here for at least a week if not longer so give me a sittingroom and a bedroom and recall the special dishes i like dont ask questions just yet i shall tell you all when i have had dinner but just now i am much too hungry to talk have you been long here i asked contradicting my last assertion ten years master cyrus first as cook and afterwards as mistress my husband had this inn from his father but was letting it go to wreck and ruin when i arrived owing to his being fat so he married me so that i could look after it i would only stay when i saw the weddingring owing to his being fat i questioned rather puzzled come master cyrus and see said mrs gilfin and led me into a lowceiling bar of the dickens epoch all whitewash and smoky oaken beams here i beheld a prehistoric inglenook in which was placed a capacious armchair and in it was seated the fattest man i had ever set eyes on he smoked a churchwarden pipe and drank beer from a huge tankard placed on a small table beside him this is my husband said mrs gilfin and introduced me mr gilfin who smoked with his eyes closed opened them sleepily glad to see you sir i hope youll be comfortable the missus will look after you its fine weather for this time of the year although i aint been out to see and having made these original remarks he closed his eyes again and pulled at his pipe a large mass of adipose contented and purely animal he doesnt talk much explained mrs gilfin beaming through her spectacles on her daniel lambert but folk come for miles to see his size he dont go out of doors either master cyrus but sits there smoking and eating and drinking so as to keep himself in good condition to be a draw to be a draw i echoed while mr gilfin blinked drowsily customers come to look at him and wish they were like him master cyrus i look after things but john is the attraction the burly beast of burwain they call him and though it aint polite it makes people curious to call and you can see master cyrus added mrs gilfin as she left her husband to his pipe and beer how the inn with such a man was going to wreck and ruin it was a good job he married me not but what im thankful to be the mistress of the robin redbreast its poor work being a cook at my age and under mistresses who dont know their place aint in the kitchen your poor dear ma now master cyrus always stopped in the doringroom as a lady should i assented as there was little use in arguing with mrs gilfin whoas i knew of oldalways had an answer to the most pertinent objections although not so fat as her spouse she was still very stout and her looks along with those of john said a good deal for the style of living obtainable at the inn i engaged the sittingroom in which we had our first conversation and a bedroom immediately over head then i had my traps taken into the house and having stowed away the rippler in a convenient outhouse sat down to besiege burwain in due form after dinnerand a very good dinner it was tooi told mrs gilfin as much as i thought necessary which did not include any reference to the discovery of the cloak dear dear said mrs gilfin who had frequently raised her fat hands at intervals during my narrative to think of the young gentleman who was so fond of my custards being in love and with miss gertrude of all young ladies well shes the beauty of the world and no mistake master cyrus so i thought from the photograph cuckoo by the way did you not know this poor woman who was murdered do i know the nose on my face asked mrs gilfin severely of course i knew her well when she was housekeeper to mr miser monk miser monkyou mean gabriel monk no i dont master cyrus if youll excuse me for contradicting you gabriel he was christened i daresay but miser he was called by them who knew how he hoarded up money he was a genuine miser then genuine mrs gilfins fat hands flew up and her pigs eyes twinkled he would skin a flea for its hide and squeeze blood out of a stone and take the trousers off a highlandman master cyrus a nasty stooping lean old man with a blackvelvet skullcap and a stick and a suit of clothes you wouldnt have picked up off the dunghill of good family too added mrs gilfin nodding until her capribbons quivered the monks are an old essex family who used to own burwain and all the land from gattlingsands to tarhaven but they came down in the world and only the lodge remained to mr miser monk as his father was a spendthrift and scattered everything but the miser invested what was left master cyrus and i believe had an income of five hundred golden pounds a year although he never spent a penny of it he never repaired the lodge or attended to the garden or gave a farthing to the poor but saved and saved as he lived for eighty years master cyrus you may guess that his savings came to a pretty penny he died five years ago when anne caldershaw took her savings and herself to live at mootley what became of his money i asked anxiously ask me something i know master cyrus the lodge and the few acres round it and the five hundred a year which was so tied up that it couldnt be touched went to mr walter monk miss destiny didnt like that though why she should have expected to be remembered in the will when she was only mr miser monks brothers sisterinlaw i cant make out she lived with mr monk didnt she mrs gilfin nodded for years and years and so got into his misery habits ah said i recalling certain traits of the little old lady at mootley so i should imagine miss monk lived with her uncle also it seems mrs gilfin nodded again mr miser monk loved his niece she was the only person he ever loved mr walter monk was always away as he is now and being a widower there was no one to look after the child mr miser monk took miss gertrude to live with him when she was quite a baby and asked miss destiny to come to him also anne looked after the house and the four lived together in that tumbledown old place like rats in a cheese if miss gertrude hadnt gone for years to a boardingschool at hampstead and got good food there she never would have grown into the handsome young lady she is ah i exclaimed greatly interested then she is handsome as paint master cyrus and the sweetest young lady you ever met takes after her pa she does who is nice enough though hes selfish i dont deny in what way why said mrs gilfin casting about in her mind for an explanation hes hardly ever at home being always in london on business he says though i think hes too lazy to do much especially added mrs gilfin with emphasis as he has five hundred a year sure but he only comes down here once in a blue moon as you might say and leaves that poor young lady to live the life of a nun at the lodge along with one servant to do all the housework why doesnt miss destiny continue to live with her niece i asked ah mrs gilfin nodded vigorously shed be glad to do so as being a miser like the late mr gabriel monk it would save her living expenses but the fact is master cyrus that miss destiny dont like miss gertrude and miss gertrude dont like miss destiny nor does mr walter monk for the matter of that the five hundred a year being left to him is a sore point with miss destiny so she cleared out when mr miser monk died and now lives at the end of the village in a small cottage along with that halfmad creature lucinda tyke she picked up in the rochford workhouse and dont pay no wages to i was playing with the poker as mrs gilfin spoke then i take it that mr walter monk has five hundred a year and no more except the lodge and the three or four acres round about master cyrus he spends most of the money on himself too and miss gertrude has enough to do to make both ends meet though from her looks she should be a queen and sit on a throne but if the late mr gabriel monk was a miser what became of his savings ah said mrs gilfin significantly now youre growing hot master cyrus as the children say the will left the money and the property to mr walter monk and the savingshe didnt mention the amountto miss gertrude with her uncles dear love but search as they might they could not find out where the money was hidden and as mr miser monk saved nearly five hundred a year for eighty years more or less he must have hidden away a heap of gold forty thousand pounds i daresay ended mrs gilfin with relish or fifty thousand i mused recalling the sum mentioned by the gardener and beginning to see light have they searched everywhere everywhere echoed mrs gilfin nodding again miss gertrudes an innocent who believes that her pas an angel which he aint though nice enough in his ways shed give him her head if he asked her and never complains of him keeping her short and being always away spending his five hundred a year he knew if he found his brothers savingsforty thousand pounds im certain added mrs gilfin decidedly that though lawfully miss gertrudes shed hand them over to him so he turned the house upside down and even dug up the garden to say nothing of searching the meadows he wanted the spending of the money you see master cyrus but they couldnt find even as much as a shilling whats become of all the money no one knows unless mr miser monk gambled and lost he certainly went up to london every now and then mused the landlady and them old men cant be trusted any more than the young ones saving your presence master cyrus but there it is sir she spread out her pudgy hands and shrugged her fat shoulders plenty of money belonging to that poor young lady hidden away and she with scarcely enough to dress on let alone keep the bread in her mouth though to be sure she hasnt got to pay rent and her pa gives the servant her wages regular ah mrs gilfin sighed and such a beauty i wonder she aint been married ages ago does her father love her yes and no he loves her when she dont cross his path and thinks her a bother when she do some times he takes her to london for a treat being free with his money when he spends it on himself he got her picture taken by a swell photographer once but i daresay that was to show her to one of his rich friends and get her married off well so that he could live on his soninlaw that must have been one of the photographs i saw on the mantlepiece in the mootley corner shop i exclaimed like enough master cyrus and i daresay her pa gave her the silver frame when he was feeling generouslike as he do on occasions queer said mrs gilfin rubbing her nose one brother a miser and the other taking after his father is a spendthrift luckily the five hundred a years so tied up that he cant get at the principal and it comes to miss gertrude when her pa joins mr miser monk in the graveyard so shes all right the dear sweet young lady she is have you ever seen the photograph cuckoo oh yes master cyrus mr joseph strivers got one begged it off her and she being an angel gave it to him though hes only the gardener does she love him i asked tremulously no she dont said mrs gilfin shortly does he love her i persisted he do the impertinence him only being a gardener though handsome i will say mr walter monk dont pay him much for gardening at the lodge yet he stays on there because he loves miss gertrude as if shed look on such dirt as anne caldershaws nephew his father left him with fifty pounds a year so thats why he can afford to stop on and now i hear hes come in for money from his aunt but if he dares to raise his eyes to miss gertrude master cyrus you break his neck advised mrs gilfin but if she loves him how can she when he aint a gentleman born snapped mrs gilfin she dont love anybody but a dog she have and lives in that shabby old house like a nun in a convent or a toad in a stone where the young mens eyes are i dont know ended mrs gilfin virtuously indignant my spirits rose as she spoke im glad shes fancy free i said rejoicingly theres a chance for me then you being welllooking i should think so master cyrus said mrs gilfin chapter viii the beauty of the world i usually invent my plots arrange my business and consider my circumstances when in bed which is by far the best place for such thoughtwork alone in the darkness of the silent hours there is no external influence to prevent concentration therefore conclusions of the best can be reached speedier than in the daytime on the night of my arrival at burwain i took advantage of the opportunity to think hard and long it was necessary that matters should be adjusted clearly in my own mind before i could hope to deal with the situation after mrs gilfins report i desired more than ever to make gertrude monk my wife but there were obstacles in the way which only deliberate and continuous action could remove a clear understanding of the position was decidedly imperative i now began to see that anne caldershaws hint to her brother had reference to the missing monies of gabriel monk certainly even if he had saved every penny of his income for eighty years he would not have accumulated fifty thousand pounds but it was more than probable that his visits to london were connected with various investments and that in one way or another he had gained the fortune mentioned by mrs caldershaw butas i asked myself frequentlyif monk had invested the money why was it not discoverable since investments cannot very well be concealed on reflection i decided that the man being a genuine miser loving the color and weight and feel of gold had probably turned his investments whatever they might be into hard cash and had hidden this carefully away in some way mrs caldershaw had learned the whereabouts of the specie and the missing eye indicated the hidingplace the money by gabriel monks will belonged to gertrude monk but the exhousekeeper wished her nephew to get it and so had left him the clue to the place where it was concealed perhaps she knew that striver loved her young mistress and thought that if he married her after acquiring the fortune that justice would be done she wished as the saying is to kill two birds with one stone but two things puzzled me greatly in connection with the matter in the first place it was odd that mrs caldershaw aware of the whereabouts of the money should not have laid hands on it and in the second it was difficult to understand how she could arrange that her glass eye should be a clue to its possession then i began to believe that the dead woman had removed the coin from where the miser had hidden it and had drawn a plan of its new restingplace which she had concealed behind the eye but having regard to the shelllike shape of the eye as described by joseph striver the plan could not be delineated on a piece of paper however small as there was no shield at the back of the artificial eyes to protect it from wear and tear the plan i fancied as did mr striver was drawn on the inward curve of the eye itself although it was difficult to imagine that the details had not been obliterated by the moisture of the flesh but this last conjecture was for the moment beside the matter what i knew was that mrs caldershaws glass eye indicated the whereabouts of fifty thousand pounds belonging by will to gertrude monk to find that treasure and marry the girl was what i determined to do and to manage this it was necessary to prevent the fortune from falling into strivers hands by getting the glass eye into my own possession that was no easy task on account of the obscurity which involved the murder and the theft which had led to the murder of course gertrude monk knew that she was legally entitled to her uncles money so it was possible that having learned mrs caldershaws secret she had gone to mootley to insist upon the eye being given up for the purpose of obtaining her rights but in that case she would scarcely have murdered the woman since all she had to do was to compel mrs caldershaw by law to confess the truth it might be that she had quarrelled with the old woman who would not be inclined to disarrange her plans for the wellbeing of her nephew but i did not think that a girl with so lovely a face and so high a characteras mrs gilfin avouched forwould have stooped to committing a crime had she done so and had obtained the money her conscience would not permit her to rest therefore i acquitted the young lady of homicide and cast about in my mind to think who could possibly have slain mrs caldershaw for the sake of the fortune miss destiny certainly grudged her niece the money and being a miser would have been glad to acquire it but she was too frail a little woman to commit the murder also at the time she was driving to mootley and had not yet reached the place as the story of her encounter with my looted motor car clearly proved she had established an indefeasible alibi mr walter monk was in london at the time of the murder mr joseph striver was at burwain and i could think of no other person who would be driven to murder mrs caldershaw for her secret the more i thought of the matter the more complex did it become all i could doi decided this about three oclock in the morningwas to revert to my original decision and play a waiting game then i fell asleep and woke at nine oclock with a headache the result of overthinking however a cold bath a good breakfast and a halfhours gossip with the landlady banished my pains and somewhere about eleven i walked forth to spy out the land i wished to call on miss destiny and through her to gain an introduction to her niece once in touch with miss monk i might learn in some cautious way how her cloak came to be in the field certainly on the fact of it i fancied she had worn it herself and had stolen my rippler but it was just possible that she had given it to mrs caldershaw and had not been near mootley at all in which case i began to wonder more than ever who was the clever woman who had taken possession of it but such wondering was futile as i had no certain facts to go upon gertrude monk alone could give the clue seeing that the cloak whether worn by herself or not was her property there was little difficulty in finding the abode of miss destiny who appeared to be as wellknown in burwain as st pauls cathedral is in the metropolis her miserly character appeared to be common talk and when i reached the end of the village and sighted her cottage i could well understand why it was no secret a gentlewoman with a certain amount of money however small would never have dwelt in such a hovel unless she grudged every farthing to render it sightly and comfortable for miss destiny had her abode in a tiny house of galvanized tin standing some distance from the main road and almost hidden by a dank growth of tall weeds and shrubs and neglected trees a sod fence fringed the roadway and therein was placed midway a rickety wooden gate with a broken hinge from this a crooked pathway made by feet and worn by feet and preserved as an entrance by feet meandered to the greenpainted front door on either side docks and darnells and brambles and coarse grasses and weeds flourished in profusion breasthigh and overhanging the tin shedit could scarcely be called a cottagewere two gigantic elms which dropped their decayed branches on the roof and round the walls where they lay to add to the sordid confusion of the place viewing this desolation i could only think of the chateau of the yellow dwarf as described by madame daulnoy i walked up the sodden paththe tin shed seemed to have been built in a swamp so oozy was the groundand rapped smartly at the narrow front door on either side were two small windows through the glass of which i caught a glimpse of iron bars which proved that miss destiny had made necessary provision against burglars what struck me as odd was the absence of a chimney but i had no time to consider this for shortly i heard the rattle of a chain and the sound of bolts being drawn back then the door was opened an inch or two to reveal the dull eyes and mustached lip of lucinda the expression of her face was aggressive and watchful what do you want she demanded in her beautiful voice which struck me anew as singularly sympathetic despite her rough greeting i am mr cyrus vance who was at mootley i explained elaborately and i wish to see miss destiny before i ended my request i heard a little low fluttering laugh and lucinda opening the door widely moved aside to show the tiny figure of her mistress with outstretched hands prince charming come in search of the sleeping beauty cried miss destiny romantically and all because he saw a portrait of the lady come in mr vance come in i can promise you flesh and blood this time my dear adventurer there was little change about the old lady she still wore the threadbare black silk dress though without the velvet mantle and her snowwhite hair was still piled up after the fashion of louis xvis illfated queen i thrilled when i heard her words as i guessed that i had arrived in a happy moment and that miss destinys niece the goddess of my dreams was seated within that pauper house even lucinda grinned in a friendly way as she saw the color come and go in my face with all my selfcontrol i could not suppress that sign of emotion prince charming said miss destiny introducing me directly into a bare sittingroom for there was no passage in the cottage yet me present you to the sleeping beauty and she looked more like a fairy godmother than ever as she clapped her skinny hands gertrude monk was seated in a wellworn horsehair armchair near the oil stove which did duty as a fireplace to warm the bleak room she was plainly dressed in blue serge with a toque of the same on her dark head and had a muff and boa of silverfox fur nothing could have been more puritanic than her array but the closefitting frock showed off her fine figure to advantage and she looked uncommonly handsome i have already described her from her photograph so there is no need to go over old ground but she was even more beautiful and unapproachable than i had believed her to be and looked more like the goddess diana than ever the sole thing i found lacking to complete her perfection was color for her face was the hue of old ivory and even her lips looked pale also there was a troubled look in her large dark eyes and she welcomed me with some embarrassment but this last probably was due to the oddity of our introduction since miss destiny had evidently informed her of my admiration for her portrait i am glad to meet you mr vance she said sedately and with a stately bow of her head my aunt informed me of your connection with the sad death of my old nurse i think my connection with the matter is public property miss monk i said nervously for my name has been in all the papers as a playwright that should please you she said coldly anything for an advertisement well tell us what has been discovered nothing as far as i know miss monk oh she raised her fine eyebrows i understood she glanced at miss destiny that you promised to come and inform my aunt of any new developments as you are here i thought that something had been discovered nothing has been discovered miss monk i simply came here to see an old servant of my mothers who keeps the robin redbreast and intend to stay for a few days of course this was a white lie but i had to make some excuse for her troubled eyes were searching my face intently mrs gilfin said she a smile relaxing the corners of her mouth and heaving what i took to be a sigh of relief i am fond of mrs gilfin and she is fond of you miss monk had she never spoken to you about me no was the reply so my artful question failed in its effect then the conversation languished and miss destiny babbled to excuse her lack of hospitality lucinda had left the room i should give you a cup of tea gertrude and you also mr vance but the kettle is not boiling and the baker has not come so you must excuse me i am not hungry thank you miss destiny what a comfortable little place you have here in my desperate desire to propitiate the little woman i told a lie and miss monk saw that i did for her lip curled so contemptuously that the color came to my cheeks i had been undiplomatic for the word i had used did not apply in the least to the bare surroundings the shedit had originally been a shed as i afterwards learnedwas divided by frail partitions into four small rooms two bedrooms a kitchen and a parlor these were furnished with the flotsam and jetsam of auction rooms in an insufficient manner if miss destiny had contracted the vice of avarice from the late gabriel monk she had done so very thoroughly the bare wooden walls the drugget on the floor the four or five sticks of shaky furniture and the evilsmelling oil stove made up a picture of insistent penury and miss destiny leanfaced keeneyed and restless looked like the hag poverty herself as she hovered about the bleak room and even she saw through my lying remark comfortable no indeed mr vance she tittered nervously comfort to my mind means laziness and selfindulgence lucinda and i live the simple life and require only the bare necessities of civilization and im so poor her niece intervened coldly is it necessary to inform mr vance of your private business aunt oh my dear he knows it for instance that i am your aunt only by courtesy what do you mean you are my mothers sister yes poor dear jane what a bad marriage she made with that spendthrift aunt aunt leave my father alone my dear i refuse to be contradicted i never liked walter and i never will so i disassociate myself from him in every way as a sisterinlaw and look upon myself as your aunt by courtesy merely by courtesy miss monk rose with a flush this conversation cannot be interesting to mr vance she said quietly if you have any business with him i shall leave you together no no i have no business with him my dear merely i should like to know if annes will really leaves all her property to joseph if you mean mr striver i understand that he had got the money and the lease of the corner shop to say nothing of the contents said i in detail merely i should like to know if annes will really did think anne would have remembered me we were such friends and with a little money i could have made myself more comfortable the garden for instance im sure i live in a kind of jungle gertrude i wish you could let joseph come and put it right then we could talk about his good fortune joseph takes odd jobs at times said miss monk trying to speak calmly for really her aunt was very trying with her unnecessary frankness if you offer him a good wage he will come with pleasure oh i cant afford to pay money said miss destiny hurriedly it is not to be expected especially since gabriel left me nothing ah gertrude you are the lucky one fifty thousand pounds miss destiny smacked her lips oh if it only could be found it is not likely to be found mr striver intends to find it i said incautiously and could have bitten out my tongue the moment afterwards for so crude a remark both the women turned to face me miss destiny with vulturelike eagerness and miss monk with an expression of astonishment what has joseph to do with my money asked the latter pointedly perhaps he doesnt know that it is your money miss monk what do you mean exactly simply that striver is searching for the sum of fiftythousand pounds that being the amount of some money belonging to you which is missing as miss destiny said just now i apprehend that it is the same it must be it must be cried the little old lady clapping her skinny hands for anne never could have saved so much out of her wages gertrude i always declared that anne knew where the money of gabriel was hidden now it seems she told joseph about it she did not inform him of its whereabouts i struck in eager to enlist miss monks attention but he hopes to trace it by means of the glass eye the glass eye echoed miss monk very much amazed i know that anne had a glass eye and that it is missing but i see i understand said miss destiny feverishly dont interrupt me gertrude for i see it all anne always attached a great value to that glass eye so in some wayfrom what mr vance saysit is connected with the hidingplace of gabriels money perhaps gabriel got anne to assist him in hiding it dear me and the eye is missing if it could only be found gertrude you would be quite an heiress i dont believe that the eye or the money will ever be found said miss monk impatiently and walked towards the door are you returning to the village mr vance the hint was unmistakable and i was only too glad to take advantage of it since it meant a ttefte with my goddess mrs gilfin will wonder what has become of me i said glancing at my watch oh dont go dont go implored miss destiny grasping my arm i do so want to learn all about this glass eye and the money ask joseph striver then i replied disengaging myself he knows all that i know and more i ended significantly really and truly oh i must tell lucinda and miss destiny vanished into the back room crying for her handmaid miss monk seized the opportunity to open the front door and slip out raising her eyebrows at me meanwhile i took the hint at once we walked down the meandering path between the weeds and out on to the high road miss monk kept silence for some distance but i was so taken up with admiring her face and was so delighted to be in her presence that i did not mind her lack of speech with compressed lips she stared straight in front of her then spoke abruptly you seem to know a great deal about our family affairs mr vance nothing more than has to do with the murder of mrs caldershaw i replied quietly and i am so mixed up in that yes yes she interrupted impatiently i understand so far but my aunt has been talking to you well yes and no i have not gathered much information from miss destiny why should you wish to gather any information at all asked the girl with some sharpness my dear young lady this murder interests me and i wish to learn the truth naturally i seek for information oh and you have come here to question my aunt no indeed i dont see what she can tell me she can tell you nothing said miss monk with decision my aunt is not quite sane as you can easily see she has a moderately good income yet prefers to live in that miserable place which youshe was sarcastic herecalled comfortable mr vance i wished to put miss destiny in a good humor said i uneasily why she was so very direct that i nearly came out with the truth but it was absurd on the face of it to confess a crazy love for one i had known only half an hour she would take so sudden a declaration as an insult i therefore held my peace and fenced miss destiny from what she said at mootley seems to know something about that glass eye which was stolen from mrs caldershaws head when she was dead i wish to learn all about it so as to discover why the eye was stolen and the woman murdered then you did come here to question my aunt in spite of your denial well if i must confess it i came to ask about the glass eye miss monk walked on in silence and then again spoke abruptly you should be honest with me mr vance i am honest pardon me you are not since you said that you did not see what my aunt could tell you and she looked like an offended goddess this was brutally true i had equivocated i throw myself on your mercy she turned a pair of surprised eyes in my direction why on mine i appear to have offended you i hesitated what does that matter we are strangers i wish we were not said my rash tongue and miss monk stopped i really dont understand you mr vance why should it matter to me whether we are strangers or not your aunts words when she introduced me miss monk flushed and cut me short that is my aunts nonsense she said hastily you dont expect me to believe that you followed me here because you admired my photograph that was exactly what i had done but it did not do to tell her so for she looked more like an offended goddess than ever i came here about the eye was my cautious answer you think that a true knowledge of why anne caldershaw attached a value to that eye would enable you to trace her assassin yes i do think so do you miss monk i spoke with the cloak in my mind do you wish me to trace her assassin why not she should certainly be captured and punished and the eye recovered especially as you seem to think it can indicate where the money left to me by uncle gabriel is hidden she she she i positively gasped of course again she looked surprised i understand from the report in the papers that the woman who ran off with your motor car is the assassin it was with some difficulty that i commanded my voice miss monk i thought must be very sure that she had hidden her trail successfully else she would scarcely dare to speak in this way but of course as i remembered she did not yet know that i had found her cloak you would like to have the woman traced yes she said coolly and the eye recovered if it means the recovery of my money i inherit fifty thousand pounds by i know i know said i hastily mrs gilfin told me miss monks face clouded i daresay she remarked bitterly the story of the missing money is common property no doubt mrs gilfin told you that my uncle gabriel was a miser yes she told me a good deal you asked her questioned the girl suddenly i admit it in the interests of the case of course she said whether ironically or not i could not determine and then walked on in silence shortly we were abreast of a mouldering redbrick wall on the outskirts of the village beyond could be seen the mellowtiled roofs of a large mansion miss monk stopped abruptly i live here she said with some coldness and must go in goodday mr vance she vanished through a heavy green gate and left me staring down the deserted road to me the sun seemed to have vanished from the sky chapter ix gertrudes father hitherto i have explained everything in detail from the time i adventured out to seek romance and found tragedy instead now i must be more or less exact as it is well nigh impossible to set down everything for an indefinite period i lodged at the robin redbreast and met miss monk frequently here there and everywhere the moth had come to the candle and was hovering round the flame with dangerous pertinacity not that the lady accepted me straight away for the most romantic of women have their practical side miss monk at first acquaintance apparently liked me but i puzzled her and she questioned mrs gilfin about me so as to be sure of her ground a very necessary precaution in the face of circumstances you seem to have made quite an impression on that sweet young lady master cyrus said the landlady a day or so after i had visited miss destiny she met me by chance last night and asked me to tell her all about you i hope you gave me a good character said i anxiously and very pleased to think that my interest in diana of the ephesians was reciprocated i told her that you were always the best of boys master cyrus and that fond of my custards as i had always to give you one every day when you was little and sweettoothed i reddened oh nonsense miss monk doesnt wish to hear tales of my childish greed cuckoo she wished to hear everything said mrs gilfin phlegmatically being wonderfully took up with your pleasant ways and i dont blame her said the excook beaming through her spectacles seeing as youre a gentleman grown master cyrus and handsomer than i ever thought youd become not that miss gertrude cares for good looks without good birth and good manners or shed have run off with joseph ages ago is he back i asked starting for i had to reckon with the gardener oh yes hes back grunted mrs gilfin disgusted and always hanging about that house picking weeds so he says but its to look at what hell never get as ill tell him some fine day such sauce he hasnt had the insolence to speak to miss monk on the subject of his confounded feelings i asked anxiously for there was no denying that the mans aggressive good looks constituted him a dangerous rival not he and if he did shed soon send him to the right about with a flea in his ear good looks aint good manners master cyrus say what you will well i laughed i hope you told her that i was the bestmannered and most goodnatured man in the universe cuckoo i told the truth you may be sure master cyrus rebuked mrs gilfin saying you was that honorable and clever and thoughtful and kindhearted as id trust you with my very own heart to do what you liked with not that you want my heart bless you ended mrs gilfin beaming again and becoming one vast substantial smile like mrs fezziwig in the christmas carol you want miss gertrudes good heavens cuckoo you didnt tell her that i hope not in so many words master cyrus but bless you added mrs gilfin significantly women in these matters aint fools sir i was rather perturbed over this as it was not impossible that the maidenly modesty of gertrude might take offence if she guessed my undeclared sentiments and in any case the slightest hint of such an attitude might embarrass our conversation by this time it was useless to deny that i was fathoms deep in love i suppose i had brooded so long over the beauty of the pictured face that when the original proved to be even more attractive the egg of love was promptly hatched into the actual chick from the moment my eyes met those of gertrude and soul read soul i adored her with a headstrong passion which i should have scouted in another man if ever there was an impulsive being who aptly illustrated marlows dictum as to love at first sight i was that uncommon individual for i take it that sudden passions of this unthinking sort are unusual in an age when loversa most unsuitable name for such cautious creatureswish to inspect the ladys checkbook before proposing but i need not have worried my mind over any possible embarrassment on miss monks part she was more composed than i was when we next met and that was in the village store whither i had gone to procure some stationery it was necessary to write cannington and advise him of my actual whereabouts if only to keep him out of the way i did not wish him to come down and spoil my wooing as an inconvenient third besides as a featherheaded boy he might be indiscreet with regard to the mootley murder and i wished to supply all information on that matter by word of mouth it was the sole excuse which i had for seeking the society of my goddess and i did not wish it to be staled by other peoples repetitions while i was purchasing blottingpaper ink and pens and stationery from a genial old woman in a mobcap miss monk entered the shop she was dressed as she had been when i last saw her but this time carried a dogwhip in place of a sunshade gamboling round her was a large ungainly newfoundland yearold puppy who answered to the odd name of puddles at least that was his pet name as miss monk afterwards told me that he was registered as ion after the hero of judge talfourds famous play puddles lounged against me with exuberant friendliness and had to be corrected with the whip when the commotion subsided his mistress found time to speak and apologize looking handsomer than ever with the color of exercise in her cheeks you mustnt mind the dog she said gravely he wont bite you i hope not i replied with equal gravity i am extremely timid you know she smiled at this i think i would trust you in a moment of danger mr vance but to be friends with me you must be friends with puddles i quite understand love me love my dog i didnt say anything about love she laughed her color deepening but in any case you have put the cart before the horse love my dog and love me you should say certainly puddles i dropped on one knee and held out a caressing hand try and love meas a beginning a beginning to what asked miss monk smiling and crimson puddles knows puddles understands see he gives me his paw good dog i shook the huge paw patted the huge head and rose to be conventional it is a beautiful day isnt it miss monk of course and the horse is the noblest of all animals she replied with uplifted eyebrows i thought you were more original mr vance i assure you that is a mistake i am that harmless and necessary person the repeater of platitudes she shuddered dont repeat them to me please i hate copybook phrases yet what good sense they contain your remark about the horse is one and is absolutely true so true she mocked as to make the statement unnecessary she turned to purchase a bag of dogbiscuits are we fighting a verbal duel mr vance it would seem so miss monk but the buttons are on our foils with the bag in her arms she wheeled nervously why do you say that and there was apprehension in her dark eyes i speak for the sake of speaking no her anxious eyes searched my face you are not that kind of man if you she stopped and bit her lip and with a curt nod walked rapidly out of the shop followed by puddles i did not attempt to follow as i saw that my cryptic speech had interested her and wished to give her time to think over my personality while i remained in her thoughts there was every hope that she would seek me again better that she should be afraid of me than indifferent to me and as i sauntered back to the robin redbreast i felt convinced that she was afraid of me my dark sayings had made her afraid at our first meeting under the tin roof of miss destinys hovel i had seen the fear in her eyes and at this second meeting i saw it again more apparent but what could she be afraid of in connection with me there was only one commonsense answer gertrude monk was the lady who had stolen my motorcar and who hadbut no i could not bring myself to believe the worst even in the face of the obvious certainty that she was concealing something which had to do with the weird circumstances at mootley she would explain when the time came and that would be when she was sufficiently well acquainted with me to regard mrs gilfins eulogy as justified thenwell i would wait until then for in the pursuit of the impossible i was developing a fine quality of patience during the next few days i occasionally met miss destiny and her servant in the village they went shopping together and the little old lady beat down the prices of everyone however cheap the goods she wanted might originally be i believe she enjoyed the squabble and certainly her tongue clacked from morning to night in the endeavor to get her own sordid way she was a miser pure and simple and had contracted the diseasefor that it wasfrom the late gabriel monk everyone hated miss destiny for in addition to being avaricious she had a desperately evil tongue and dealt with one and all from the point of view of a misanthrope that is she never said a good word of anyone but babbled out many bad ones so that she set people by the ears constantly she might have abused me for all i knew but if she did her demeanor to my face was extremely pleasant when we met she always hinted roguishly at my love for her niece and chaffed me about the same at times i wondered if she discussed my presence at burwain with gertrude i thought not as my meetings with the goddess were always marked by a perfectly unembarrassed manner on her part moreover aunt and niece did not get on well together and only exchanged formal visits miss destinyas i gathered from mrs gilfins ready tonguehad never forgiven gertrude for inheriting the missing fortune and always expressed herself pleased that it could not be found although i had been over a fortnight at burwain mr walter monk was still absent from the old jacobean mansion and gertrude lived there with one servant in nunlike seclusion she read a great deal and played the piano and attended to puddlesa great standby against loneliness joseph also was frequently about the garden but i dont think she ever gave him a wordon mrs gilfins authority i can say thisunless it had to do with his duties but he hung round the place like a stray dog satisfied if he could catch only a glimpse of gertrude and was in the seventh heaven if she addressed a word to him miss destiny spoke to me of the gardeners infatuation which was apparent to everyone you have met joseph she asked me one day in her mincing manner at mootley when he was setting his aunts house in order i informed her genially i was always genial with miss destiny as for my own purposes i wished to keep on good terms with her ah yes he inherited annes savings quite a nice little sum i believe and the lease of the shop also added miss destiny musingly gertrude might do worse what do you mean i asked sharply and i fear angrily the little old lady raised her twinkling sharp eyes to my annoyed face i forgot she said impishly you are the other one the other what miss destiny loverthe second prince charming though i think she remarked in a very spiteful tone that the first prince is the handsomer i went straight to the point miss destiny i dont for one moment suppose that you would like to see miss monk become strivers wife why not he has looks if not birth and money if not position the things absurd a lady marry a gardener other ladies have done so and have been happy she persisted besides gertrude may not be able to help herself what do you mean by that nothing and everything she replied enigmatically mr striver is in possession of all annes private papers she hesitated well well well i said impatiently ask gertrude she snapped out ask what miss destiny winced and her black eyes twinkled again ask her to be your wife mr vance else you will find her mrs striver before six months are ended now dont ask questions here she pointed to her flat bosom ask them of gertrude again i say joseph has anne caldershaws private papers well i was more bewildered than ever that is all said miss destiny and dropping one of her oldfashioned curtseys she trotted off laughing malignantly like a wicked fairy what the terrible old woman meant i could not imagine but i determined to take her advice and ask questions in the right quarter i had now been some time at burwain and as yet had learned nothing likely to throw light on the darkness of the mootley murder striver evidently had made up his mind to stay where he was as gardener at the lodge and although we never spoke he always eyed me savagely when i paid a visit to the mansion it is true that gertrude did not invite me into the house and always saw me in the garden but that i should dare to come and worship at his private shrine was quite enough to make striver desperately angry and in his working clothes the fellow looked handsomer than ever i really wondered that gertrude did not fall in love with him as he was by way of being a rustic apollo and was possessed of some education but she was always extremely cool to him and scarcely displayed more warmth towards me a most inscrutable girl i could not make her out for try as i would the secret of her nolimetangere attitude baffled and disconcerted me my father is returning for a few days this evening said gertrude to me when we met by chance on the village green i should like to meet him i said promptly why she demanded with her usual directness it was a difficult question to answer i admire his daughter was my lame reply surely you can understand that you are talking nonsense she interrupted quickly yes i can she stopped for a moment then went on impetuously i wish you would go away i see no reason why i should i remonstrated i do i do you are not hot you are not cold you are neither fowl fish nor good redherring go away and turning on her heel she walked away so swiftly that i had no time to ask further questions what did she mean i could not understand later i met with miss destiny and could understand the aunt no more than i understood the niece the first told me to go away in a most peremptory manner while the second hinted that because joseph possessed mrs caldershaws private papers gertrude was likely to become mrs striver within six months it was really all very perplexing and the sole way to end such perplexity was to show miss monk her cloak and demand explanations but this i did not wish to do until i was more certain of my ground until i understood her feelings towards myself better for by this time what with strivers persistence her own dismissal of myself and miss destinys strange hints i was beginning to believe that she favored my handsome humble attentive rival i shant stand it any longer i thought turning my steps towards the inn this very evening i shall call and see her we must have an explanation straight away and this resolution i adhered to so firmly that i found myself at the door of the jacobean mansion one hour after dinnerthat is seeing i dined early in the countryat seven oclock the grounds of the lodgethanks to strivers lovelorn devotionwere most beautifully kept the flowerbeds had no weeds the lawns were smoothly clipped and rolled and the whole place had an orderly trim look which contrasted oddly with the tumbledown appearance of the house itself this of mellow red brick overgrown with ivy stood on a slight rise and a wide terrace of stone with shallow steps descending to the lawns ran round three sides of it some vandal had put french windows into the drawingroom and these looked quite out of keeping with the oldworld air of the mansion it was a very ancient house and i verily believe that only the ivy held the mouldering bricks together the porch was large and chilly and when i pulled the bell its jangling echoes followed by the baying of puddles added to the lonely impression produced by the place miss destiny called her niece the sleeping beauty so this dismal dwelling might well have been her palace only mr strivers trim garden looked modern and wellcared for the house itself was a slight improvement on the ruins of carthage the one servant of the lodgea whitecapped sober sedate old creature called trumblecame to the door and seemed doubtful about admitting me the place was like a convent and evidently trumble did not wish any male to enter but while i argued with her miss monk appeared and intimated that i could come in i would have thanked her but that her beauty took my breath away even in the dim light of the hall lamp she shone like a star but it was not until we were in the drawingroom that the full perfection of her loveliness burst upon me i stared like an oaf or like the misnamed cortez in keatss sonnet she was in a paleblue evening dress which displayed her beautiful neck and arms to perfection as in the photograph she wore no necklace or bracelets or rings or brooches or indeed ornaments of any description the dress also was plain and devoid of trimming so that it revealed fully the noble lines of her figure as usual her hair was bunched at the back of her shapely head in ancient greek fashion and she more than ever reminded me of diana i did not look at a mere picture this time but at the flesh and blood divinity who had descended in gracious splendor from high olympus though indeed her somewhat stern face did not look very gracious at the moment owing to my intention of calling i had arrayed myself in a dress suit for the occasion although i did not usually prepare myself for dinner in this way at the robin redbreast but manlike i had a feeling of vanity that i also was ultracivilized had i come in tweeds i should have been ashamed to face this gracious vision and yet i am not a vain man though as the somewhat unworthy sentiment flashed into my mind i thought what a conceited ass i was and all because i loved a woman and wished to appear at my best before her truly human nature is strange andas in the present personal instancetrifling well asked miss monk a slight smile breaking the severe curve of her lips as she saw how persistently i stared why have you called mr vance is it a crime i asked somewhat annoyed in my eyes it is because i asked you to go away ah i came here to seek for an explanation i have none to give still as you are here you may as well sit down i cannot see you for more than half an hour as my father is returning i sat down on the chair she indicated and she placed herself on the opposite sofa which stretched diagonally before the fire there were three lamps with rosy shades in the large lowceilinged room and we sat in a kind of paphian twilight eminently suited to a proposal what with the subdued light amidst which she glimmered like an exquisite star and my own tumultuous feelings i wonder that i did not take her in my arms then and there to kiss her into consenting to be my dear wife but prudence came to my aid and i was spared the necessity of a refusal which certainly would have been forthcoming had i acted as i felt inclined to do she was silent and i was silent and the only sound in the room was the crackling of the fire and the ticking of the french clock on the mantelpiece then as gertrude did not speak i was forced to begin the conversation else my halfhour would be wasted you puzzle me miss monk i said bluntly and purposely said it so as to enchain her attention do i why your aunt also puzzles me i went on ignoring her question why she asked again and the uneasy troubled look came into her eyes she declares that you will become mrs striver within six months mr vance she rose impulsively and looked highly indignant because i continued remorselessly and repeating miss destinys exact words joseph has anne caldershaws private papers miss monk turned white gasped and sank back nervously into her seat my aunt is mad to say such a thing she stammered possibly said i dryly i have no very great idea of miss destinys sanity myself but it may be that you can explain the madness gertrude looked round the room as if in search of help and placed both hands on her breast as though to still the beating of her heart i would explainto a friend she muttered and her face was whiter than the statue of parian marble on the bracket by the fireplace i am a friend miss monk a true friend test me and find me so i bent over her can you not understand she put out her hand and pushed me back slightly my friendnot yet i retreated friendso cold a word it is sufficient for the present and then i saw that her whiteness was drowned in a rising tide of crimson i would have spoken for a sudden leap of my heart told me that her feelings were not so indifferent as i had imagined them to be but again she put over her hand no say nothing let us remain friends until until when i asked eagerly pressing her hands between her knees she stared into the fire then spoke in a low steady voice i never had a friend either man or woman and i have always wanted one when you came i thoughtit was foolish on my part perhapsbut i thought that you might help me i wish to help you in every way she went on without heeding my impetuous speech i doubted one always doubts a man i asked mrs gilfin about you what she told me confirmed the impression i had gained from your looks i felt certain from many times we have met that mrs gilfin spoke truly you are a man i can trust yes yes but am i a man you can love let it remain as trust for the time being i still had doubts and today i told you to go away why because you said nothing you did nothing you were neither hot norah well remember what i said today when we met i could not make a friend of anyone who was indifferent but now as i see you mean to be my friend i may trust you i need sympathy i need help i needshe started to her feet and held up an anxious finger hark hark not a word to him to him i wondered what she meant until the door opened and a man walked delicately into the room here i am daughterling said the man gaily chapter x a surprise i was decidedly disappointed by the inopportune arrival of mr walter monk his daughter was just about to tell me much that i greatly desired to know and his abrupt entrance had prevented her from speaking freely it was most provoking as i might not easily find her again in a confidential mood however as things were it only remained to accept the situation philosophically so i dismissed the lost opportunity with a shrug and turned to examine the newcomer already he was embracing the girl whom he rather effectedly called daughterling i summed up his character from his use of that exotic word mr monk presented himself as a dapper smallsized man with a cleanshaven face smooth grey hair parted accurately in the middle of his small head and a pincenez which usually concealed two shallow brown eyes on removing an expensive travellingcoat lined with sable he appeared in an admirablycut tweed suit with smart brown shoes darkblue socks and a silk scarf of the same hue knotted neatly under an immaculately white collar he struck me as a lapdog man a dandy a petitmitre too precisely dressed too finickythats the exact wordin his manner too effeminate in his way of speaking there was a suggestion of miss destinys mincing ways in his whole attitude how such a dolllike piece of humanity came to have so tall and stately a daughter was a question i could not answer until it struck me that gertrude might take after her deceased mother then i wondered afresh how such a woman could have married such a manikin i am glad to see you dear said gertrude kissing him in such a motherly way but i did not hear the bell i let myself in by using my latchkey replied mr monk disengaging himself from an embrace which somewhat disarranged his careful attire and this gentleman gerty dear mr vancemr cyrus vance the dramatist how are you mr vance i think mr monk put his finger reflectively to his forehead i think i have heard the name i doubt it was my reply for the disparaging insolence of the little man somewhat amused me my fame has not travelled very far towards the west oh i am sure it deserves to said mr monk politely gerty dear can you give me a cup of coffee dinner will be ready soon father i do not want any daughterling as i dined in town rather early to be sure but the food was better than i could get here coffee my love coffee and a cigarette if you will permit smoking in your drawingroom this unnecessary politeness was a further revelation of mr monks character under the mask of courtesy he secured his selfish ends and imposed upon everyone by a heartless good breeding which passed for amiability i judged that in looks and manner and dress and inclinations he resembled harold skimpole esquire and was quite as homewardbound as that gentleman i could have kicked myself for accepting a cigarette from a man of so mean a nature but then he was gertrudes father after all and it was necessary to secure his good will if i desired to marry her she seemed to be fond of him and treated him with playful love filial affections evidently warped her judgment a state of things of which i am sure mr monk took every advantage while gertrude ran for the coffee he lighted my cigarettewhich he had just handed meinsisted that i should be seated and then took possession of the best chair which he selected with unerring judgment i was not aware that my daughter knew you mr vance he said gracefully examining his manicured nails have we acquaintances in common miss destiny i rejoined laconically my sisterinlaw strange since she is quite a homebirdso attached to her modest little nest where did you meet her may i ask at mootley when anne caldershaw was murdered the cigarette fell from mr monks white fingers and he shuddered oh pray dont speak of that horrid thing he cried holding up a protesting hand it as cost me many sleepless nights so old and valued a servant as anne was i shall never get over it never i was in london and when i read the news in the papers i nearly fainted really i did i assure you dont speak of it papa if it annoys you said gertrude coming behind his chair to kiss the top of his head no my dear i wont he picked up the cigarette and waved his hand i banish the disagreeable vision to a man of refinement these crimes suggest painful thoughts such as make one grow old it is my aim in life mr vance he added turning to me to avoid the unpleasant beauty is my desirebeauty and peace i cannot bear the poor and the sordid i shrink from the great unwashed very estimable people no doubt but he shuddered in his mincing way let them keep out of my sight you are not a philanthropist mr monk certainly not why should i trouble about the poor they are quite happy in their own disagreeable way and to meddle with them only makes them discontented yes mr vancehe stopped suddenly and again applied the reflective forefinger ah yes i remember now i saw your name as one of the witnesses at the absurd inquest that was why it sounded familiar why do you call the inquest absurd papa asked gertrude handing him a cup of coffee for while he was speaking it had been brought into the room such unnecessary trouble over a common woman murmured mr monk gracefully with a glass eye tooan incomplete woman and so very ugly her one redeeming feature was that she could cook though with my late brother she had small opportunity of exercising that great art but let us change the subject my child lest horrid dreams should come to us all from contemplating the crimson theme of murder you are staying here mr vance he asked dropping his grandiloquent manner and speaking alertly at the robin redbreast for some time i shrugged my shoulders it depends upon my fancy i should not think burwain had many attractions for a young man said mr monk still alert and decidedly inquisitive oh i am not very young sir and after the turmoil of london a change of scene to this restful place is agreeable quite so quite so he nodded an assent but his eyes behind the pincenez were still watchful but after this mootley tragedy i should have thought you would have sickened of the country by the way he stirred his coffee negligently is there any chance that the assassin will be found i cant say i mean to try said i grimly and wondered why mr monk harped on the crimson theme he so much disliked you meant to try he stared and sat up quickly why may i ask i have the vice of curiosity was my answer and the circumstances of the case are so odd that i wish to solve the mystery i dont see where the mystery comes into the matter mr vance if you will pardon my having a contrary opinion to yourself the woman who ran off with your motor cari remember what you had to do with the matter quite well nowstabbed anne with a hatpin where is your mystery there dear papa said gertrude who was perched on the arm of his chair dont talk about the matter as i see it agitates you greatly i glanced at her when she said this as it struck me that if she was the woman who had taken my car she naturally would not like the matter to be spoken about but she appeared to be perfectly calm and her color did not change when our eyes met mr monk was far more discomposed than she was my dear he said in answer to her remonstrance i must steel myself to hear all about our old servantat least about gabriels old servant where i ask again is the mystery in the fact that mrs caldershaws glass eye was stolen i asserted well admitted mr monk reluctantly that is a strange article to steal i agree do you know why it was stolen mr vance i have a theory what is your theory he pursued eagerly your late brother left fifty thousand pounds to miss monk here i explained and that money cannot be found i believe that mrs caldershaw in some way knew of the whereabouts of this fortune and indicated the hidingplace in some way by means of the glass eye it was stolen by the person who desired to gain that fortune dear me mr monk sat up briskly and then rose to his feet have you any grounds for this strange belief none that would satisfy you mr monk what do you think my child there may be something in the idea admitted gertrude cautiously it may be worth mr vances while to search the matter out i admit that i should be glad if he could find the money if she was the woman who had taken the car this speech was strangely daring and while she made it her eyes were fixed very straightly on mine in fact it was my eyes that fell first before hers i must say that she puzzled me in the face of what i knew and more than ever i regretted the inopportune entrance of mr monk when she had been on the eve of making an explanation which might have solved the mystery of her behavior yes yes said mr monk trotting up and down the room i should be glad of the money myself and again i noted that in his selfishness he did not appear to remember that his daughter owned the missing fortune well well well well well it is a strange theory andif you will pardon my saying so mr vancesomewhat incredible theories are usually more or less incredible said i dryly however if the glass eye can be found we may prove the improbable to be the possible the glass eye hm the glass eye of anne caldershaw mr monk halted near my chair and placed meso to speakin the witnessbox he questioned me most precisely concerning my theory weighed my replies made suggestion of his own and appealed several times to gertrude to learn what she thought about the matter finally he concluded that there might be something in the matter although he confessed that he saw no chance of recovering the missing eye which was the clue to the missing money always presuming was mr monks final remark that you are correct there is no doubt that the fortune is missing and that wemy daughter and iwould be glad to obtain it but the chances of finding the keyif it be the keyto the mystery of the hidingplace are very very remote never mind go on i have explained everything i know mr monk i dont mean that sir what i mean is that i desire you to go on with the search for the glass eye and for the criminal who slaughtered anne how do you propose to proceed may i ask i havent the least idea i replied despondently no matter do not despair nil desperandum is a most excellent motto for the young and ambitious it has been my motto through life this came excellently from a man who had done nothing but indulge himself throughout his fifty years of existence but he made the statement in a light and airy manner then turned to his daughter my dear dont you think that after this very criminal conversation we might have a little music to soothe and charm our weary souls gertrude whom the examination had made thoughtful excused herself on the plea of fatigue so mr monk took possession of the piano himself he played gracefully if not convincingly and sang little songs in a pleasant voice of no great power i would much rather have chatted with gertrude who was now staring meditatively into the fire but mr monk demanded my entire attention he was jealous of applause and i was obliged to watch him sitting at the piano like an enlarged white rabbit i thought privately that he was an infernal nuisance but as the father of gertrude he had to be treated diplomatically come daughterling said monk when he had exhausted his stock of amiable ditties you are looking tired go to bed my child and leave mr vance and myself to cigarettes in the smokingroom there is no fire in the smokingroom papa said gertrude rising order the servant to light one at once my love it is not worth while expostulated his daughter and then i heard her say something in low tones regarding the price of coals but mr monk would take no denial andas usualproceeded to gratify his selfish inclinations however as it turned out when we sought the smokingroom the fire was not laid so mr monk after a few severe words about the criminal negligence of servants relinquished his point and i regret to see that you are not so excellent a housekeeper as i should wish you to be gertrude he finished with chill dignity howeverlet it pass and before leaving this room mr vance pray examine it carefully this was easy as on entering he had lighted two powerful lampsor rather he had ordered gertrude to light them with my assistanceso the room was seen to the greatest advantage in the mellow radiance it is the oldest portion of this old house explained mr monk waving his delicate hand built by an ancestor of mine two hundred years ago in order to live a monastic lifequite like a monk ha ha he ended laughing at his small jest my late brother gabriel always lived in this celli call it a cell mr vance rather dull you know but the beam is extremely fine as you can see the apartment was of no great size with one narrow window opposite to one narrow door both of these were draped with faded crimson curtains to exclude light and draughts the wide and spacious fireplace was decorated with reddish dutch tiles and at present was filled with ferns and grasses as it doubtless had been throughout the summer the floor was covered with a richlyhued crimson carpet from a cairien loom and the furniturewhat there was of itconsisted of black oak it really resembled a monastic cell in its severe looks and the atmosphere was chill and deathlike as though no human being ever dwelt in it gertrude shivered come back to the drawingroom papa she said impatiently you cant smoke in this icehouse all the fault of your doubtful housekeeping my dear one moment i wish mr vance to admire this beam to which i called his attention some time ago see the device and lettering mr vance an odd motto and an odd device my ancestor chose both and had the beam carved a very fine piece of work the beam to which he so persistently drew my attention was a massive length of dark oak stretched across the ceiling immediately below the flat panels of black wood in the powerful radiance of the two lamps i saw that an eagle was carved on the beam and round him swarmed a cloud of winged insects beneath ran the motto in gothic letters and in latin aquila non capit muscas an eagle does not catch flies translated mr monk with a shrewd glance in my direction a quaint saying for any man to choose there is a story attached to it i am certain perhaps gertrude i dont know of any story father she interrupted quickly anticipating a long conversation in this vaultlike room do return to the drawingroom or you will catch cold this hint of possible danger to his precious person lured mr monk away at once i remained behind and extinguished the lamps for gertrude trying meanwhile to let her understand that i desired to resume our interrupted conversation but she seemed to be absentminded and when we left the chill smokingroom did not ask me to follow her father i therefore assumed my overcoat and took my leave at the last moment mr monk appeared with hospitable offers a glass of wine a slice of cake a cigarette said he graciously ah you will have nothing very good let us say goodnight he shook my hand with a royal air remember while you are here to come and see us i may be away but my daughter will always be charmed to show you the house so pleased to have met you so very very pleased i finally tore myself from mr monks blandishments and secured a friendly smile from gertrude as i stepped out into the darkness on the way back to the inn through the unlighted village streets i meditated on the position mr monk for his own selfish ends evidently desired me to find the criminal less to avenge mrs caldershaw than to secure the glass eye which i believed to be the clue to the hidingplace of the fifty thousand pounds if i could manage to be successful it was probable that out of gratitude he would permit me to marry his daughter and gertrude herself judging from our interrupted conversation was not averse to me she was ready to take me for a friend at all events and from a friend to a lover is not a far remove it only needed time and perseverance to accomplish it seemed to me that my best plan was to cultivate mr monks society while he remained at the lodge and between whiles to secure if possible a private interview with the girl apparently there was something on her mind which might or might not have to do with the mootley murder but in any case if she were only frank with me i could gage her attitude more accurately once i gained her confidence and she knew me to be a true friend if not a lover she might explain to me how her cloak came to be in the possession of the eloping lady of coursealthough as i have said beforei persistently declined to believe this she might be the eloping lady herself but in any case it was apparent that i could not move a single step with the clue of the cloak until i learned all about it from the woman i now so devotedly loved having more or less roughed out my plans which were to see as much of gertrude and her father as possible i retired to bed and dreamed that i was a married man with a famous name and a large fortune but the pleasant vision was rendered uncomfortable by the constant presence of a gigantic eye which glared malignantly on me and on my schemes i was glad when the morning broke for the next two or three days i was pretty constantly at the lodge and became intimate with mr monk although i did not see so much of gertrude as i desired her father in his selfishness would not leave us alone and moreover learning that i had a motor car requisitioned the same to pay visits to surrounding friends he went to gattlingsands to tarhaven and even proposed a visit to mootley in order to inspect the scene of the crime i was quite willing to go we can stop at murchester and see my friend lord cannington who is in the gunners i suggested mr monk started and turned to ask questions you know lord cannington very well i have known him for years and you some friend of mine knows him said mr monk quietly although i fancied that he was secretly perturbed the name struck me as familiar a charming young man i believe i wish gertrude knew him should this money be recovered i wish her to marry a title if possible this suggestion did not suit me at all cannington was just the kind of inflammable youth to fall at gertrudes feet quite independent of the fortune much as i liked the boy i did not see why i should search out fifty thousand pounds for him and allow him to marry the woman i loved i therefore determinedselfishly perhapsto keep mr monk and lord cannington apart and threw cold water on the journey to murchester and as mr monk himself did not seem very keen about the visit we did not go but he did take me to see miss destiny and asked her graciously to the lodge rather to the annoyance of gertrude who had not much love for her miserly aunt in fact while monk remained in burwainwhich he did for quite a weekmiss destiny hovered round the house like a bee round a flower once or twice i met her driving in her socalled trapi agreed with mrs faith that it was a cartin the company of lucinda and she behaved pleasantly to me although she could not deny herself the impish delight of hinting at my devotion to gertrude not that youll ever marry her mr vance walter has other plans she is to be used to forward his fortunes as he wants money i said nothing but privately determined that the girl should not be sacrificed like a modern iphigenia on the altar of selfish paternal desires i kept my counsel and let monk talk as he pleased and was unobtrusively agreeable to gertrude miss destiny i saw very little of on the sixth day of mr monks stay in burwain i went one afternoon to the lodge and found the little old lady in conversation with striver the handsome gardener was trying to evade the pertinacity of miss destiny who insisted that he should look after her domain for nothing i am sure that my brother so she spoke of mr monk pays you well joseph so you can easily give a couple of hours a day to my little place i have my duties here said striver scowling as i approached but if mr monk gives me orders i can arrange for a certain sum oh i cant pay you a single penny cried miss destiny shrilly its not to be expected but if you come you will find me a friend in what way asked the gardener sharply and not too politely miss destiny did not answer in words she looked at striver then looked at me and finally glanced towards the house where gertrude was standing in the doorway my rival flushed crimson and i did also as we both knew exactly what she meant on seeing the telltale color she burst into a roguish laugh and walked towards the porch a moment later and she disappeared with her niece into the house striver and i looked at one another you have no right to come here said the gardener who looked handsomer than ever in his rough working clothes what do you mean man oh its all very well calling me man in that lordly way he said violently but i know quite well that you are in love with there is no need to mention names i interrupted throwing up my hand and i forbid you to speak to me in this way you forbid me cried my rival laughing bitterly as if i feared you mr cyrus vance you have more need to fear me yes after all i believe you know more about my aunts death than you chose to say i did not deign to reply to this absurd remark but moved towards the house in the hope of meeting mr monk usually he was in the drawingroom and as the french windows were open all three i advanced towards the middle one while striver leaning on his spade looked after me enviously he grudged that i should be able to enter the house while he was chained to the garden and to his work however i had no time to consider his feelings and was about to step into the room when i saw on a small table near it a glittering object it was a glass eye chapter xi miss destiny speaks there it glared at methe glass eye for which i sought as striver had said it was a mere shell on the outward curve of which was depicted the pupil and the iris of a gray eye the white portion of the fabric being delicately streaked with thin red veins uttering an ejaculation i tipped it over with my finger and just had time to see that there was a piece of silver the size of a threepenny bitand perhaps indeed a threepenny bitfastened inside the concave when i heard mr monks voice calling me on the terrace it flashed across me in an instant that he must not see the eye which apparently gertrude had carelessly left lying on the table i should have picked it up to slip into my pocket but the sight was so very unexpected that i had not my presence of mind and stepped back again on to the terrace leaving the sinister object on the table at the same moment mr monk coming round the corner of the terrace slipped his arm within my own i heard your voice he said gently and it guided me towards the corner come and see the greenhouse there are some orchids there i should like you to examine i am fond of these weird plants such a wellbred taste too added mr monk languidly the love of a man for orchids is like the love of a woman for lace i replied mechanically for my head was in a whirl and submitted to be led to a far distant corner of the garden where the greenhouses nestled under the red brick wall here while mr monk discoursed learnedly on flowersabout which he knew less than nothingi wondered in my own mind what might be the meaning of my discovery the glass eye could have been left in the drawingroom by no one but gertrude since i already possessed her cloak to showwhat i had hitherto shrunk from acknowledging even to myselfthat she was the lady who had stolen my motorcar then again she was the one person who had a right to the fifty thousand pounds when found i groaned it really seemed that my pearl amongst woman was guilty of theft and murder and yet even at the eleventh hour i could not make up my mind to believe that she was guilty mr monk mistook my groan for weariness and became offended i fear you dont take much interest in flowers mr vance he said glaring at me through his pincenez oh yes they interest me pray proceed i said hastily no the air of this place is so dense that it gives me a headache the day is uncommonly warm for this season of the year let us return to the house i have a new song i should like to show you tomorrow i return to london and shall not see you for some time oh i can call on you when i go back to town i said idly for my brain was still preoccupied with the glass eye problem no no pardon me no said mr monk decidedly and hastily i am going away for a few weeks to the continenton business of course business i echoed i thought you were free mr monk he sighed and shrugged his shoulders as we slowly walked across the lawn towards the shallow steps of the terrace i have five hundred a year he declared and what is that a mere pittance i have to allow gertrude something and have this house to keep up also my flat in london has to be rented i cant do that on ten pounds a week it was on the tip of my tongue to ask him why he did not remain at burwain and play the part of a country gentleman to reduce his expenditure when he proceeded yes i am in business of a sort connected with commissions on loans that is you will understand mr vance i am not a money lenderfar from it i simply find people who have no money and who want it and agree to procure them money from those who possess it on condition that i have a ten per cent commission in a word i induce my many friends to benefit each other and so benefit myself come mr vance you are a rising dramatist who should be better known in the west end suppose you allow meat ten per centto arrange a loan for you to produce one of your better class plays i have no security i objected i can arrange that said mr monk with an airy wave of his hand and if you can find that eye i started violently but he did not appear to notice and get the fifty thousand pounds i shall let you have the money myself at the same percentage i shall not charge any commission he ended generously quite forgetting that he was proposing to gamble with his daughters money but that obtuseness was mr monk all over if i could see you in town later on later on he said hastily mounting the steps say in three or four months when i return from the continent then we can have a talk your address is he interrupted again i shall see you here i shall see you here it will be much more convenient for me and he passed through the french window into the drawingroom mr monk puzzled me as i did not understand why he should refuse to see me on hisso to speakbusiness premises seeing he desired to speak with me on a business matter however all his froth and small talk were driven out of my head by my discovery that the glass eye had disappeared from the small table i suppose gertrude had put it into her pocket as she was in the room arranging some flowers in a vase i glanced at her keenly but she appeared to be perfectly cool where is your aunt asked monk looking around she has gone home again she only came to see if she could get joseph to attend to her place said gertrude busy with her flowers goodmorning mr vance goodmorning i answered looking hard at herso hard that she blushed becomingly but certainly not guiltily what is the matter she asked putting her hand to her head is my hair out of order noooo i said hesitatingly for her coolness amazed me i was only delighted to see you looking so well she blushed again thank you was her laughing reply for that compliment you shall have a flower and she actually handed me a late rosebud i placed it in my buttonhole feeling quite bewildered it was impossible that she could be guilty and yet the eye had certainly been on the table and perhaps had found a place in her pocket meanwhile mr monk was fuming with injured egotism at being left out of the conversation attend to me gertrude if you please he said sharply i wish you would tell your aunt that i disapprove of her trying to get joseph to attend to her garden she will not pay him and the man cant work for nothing oh i think he can said miss monk putting the vase of nowarranged flowers on the mantelpiece mrs caldershaw left him quite a fortune for a man in his station of life but why dont you speak to my aunt yourself no no no she upsets my nerves we always quarrel exactly what happens when i speak to her rejoined gertrude with a shrug so i am never pleased when she comes here its your fault papa when you are away she never calls i really think she must be in love with you dear you had better take care papa since the deceased wifes sisters bill is law now aunty may wish to marry you monk laughed and smiled not illpleased by this tribute to his looks i shall chose a younger wife than your aunt my dear the stepmother i may give you will be young and charming his daughter looked at him in dismay papa are you thinking of marrying again she demanded quickly no my love i am too poor to marry but if i met a rich woman well he stopped pulled up his collar glanced in a near mirror and adjusted his tie apparently thinking he was worthy to be wooed by an heiress gertrude laughed more at ease in her mind it would be foolish to marry at your age papa you have a comfortable house and a good income so why not enjoy yourself as you are doing now but it appeared that she had said the wrong thing since her father was excessively touchy at my age gertrude he remarked in an offended tone you forget that i am still comparatively young and that when you marry i shall be very solitary as to my income it is a mere pittance to a man of my artistic tastes his daughter might have reminded him that he spent most of his income on himself and kept her on next to nothing but she passed over the whole speech save one remark i shall never marry papa she said quietly why not why not fumed mr monk startled no one will have me she said demurely oh her father laughed that is all right i havent been unmindful of you my child when in town there are one or two men to whom i must introduce you with a view to matrimony i shall arrange please dont papa i prefer to arrange the question of marriage myself foolish foolish child said monk his touchy temper again getting the better of him you shall do as i tell you else you will place me in the disagreeable position of lear and he walked out of the room just like a child annoyed because the bad naughty table has hurt it oh dear me how easily papa is offended sighed gertrude shrugging when he banged the door this must be unpleasant for you mr vance what must be these family jars oh dear no dont think that i answered easily i see you have to humor your father hes a dear father mr vance but sometimes he is difficult to deal with i offend him without meaning to he is so sensitive i thought the man selfish myself but it was none of my business to say so therefore i dropped the subject and asked miss monk to grant me a favor i wish you to come to tea tomorrow at the inn mrs gilfin will play the part of chaperon if your father cant come i dont think papa can as he is going back to london in the morning i accept with pleasure shall i ask your aunt oh no please dont i would rather mrs gilfin were present not that it needs anyone to play propriety as i am sure you can behave yourself at what time do you want me to come four oclock unless you like to come earlier and go for a drive in my motor no i shall come to the robin redbreast at four i wish to ask your advice on a very important subject to renew our conversation of the night when your father entered so unexpectedly yes as i said then i want a friend and i said i know what you said if you say it again i shall begin to think i must have a chaperon for your proposed tea after all now you must go i have heaps and heaps of housework to do also i must pack papas portmanteau i internally blessed mr monk and his confounded portmanteau then took my departure as i had entered by the middle window as i passed out i could not help glancing again at the table whereon i had seen the glass eye miss monk saw my inquiring gaze and came forward have you lost anything i was more confounded than ever nonothing i said hurriedly goodday and i departed at top speed entirely at sea as regards the true state of affairs and yet apart from the evidence of the cloak the presence of the glass eye at the lodge seemed conclusively to prove the guilt of gertrude on my way back to the inn i wondered if by any chance miss destiny had seen the eye on reaching the house it was not impossible that after my capture by mr monk she might have entered the drawingroom in which case beingas i had frequently foundof an inquisitive turn of mind it was certain that she had caught sight of the object it was even possible that she had taken the eye in order to find the secret hidingplace of the fortune miss destiny was a miser miss destiny had no great love for her niece so the theft of the eye would appeal to her avarice and love of making herself disagreeable and of course she would know very well that her niece could say nothing without getting herself into trouble no sooner had this idea entered my mind than i wheeled about and took the road to miss destinys hovel with the intention of asking questions but these were not easy to formulate if she possessed the eye she certainly would not acknowledge the theft if she did not i might reveal my suspicions of gertrude and thus would place a weapon in the little old ladys hand which she would undoubtedly make use of but in my hurried walk to my destination there was no time to arrange what to say so i determined to trust more or less to chance and in this doubtful state of mind i arrived at the tin house miss destiny herself opened the door and explained that lucinda was shopping in the village she appeared to be her usual mincing self and betrayed no uneasiness i was invited into her sordid shabby sittingroom and she entered into a long complaint about her brotherinlaws treatment walter is so very mean lamented miss destiny sitting down i believe he grudges joseph coming to work for me mr monk has engaged joseph to attend to his own garden i reminded her the lodge garden is in good order she snapped whereas mine needs a lot of attention walter might send the man along if you pay joseph miss destiny pay him she interrupted with a shriek and throwing up her hands my dear mr vance it is as much as i can do to keep bread in my mouth i am reduced to thisshe glanced roundwhich is by no means the abode of a gentlewoman but gertrude and her father would let me starve sooner than behave as relatives should oh no no i protested miss monk is extremely kind have you found her so demanded the vindictive aunt i have found her charming was my cautious reply charms dont pay taxes mr vance i suppose she added abruptly that you intend to marry her oh dont look so astonished young man i remember how you admired her photograph in annes house and you didnt come here for nothing oh dear me no i came here to learn all i could about the glass eye so that i might trace the assassin of anne caldershaw oh indeed miss destinys sharp eyes twinkled wickedly and you haunt my niece in order to ask questions why not i ventured cautiously miss destiny laughed significantly why not indeed she echoed its my opinion that gertrude knows much more about the glass eye than she dares to tell you or anyone else my blood ran cold for the moment apparently this disagreeable old woman had seen the eye on the drawingroom table and thence had drawn the very worst conclusions i ventured on a bold stroke do you mean to say that miss monk has the glass eye i dont say that then she has not the glass eye i said impatiently and drawing a breath of great relief i dont say that either then what do you say miss destiny nothing except that you will be wise to go away from burwain and give up all idea of marrying my niece why i asked very directly becauseas i saidgertrude knows something about the murder that is a serious thing to say miss destiny on what grounds do you make such an accusation she made no direct reply but rocked to and fro i know i know she said with a cunning look and a malicious chuckle i ventured still further on the dangerous ground upon which i was treading have you seen the glass eye in miss monks possession no she said and her reply startled me for i had made sure that she dared to speak thus freely from having espied the object on the drawingroom table i never said that she had the glass eye then on what grounds oh i dont wish to say anything she interrupted having said so much you must say more was my firm reply you have no right to make dangerous accusations without proof gertrude herself can supply the proof i would not insult her by asking her to no screeched miss destiny jumping to her feet like a small fury because you are a fool every man who loves is a fool and you love gertrude heaven only knows what you see in her i see a lovely girl and an accomplished lady a good daughter and an honorable gentlewoman four people rolled into one sneered the spiteful little creature quivering with wrath she may be lovely in your eyesi know what fools men arebut good and honorable she is not prove what you say i cried but she only trotted about the room tremulous with anger and jealousy i determined to enrage her still further as if she completely lost her temper she might unexpectedly come out with all she knew i was therefore pointedly rude the fact is miss destiny you are jealous of your nieces beauty me she quavered and her eyes flamed me jealous yes you are also annoyed because your niece has gabriel monks money has she if she has she committed murder to get it thats a lie you forget sir that you speak to a lady i do not i retorted still carrying out my plan i am speaking to a jealous old woman who is trying to harm an innocent girl this last speech brought about the desired result innocent she cried and stamped her foot if she is innocent what was she doing at anne caldershaws on the night of the murder she was not there yes she was yes she was yes she was chattered miss destiny thrusting her angry face close up to mine i said nothing about it at the inquest as i did not wish to get her into trouble but now that you dare to say i am jealous of thatthat minxshe brought out the word with a gasp i shall speak out and i dare gertrude to contradict me i arranged to meet her at annes house at five oclock i started on the previous day in the trap with lucinda and stopped the night with a friend at saxham next day i went on but owing to the state of the roads and the slowness of the horse i did not reach annes house until after the crime was committed but gertrude intended to go to murchester and thence walk to annes house on the day when the murder took place i am sure that she was at mootley at five oclock to keep the appointment and it was after that time that anne was stabbed with the hatpin a hatpin with a blue glass head cried miss destiny triumphantly i gave gertrude three pins like that myself as a christmas present last year now you see she is guilty it certainly looked like it but i declined to admit even the shadow of a suspicion i dont see said i tartly and controlling myself with an effort miss monk may have called at five oclock and not finding you there may have returned to burwain by the evening train oh did she mocked miss destiny cruelly then what about the blue glassheaded hatpin what about her presence at mootley about the time anne was killed what about the lady who stole your motor car you cant prove the lady was miss monk yes i can that man giles said the lady wore a white cloak i saw her with the white cloak myself and gertrude had such a white cloak really i said bantering although these proofs of guilt made me tremble perhaps you recognized miss monk when the motor car nearly collided with your carti beg pardonyour trap no i didnt recognize her said miss destiny sitting down sullenly it was darkish and gertrude was the last person i expected to see in a motor car i saw that the lady had a white cloak and knew my niece possessed one but it never struck me that gertrude was the driver until i came to mootley and heard that anne had been murdered the information about the glassheaded pin made me certain all this has to be proved said i after a nervous pause for there was no denying that miss monks position was perilous have you accused her no i havent i asked her why she didnt meet me at mootley and she said that she had decided not to go a liea lie cried miss destiny leaping to her feet again she was there and she murdered anne and stole the eye perhaps i cant say that for certain i only speak of what i know but as anne was murdered for the sake of the eyeeveryone seems to think thati have no doubt that gertrude has it have you seen it in her possession you asked me that before i have not seen it in her possession i only speak of what i know she said again and looked dogged there was a few minutes silence putting together miss destinys statements and what i knew about the eye and the cloak it would seem that the proofs of guilt against gertrude were overwhelming prejudiced as i was in her favor and blinded more or less by love i could not help acknowledging that the evidence was dead against her if miss destiny spoke out and gertrude was arrested she would be hard put to prove her innocence only one thing remained to be done to silence miss destiny until gertrude could explain herself of course you will say nothing i said sternly miss destiny looked at me sulkily of course she asserted i dont love gertrude all the same i dont wish to see her hanged not that word i rose and put out my hand wincing hanged hanged hanged screamed the furious old woman you are so blinded by love you fool that you cant see her wickednessthe murderess she is not the thief she is not i turned on my heel and flung open the door miss destiny leaped to my side what are you going to do i intend to see miss monk and ask her to disprove your accusations she cant she darent we shall see i snapped and left the house while miss destiny jeered and made mouths after me like a wicked foul old witch chapter xii gertrudes defence as may be guessed i passed a very perturbed four and twenty hours until my arranged interview with miss monk miss destiny had not seen the glass eye in the drawingroom and so far could prove nothing against her niece i believe that so far she was speaking the truth as if she had seen the eye she would have only been too pleased to adduce its presence as a proof of gertrudes guilt but as things were what she knew was damning enough she could swear to the girls presence at mootley on the evening of the murder and to the ownership of the white cloak worn by the lady who had stolen my motor car fortunately from sheer shame since miss monk was her niece miss destiny promised to hold her tongue in the face of what the old woman had said and that i already knew it seemed certain that gertrude was guilty miss destiny could even declare that her niece had possessed certain blue glassheaded hatpins with one of which the crime had been committed then again gertrude wished to get the money which after all was rightfully her own it seemed probableon the face of itthat while waiting with anne caldershaw for miss destinys arrival she had tried to learn what the exhousekeeper knew as to the whereabouts of the money anne may have boasted that the secret was locked up in her glass eye and thenwell i shuddered to think of what took place nine people out of ten would have pronounced gertrude guilty with the greatest promptitude but i happened to be the tenth and i hesitated to give an opinion but then i was in love and my decision was biassed but i really could not believe that so lovely a girl was guilty besides her demeanor was not that of a brazen criminal and she had seemed really puzzled by my overattentive gaze tossing and turning on my bed i tried to see some ray of light but all was utter darkness the evidence was dead against gertrude monk and her fate was in the hands of her vindictive aunt miss destiny might hold her tongue for the time being but it would take very little to set it wagging and being a miser she might try to blackmail her niece my brain ached with trying to get at the truth to inspector dredge it would have have been readily apparent but in the face of stern facts i refused to believe the girl to be guilty then there was giles during the night i thought a good deal of giles whom i had met that very evening when i returned to the robin redbreast he was remaining there for the night and informed me that he had come over to burwain that day in order to see striver about the lease of the corner shop you see mr vance said giles shortly before i retired to bed and while we were in the bar my wife wants to have a shop of her own so i thought i would get mr striver to make over the lease of mrs caldershaws shop to me my wife is set on having it and i think mr striver will agree to the terms i propose you have seen him then yes sir i went to his house today and found he was at the lodge working in the garden i sought him out there and we had a talk just before miss destiny came to bother him i went away then and afterwards you came oh my mind swiftly ran over the events of the day then you were in the grounds of the lodge before i arrived yes mr vance said giles readily enough mr striver wasnt in the garden at the time as he had gone round to the back of the house i walked up to the front door and asked for him the servant sent a message and we were talking over our deal when the little old lady arrived she spoilt the business for the time being but i saw mr striver this evening and we have arranged about the matter my wife will have the shop i thought a good deal about this conversation when in bed giles had been alone in the grounds of the lodge and had gone up to the house to seek for striver might he not have placed the eye on the table since he could easily do so when the middle french window was open but then i had absolutely no reason to suspect giles as the glass eye would be meaningless to him but stop would it indeed be meaningless certainly mrs giles had denied that she knew about mrs caldershaws glass eye but then she had admitted that the exhousekeeper had said she would never die in her bed in one way or another mrs giles may have learned the secret of the hidden money and thus giles might have killed mrs caldershaw to obtain the glass eye which was the clue but after reflection i dismissed this theory as utterly ridiculous giles could not have gained possession of the hatpin belongingaccording to miss destinyto gertrude monk and certainly having the eye would not come over to burwain to leave it in the drawingroom of the lodge giles on the face of it was utterly innocent yet it was strange that he should have been in the grounds of the jacobean house nearly at the time i had seen the glass eye and that it had disappeared if giles had not placed it there he might have taken it no no no no i muttered in drowsy tones its absurd giles has nothing to do with the matter he merely came over to arrange about the shop he did not place the glass eye there nor did striver if striver had possessed the eye he would have gained possession of the money besides he was not at mootley until the funeral took place mr monk hes innocent enough as he was in london when the crime was committed moreover if he possessed the eye he also would be in possession of the fortune gertrude is the only person to whom suspicion points i shall insist upon a full explanation tomorrow i alone can save her if she is guilty and then i fell into a troubled sleep reproaching myself for daring to doubt my divinity giles departed next morning before i arose and i did not see him again haunted still by undefined suspicions i regretted his departure and determined later to look him up at mootley of course the mere idea of thinking that the respectable sturdy greengrocer was guilty seemed ridiculous but in my anxiety to save gertrude from danger i was willing to sacrifice anyone and everyone to such a state does love bring the most just of mankind by the midday post i received an impetuous letter from cannington who informed me that he had snaffledthe word is his owna couple of weeks leave for the present he was staying with his aunt lady denham because mabel wished it but proposed when i came up to take rooms at a hotel where he wouldas he put itbe less tied by the leg then he went on to say that i had remained long enough at burwain and that if i did not come to him he would come to me like mahomet and the proverbial mountain bearing in mind mr monks aspirations for a titled soninlaw this was the last thing i desired so i arranged promptly in my own mind to accept his invitation besides after my interview with gertrude in which i hoped to come to an understanding there would be no need for me to remain at burwain her story might send me farther afield in search of new clues reading between the lines of canningtons letter i saw that he was devoured with curiosity concerning miss monk he knew that i had fallen in love with the portrait and as he had always regarded me as a particularly staid sedate personage he naturally doubted if i would carry on so fantastic a romance however he evidently had his suspicions since i chose to linger in a dull country village and therefore was desperately anxious to see the lady who could thus move my elderly heart as cannington was a most pertinacious mortal i wrote by the next post that i would be in london next week and then would have much to tell him about the case and as a matter of fact i did wish to have some safe person with whom to discuss matters i could always rely on cannington to hold his tongue even if his advice did not prove to be particularly good at all events the boy could always be relied upon to keep silent which was more than i could say for many people i know so to cannington i resolved to confide the full tale of my discoveries andin the interests of my wooingi ended my letter with a repetition of the fact that i was coming to see him had i not emphasized this the boy might have appeared the next day to make inquiries after posting this letter i consulted with mrs gilfin about afternoon tea and that able old creature bustled about to some purpose she arranged flowers in my sitting room stoked the fire dusted the furniture unnecessarily and spread a truly gorgeous tea for my visitor i protested that neither one of us could eat so many cakes and buns and jam and bread as loaded the table mrs gilfinwho had some idea of my state of mindadmitted with a beaming smile that love did spoil the appetite but she objected to the presence of my second portmanteau in the sittingroom it do spile the looks of things said mrs gilfin why not put it in the bedroom master cyrus i have use for it here cuckoo i answered and so i had for in it was snugly folded the celebrated cloak which i proposed to show to gertrude when the time came for explanations at four oclock all was spic and span as the room was as comfortable as the afternoon tea was tempting miss monk duly arrivedthis time without puddles as an escortand looked more beautiful than ever in her plain dress poor girl she nearly always wore the same frock which showed how very short in cash mr monk kept her she should have been arrayed in silk attire and i inwardly swore when establishing her in a deepseated armchair by the fire that some day she should be at my expense meantime i handed her a cup of tea and piled her with thin bread and butter much to mrs gilfins satisfaction that good lady had looked in to see that we were comfortable eat all you can miss urged mrs gilfin you dont look as fat as you ought to be gertrude shuddered i dont want to grow fat said she laughing theres worse things than fat said mrs gilfin sensibly lean people with wrinkles are never so nice as them without if miss destiny had more flesh on her bones she be more popular and after delivering herself of this dictum the landlady departed with a fat chuckle gertrudes face clouded when her aunt was mentioned i noticed this and commented thereon you are not fond of miss destiny i remarked i have little reason to be she replied with a nervous air aunt julia is that her name yes julia destinya strange name isnt it well then she has always behaved harshly to me even when i was a child she never liked me and since uncle gabriel left me this fortune she has scarcely been able to bear the sight of me then this morning what about this morning i asked seeing her hesitation aunt julia came to me and said all manner of dreadful things even if you had not arranged this afternoon tea mr vance i should have come to see you i need a friend more than ever i privately thoughtand i was right in thinking sothat miss destiny had been making herself disagreeable over the visit to mootley and perhaps had added threats however i said nothing for the moment as i wished gertrude to tell her story in her own way take some cake and another cup of tea i murmured sympathetically then we can talk gertrude handed me her cup i cant eat or drink anything more thank you mr vance i want to speak seriously to you no one can hear us i hope i glanced at the door and window both were closed no one can hear us i assented taking the chair opposite to her and you can depend upon my being secret about whatever you choose to tell me you know that yes she looked straightly at me and her royal beauty impressed me anew i have studied your character closely so that i might be certain of making no mistake and you are satisfied perfectly she glanced round again then leaned back in her chair listen mr vance and dont interrupt me more than you can help as it is difficult for me to tell my story clearly i am all attention said i leaning forward you know that i told you of the fifty thousand pound which my uncle gabriel left me yes the fortune which is missing gertrude nodded uncle gabriel was a miser and concealed his riches my father has inherited the income and the property but the fifty thousand pounds has been hidden away when the will was read i learned that such a sum had been left to me but its whereabouts could not be discovered i searched through all my late uncles papers without result then about the end of july i came across an old box in the attic filled with foolscap sheets covered with figures also there was some writing in the form of a diary two or three loose sheets pinned together have you the diary and the other papers yes you can see them when you come to the lodge meanwhile it is easier for me to tell you the contents as the writing is extremely crabbed i learned that uncle gabriel had for years used the family income of five hundred per annum in purchasing diamonds really he could buy many valuable stones at such a price you forget that he had the income for forty years or thereabouts and lived like a pauper he was always saving money and buying diamonds at timesas the diary saidhe went to london and amsterdam and paris and traded in stones he turned over what he had bought as a matter of fact and in one way and another managed to accumulate fifty thousand pounds worth of jewels then the fortune which is hidden consists of diamonds exactly in the diary uncle gabriel hinted that the jewels were for me but that he mistrusted my father and would put them safely away why did he mistrust your father i asked although i had a very shrewd suspicion of what the answer would be the girl flushed uncle gabriel was never just to my father she said in a low voice oh i know that papa has his faults but his heart is in the right place papa has no idea of money he is like a child so uncle gabriel thought that if papa secured the diamonds he might squander their value what said i significantly when they belonged to you she colored again i think papa believes what is mine is his you see uncle gabriel died when i was about sixteenfive years agoand he thought that if papa could lay hands on the jewels then that they would not come to me he mistrusted papa and with very good reason i murmured too low for gertrude to hear walter monk as i truly believed would act exactly in the way his brother suspected he would whats that you say never mind i understand that the diamonds were concealed so that your father might not be tempted but surely your uncle intended them to come into your hands sooner or later yes the diary said that the jewels were hidden in a certain place what place i asked abruptly ah that was kept secret but uncle gabriel talked about trusting anne ah i said rubbing my hands with satisfaction now we are coming to the gist of the matter any mention of the eye no you see in the diaryit can hardly be called oneuncle gabriel only jotted down scraps of the scheme in his head to make a long story short i gathered that he had entrusted the secret of the whereabouts of the diamonds to anne caldershaw as he had known her for years and esteemed her an honest woman i see and she was not honest dont you think so no evidently she intended to tell striver the secret since she left him the glass eye in the will he was to get the money and theni daresayhe could ask you to marry him ridiculous said miss monk coloring perhaps nevertheless i believe that such was the scheme of mrs caldershaw for she intended to enrich her nephew at your expense hoping that you would marry him and thus gain the benefit of what was rightfully your own the idea of a marriage salved her conscience as it were the idea is absurd i would never marry a man like joseph although he is handsome and fairly well educated you know that he loves you yes i know she replied blushing but in a somewhat cold tone never mind the thingas i sayis absurd but it might be as you say mr vance that anne had such a scheme in her head however you understand that i gathered from the socalled diary that she knew of the whereabouts of the jewels yes i know that what did you do i determined to go over and see anne caldershaw and did you yes she looked at me nervously you were at mootley then whenwhen no she burst out fiercely not though aunt julia swears i was oh you did not go to mootley at all yes i did i arranged to meet aunt julia at annes house at five oclock i got there before that time then you were at mootley on the evening of the murder i have never denied it she said cresting her head like a snake and looking haughty but i do deny that i was in the house when the crime was committed i was not the woman who ran away with your motor car whatever aunt julia may say who was the woman then i dont know i never set eyes on her ah said i thoughtfully talking of eyes was mrs caldershaws glass optic in her head when you spoke to her yes it was and remember please that i never knewas it appears from your ingenious theorythat the secret was hidden in that eye i came at halfpast four and went into the back room where i talked with anne i related to her what i had discovered and asked her to tell me where the diamonds were she said she did not know she did not know i echoed in utter astonishment so she said she declared that uncle gabriel had given her a cipher in which he had concealed the whereabouts of the diamonds anne could not read it herself so she had no idea of where the jewels were did you ask her for the cipher yes i did she refused to give it to me on what grounds gertrude grew red and looked nervously into the fire i may as well be quite frank she said with an outburst of candor anne really did wish me to marry her nephew and said she would give me the cipher if i promised to marry joseph i refused and then well what then i asked impatiently and indignant at the plot between the dead woman and the gardener to force miss monk into unwilling matrimony then i heard a voice in the shop calling for mrs caldershaw she went away and shortly afterwards returned to ask me to leave at once there was someone who wished to speak to her and she did not wish me to meet this person therefore she asked me to leave at once did you know who this person was gertrude hesitated i could answer you that frankly she said after a pause as i caught a glimpse of the person through the halfopen shop door the mere sight of this person sent me away as i did not wish to meet here she hesitated him or her i asked inquisitively i would rather not say just now she replied with reserve but you must say i insisted dont you see that this person whether man or woman may have been the one who murdered mrs caldershaw she grew pale i have thought of that myself she said hurriedly therefore i refuse to tell you who the person was if a certain contingency happens i shall speak out you wont tell me now i said somewhat wounded no dont ask me to perhaps later on she seemed greatly distressed you see its a terrible thing for me to give the name of a person who might be accused of the crime if this person was hanged even if guilty i should not be able to rest in my bed she shuddered and burst into tears my position is very hard she wailed but i can assist you if you will speak plainly she shook her head i cannot speak plainer than i am doing later on yes later on i may tell you but just now i dare noti dare not and again she began to weep as it was evident that she had some strong reason to conceal the name of this mysterious person i did not press her further although i was most anxious to learn all about the matter instead i asked another question in soothing tones how did you leave by the back door said gertrude drying her eyes in that way i escaped coming face to face with the person in question but there is no gate out of the back yard by which you could escape i examined the fence myself you did not examine it carefully enough the gate is at the side of the house and is exactly like the fence when it is closed no one could tell that there was a gate i expect that is why you overlooked it outside the gate a path led amongst those elmtrees some little distance until it came out on to the high road some distance down the slope i went along the path and on gaining the road i walked to murchester where i caught the halfpast six train so you see that i had nothing to do with the murder i was horrified when i heard of it and seeing the danger i was in of being suspected i held my peace i even denied to aunt julia that i had been to mootley at all saying that i had changed my mind i recalled the conversation with miss destiny and recognized that gertrude was speaking the exact truth mrs caldershaw was alive and well when you left her i asked rising to drag out my portmanteau quite well what are you doing ill show you in one moment mrs caldershaw did not appear to be afraid of being killed no she was quite her usual self did you take your cloak with you my cloak she rose much agitated how do you know that i wore a cloak you must have had one to take such a journey i said evasively yes replied gertrude somewhat reassured butoh she gasped as i displayed the garment i had produced from the portmanteau yes i said unfolding it this is the cloak worn by the lady who took my motor car i found it concealed in the field and it is your cloak yes she admitted with white lips it is my cloak chapter xiii love we stared at one another for quite sixty seconds she standing whitefaced and tonguetied near her chair i kneeling by the open portmanteau to display the cloak when i would have spoken she flung up a protesting hand to silence me how do you know it is my cloak the embroidery in blue silk repeats the initials of your name and you found it in the field where the motor car was stranded i did concealed in a hedge where i concealed it i dont say that gertrude stepped back and clutched at her breast dont you believe that i am the woman who stole your car no i dont dont you believe that i murdered anne for the sake of the eye no i dont but on what groundshe flung abroad her armsdo you believe me to be innocent i love you you love me she repeated mechanically i rose still holding the cloak in my arms and spoke vehemently of course you must have seen for days that i love you i came here because i fell in love with your photograph and because i found this i shook the cloak yes can you not understand that i desired to save you to save me from what from arrest had anyone but myself found the cloak you would have been in prison long long ago but i told no one about my discovery i hid the cloak in my portmanteau and came here to seek an explanation i knew that you would be able to exculpate yourself then you needed an explanation she asked in low tones only that i might learn how to save you i needed no explanation to assure me that you are innocent for a moment i had my doubts when miss destiny spoke to me yesterday gertrude interrupted with a cry and the scarlet blood flushed her cheeks swiftly aunt julia has been speaking to you i have been speaking to aunt julia listen i saw long ago that your aunt was not your friend and i feared lest she should make mischief i therefore called to see her yesterday so that i might learn how much she knows she told me i know what she told you interrupted gertrude again and flung back her head she came to me this morning as i explained and said all manner of dreadful things such as i shall tell you so that you may see i place myself entirely in your hands mr vance aunt julia declared that i was at mootley on the evening of the murder that the hatpin with which anne was stabbed belonged to me and that she saw my white cloak on the lady who drove the motor car whom she believed to be myself escaping she threatened to tell the police all these things unless i gave her half of the fifty thousand pounds as if i couldas if i could wailed gertrude dropping into her seat i do not know where it is why not learn from the glass eye she looked up astonished i have not got the glass eye i stared in my turn listen miss monk in the face of what you have told me and of what your aunt has said i believe that you are innocent thank god for that she muttered i could not have endured an accusation from you on hearing this it was with the greatest difficulty that i prevented myself from taking her in my arms to kiss away the tears but there was much to be cleared up before i could do that as i wished her to understand my entire belief in her innocence but i went on with emphasis while i know that your account of the interview with mrs caldershaw is correct i ask you to trust meas i am your firm friendfully i have trusted you fully she said plaintively what about the glass eye are you sure that mrs caldershaw did not allow you to carry it away when you left by the back door to escape meeting this mysterious person you speak of i am quite sure said gertrude rising with great dignity that mrs caldershaws glass eye was in her head when i ran from her house i was in such a hurry to escape meeting the person i mentioned that i left my cloak behind me and also one of the blue glassheaded pins which fastened my hat i can guess what happened the assassin killed anne with the hatpin stole the glass eye and then assumed my cloak to escape and perhaps she added with an afterthought to throw the blame of the crime on me and the assassin was this person whom you did not wish to meet her hands trembled i think not i hope not iii cant answer your questions mr vance but why she continued hurriedly why do you mention the glass eye in connection with my not havingas you declaretrusted you fully because i saw the very eye on the small table near the middle window of the drawingroom at the lodge she rose quickly and looked aghast yousawtheglass eye there she said slowly when yesterday and i rapidly explained the circumstance i thought that you had the eye in your pocket when i came afterwards into the room with your father i said and because i fancied miss destiny might have seen it i went along in your interest to interview her but from what she said i am convinced that you had concealed it before she could set eyes on it stop cried gertrude i did not conceal it i never saw the glass eye save in annes head if i had that eye you must think me guilty and her eyes searched my face no i said firmly i only thought that perhaps not quite trusting me you did not say that anne caldershaw had given it to you but she did not i have told everything you know the reason why i went to mootley and all that took place i left anne in good health and walked to murchester to catch the train dont you believe me oh i advanced towards her anxiously cant you see that i believe you entirely nothing will ever persuade me that you are guilty all i ask is for absolute confidence so that i can find the true assassin and free you from the danger of being denounced by your vindictive aunt i have given you my absolute confidence she said with dignity yet not unmoved by my declaration not entirely i do not know the sex or the name of the person from whom you fled at the corner shop gertrude turned swiftly towards the window i can answer no question on that point she said in low tones do you think this person had possession of the eye i persisted no no no ask me no more i have told you all that i can tell you i will only ask one question whichif i am to learn the truth about this case and save you from arresti must have answered do you believe that the person in question is guilty she turned with a pearlywhite face no the person is not guilty do you wish me to swear it her question was sarcastic and i winced i believe your bare word i said somewhat coldly have i not proved my belief forgive me in her turn she moved towards me and laid a beseeching hand on my arm you are my best friend and indeed my only friend i have no one but you to trust and love i asked trying to catch her hands no no she drew away not yet yes now we must understand one another i am not content with friendship gertrude i want your love butbut it is so sudden she stammered sudden when i have been eating my heart out ever since i set eyes on your portrait oh my dear you cant believe that butbut she made another objection there is so much to talk about we can talk all the easier when we understand one another surely you can see how devoted i am to you i know that oh yes i know that indeed i do then i held out my hands mr vance call me by my name indeed i cantoh nooh no gertrude this time i became masterful and possessed myself of her unwilling hands is there anyone else no certainly there is not you dont love striver the idea i never heard such nonsense you are about to hear a good deal of nonsense when a sensible man such as i am is in love he talks his heart out she did not draw away her hands but laughed softly in spite of her fears and insistent troubles what you say can never be nonsense then you love me i demanded persistently yes its no use my denying it i do love you gertrude i caught her fully in my arms and before she could turn her head aside had pressed my lips to her own she bore the embrace for one moment then pushed me away and retreating to the armchair sat down to cry softly i followed gertrude darling oh what is the use of talking how can we behave in this way when all things are wrong i do love you it is useless to say that i do not but my heart aches with pain darling i knelt beside her i am here to help you i know i accept your help gladly and i thank god for having sent a good man to help me dear dont think of me as good i have no end of faults you would not be human otherwise and for those faults i love you all the more mr gertrude well then cyrus dearest my own you will marry me some day when she suddenly rose and assumed a resolute air cyrus we must not fiddle while our rome is burning tell me how the glass eye came to be at the lodge i fell into her humor as i saw that she regarded the position of things as far too serious to permit simple love dalliance my dear i cant tell you unless i never saw the eye she interrupted impatiently dont you believe me yes you never saw the eye was miss destiny in the drawingroom no we both went up to my bedroom when she came into the house and i saw her out of the gate just before i returned to the house to meet you and my father why do you ask that question do you think my aunt oh no miss destiny did not arrive at mootley until the crime was committed she could not have got possession of the glass eye i only wished to be sure that she had not seen it as she did not enter the drawingroom and as i have crossquestioned her it is evident that she knows nothing on that point then theres giles who is giles he is a man who lives at mootley and who caught me in the back room with mrs caldershaws dead body he came over to see striver about the lease of the corner shop and was in the garden of the lodge i wondered if he might have placed the glass eye on the table why should he does he know anything of the secret i dont think so and indeed he is an honest man who would not harm anyone my dear i dont think giles had the eye then striver oh cyrus he did not go to mootley until the funeral do you suspect him not of the murder but it is just possible that the eye was not taken by the assassin and that striver found it when he was in the shop hunting amongst the papers of his late aunt that is a new idea since you have always believed that the murder was committed for the sake of the eye i dont know what to believe i said wearily passing my hand across my forehead still someone must have placed the eye on the table and why not striver who was working in the garden i dont seesupposing your theory of the murder is truehow he could have got possession of the eye it might be another one i dont think so gertrude for in the concave of the eye i saw a piece of white metalsilver i fancy on that i truly believe the hidingplace of the diamonds is indicated but if joseph had the eye she persisted although i do not see how he could have got it he would use it to find the diamonds and thus would not have placed it on the table you forget i said quickly that the hiding place of the eye is indicated in cipher according to mrs caldershaw joseph might have found the eye in the corner housei dont accuse him of murderand being unable to read the cipher might have placed the eye on the table to implicate you why should he when he says that he loves me for that very reason he is jealous of me and knows that you will never marry him if by implicating you he could secure your arrest and then could save you by confessing that he found the eye and placed it on the table he might think you would marry him out of gratitude oh the idea is absurd said gertrude petulantly its such a roundabout way of going to work let us ask joseph no i said cautiously after all what i say is merely theoretical if joseph did not place the eye on the table it is no use our letting him know that it was there it would supply him with a weapon then you dont think he i cant say what i think as i said before i muttered rising to pace the room if i were a born detective i might unravel this mystery as it is i cant see my way to the truth if the truth is never known remarked gertrude after a pause what does it matter this much you will always be in danger of being denounced by your aunt not if i give her half the fifty thousand pounds quite so my dear but there again the truth must be discovered as you cant gain possession of the money otherwise can you trust your servant eliza oh yes she has been with us for years she could not have placed the eye on the drawingroom table what time did you see it about three oclock i was about to enter the room through the middle window which was open and saw it suddenly then your father called me when i returned in halfanhour you were in the room and the eye was gone i had just entered the drawingroom a few moments before you came with papa said gertrude thoughtfully and i entered through the window as i had been seeing my aunt out of the gate the eye certainly was not on the table then i should have seen it otherwise as you did well then it was gone just before halfpast three i remarked and i saw it at the hour when you were in the drawingroom before that time did you see anything no replied gertrude impatiently i told you i never saw the eye at all cyrus i did not enter the drawingroom after luncheon until halfpast three oclock in the morning i certainly saw nothing was your father in the drawingroom after luncheon not to my knowledge he was pottering round the greenhouses surely you dont suspect papa and her color rose no certainly not only i wondered if he had seen it he could not have seen it else he would have picked it up to show me well i said with a longdrawn sigh for the mystery of the thing perplexed me i dont know who placed it there or who took it away perhaps striver removed it i added with an afterthought why should he why shouldnt he i echoed its the very thing he wanted since when i saw him at mootley he was hunting for the eye to secure the money but you said i know what i said was my cross interruption so far as i can see there is no chance of learning the truth as i dare not risk speaking to striver lest i place a weapon in his hand i dont know what to do well dear said gertrude rising to take her departure if you ask my opinion i think it is best to leave matters alone but you will be in danger from your aunts tongue i dont think so i have promised to give her half the money when it is found and she wont risk losing that since she is such a miser anne is dead and buried so let sleeping dogs lie and marry you i asked tenderly yes and marry me she came forward threw her arms round my neck and whispered cyrus let us think of ourselves and our happiness and leave this mystery alone well i shrugged my shoulders and slipped my arm round her waist i only wished to learn the truth in order to shield you although i dont deny that the mystery of the case appeals to me but if you are content to leave it alone and marry me so am i let us relegate the murder of mrs caldershaw to the already long list of undiscovered crimes and the cloak asked gertrude her eyes falling on it ill wrap it up in a parcel and you can take it back to hang in your wardrobe eliza knows that you have a white cloak and will never connect it with the mootley murder even though she read an account of the case she has not said gertrude shaking her head she never reads any of the newspapers and only knows that anne is murdered she may hear talk of course but i dont fancy shell trouble her head does she know that you went to mootley on that day no i told her that i was going to london for you see i did not wish my father to know that i had been to see anne why not can you ask knowing what i said about my uncles mistrust of my father if papa knew what i had found out about the diamonds and had gone to see anne about the matter he wouldat the timehad i been successful have insisted on my giving him the jewels for that reason i kept my visit secret from everyone save my aunt i was forced to let her know as she had arranged to see anne on that day and we were bound to meet did you tell miss destiny about the diary yes it was necessary for me to ask her if she thought that anne would be honest enough to give me the cipher she told me that she believed there would be no difficulty in getting it as anne having nursed me was devoted to my interest but you see ended gertrude with a sigh anne would only help me on condition that i agreed to marry joseph then you dont intend to let your father have the diamonds when they are found i asked wrapping up the cloak in brown paper no dear papa is the best of men but he does not know the value of money and if he gained possession of fifty thousand pounds would only squander it the five hundred a year he has settled on me after his death and he cant spend the capital i shall give papa plenty of money within reason when he asks for it and when the jewels are mine oh hell ask for it right enough i muttered cynically however gertrude you must first catch your hare we must search for the diamonds it may be that they are hidden in the house no it has been turned upside down without result i wish i had found time to glance at the cipher which certainly must have been written on that piece of silver attached to the eye i muttered regretfully however its too late now nothing can be done nothing echoed gertrude taking the parcel from me and advancing towards the door leave the matter alone cyrus and let us be happy i flew after her gertrude you are going without dear i forgot she paused to kiss me fondly and then departed after that i cared very little if the mystery were solved or not chapter xiv the unforeseen happens so here i had reached the goal of my desires in a surprisingly short space of time truly the gods had been good to me and in the most unexpected manner i had won the love of the sweetest woman in the world and the mysterious murder of anne caldershawgruesome as it may seemhad been the main circumstance to bring about my triumph but for the crime i should not have seen the portrait of my beloved and but for her innocent connection with the samewhereby i was enabled to prove my honesty and good faithi should never have gained her confidence but to trust me she had to study my character closely and having done so had unconsciously fallen in love when i offered to come forward as her champion my conquest was complete and therefore gertrude yielded truly an odd wooing for the next two or three days we were completely happy mr monk having departed could no longer interrupt us at inauspicious moments so we had all the golden hours to ourselves also the weather unexpectedly changed from autumnal greyness to a springlike delicacy of sunshine in a blue sky it was more like may than the end of september and the singing of the birds was echoed by our joyful hearts we scarcely said a word about the mootley crime as we had tacitly agreed to abandon any search for the criminal and indeed there remained no clue to lead to the discovery of the assassin at times i had doubts about the mysterious person whose name gertrude had so steadily refused to tell me i felt sure that she was shielding someone and could not think of any reason strong enough to make her do so but i put the doubt from me when she smiled into my eyes and surrendered myself entirely to the happiness of the magic hour whether miss destiny guessed the truth i cannot say she never came near the lodge as she only haunted it when mr monk appeared on the scene and then merely for the sake of getting what she could out of him but as lucinda was always shopping in the village and the dwellers in burwain were born gossips miss destiny must have heard that her niece was receiving me at all hours and in all places knowing my infatuation she would put two and two together and the resultant four would prove to her suspicious mind that we had come to an understanding but if she did arrive at this knowledge she made no sign perhaps she was content to wait events so long as her half of the fifty thousand pounds was safe at all events she lay snug in the jungle which surrounded her tin hovel like the malignant fairy she was but the golden days came to an end as golden days will since an everlasting paradise is impossible on earth i was forced to keep my promise to cannington and seek london else he would certainly have put in an inopportune appearance of course in spite of his title and looks and the possible support of mr walter monkalways supposing the two methe could do nothing now as gertrude had solemnly promised to be my wife all the same i did not want cannington to come stumbling into loves garden later on when the first ecstasy of delight had passed away i promised myself that he should be formally presented to my newlycaptured diana but at the moment a duet was better than a trio so i explained matters to gertrude and put the rippler in order for a spin to london but you wont remain long away dear she asked me promise me promise me i did promise her with many a kiss on the bare road between burwain and tarhaven so far i had taken her in my car and now it was necessary that she should return only the birds and sheep the sailing clouds and the allbeholding sun saw our embrace so we gave ourselves up fully to the delight the parting indeed was sweet sorrow as shakespeare says and only at the golden moment did i fully understand the feelings of romeo the day was balmy and sunny the roads were dry and the rippler was on her best behavior so the journey to london was extremely pleasant i reached my west kensington flat early in the afternoon as i had telegraphed the probable time of my arrival to the caretakers wife who usually looked after my rooms i found everything in good order there was a brisk fire a good meal and a warm bath awaiting me so i spent the next hour very pleasantly cannington had already been informed that i would call at lady denhams grosvenor square house about five oclock therefore i had ample time to get ready for the visit after writing a few letters and looking into my bankbook i arrayed myself in the purple and fine linen of the west endthat is i assumed a frock coat grey trousers patent leather boots and all the paraphernalia of society then i sallied forth andgiving the rippler a restjumped into a taxicab after the perfect quietness of the country the bustle and roar of the manycolored life in london streets rather appealed to me i was quite sorry when the vehicle stopped at my destination a stately footman took my hat and gloves and showed me into the smokingroom where lord cannington awaited me the boy sprang to his feet and rushed forward to shake hands im so glad to see you vance he said breathlessly how jolly well you look i supposehe began to laugh and could get no further well said i sitting down and accepting a cigarette i presume your laugh means that i am engaged good lord no i dont go so far as that but you went in search of the original of the photograph and having found her i can see that love has proved to be the elixir of life you are quite poetical cannington and excessively complimentary oh rot im only speaking the truth you looked as hard as nails i laughed i dont know but what i am as soft as butter so far as the heart is concerned ah thats the effect of love said cannington wisely that is if you really are in love i say old chap are you in earnest so much so that i am engaged engaged good lord engaged to gertrude monk who loves me as much as i love her good lord said cannington again and rose to his feet to say it i say you havent lost much time have you no circumstances precipitated matters but are you sure that you are wise vance remember marry in haste and repent at leisure i laughed again it seemed so strange that the boy should advise an elderly person such as i was its all right cannington i know what im about you shall be best man delighted andi sayyou dont mind me having said what i did say were old friends you know thats all right boy sit down and ill tell you everything that has taken place since we parted at murchester but i must ask you to be secret cannington flushed as if id be such a bounder as to talk of your love affairs he growled the love affairs in this case are merely a side issue although important enough to me boy what i wish to explain is what i have discovered with regard to mrs caldershaws death oh cannington jumped up again greatly excited are you prying into that still yes it is that case which led me into the engagement with gertrude but i have given up searching further why because i see no clue to follow moreover gertrude wishes me to stop looking into the matter and after all it is no use sullying our love with the sordid details of this crime yet yeti rose in my earnestnesscannington although you are years younger than i am i intend to ask your advice yesthats all right what is it i shall tell you all i know and then you can judge what i mean the boy looked puzzled but sat down again and lent an attentive ear to my recital i walked up and down the room telling everything in detail for i really did wish to hear what he thought cannington was young but shrewd and took a commonsense view of things gertrudes refusal to tell me the name of the person who had driven her from the shop lingered in my mind as i knew we could never be completely happy if there were secrets between us nevertheless i could not reveal what she had said on this point to cannington as it was a matter entirely between ourselves but i intended to tell him everything else and then ask him what he thought of the position of affairs he waited with a grave face i therefore related all that i had discovered beginning with the finding of the white cloak in the field and ending with an account of the interview between gertrude and myself suppressing as i have said the fact that she withheld the name of the mysterious person cannington with his eyes on my face listened intently and without interruption he was acute enough to put his finger on the weak spot who was the person who entered the shop when miss monk went away i dont know said truthfully and glided into an easy explanation to preserve my secret mrs caldershaw wished miss monk to leave without seeing the person and therefore sent her out by the back door so hurriedly that she forgot the cloak and one of her hatpins thats unfortunate muttered cannington his eyes on the carpet perhaps this person killed mrs caldershaw i had gertrudes assertion that this was not the case but for obvious reasons could not impart the information to cannington we cant be sure of that i said smoothly we cant be sure of anything insisted the boy thoughtfully still miss monk evidently left someone with mrs caldershaw and when you arrived on the scene mrs caldershaw was dead it seems to be that the lady killed her the lady why do you think that this person was a lady well a woman a female what you will he said impatiently she assumed the white cloak which was left behind in the kitchen and ran off with your motor car and with the eye ah i cant say im sure on that point said cannington musingly you see the eye turned upso you sayat the burwain house i think he paused yes go on said i encouragingly he shook his head i dont know what to think vance the whole matter is most mysterious and perplexing give me a night to think about the matter it is strange he said suddenly that miss monk wants you to leave the matter alone it is strange i assented and winced but there it is well let it remain so until tomorrow said cannington hastily tomorrow when ive had a good think ill give you my opinion i guessed what was in his mind although delicacy prevented him from speaking plainly to me gertrudes conduct was suspicious and he not being in love with her saw the position more clearly than i did i dont say he suspected her but he apparently believed that she knew more than she chose to tell and thus desired me to leave the case alone in point of fact cannington fancied that gertrude feared what i might discover if i pried further into the matter had he known as i did that she was withholding the name of the person who had called to see mrs caldershaw he might even have taken a blacker view of the matter of course being gertrudes devoted lover and believing in her absolutely i said nothing all the same i felt a trifle uneasy myself especially when i guessed what cannington was thinking about the queen of hearts can do no wrong so i amended the old saying nevertheless i fervently wished that gertrude would be more frank with me only on perfect confidence would perfect love and perfect peace be established to say nothing of perfect happiness after a pause cannington having promised to give me his opinion tomorrow said no more but began to talk of lady mabel it seemed that mr wentworth marr had returned to london and was more attentive than ever hes coming here today to afternoon tea said cannington glancing at his watch in halfanhour i expect hell turn up aunt lucy and mab will be here also and dicky weston oh weston is attentive also well he is in some way he got an inkling that marr was paying court to mabel so he suddenly appeared and has been here morning noon and night i shouldnt be surprised if he proposed soon will lady mabel accept him oh lord who knows what girls will do i think she will and yet marr is a fascinating sort of tamecat man with heaps of money so you may be inclined to go nap on him i shouldnt think a tamecat man would suit your sister i said dryly wait till you see him said cannington with a yawn hes not my style i must confess by the way dickys getting on splendidly with his airship and wants some quiet place to put it together to put it together what do you mean boy its in bits explained cannington and he wishes to cart the several parts to some peaceful part of the country where the putting together wont be overlooked what about burwain oh you know it cannington its a dull little village between gattlingsands and tarhaven weston will find all the quiet he wants there i suppose like all inventors he fears lest his especial secret for flying should be discovered something like that and yet he told me heaps about his airship it seems to be a clever sort of business although it has a gas bag i believe in the heavierthanair business myself what the dickens do you mean aeroplanes you know and cannington entered into a long disquisition on the difference between navigable balloons and those machines which strive to fly birdlike by power of wing alone in the middle of his lecturewhich i confess bored methe footman entered to announce that we were wanted in the drawingroom thither we repaired and were welcomed by mabel lady denham and by a dark untidy little man in whom i recognized dick weston lady denham was a stout fairhaired phlegmaticlooking person who never troubled herself about anyone if she could help it therefore she allowed her niece to pour out the tea and allowed cannington and myself to hand round the bread and butter which latter business of course was right enough she aroused herself so far as to say that i was looking well and reminded her of my poor dear mother after that she relapsed into meditation and devoted herself to making a regular substantial meal there was nothing fairylike about lady denham weston was quiet also and sat near mabel haunched up in his chair like a little gnome but with eyes full of intelligence he was not handsome and being devoted to sciencei suppose one would call airships science although i cant be surehis manner was preoccupied and dry i wondered that a lively girl like mabel could love such an uninteresting personage but she did i saw the flash of her eyes when they rested on his uncomely face and figure but weston was a decent little fellow in spite of his exterior and there was something in his dark face which always attracted animals and children nevertheless lady mabel handsome titled and lively seemed to be the last person to make him a desirable wife i managed to get her into a corner after we had eaten and drunk sufficient mabel tell me which one of your suitors do you intend to take i cant say she whispered back and her lively face grew sad of course i have known dicky all my life and hes a dear but mr marr is really a charming man he will be here soon and then you can judge for yourself marry dicky mabel im sure you love him i advised yes i do and i really believe that he loves me but i cant accept him unless he proposes hes always in the clouds just look at him talking airships to cannington instead of amiable nonsense to me do you think you will be happy with him certainly we get on capitally together but hes a solitary inventor and you are fond of society isnt it rather the coupling of the quick and the dead what horrid things you say she retorted heatedly of course if i marry dicky i shall shake him into a more companionable person hes got plenty of money and i daresay when he finishes this airship hell come out of his shell the only way i can make him talk is by making him jealous so i am waiting for mr marr to flirt with then you are really using mr marr as a stalkinghorse to secure dicky well i am in a way but if dicky will go on being so silly and sitting as mum as an owl i shall marry the stalking horse no mabel dont do that marry for love i cant afford to you silly man cannington and i havent sixpence between us and what do you know about love i know all about it i whispered proudly im engaged oh cyrus her eyes shone like stars and she gasped who is she a lady called miss gertrude monk who lives at burwain before mabel could ask further questions canningtons sharp ear caught the name and he called out to me vance i have just been talking to dicky here about burwain and he thinks it will be the very place to establish his workshop come and tell him all about it bother murmured lady mabel when i want to hear all about your love affair is she pretty more than pretty she is an angel oh all men say that of a girl before marriage all except dicky that is i have never managed to get him enthusiastic enough to call me an angel perhaps he thinks it goes without speaking mabel and vance vance called out cannington impatiently and i had to obey the summons lady mabel pouted and betook herself to the teatable as lady denham requested at the eleventh hour a fresh cup tell me all about burwain vance commanded dicky in his pleasant voice i did my best and drew as vivid a word picture as i was able when weston heard of the absence of a railway station of large tracts of common and of the sparsity of population he rubbed his hands its capital he remarked i shall go down next week and lease a portion of the common outside the village then i shall run up a high fence and take down by rail all the parts of my machine it wont take long to put together then we can all take a fly to the moon not me said mabel firmly i dont want to be smashed up that isnt a compliment to my invention said dicky hotly but i suppose youll come down and see me start that means i shall come down to say goodbye she replied smiling oh dicky youre a dear boy when you are sensible but this airship rubbish mabel i thought you admired my airship he expostulated indignantly how can i when i have never seen it besides a woman never admires anything that takes the attention of a man off herself what nonsense im always thinking of you mabel blushed and laughed skeptically am i to believe that dicky of course and then dicky in spite of the presence of three other people might have gone on to say much morefor he really seemed to be warming to a proposalwhen lady denham sat up and sighed you boys will have to go away she said in her soft slow voice we have to go out to dinner tonight and to the theatre afterwards and then to an at home im sure i would much rather rest in my bed then why dont you aunt lucy asked cannington bluntly my dear boy she said reprovingly i must take mabel out and give her some entertainment besides i have made up my mind to get her married married cried dicky indignantly of course mabel isnt cut out for an old maid perhaps dicky thinks that i am said mabel looking slyly at the untidy inventor that is if he ever thinks of anything but airships i think of no end of things said weston rather crossly and i dont see why you are in such a hurry to get married i am not in a hurry really said cannington uneasily this conversation is growing personal we all belong to the family here said lady denham wearily i look on cyrus as a son his mother and i were at school together a very charming girl she was too is dicky one of the family asked mabel with a glance at the inventor of course i am he said hotly for mabel seemed to be rousing him out of his absentmindedness havent i known you and cannington for years i dont think we have ever known you said cannington with a laugh you are always in the clouds as an airship inventor should be said i pointedly airship said lady mabel teasingly its nothing but a gas balloon it isnt snapped dicky jumping up greatly excited by this insult to his pet invention when the works are established at burwain you come down and you will see exactly what i mean oh i shall come to burwain with pleasure said mabel sending a look in my direction i am very anxious to go to burwain really said weston and his cheeks flushed after all it appeared as though cannington had overrated dickys absentmindedness for he was singularly alert and watchful in my opinion he looked upon lady mabel wotton as his own especial property and therefore was not troubling himself to make a too impulsive proposal perhaps he was waiting to launch his airship before launching himself on the sea of matrimonial troubles but he said no more although the flush spoke volumes for lady denham struck in quietly in her placid voice i thought mr marr was coming to tea she said looking round slowly i believe hes entering the house now said cannington with the air of a listener i heard a motor drive up a charming man said lady denham lazily and devoted to mabel oh is he growled weston darting an angry look at the girl which she sustained with a sweetly unconscious air he must weston appeared to be doomed to interruption for just as he was beginning a diatribe on his rival the door opened and a footman announced mr wentworth marr in grandiloquent tones a man entered and i gasped as well i might mr wentworth marr of london was none other than mr walter monk of burwain chapter xv an explanation the little gentleman minced into the room smiling and bowing as i stood in the shadow removed from the strong light of the electrics he did not catch sight of me when he first entered exactly as he behaved at burwain so did he behave in londonthat is as a specious humbug of course he looked as though he had just been taken out of a bandbox and his petitmitre air was more pronounced than ever with the assurance of a man accustomed to attention he made a tour of the circle lady denham you are looking more charming than ever lady mabel the good wine of your beauty needs no bush to advertise its perfection cannington i am delighted to see you again mr weston this last name was pronounced less effusivelyi trust the airship stocks are rising ha ha then he tittered at his small joke made a comprehensive bow and looked at me i quite expected to see him turn pale i half expected to see him fly from the house where he was sailing under false colors but i had yet to learn the complete selfpossession of mr walter monk alias mr wentworth marr he might have foreseen the meeting so coolly did he eye me through his pincenez the tables were turned with a vengeance for i felt more like the culprit than did mr monk this is our oldest friend said mabel and unless she had spoken i do not know how the little traitor would have acted mr cyrus vance the dramatic author i believe remarked mr monkit is just as well to call him by his true name to prevent confusionand bowed politely yes said i with a cool smile there was no reason at that moment why i should denounce the little man and he played his comedy so deliciously that from sheer admiration of his impudence i felt compelled to take a judicious part in the same i am happy to meet you mrerer marr old chap put in cannington quite unaware that anything was wrong yes of course mr marr thank you observed the fraud with a bow you flatter me mr vance he wasas i have saidas cool as a cucumber to all outward appearances nevertheless as he turned sideways to answer a question put by lady denham i saw the perspiration bead his forehead i knew that he was controlling himself with a great effort although he never turned a hair he was evidently taken aback by my complete calmness yet it relieved his mind when he saw that i did not intend to make a scene yet had i denounced him he undoubtedly would have been prepared with a crafty explanation for he was too clever a schemer to leave anything to chance and as i guessed my chance observation that i knew cannington had placed him to a certain degree on his guard with wonderful selfcontrol he spoke to lady denham and laughed with mabel and deftly led the conversation on to theatrical topics when it became general he strolled over to me in a light and airy manner until he was at my elbow and when are we to see a play at the west end by mr cyrus vance he asked gaily dropping his voice immediately at the end of the question to whisper explanations when we leave oh said i loudly and replying to his public inquiry i hope next year will see me successful as the author of a comedy then i in turn dropped my voice count on my silence monk drew a long breath of relief but went on with his comedy i hope you will put me down for a box he said effusively i am a great admirer of the drama you shall be on the free list mr marr i said with ostentatious gush the whispered words had not been heard by anyone in the room so mr marr and i understood one another thoroughly without anyone being the wiser i half fancied canningtons observant eyes might have seen our byplay and his sharp ears might have overheard but for once he seemed to have missed his opportunity shortly mr monk more at ease was conversing gaily on the news of the day lady denham seemed to favour him but mabel had a contemptuous look on her face several times when he addressed her i felt certain that only his supposed wealth attracted her and that she had no respect for his tamecat antics and the cream of the joke was that mr walter monk passing himself off as mr wentworth marr had only five hundred a year i could not help giving vent to an audible laugh as the humour of the situation struck me why do you laugh cyrus asked mabel turning suddenly i have thought of a good joke for a comic scene in a drama said i grimly may we hear it asked mr monk audaciously for he must have guessed the reason of my unseasonable merriment certainly not sir when you pay your money in the stalls you shall hear the joke delivered on the stage i hope its a good one said cannington scoffingly its as funny a joke as i ever heard of i replied cheerfully and my eyes sought those of mr monk significantly i shall look forward to hearing it he said bowing politely and perhapsas i know several of the managersi may be able to assist you in getting your masterpiece staged my card and he passed along a piece of pasteboard which was inscribed mr wentworth marr stratford street st jamess i am in rooms there mr vance as i dont intend to take a house until i can find a lady to preside at my dinnertable weston scowled at this and lady denham smiled benignly oh you millionaires are so modest she said in her slow cool voice why you have a country house in essex a shootingbox in scotland and a villa at nice with tremendous audacity the fraud bowed as each place was mentioned i hope to receive you in them all dear lady mr vance also i trust will honor me with his company oh ill come and see you with pleasure said i grimly mr monk impressed me as a kind of casanova so matchless was his impertinence i wondered how an honorable girl such as gertrude undoubtedly was came to have so scheming an adventurer as a father i was also puzzled to think why mr monk whom i knew to be almost penniless should wish to marry a pauper aristocrat like lady mabel wotton but as yet i was not in a position to fit the pieces of the puzzle together and had to await enlightenment from the archrogue himself i just looked in my dear ladies said mr monk accepting the title of millionaire quite complacently to invite you to a box at the curtain theatre early next weektuesday is the day to be quite precise there is a new play which i think you will enjoy lady denham delighted she yawned i like going to the theatre one can sit still all the time and say nothing the performers on the stage say all that is to be said replied mr monk smiling suavely lady mabel may i count on you certainly she answered swiftly with a sly glance at the scowling weston and perhaps lord cannington thanks no mr marr i have to go back to murchester leaves up thats a pity mr vance if i am in town i shall be delighted i answered mildly and wondered more than ever at the audacity of the little man he knew that i could expose him as a fraud and must have been puzzled to know why i did not yet he had the hardihood to drag me into his schemes of posing as a millionaire then that is all settled and now he added making a comprehensive bow really and truly i must take my leave perhaps mr vance i can give you a lift in my motor you are really too good i replied accepting promptly and with scarcely a repressed chuckle but i say vance i want you to go to dinner at the savoy with me and afterwards to the empire cried cannington catching my arm while mr monk was shaking hands and taking his leave my dear boy in any case i must go home and dress let us change the dinner into a supper at the savoy and ill come here at nine oclock to accompany you to the empire cannington was satisfied with this alteration and nodded then in my turn i took leave of the ladies and departed in the company of my proposed fatherinlaw at the door a really magnificent motor far surpassing my machine was waiting a brougham motor with a chauffeur and a liveried footman how mr monk contrived to live in this style on five hundred a year i could not conceive the machine alone must have cost three times the amount of his entire income then with indignation i thought of my dear uncomplaining girl at burwain with her one poor frock and her touching belief in the honesty and kindheartedness of this little villain when we were safe in the motor and the footman had received his orders to take the vehicle hometo strafford street no doubtmr monk made himself comfortable then patted my knee in a most amiable manner very good indeed my dear sir very good indeed he said suavely and in a most selfcontrolled manner you kept my little secret in a way worthy of a man of the world thank you i am waiting for an explanation now i said dryly do you think i owe you one i am of that opinion mr monk hush he glanced anxiously through the glass at the backs of the footmen and chauffeur here in london i am mr marr mr wentworth marr i said mockingly may i ask why i do not see he said smoothly that you have any right to ask questions concerning my private business i must correct you there i answered hotly lady mabel wotton her brother and lady denham are friends of mine i do not wish to see them deceived mrererwentworth marr that is very creditable to your heart mr vance but i fail to see how i am deceiving them you wish to marry lady mabel is that a crime i am a widower and am free to take another wife not under the pretence that you are a wealthy man how do you know asked mr monk smiling politely that i am not a wealthy man mr vance pshaw man i rejoined heatedly for his cool insolence was getting on my nerves you have a life interest in five hundred a year and a tumbledown house with a few acres of land at burwain so far as you know mr vance those are all my possessions but when we reach my rooms he leaned forward and peered through the misty glass we are nearly there now i am glad to say you will have an explanation which will astonish you had you recognized me when at lady denhams i did recognize you had you denounced me i should have said he went on pleasantly i should have made the explanation then and there ah said i meaningly i thought my chance mention of canningtons name at burwain forearmed you he nodded and chuckled in his infernally oily manner it was just possible seeing that lord cannington and lady mabel to say nothing of lady denham were our mutual friends that we might meet so i made ready i certainly did not expect to meet you quite so soon however tell me he glanced sideways at me curiously why did you not address me by my real name i remembered that you were gertrudes father how luckyfor me said mr monk sarcastically julia destiny hinted that you were in love with my daughter she didnt hint enough i am engaged to your daughter without my consent i ask it now then you shall not have it i laughed your consent matters very little mr monk marr i tell you marr and gertrude will never marry you without my permission you may be sure of that i am not at all sure of it she loves you better than you deserve but when she finds that you are keeping her in poverty at burwain while you live in splendor in london and under another name which looks fishy will she continue to regard you as the perfect father mr monk moved uneasily in his seat here we are he said when the car stopped in a somewhat dark street in my rooms i can explain and in any case i am obliged to you for carrying off the situation so well not that i was unprepared had you driven me into a corner but as a gentleman i do not like stage melodrama in private life yet you make ready for every opportunity to exercise it i retorted as the footman opened the door your explanation will take place in private he said sharply and we alighted the motor departed hastilyto the nearest garage i supposeand mr monk ushered me up a flight of welllighted stairs these are my quarters he said complacently and i was shown into a really splendid hall perfectly decorated it is useless to describe the rooms in detail but mr monk had done himself full justice in the way of art and comfort we went into a moorish smokingroom which reminded me of cairo and i accepted coffee and cigarettes perhaps mr monk had some hazy idea connected with the eastern decorations that having partaken of his bread and salt i would not betray him for he pressed tobacco and mocha on me very assiduously i took all he offered but reserved my private right of judgment to save lady mabel from this fraudulent adventurer by denouncing him was not a betrayal in my eyes the sole thing that had prevented me stripping him of his fine feathers hitherto had been the undoubted fact that he was gertrudes father and so i had told him in the motor you see that i am comfortable here said mr monk who was smoking a very fine cigar but i beg leave to contradict you when you say that i do not give my daughter sufficient money gertrude has whatever she asks for and being fond of the simple life is quite content pardon my contradicting you but thinking that you have but five hundred a year and knowing your luxurious tastes miss monk denies herself all save the necessaries of life so that you may have more money to spend did she know you were a millionaire i am not a millionaire said monk snapping for the first time as hitherto he had kept his temper in a most aggravating manner i understood lady denham to say that you were i reminded him politely like all women lady denham exaggerates i have a good many thousands but i cannot call myself a millionaire and the house in the country in essex remember that is true enough oh yes though it can hardly be called an estate but the shootingbox in scotland i rented one last year for a time i see you saved the situation in that way and the villa at nice a friend of mine lends me his i can ask anyone there and apparently intend to pass it off as your own no he said smiling graciously you are mistaken it is true that i asked lady denham and lady mabel to nice i mentioned the villa but i did not declare it was mine they hastily concluded that it was from what you left unsaid i presume well and your change of name that has to do with my money a distant cousin of mine died three or four years ago in australia and left me nearly one hundred thousand pounds on condition that i took his name i complied with the necessity in a legal manner without letting my daughter know and now enjoy the money i am quite rich enough to marry lady mabel if she will have me that may be but when she learns that you have a daughter as old as she is i doubt if she will accept you particularly as i know what you would say particularly as that weston man loves her not quite that mr marr particularly as she loves the weston man but may i ask why you keep your daughter in ignorance of your change of name and your possession of wealth listen he said throwing away his cigarette i inherit five hundred a year from my late brotherthat is as you say i have a life interest in it after my death it goes to gertrude as a matter of fact she enjoys it now as it goes to keep up the lodge at burwain and pay for her necessary needs that she chooses to dress plainly and live plainly is not my fault the money is to her hand when she wants it under these circumstances since she has all she requires i do not see why she need know that i live a different life in london as she would not join me here if i offered to take her on my part i am a man still young and i wish to marry again since i am well off why then should i encumber myself with a grownup daughter i cant answer that question as i dont quite follow your eminently selfish reasoning but as it is i propose to take charge of your grownup daughter then you can do what you like so long as you dont marry lady mabel under false pretences you will tell lady mabel yes and cannington also i should not be surprised if he horsewhipped you mr monk winced i shall take my chance of that he said bravely enough and to do him the justice he was no coward so far as flesh and blood was concerned but suppose i get ahead of you and explain myself in that case lady mabel will not marry you its probable although beyond the fact that i forgot to tell her of my change of name i have done nothing wrong nothing wrong when you masquerade i tell you i dont masquerade he cried with sudden heat and springing to his feet my name has been legally changed and the money is mine by right i really am under an act of parliament mr wentworth marr i daresay it was vanity on my part to lessen my years by not confessing to having a daughter of gertrudes age but that is not a crime but you are not going to blackmail me mr vance so dont think it i dont propose to i simply intend to tell cannington and lady mabel the truth then they can deal with the situation monk snapped his delicate fingers tell them the truth by all means he said derisively its bound to come out sooner or later striver knows that i appear in london as marr striver the gardener how did he learn i asked taken aback ah sneered the little man you dont feel quite so certain that you hold the keys of the situation do you mr vance yes striver knows he saw me in piccadilly when i was getting out of my motor and went to ask my chauffeur questions what sort of questions about my possessing a motor i suppose striver knows my income and didnt see how i could afford such a machine also he has the impudence of old nick himself at all events he learned from my chauffeur that i was marr and thinking something was wrong as you did he learned my address and had an interview to prevent his telling gertrude i was obliged to shut his mouth and confess all how did you shut his mouth i asked hastily i intimated said monk coolly that if he could get money enough and went to school to improve his education he could marry gertrude what this time i sprang to my feet and a fine rage i was in you dared to make a bargain with that fellow i had to shut his mouth said monk sullenly and sat down so he lives in a fools paradise you dont suppose that gertrude would marry striver i never thought so for one moment no more than she would marry you she is going to marry me i insisted at white heat nothing of the sort said the little man obstinately now that you have learned the truth i am not going to be under your thumb i shall give up any idea of marrying lady mabel i shall bring gertrude to london and i shall marry her to lord cannington youll do nothing of the sort who will stop me there is no stoppage in the matter of the kind you mean whether i or your own self tell lady mabel the facts of the case matters very little but when the truth becomes known she will not marry you and cannington who is my best friend will not marry gertrude he would not even admire her unless i gave him permission since he knows that she is my promised wife who told him that asked monk wrathfully i did it is true gertrude is going to marry me and you can do your best to prevent it and another thing mr monk or marr or whatever you choose to call yourself you had better confess the truth at once weston is going to set up his airship factory at burwain and lady mabel is bound to go down and see him you will understand the necessity to retreat gracefully from your position before you are kicked out as to striver what about striver sneered the little villain who was desperately pale by this time for my words had gone home he wont give in you have got the better of me but striver will get the better of you i snapped my fingers as mr monk had done himself a few minutes previously that for mr striver i said contemptuously do you think i care for a country bumpkin such as he is gertrude has promised to be my wife so the rest matters little monk nursed his chin on his hand and looked remarkably sullen after a couple of minutes silence he looked up see here i shall make a bargain with you if i withdraw from lady mabels society and court her no more will you hold your tongue no lady denham must learn the truth you are at her house under false pretences as you choose he shrugged but his eyes glittered wickedly behind the pincenez but if you will hold your tongue for say a fortnight until i can retreat gracefully from my position by feigning to make a trip to the continent i will offer no opposition to your marriage with gertrude oh i have no wish to be hard on you mr monk your opposition to my marriage doesnt matter since gertrude will think very little of you when she learns the truth i shall hold my tongue for a fortnight and you must give up lady denhams acquaintance altogether also lady mabels and lord canningtons acquaintance and youll let me tell gertrude myself he entreated now beaten yes said i after a pause i shall let you tell gertrude yourself thank you said monk in a low tone and in return i advise you to beware of striver you have conquered me you wont conquer him and he smiled in a most evil manner chapter xvi strivers threat i was having my fill of surprises by this time and was beginning to wish that the matter should end by the matter i mean this mootley crime the present cause of all these happenings by stumbling on that fine adventure i had become engaged to gertrude and to keep cannington from plundering my preserves i had come to london here at his aunts house i had met gertrudes father masquerading as a millionaire there was no use his denying this his change of name may have been legal and he may have acquired a competency by the death of his australian cousin but he certainly could not rank with the park lane fraternity yet lady denham believed him to be one and he encouraged the idea i took my leave of the smoothfaced little man with the resolve to keep my promise so long as he abstained from calling on lady denham and withdrew his pretentions to lady mabels hand there was no need for me to strip him of his peacocks feathers there was no need even to tell gertrude as the revelation would not change her feelings towards me in any way certainly the ingenious mr striver knew and i wondered that he had not made use of his information before to force monks hand but striver was a patient man and perhaps had waited until he had acquired his aunts wealth before pressing his suit then if gertrude refused he could threaten to tell her of monks secret doings unless that gentleman exercised his parental authority so far as to insist upon the unequal marriage butand the reflection made me chucklethey were both a day after the fair for gertrude had promised to be my wife and i was equal to striver in the knowledge of which he hoped to make use it was a poor lookout for the handsome joseph and in spite of monks warning i had no fears that the man could harm myself or my darling in any way i remained a week in london and enjoyed myself along with canningtonthat is i went to the theatres to various at homes to certain small dances and to suppers dinners motor drives and all the rest of it including bridge drives although i had no particular regard for that fashionable game but my heart was far away with gertrude and i felt very much bored in spite of the boys lively society i think he noticed my abstracted condition at times for he proposed that i should leave him and return to burwain i refused since i had arranged to remain a week i heard from gertrude every day and replied at length so that somewhat ameliorated my desperate situation moreover i wished to remain in london to see if mr monk intended to keep his promise one daythe last of my stay in town as a matter of factcannington turned up at my club with two pieces of news he delivered both over a brandy and soda and a cigar weston has been to burwain and has got his land lease for a few months said cannington and tomorrow he is taking down a gang of men to erect fences within a weekso he saysthe fences will be up and in a fortnight the sheds will be erected then he can take down the various parts of his airship to put the beastly thing together but to get fences and sheds rigged up in such a hurry will take a very great number of men of course however dicky has thirty thousand pounds a year so much as that why doesnt mabel marry him then she wants money and love weston can give her both do you think so really old chap i am certain of it he was dreadfully jealous of our friend mr marr well i think he is you see dicky looks on mabel as his own property and hates anyone to poach i wish he would adjust the situation but hang him he wontthat is he has done his best and cant why dont you ask him his intentions you are the head of the family cannington grew red oh hang it i cant it would look as though i were shying mabel at the chaps head it will all come right in time unless mabel in a fit of pique accepts marr she wont do that hes bunked out of the business really said i with feigned surprise and why lord only knows said cannington indifferently aunt lucy is in a fine state about his clearing he wrote and said he had a sudden call on business to south americasomething to do with a silver mine i fancyand would be away for a year aunt lucy says this means he has given up any idea of making mab his wife and she blames poor mab and says it was her flirting with dicky that sent old marr off its just as well cannington weston is a much better match for your sister and is quite rich enough besides being younger but has marr really gone away i suppose so i havent seen him about town lately and he said that he was sailing soon for new york im sure i dont care he can go hang for me he laughed aunt lucy said i ought to thrash him for compromising mabel but thats all bosh mabs quite able to look after herself and i cant lay hands on a man old enough to be my father what do you think ought i to thrash him privately i thought that it would do mr marrmonk good to have a trifle of physical pain and when cannington knew the whole truth i was not at all sure but what he would reconsider his position and thrash the scoundrel but since monk had kept his promise i had to keep mine so i merely shrugged my shoulders hes too old boy besides your sister never cared for him when the airship is floatedis that the correct termweston is sure to propose and you expect mab to take him with a thank you flashed out the boy growing red and haughty well said i with a look of surprise she loves him thats true enough but shes not going to be at the beck and call of master dick as i told him when when he came grumbling to me that mab had refused him he asked her to marry him i exclaimed cannington nodded dicky got so mad with the way in which aunt lucy talked that evening you were there and with the way in which marr seemed to be so sure of his ground that he proposed the next day mab refused him at once as he seemed to think he only to ask and to have i told him it served him jolly well right and that i admired mabs spirit so do i was my hearty reply but i dont think weston meant his offer to be taken in that light hes a absentminded man and oh hang it a refusal will do him good said cannington crossly and perhaps hell drop being such an ass of course he wants me to persuade mab but i told him i wouldnt lift a finger well then vance you see that mab has lost both her lovers at once marr has sheered offlike his impudence although im gladand dicky has been sent away with a flea in his ear and serve him jolly well right and how is mabel as jolly as a sandboy bless her in spite of aunt lucys nagging i have asked her to come down to murchester for a week she can take rooms at the lion hotel and collar some old woman as a chaperon then we can have a good time together come down also no boy i must return to burwain tomorrow and when am i to be asked down to see miss monk very shortly as soon as i have her fathers consent oh she has a father yes but no mother by the way i said swiftly to avert further questions you didnt give me your opinion of the case i put to you i dont know what sort of opinion to give said cannington testily the best thing to be done is to find out who it was entered the shop when miss monk went away i can think of nothing else canningtons opinion was mine also but if gertrude refused to speak i did not see what i could do besides she was anxious for me to abandon the case i felt inclined to do so myself much as the mystery piqued me however i ceased to discuss it with canningtonwho really took very little interest in intricaciesand we spent the evening at theatre next day i furbished up the rippler and departed at top speed for burwain i flew so to speak on the wings of love as i was desperately anxious to reach the side of my darling it was a wet day and the roads were in a very bad condition nevertheless i broke every rule with regard to speed and defied the police traps i broke through three i know and managed to escape having the number of my car taken by the time i reached burwain i had accumulated a tidy sum in fines i did not care i would have paid three times as much to reach gertrude but the fun of it was that owing to my desperate haste there was no chance of my being made to pay the money as i had flown past with the speed of a kingfisher more haste less speed was not a true proverb in this instance so anxious was i to hold gertrude in my arms that i halted the rippler before the gate of the lodge and proposed dripping as i was to have an interview before driving on to the robin redbreast i soon made my way to the door and rang the bell the house looked forlorn and dismal in the misty rain and there was a chill in the atmosphere but love cares very little for such discomforts so i smiled gaily at eliza when she appeared at the door she was a sourfaced elderly woman with a silent tongue and usually never opened her mouth even to me although i was a constant visitor but on this occasion with a somewhat disturbed face she spoke eagerly and seemed pleased to see me thank goodness you have come sir she whispered with a backward glance i know youll make him clear out make who clear out eliza i asked staring that joseph sir the gardener yes sir ever since you have been away hes been haunting the house its sheer lunacy sir but hes in love with miss gertrude and follows her like a dog an hour ago he forced himself into the house and is now talking with her in the drawingroom andoh sir she caught hold of me as i compressed my lips and strode past her dont anger him hes a desperate man ill break his neck said i drily let me go woman and wrenching my sleeve from her grasp i walked to the drawingroom door and flung it open cyrus gertrude saw me at once and flung herself across the long room to nestle in my arms i am so glad you are here heheshe pointed to the gardenerhes quite mad striver dressed much the same as he had been when i interviewed him in the mootley corner shop stood sullenly at the end of the room apparently he had pinned gertrude in a corner but his turning to see who was entering had given her the chance and now she was safe by my side the fellow looked as handsome as ever but his face was scarlet with anger and his fists hung clenched by his side feeling myself to be the master of the situation i was comparatively cool what the devil do you mean man i said with pointed and intended insolence he is mad he is mad cried gertrude clinging to me and replying for the man who still kept a sullen silence he forced his way into the house and has been saying dreadful things things you cannot deny said striver moistening his dry lips with his tongue mr vance you had better keep out of this or it will be the worse for her and he pointed to gertrude i removed her arms from my neck and walked straight across the room before striver was aware of my intention i had my hands on his throat and was shaking him as a terrier does a rat with desperate efforts he tried to tear away my grasp but could not do so and his face was rapidly turning black with strangulation when gertrude ran to my side dont kill him for gods sake cyrus i loosened my grip and striver staggering back fell into a chair then somewhat unjustly i turned on gertrude are you thinking of him i demanded in a thick voice for at the moment i was not master of myself i am thinking of you she replied clasping her hands who else would i think of i dont wish to see you hanged for murder you would hang together gasped the gardener recovering his breath with a gigantic effort with my dying breath i would tell the truth what truth i asked fiercely gertrude clung to me dont listen to him dont listen to him ah striver sneered with pale lips shes afraid you see i am not afraid cried gertrude her eyes flashing and drawing herself up to her full height cyrus knows everything i only asked him not to listen because i wish you to go away and rid me of your hateful presenceyour hateful presence she repeated incoherently striver gave a sob if you knew how i loved you stop i had control of my feelings by this time it is no use your saying these things miss monk is engaged to me shell never marry you never said the man between his teeth i shall denounce her to the police as whatbe quiet gertrudeas what mr striver as the woman who murdered my aunt he cried staggering to his feet i laughed and the two stared at me in astonishment the sound of merriment at such a tragic moment startled them but i saw swiftly that it was useless to act a melodramatic scene and was half sorry that i had so nearly strangled the gardener now i was cool and composed and before proceeding to act wished to know where i stood sit down striver sit down gertrude they did as i asked them in sheer amazement now then i took a seat myself perhaps you will explain he forced his way began gertrude when i stopped her i know that much mr striver is in love with you i dont blame him for that since no man can help his feelings he has forced his way into this house to compel you by threats to be his wife i condemn him on those grounds for no human being has a right to coerce another now then the situation being plain perhaps striver you will speak out if i had been violent the man could have met me more easily but my perfect fairness and coolness confounded him and he stared stupidly at me i grew impatient come striver speak up i dont wish to condemn you unheard on what grounds do you accuse miss monk of this crime she was at my aunts house on that evening i know as much from her own lips i also know that she left her white cloak behind and a certain hatpin well he was more confounded than ever she stabbed my aunt he muttered i never did i never did cried gertrude breathlessly my dear said i patting her hand there is no need for you to deny that i am aware of your innocence but i wish to know upon what grounds mr striver bases his accusation i shall tell them to the police said the gardener rising you cant do that struck in gertrude without incriminating yourself oh indeed said i lightly perhaps you will explain striver you see i am treating you with all justice i dont want your justice he said rudely ah i retorted meaningly perhaps you want the justice of a british jury striver come out with it the young man clenched his fists if i ruin myself i shall ruin her you shant have her if i cant allow me to tell you striver i said repressing gertrude that all this bombast has no effect on me prove your accusation you cant without incriminating yourself repeated gertrude drawing a breath cyrus he told me that ill tell him interrupted the gardener fiercely i know that i run the risk of standing in the dock but you miss monk will be by my side its my love for you which makes me risk my neck so that you can put a rope round the neck of the woman you love i said cheerfully although i confess that the mans decisive tone made me uneasy that is an affectionate way of acting well are you going to confess i am not afraid to confess said striver in thick tones but more composed you cant make use of my confession without proving herhe pointed to gertrudeto be a murderess and a thief a lie a lie moaned the girl i have been very patient with you striver i said suppressing my anger with an effort but if you call miss monk names ill knock your teeth down your throat im not afraid of you mr vance no youre afraid of the police and so is she he pointed again i am not denied gertrude and stood up calm and unflinching to deny it oh damn your fencing come to the point forgive me for swearing gertrude but this longwinded ass would provoke a saint striver took no notice of the insult he plunged with a gasp directly into the middle of his story and i soon saw how it was that he did not dare to denounce gertrude my aunt wished me to marry miss monk he said rapidly and with his eyes on the carpethe was standing up by the wayand as i loved her i wished for nothing better my aunt said that she could give me gabriel monks money after her death as she had concealed its whereabouts in her glass eye oh i said half to myself so i was right yes you were right assented striver quickly i wanted my aunt to show me the eye when she was alive but she always refused and said that it would remain in her head until she died a violent death mr striver yes she always declared that because of this secret she would not die in her bed she was afraid that miss monk would kill her oh rubbish i interrupted impatiently miss monk would not kill a fly as you well know mrs caldershaw must have been mad i think she was murmured gertrude clinging to me she was not mad enough to give away the secret of the eye to me said striver savagely i heard from miss destiny that miss monk had learned from some diary of gabriel monks that my aunt knew the secret of the money yes interrupted gertrude looking up but not of the eye seeing that you murdered my aunt i believe you did contradicted the gardener bluntly miss destiny said that you were going over to mootley to see my aunt i went over also on that evening i asked startled yes and some time before miss monk arrived i saw my aunt and asked her to tell me the secret she refused as she only wished me to have the money after her death then miss monk arrived and my aunt smuggled me up the stairs into a bedroom from above i saw miss monk enter the back room with my aunt i returned to the bedroom to wait and fell asleep when i awoke it was quite dark i stole down the stairs into the back room and found it in darkness also i found my aunts body and the eye missing my aunt was not quite dead as she moaned while i was wondering what to do i heard a motor arrive my motor i asked swiftly yes i then saw in a flash that being found with my aunt dying i might be accused of murder and of stealing her eye seeing that i wanted it so much i could not risk anyone entering the back room so i fumbled for the key it was on the outside and you entered the shop mr vance before i could get it but there was a bolt on the inside of the door and this i slipped when you tried the door you could not get in afterwards when you were filling your tank with petrol i came out softly and stole up the stairs with the white cloak why did you take the white cloak i knew that it belonged to miss monk as i had frequently seen her wearing it i wished to keep it as evidence that she had murdered my aunt in the back room i left the cloak when i had to depart in a hurry said gertrude defiantly so you say sneered striver but i believe differently however i managed to get safely back to the bedroom and wondered how i could escape it then struck me that i could assume the cloak as a disguise i found a veil also and put that round my cap in the dusk with the long cloak and the veil i thought i would look like a woman and could steal out oh i said with a gasp then you ran away with my car yes i did he said with a sort of triumph i waited my chance to get out of the place as i was afraid lest i should be accused of the murder when you entered the back room attracted by the moan of the dying woman yes go on well then i stole down the stairs and turned the key which i already knew was on the outside you had set your motor going so i ran out and leaped in that man giles saw mealthough i did not know his name at the timeand i put on all speed to escape luckily you had turned the motor round in the murchester direction i spun along and met miss destiny in her trap as you know at the time i didnt think it was her then it struck me that shea stranger as i believedmight say how she had seen the motor and i would be traced i therefore slewed the machine into the field through the gate i left it stranded there and concealed the cloak which i found along with the veil i put in go on mr striver theres nothing more to tell he said sulkily i walked to murchester and caught a train as i had not the motor or the white cloak i felt that i was safe and so i was you are not very safe now i remarked rising to stretch myself suppose i tell the police then i denounce miss monk as guilty she was in the back room i had left long long before interposed gertrude very pale i was in the back room also striver yet i am innocent however i can see that if i talk you can talk so for the present in any event i shall say nothing about the matter you can go i pointed to the door he stood his ground and looked at gertrude you are in my power said he and you are in ours i retorted cheerfully it wont do striver things shall remain as they are for the present miss monk is not for you i shall tell the police he threatened by all means and cut your own throat go i flung open the door he looked with deadly hatred at gertrude and myself then departed in silence when i turned towards my darling she had fainted chapter xvii lady mabels visit of course in daring striver to do his worst i knew that i was running considerable risk the man was crazy with love and might be sufficiently reckless of consequences to himself to tell the police all that he had confessed to us then gertrude would certainly be arrested on his evidence striver as an accomplice after the fact would be arrested also and then justice would have to remove the bandage from her eyes to learn which of the two was guilty in my own mind i had no doubt of gertrudes innocence but an unbiassed jury might take and probably would take on the declarations of striver a very different view i had dared much on the spur of the moment and had defied a jealous man therefore for the next two or three days i was uneasy but i did not permit gertrude to see that i was doubtful of strivers silence when she recovered from her faint she expressed herself afraid lest he should speak out and in point of fact voiced my sentiments but in order to pacify her i made light of her fears my dear much as the man loves you he certainly will not place his neck in a noose to be revenged on you i said again and again he is too deeply implicated by running away with my car and with your cloak and with being in the house when the crime was actually committed to dare to tell the police the truth even if he did go with his story i doubt if you would be arrested as on the face of it he looks much more guilty do you think he is guilty cyrus she asked tremulously well i spoke doubtfully some such thought struck me once or twice he was in the house he wanted the eye to learn the secret of the hidingplace and he knew that you had paid a visit he might have murdered the old lady with your hatpin so as to throw the blame on you and then might have hoped to implicate you still further by using your cloak as a disguise that giles mistook him for a womanwhich he counted uponwould of course aid him to entangle you yet more in the snare but i cant be sure if he is actually guilty i hope not i hope not murmured gertrude anxiously it would be such a terrible thing for him to murder his relative i dont mind joseph at all if he would only get rid of this crazy affection he has for me i dont know why he loves me so look in the glass and youll see i said kissing her oh nonsense cyrus said gertrude impatiently how can you joke when things are so serious i am a very ordinary girl and joseph is half mad i really believe ohshe stopped short and looked at methat eye i saw what she meant yes i nodded that struck me also joseph might have been the one who placed it on that drawingroom table to implicate you in that caseif we can only force him to confess as muchhe must be guilty of the murder i hope noti hope not she said again shiveringly and yetthen she went off on a new line of thoughtif he placed the eye there why should he take it away again he may not have done so do you know gertrude i should not be surprised if your aunt julia had it she wanted the eye as we know because she desires to handle the money apparently she told joseph of your visit to mootley so that he might go there on the same day and anticipate your learning the secret from mrs caldershaw but what would she gain by that she would be able to make joseph give her part of the money when he found it i replied quickly then you think she anticipated the murder not for one moment my dear with all her faults your aunt is not wicked enough to deliberately urge a man to commit murder but she sent joseph ahead first trusting that mrs caldershaw would tell him the secret before you arrived then he could return with the cipher and they could understand it togethersolve it that it but as things turned outall this is pure theory mindjoseph did not show her the eye but he could not have had it by his own confession insisted gertrude quite so but who else could have placed the eye on the drawingroom table my dearest i suspected giles i suspected you and i think in a way i suspected striver since he was working in the garden now i am sure he put it there because he was unable to read the cipher and so made use of it to implicate you miss destiny found it and probably now it is in her possession that glass eye has a trick of disappearing the disappearing eye said gertrude with a wan smile but you are wrong about aunt julia cyrus she was with me all the time when you saw the eye and i walked with her to the gate myself we were not in the drawingroom i was disappointed when i heard this in that case she could not have taken it i mused mr monk could not as he was with me all the time cyrus how can you think that papa would do such a thing i smiled covertly my experience of mr monk showed me that he could act in an extremely underhanded and mean way when it suited his own tricky ends to do so but bearing my promise in mind i did not dare to explain myself to the girl i merely said that perhaps after all striver took the eye back again as he had every opportunity of doing so but he would have produced it when we talked insisted gertrude again no that would incriminate him too deeply however this eye as i have said seems to have a trick of appearing and disappearing so it will turn up again meanwhile we will give mr striver the benefit of the doubt and assume him to be innocent although im hanged if his actions look like it he wont say anything you may depend upon that striver did not and evidently my policy of daring him to do his worst had proved successful he remained a week in burwain but did not come near the house then he disappeared mrs gilfin told me the news striver had given his cottage into the charge of some cousin and had gone away for an indefinite period didnt say where he was going chatted mrs gilfin i asked john to find out from the gossip in the bar but he couldnt but knowing men as i do i know where hes gone where cuckoo i asked anxiously for bearing in mind what the gardener knew i was eager to know his whereabouts to london town said mrs gilfin solemnly young men with money always go there to have a spree and since youve caught the eye of miss gertrude master cyrus dear that young mans given up trying with his aunts money hes gone to enjoy himself i doubted it striver was too deeply in love to get rid of his crazy passion so easily still it was possible that he had gone to london to drown his disappointment in an orgy so i took the news of his departure to gertrude although i did not tell her of mrs gilfins belief i found the girl puzzling over a letter from her father hes going to new york on business she said handing me the letter now i wonder what his business can be cyrus and why did he go away without coming down to tell me personally and say goodbye i read mr monks precise handwriting carefully he had kept to my agreement with him and had left the country he would be away he wrote to his daughter for an indefinite period and hoped to return a wealthy man i guessed that such a mean creature would probably stay in america and marry there leaving his daughter to look after herself luckily there was a postscript stating that if gertrude wanted money she was to apply to a lawyer whose address was given i handed back the letter with a shrug since mr monk had departed there was no reason for me to say anything at all although i had limited my silence to a fortnight i expect hes found some business which will make him rich and has had to go off in a hurry you cant miss him very much gertrude darling for he is never here no that is true she said thoughtfully folding up the letter and since you have come into my life cyrus i miss my father very little still he might have come to say goodbye i am afraid she ended sighing that papa is a little selfish well never mind hell return with wealth as he says do you think he will i am sure of it i replied kissing her for if mr monk did appear in burwain again a contingency i could not be sure would take place he would doubtless admit his possession of the australian cousins money to his daughter meanwhile as i pointed out he was gone and striver was gone so all we had to do was to enjoy ourselves then theres no danger of joseph seeing the police i kissed her again no set your mind at rest and truly when day after day went past and no news came i began to believe that mr striver and his suggested revenge had passed away altogether the murder of mrs caldershawunless the gardener was guiltystill remained a mystery but so long as gertrude was not troubled i cared very little if it were never solved september passed into october and that damp month gave place to foggy november i remained very comfortably lodged at the robin redbreast and saw gertrude every day the lawyer sent her a weekly sum so all was well financially and for the rest she no longer felt lonely since she had my company to an unlimited extent we motored a great deal we sometimes visited the tarhaven theatre and we spent long evenings together over the piano for gertrude was a very good musician if ever a man had an opportunity of knowing what kind of wife he was marrying i was that lucky individual our wooing was odd and unconventional to say the least of it and i was known in burwain village as miss gertys young man only puddles acted as chaperon although miss destiny sometimes assumed that office the little old lady was extremely gracious to me and actually asked me to afternoon tea in her tin house an unprecedented favour considering her avaricious nature gertrude privately informed me that her aunt did not again refer to the hidden money and evidently was quite ready to wait until it was found if it was and she did not receive her half i had no doubt that she would show her teeth but meanwhile she was bland and smiling and agreeable i disliked her myself as i knew she was holding a whip over gertrude still so long as she did not use it i had no cause to complain gertrudes positionowing to circumstances over which she had no controlwas an extremely delicate one and miss destiny as a possible scandalmaker had to be propitiated i was therefore as amiable to her as she was to me but i fancy she hated me under her feigned mask of friendship as several times i caught sly glances revealing the smouldering fires of her suppressed feelings i had through those damp months a companion at the robin redbreast in the small person of dicky weston true to his intention he had leased a few acres of waste land outside the village and having enclosed it with a high tin fence had erected sheds for his three or four workmenin the construction of his airship he did not retain moreand for the housing of the vessel as i presume it may be called the various parts were brought from london and weston spent his days in putting them together meanwhile he lived along with me at the inn and we had a common table i rather liked weston although he was confoundedly absentminded he told mefor we grew confidentialthat he had proposed to mabel and that she had refused him i believe shes in love with that marr fellow said weston savagely she is in love with you my dear chap i assured him anyone but a halfblinded inventor could see that then why didnt she accept me do you expect a girl to drop into your mouth like a ripe apple just because between the intervals of what you regard as more important business you propose to her women need to be wooed in order to be won weston and lady mabelvery rightly declined to be considered a side issue of your life interest but i love her no end vance pooh you would sacrifice her and a dozen like her to your moloch of an airship i said lightly i wouldnt he insisted but mabel couldnt expect me to throw over everything to dance at her heels she could expect it and she did expect it weston you dont know the sex i know mabel and i love mabel he muttered but since she wont have me there is no more to be said i expect to hear she has married marr you expect wrongly then said i with a shrug marr has gone to america for an indefinite period and is out of the running then theres a chance for me he said his dark face lightening up if you play your cards properly show me how to play then he asked me and i laughed good lord man you arent a child to be shown what to do make a fuss with mabel and show heras she deserves to be shownthat she is the one woman in the world for you so she is so she is i love her no end upon my soul i do you have not shown that by your actions i replied dryly if your love was so ardent you certainly would not be daunted by a single refusal weston sighed i dont understand girls he confessed you certainly dont my friend however if you are willing to make another attempt ask mabel down to see your airship she wont come she cant come why not it isnt a long journey from italy it is he said dolefully lady denham and her niece have been in florence for some weeks lady denham wrote and told me they were going oh she wrote you did she that shows that now marr is off the scene lady denham will favor your suit canningtons at florence also i got a letter from him a few days ago the whole party are coming back to england for christmas as lady denham virtuously intends to spend the festive season at her country house in the good old english fashion its a fortnight to christmas ruminated weston anxiously i wonder if lady denham would ask me down i am quite sure she would men with thirty thousand a year are not easily picked up marr the millionaire i laughed when i said this having sheered off lady denham will be delighted if her niece will marry you but mabel doesnt love me for my money i hope no shes too decent a girl you will be a lucky man if you win her lord knows what she can see in you weston youre not handsome not entertaining and your mind generally floats in the clouds with your blessed airship weston laughed in no wise offended ill tell you what he said after a pause ill wire cannington asking him to bring his sister down here when they return to england wont a letter do why are you in such a hurry i havent time to write a letter confessed weston candidly a wire is just as good if more expensive but if they come down i can then show mabel the airship and ask her to use it with me for the honeymoon she cant mistake that offer its an odd one but she certainly cant i answered laughing the consequence of this conversation was that weston sent his telegram and then promptly forgot all about it in the interest of his infernal aerial tramp cannington did not reply so i wrote him a long letter detailing my conversation with the inventor and pointing out that lady mabel was the dream of the little mans life so she was in a way although weston had a queer method of showing it my letter crossed another one from cannington and i learned that the party had returned to england sooner than was expected thus westons wire to florence had not reached lady mabel i posted another explanation to cannington and weston during the course of the week before christmas received a hasty note from the boy saying that he was bringing down his sister to seeme this made dicky furious good lord he grumbled are you in love with mabel considering that i have introduced you to my future wife how can i be then why does cannington bring her to see you confound you because you have behaved badly to his sister i havent i asked her to marry and she very rightly refused to have you weston you are a complete ass leave me to arrange this matter and when you get the chance throw yourself at mabels feet and let her trample on you ill do whatever you like said weston who was about as much in love as a man divided between science and humanity well could be the result of my efforts came about in due course cannington appeared on the scene in a walking kit along with his sister and announced that they were stopping at the buckingham hotel tarhaven for a few days the boy looked very well after his foreign tour and lady mabel was as blooming as a rose weston being as usual in his yard attending to his darling airship i gave cannington and the girl afternoon tea and we had a long chat which included news on both sides mabel got an offer from an italian count said cannington gaily and i refused replied mabel i have made up my mind to be an old maid you look like the sort that become old maids i retorted admiring her fresh comeliness and weston will have a word to say to that mabel set her mouth obstinately i shant accept dicky she said with a fine access of color he seems to think he has only to ask and to have well then he found that he asked and didnt get i said teasingly he has been punished enough mabel and loves you desperately he cant get on with his work for thinking of you accept him my dear girl and then the matter being settled he can attend to his work if i accept him i shall have to be his work said mabel wrathfully i am not going to be neglected for his airship but let us leave dicky alone for the present if he asks me again i mightmind you i dont say that i willbut i might box his ears and accept him meanwhile what about miss monk i am dying to see her so am i chimed in cannington pushing back his chair one at a time boy mabel you come along with me to the lodge and we shall see gertrude then you can give me your opinion on my extremely good taste as to cannington he had better look up dicky in his yard id rather come and see gertrudei mean miss monk no tomorrow you shall be presented go and talk to dicky like a dutch unclehe deserves itwhile mabel and i call on gertrude cannington nodded although i could see that he was not very well pleased with the arrangement on the way out of the inn he tugged at my sleeve while mabel was speaking to mrs gilfin i say have you learned anything more about the mootley business not lately i replied in low tones ill tell you all i know when we have more time go and see dicky by the way i caught his sleeve this time have you heard anything of marr not a word why he stared wonderingly oh nothing never mind mabel i turned to the girl i am at your service cannington shrugged his square shoulders and the three of us walked to the lodge westons yard was farther on quite beyond the village so i directed cannington to go straight on telling him that he could not miss the workshop then i took mabel inside the grounds of the lodge and up to the door eliza opened the door and conducted us to the drawingroom while she went to inform her young mistress of our arrival mabel glanced round admiringly what a charming old room she said delightedly it must have been built by william the conqueror all except the horrid windows they are rather out of place i admitted some vandal of a monk put them there during the albert period when everything was ugly i shall get dicky to give me a room like thiswithout the french windows of course chatted mabel oh then you intend to marry him certainly not i intend to box his ears if he has the cheek to speak to me again the idea what shall i give you for a wedding present mabel i asked laughing dickys head on a charger she replied promptly in that case there would be no wedding come mabel you know you love weston and intend to marry him well i do on one condition what is that he must burn or smash his horrid airship before my very eyes well said i thoughtfully and with intent he loves you so much that i believe hell even do that oh cyrus would heher eyes sparkleddoes he really love me desperately hes been miserable since you refused him oh poor dicky she began but got no further for gertrude entered as the words left her lips and came forward with a smile lady mabel she said holding out her hand i have no need to ask your name as cyrus has described you to me so often oh weve known each other for ages said mabel warmly cyrus is just like my elder brother i am so glad to meet you cyrus told mewell i darent tell you what he told me it would make him blush i have not blushed since i was a baby i retorted gertrude lady mabel is stopping at tarhaven with her brother and dont call me lady mabel its very rude miss monk why dont you keep him in better order dont call me miss monk said gertrude smiling i know you quite well from what cyrus has told me and indeed mr weston oh dicky mabel blushed hes such a silly man misswell then gertrude hurrah gertrude you are received into the family circle said i not until she meets cannington said mabel rising what a lovely lovely room you have gertrude she moved from one point to another its as lovely asyou are what a nice speech mabel yes isnt it i always make nice speeches andandoh she stopped short whats the matter asked gertrude seeing that her visitor was staring at a photograph in a silver frame that is my father your father repeated mabel and my blood ran chill for i guessed what was coming why its a photograph of mr wentworth marr who wished to marry me chapter xviii an alarming message i sat and shivered in my brown shoes in bringing lady mabel to the lodge i had quite overlooked the possibility that she might espy the photograph of monk which stood always as i very well knew on the piano in the drawingroom and the worst of it was that the photograph had only been taken a few months so there was no possibility of mistaking the face it was certain that mabel would appeal to me for confirmation of her assertion since i had met marr in her presence so what could i do while the two girls stared alternatively at one another and at the photograph i tried to make up my mind what course it would be best to pursue i think you must be mistaken said gertrude who looked puzzled the photograph is certainly one that my father had taken early this year then your father is wentworth marr insisted mabel examining the photograph more closely walter monk is my fathers name said gertrude with some stiffness there is no need for him to change it mabel looked round at me and i shivered again the heavens were falling i ask you cyrus she cried imperatively isnt this she touched the photograph mr marr there is a likeness i admitted cautiously nonsense its mr marr himself you met him at aunt lucys you must know know what i asked doggedly and uneasily that this she touched the photograph again is mr marr i was silent and looked at my toes wondering what was best to say certainly i had made a promise to monk to be silent provided he fulfilled certain conditions he had done so and therefore my lips were sealed then i recalled the fact that i had limited the time of concealment to a fortnight and thus in all honor i was now free to tell the truth it seemed necessary to do so at the moment as no other course was open to me mabel was a most pertinacious young woman and would never leave things alone until her doubts were set at rest moreover gertrude was looking at me inquiringly as she had noticed my obvious embarrassment cyrus she asked and i raised my eyes what does this mean its a long story i said weakly oh mabel walked up to me then there is a story just you tell it she sat down with a determined air i dont move from here until i know how mr marrs photograph comes to be here under the name of mr monk there was no help for it i had to speak out and make the best i could of a most uncomfortable situation mr walter monk goes by that name in burwain i blurted out but in london he is known as mr wentworth marr well i never mabel drew a long breath and looked at gertrude who had sat down and was staring hard at me why has my father two names she asked apprehensively oh theres nothing wrong i said hastily he is wentworth marr by act of parliament perhaps he is a millionaire also by act of parliament said mabel sarcastically can you say that he is cyrus papa is not a millionaire put in gertrude hastily all he has is this house and five hundred a year oh mabel drew another long breath and he gave aunt lucy to understand that he was a rich man did he give her to understand that he was actually a millionaire i asked well no not exactly aunt lucy exaggerates but he did say that he had no end of money and asked her permission to pay his addresses to me to you cried gertrude her color coming and going why i thought that you were engaged to mr weston i am in love with mr weston said mabel straightforwardly but i am not engaged to him although i may be i refused him once and my aunt wished me to marry youthat is mr marr she paused then spread out her hands in a foreign fashion i cant understand what it means cyrus understands said gertrude and her voice sounded cold perhaps you will explain cyrus willingly i said nerved to desperate coolness but you will understand in your turn that i was bound by a promise made to your father not to say anything if certain conditions were fulfilled was that fair to me asked mabel angrily perfectly fair i snapped i learned the truth when i met mr marr at lady denhams house then i recognized him as mr monk and afterwards i had an explanation with him why didnt you tell us his real name when you set eyes on him demanded lady mabel crossly i did not wish to make a scene it was only fair to await an explanation what cried the girl her color rising when mr marr was calling on my aunt under a false name he has a perfect legal right to the name and under the pretence of being a rich man he is a rich man i assured her to the extent of one hundred thousand pounds gertrude looked at me in astonishment that isnt true she denied my dear girl i have the word of your father for the amount its all very strange said mabel calming somewhat and hiding a covert smile oh great heavens i wonder what aunt lucy will say she laughed outright its like a play to think that a man with a daughter as old as i am should wish to marry me gertrude colored and i saw that her mind was tormented to think that her father should act in this underhand way to lessen her anguish i hastened to relate all i knewthis is i explained about the australian cousin the legal change of name and reason for the suppression of the burwain household and the conditions upon which i had held my peace the two girls listened quietly mabel with astonishment and gertrude with pain certainly walter monk alias wentworth marr had not committed a crime but he had scarcely acted straightforwardly well said mabel drawing a long breath as usual when i had ended i never heard of such a thing why on earth didnt mr marr or mr monkim sure i dont know what to call himtell me the whole truth there was no reason to keep quiet that i can see i was the reason evidently said gertrude with crimson cheeks for she was heartily ashamed of her father papa did not think you would marry him if you saw me for answer mabel who was an extremely kindhearted girl jumped up and kissed those same flushed cheeks my dear i liked your father well enough and would have no objection to you as a stepdaughter she laughed merrily at the idea but the fact is i never intended to marry mr marr whatever aunt lucy said i always loved dicky weston and i always shall although hes so horrid im glad of that said gertrude quickly for now i can see that my father is not the man to make any woman happy i always thought that he was a kindhearted harmless man a trifle frivolous perhaps but quite honest now i understand that i have been deceivedin more ways than one she added half to herself and i could not understand what she meant i did later do you blame me gertrude i asked rising to take her hand of course she doesnt said mabel very rapidly you made a promise on certain conditions to keep quiet for an agreed time and you have done so no blame can possibly attach itself to you gertrude i said anxiously taking no notice of mabels defence she pressed my hand i wish you could have told me she said in a low voice but my father was too clever for you i understand and you forgive me i pleaded there is nothing to forgive of course there isnt cried mabel kissing gertrude again and dont let this make any difference to our friendship dear you will marry cyrus and i shall marry dickyif he goes down on his knees to apologize for daring to ask me againand everything will be well but when i meet your father ended mabel wrathfully i shall speak my mind i dont think that you will see him again said gertrude quietly he has gone to america and went without a word of farewell or explanation to me i think he will stop there i see now that my affection was wasted on him since he apparently cares for no one but himself never mind mabel caressed her you have cyrus yes thank god for an honest man and she threw herself on my breast mabel looked at us and walked to the door ill leave you together and go after cannington if dickys anything of a lover hell meet me on the roadin his airship if possibleand with a laugh to relax the tension of the situation she vanished shortly we heard her open the front door and pass out then only did i speak dont worry gertrude he isnt worth it hes my father after all she moaned its terrible to think that he should deceive me so well he hasnt done any real harm he told me that he gave you the whole five hundred a year to yourself more or less that is not true he has kept me very short hang him he i stopped after all as she said the man was her father and i could not very well speak what was in my mind to his daughter dont think of him any more gertrude i whispered coaxingly i have you and you have me let us forget him it will be best she said drying her eyes for the ready tears had filled them and small blame to her do you think papa will come back no he will probably stop in the states and marry an heiress thank god he will not come back she muttered half to herself i never want to see him in england again i thought that this was rather a strained view to take of monks delinquencies seeing how fond gertrude had been of him until she discovered his true character but that is the way with true affection it is all or nothing gertrude a truthful honest girl could never trust her father again no i could never trust him she said speaking exactly what was in my mind he would only deceive me when it suited him i always knew that my father was more or less selfish but i looked upon him as a child his character is not a deep one it is deeper than we supposed i said grimly i can see that now andandoh she rose and pushed me awayi must go to my room to think matters over what matters what you have told me andandothers she stammered i caught her hands gertrude what is it she wrenched away her hands and glided towards the door i darent tell you i darent tell you she whispered and her lips were as white as her face as she waved me back wait wait she muttered when i can make up my mind you shall know all and she disappeared all what that was the question i asked myself as i returned to the inn apparently gertrude knew something more about her father than what i had told her but what could it be that could so move her to tears of course the discovery of her fathers doubtful behavior had given her a shock but it scarcely explained her uncontrolled emotion i began to wonder if mr monk had any connection with the mootley murder but on reflection i could find no connecting link until gertrude gave me her entire confidence i could not explain anything her entire confidence i stopped short when the two words flashed into my mind i remembered that gertrude had refused to give me the name of the mysterious person who had driven her out of the back door by the mere sight of him yeshim for i truly believed that the person in question although she had kept me in ignorance of the sex was walter monk on this assumption it was easy to guess why the poor girl had refused to speak the name she dreaded lest her father should be implicated in the crime and so in the face of the danger to herself had held her peace even to me her staunch friend and devoted lover this was what had brought her tears so readily notwithstanding she had seen him in the shopas i now believedshe had hitherto refused to credit him with the murder but the sudden discovery of the duplicity of which he was capable had aroused in her breast the latent doubt to active life she now wished to be alone in order to consider if her father was guilty of murder as he had been guilty of deception at least that was my belief although i had little grounds to go upon but gertrude as i had always thought was shielding someone whom she had seen in mrs caldershaws shop who could that someone be but her father since that relationship alone would be a powerful motive for her to hold her tongue even at the risk of losing her liberty but try as i might i could not see how walter monk could be connected with the death of anne caldershaw that same evening after dinner weston and i walked back to tarhaven with the brother and sister the sky was clear and the atmosphere was not too chilly also we walked along the cliffs under a full wintry moon naturally weston and the girl he loved were together and seemed to be quarreling pretty freely in fact dicky told me that night when we walked back that several times he had attempted to propose again but that mabel had always laughed at him so that he could not get the words out she teased him and tantalized him and drew him on and i repulsed him like a true daughter of eve so that his cold scientific bloodto put it picturesquelybegan to warm perhaps this was what the young minx desired at all events dicky weston understood her after that walk to tarhaven much better than he had ever understood her before and began to think that there were other things in the world than airships cannington and i walked behind chatting and smoking mabel either had not found time to tell him of her discovery or had thought it best to leave the explanation to me at all events cannington knew nothing so to be beforehand i judged it well to relate what i knew boy i said abruptly when we had settled well into our swing i have something to tell you something you should have known before and would have known i added emphatically had i not been bound to hold my tongue for a certain period what are you talking about vance asked cannington turning a surprised and youthful face to mine listen and dont get your hair off said i then rapidly and clearly told him of my recognition of marr as monk of the conversation i had enjoyed with him in the london chambers and finally detailed how mabel had seen the photograph in the lodge drawingroom which had proved the two men to be one the boy listened quietly enough although once or twice i heard him swear under his breath well said i when i had finished do you blame me no he said promptly since you arranged that the man should drop aunt lucys acquaintance and should drop courting mab i dont blame you but i wish you had told me when the fortnight was up my dear boy how could i you were going to italy and it was useless to communicate the news by letter especially i added when monk went to america and intends apparently to stop there yes yes i suppose you acted for the best but what a beast come thats a trifle hard i protested monk has a legal right to the name of marr and has plenty of money he is not a bad match for mabel i never liked him said cannington truculently and i am glad mabel did not listen to him she said that she never intended to listen to him and now you may be sure that she will be lady mabel weston very shortly that depends upon dickys behavior said cannington sharply unless he is all that i can desire he shant marry my sister you leave things in the hands of mabel my son shell manage the affair all right but marr damn him i should like to give him a thrashing i dont see upon what grounds you could cannington it is true that he suppressed the fact that he had a grownup daughter but that is not a crime and the suppression was due only to vanity i daresay he intended to tell the truth if mabel had accepted him i daresay muttered the boy still wrathful but i wouldnt give the little beast the benefit of the doubt i cant exactly call him to account either legally or socially i suppose but if he dares to speak to me again canningtons fist clenched itself in his deerskin glove i dont think you will set eyes on him for many a long day i said carelessly hell stop in the states and marry what does his daughter say she is very much cut up at the way in which he has behaved fancy his having all that moneyone hundred thousand poundsand keeping his daughter down to the simple necessaries of life perhaps he hasnt the money at all said cannington abruptly he must have i insisted look at the motor car he drove in and then his rooms are beautifully furnished he might have got all that by swindling in that case you certainly are justified in thrashing him since he obtained an introduction to lady denham under false pretences but i dont think mr monk has the nerve to swindle cannington laughed grimly i had never seen the easygoing boy so angry i think he has the nerve for anything after what he has doneeven for murder vance i started remembering my belief that gertrude was shielding her father i dont understand he might have murdered anne caldershaw oh nonsense mr monk wasnt even in the neighborhood mr walter monk under his real name wasnt but mr wentworth marr was cannington dont you remember how i told you that marr called on that mess shortly before we arrived he was stopping at the lion hotel in murchester and went off without seeing me again then you think that he went to mootley to see anne caldershaw and murdered her straight away i cant be sure that he murdered her said cannington doubtfully but you can see for yourself that the man is game for anything according to what you tell me mrs caldershaw was murdered for the sake of that glass eye which contains the clue to a fortune monk or marr or whatever you like to call the beast might have murdered the woman and stolen the eye and have got the money i daresay added cannington with a grim laugh he is really wealthy i cant believe it said i desperately hoping against hope for it was unpleasant to think that gertrude might be the daughter of a criminal long before the mootley murder he was courting your sister as a rich man i daresay he might have anticipated the fortune however that is my opinion vance so you can take it or leave it i dont want to hear the mans name again i only hope hell have the good sense to stay in the states as i shant answer for my temper when we meet all right boy dont get your hair off with me i havent said cannington stiffly but the whole affair is unpleasant if it is for you think what it must be for me when i am going to marry the daughter of such a rotter you will keep to your engagement then of course i returned indignantly what do you take me for a jolly good chap said the boy giving me a friendly dig i expect shethe lady i meanis worth it mabel says that she is no end of a beauty mabel is one of the few girls who can praise beauty in another for that pretty speech she shall have the best wedding present i can procure it may not be wanted grunted cannington i laughed and looked ahead at the pair quarreling in the moonlight on the contrary i shall have to see to the matter at once said i lightly on that night when i got back to the inn and retired to bed i thought long and deeply canningtons chance remark about marr being in the neighborhood during the time the crime was committed convinced me that the man had been to mootley gertrude had caught sight of him when she was in the back room and had fled for this reason she had declined to tell me the name of the mysterious person and again the presence of the glass eye on the drawingroom table was explained in a reasonable way monk had left it there and apparently by chance since knowing he would never have allowed such evidence of his guilt to remain there how he had recovered it again i could not say as he had been with me all the time until we reentered the drawingroom together it might be that gertrude in spite of her denial had chanced on the eye and remembering her fathers presence in the shop had concealed it thinkingand with good reasonthat he was guilty even to me under the circumstances she would deny the truth so i did not blame her overmuch but i arranged in my own mind to see her the next day and learn for certain if she really believed her father to be guilty on the grounds set forth he assuredly seemed to be but when the next day came i did not call on gertrude foras the saying goesi had other fish to fry at ten oclock i received a telegram asking me to be in london that afternoon at three oclock and the wire was from mr walter monk or as it was signed wentworth marr come up to my rooms at three today ran the wording s threatens i want you to deal with him wentworth marr there was a prepaid reply so i sent an answer saying i would be in stratford street at the appointed time then i sat down to consider the meaning of the summons s threatens that is striver is on the old mans trail humph so mr monk has returned from the states where he had intended to remain i daresay striver followed him there and forced him to return now i wonder if striver accuses monk or gertrude that is the question he may be threatening monk with his daughters disgrace so as to force him to get her to marry himselfstriver that is or else he suspects monk and can prove his guilt or else i stopped and put the telegram into my pocket the crisis seems to be approaching said i very prophetically and i was right chapter xix a dangerous position i could have seen gertrude before leaving for london but i did not think it wise to do so she would certainly ask questions and if by chance i let slip that my visit was to her father trouble would ensue when had he returned from america why had he returned from america for what reason did he wish to see me where was the letter or telegram which i had received these questions gertrude would assuredly ask and if i answered them truthfully she would probably insist upon coming with me that would be impossible as her presence would only complicate matters and heaven knows they were sufficiently complicated as it was for this reason i simply sent a note saying that i had been called to london on business and drove over to tarhaven in mrs gilfins trap to catch the midday train i just managed to escape cannington whom i saw in the street as i drove up to the station and was glad that he had not noticed me i did not wish to enter into further explanations and invent theories and conjecture possibilities so many lies were being told and so many secrets were being kept that it was difficult to understand the actual position of affairs the corner shop at mootley seemed to have been a kind of rendezvous for all manner of people and on that fatal evening mrs caldershaw appeared to have held quite a reception gertrude her father striver and miss destiny had all been making for that goal and the consequence of their presencein a broad sense i speakhad been the death of the old woman the sole person whose innocence could be proved beyond all doubt was miss destiny as she had not arrived until i had discovered the body of mrs caldershaw of course i truly believed that gertrude was innocent but the police might have taken a different view for this reason i was anxious to learn the exact state of things with regard to striver and monk in my opinion one of the two was guilty and i anxiously waited for three oclock to learn the absolute truth then being enlightened i should know how to act at three oclock i drove in a taxi to stratford street and was admitted by a demurelooking man in blackmonks valet i supposeto the flat apparently the servant expected my arrival for he led me directly into the moorish smokingroom where i had previously been striver and mr monk were both present seated in opposite chairs and gloweringas the scotch sayat one another they resembled a couple of illtempered dogs chained together monk i thought looked haggard and worn and anxious quite different to his usual complacent self but strivers handsome face wore a determined confident expression i judged that he was master of the situation this augured ill for monks innocence as soon as i entered the elder man quivering with nervousness rose quickly to his feet and rushed forward to clasp my hand i am so glad you have come vance he said dropping his affected speech i need your assistance in dealing with thisthis blackmailer thats a lie growled striver who looked dangerous and probably was why dont you introduce me as your secretary yes cried monk his under lip twitching thats what he calls himself vancemy secretary he followed after me to new york and has been in my company ever since to explain his presence i called him my secretary but he is a blackguarda blackmailer i have never asked you for a shilling retorted striver with a shrug no you ask me for what i value morethe hand of my child i sat down and laughed outright in spite of the seriousness of the situation hasnt mr striver given up hope in that quarter no i havent snarled the gardener nor shall i i intend to marry gertrude miss monk to you if you please as to your marrying her that is out of the question she is engaged to me and i dont intend to give her up now mr striver i havent come here to listen to bombast and froth but to hear facts for what reason do you persecute mr monk i dont persecute him i just followed him to new york to ask his help in marrying gerwell miss monk if you will have it so mr monk cant help you there i said calmly well see about that said striver with an evil look of course that is why i am here mr monk would you mind giving me a cigar please i recommend one to you also striver smoking may soothe your nerves mind your own business oh your nerves are my business since they may lead you into making mischief thank you mr monk i said taking the cigar he passed me a light please i struck a match now i ended when comfortably smoking let me hear all about it all about what demanded striver annoyed by my coolness about the means you propose to use in forcing mr monk into supporting your preposterous desire to marry his daughter he is guilty of my aunts murder it is a lie a lie cried monk sitting down and clasping his hands last time we had the pleasure of speaking together mr striver i said easily you accused miss monk now you assert her father to be the guilty person on what grounds do you base your last accusation i know those on which you base your first and i told you to tell them to the police instead of doing this you attempt to coerce an old man i had some sympathy with you because you loved in vain now i have none as i think you are simply a scoundrel using illegal means to accomplish the impossible how dare youhe sprang to his feet with flashing eyeshow that will do my man i interrupted coldly sit down and speak when i ask you questions ill break your head he muttered between his teeth but obeyed i laughed i think we tried physical conclusions at the lodge and you got the worst of it hold your tongue confound you i commanded sternly mr monk i turned to my future fatherinlaw who was shivering with apprehension you say that this person accuses you of murdering anne caldershaw yes he does he came here and learned that i had gone to america and followed he has never left me since why didnt you kick him out i couldnt i couldnt said monk shivering again while striver sneered he threatened to tell the police i kept him near me as my supposed secretary and have been compelled to pay his expenses oh you can easily do that mr wentworth marr scoffed striver seeing that you have secured the fifty thousand pounds which rightfully belongs to your daughter miss gertrude what i cried alive with curiosity its not true said monk hastily and his face grew red with anger the money i have comes from my australian cousin whose name i took in accordance with the conditions laid down in the will i told you so yes and i did not believe you mr vance striver shifted his position so as to face mei truly believed when i left burwain that miss gertrude was guilty on the grounds i explained to you at the lodge i came to london to see mr monk whom i knew to be masquerading as marr i did not masquerade broke in monk indignantly shut up said striver contemptuously and let me tell my story in my own way or it will be the worse for you no threats striver tell me the story without side issues i am aware that you learned about mr monks change of name you doubtless came here to say that if he didnt help you to marry miss gertrude you would denounce her to the police yes i did said striver sullenly but i learned from the caretaker of these rooms that mr monkmarr the man called himhad gone to new york and had left an address to which his letters were to be forwarded i got that address the caretaker had no right to give it to you cried monk indignantly oh a little money soon makes that sort of person speak sneered the gardener however i had no difficulty in learning where mr monk was stopping in new york i had plenty of cash with my aunts legacy and my own income to say nothing of the sale of the corner shop lease to giles so i determined to follow i reached new york in due course and compelled mr monk to take me as his secretary so that i could keep him under my eye monk groaned i have had a cruel time with you a cruel time better than you deserve i swear added striver turning again to me that i never believed mr monk to be guilty until i found the eye what i sprang to my feet in sheer astonishment you found the eye monk changing alternately from white to red with nervous fear would have burst out into emphatic denial but striver cast such a black look in his direction that the words died on his lips then the gardener took out of his pocket a small morocco case such as jewellers use to enclose watches and passed it along to me i opened it silently and there on the puffy white silk lay a glass eye i found that said striver slowly while searching the luggage of mr monk you had no right to search my luggage whimpered monk it was most unfair unfair be hanged you were so certain that miss gertrude was innocent and talked so much about defending her with your life that i began to suspect you of the deed i hunted when you were out amongst your luggage and papers for some proof of your guilt i found my aunts glass eye i never saw it before cried monk rising in his excitement you placed it amongst my papers to incriminate me mr vance said striver coldly look at the initials on the outside of that case you will see they are wentworth marrs initialsw m they also stand for walter monk ended striver with a sneer and when i glanced at the case i saw that he spoke the truth the case is mine i admit said monk trying to speak calmly it was in my dressingcase where i found it containing the eye put in striver sharply you did not you did not the case was empty as i was wearing the watchthis watch monk jerked a golden chronometer out of his waistcoat pocket the jeweller whose address is inside the case can prove that the watch was in it when he sold it to me i daresay sneered striver quietly but you wore the watch and placed the eye in the empty case yes and with that eye you learned the secret of the whereabouts of miss gertrudes fifty thousand pounds and you have been living on it under the name of wentworth marr the story of your australian legacy and australian cousin is a mere invention i tell you i have spoken the truth i deny everything do you deny that you were in mrs caldershaws shop i asked preventing striver from speaking by a gesture monk stared and winced how do you know that mr wentworth marr was at murchester on the day when the crime was committed he came down in his motor and stopped at the lion hotel he left a card for lord cannington at murchester barracks he also went to mootley to see anne caldershaw you cant prove that said monk and wiped the perspiration from his brow nervously i admit that i did motor down to murchester to ask cannington to influence his sister in my favor i called in the afternoon and left a card then i stopped the night at the lion hotel and returned to town the next morning and after you found that cannington was absentabout three oclock that wasyou went to mootley to see anne caldershaw prove it prove it i daresay mr striver can prove it he was concealed upstairs i was asleep for a time said striver abruptly but i woke in time to see mr monk i peered down the stairs and saw him talking to my aunt in the shop the sound of their voices raised high woke me up they were quarrelling i dont deny that i was there said monk wiping his face again but i want to know how vance learned my whereabouts its a guess based on my leaving the card on cannington it is not i said sharply your daughter was in the back room and saw you through the open door she refused to tell me this but as she said that the sight of a certain person drove her hastily out of the back door so hastily that she left her cloak behind her i believe that person was you mr monk i was simply calling on mrs caldershaw there was no reason why gertrude should not say so although i did not know that she was there she believed that you were guilty because of your presence there and did not tell me even though i pressed her you are the sole person she would shield at the risk of losing her liberty though you arent worth it mr monk am i not right i admitted that you were right striver saw me and gertrude saw me i cannot deny my presence in the shop but that does not prove me to be guilty of murder how then asked striver did you become possessed of the eye the last time that i saw the eye was in mrs caldershaws head snapped monk whose nerves were entirely giving way under the strain of crossexamination you pretended to find it amongst my baggage and slipped it into that case which is really mine its part of your plan of blackmail there may be some truth in that i remarked for knowing what i did i had not much belief in strivers story how can you talk such damned nonsense cried striver roughly when you know that mr monk has been posing in london as a rich man under the name of wentworth marr he has five hundred a year under his brothers will and that house with the acres surrounding it where did he get his money my australian cousin oh hang your australian cousin i dont believe he ever existed mr vance i swear that i found that eye amongst mr monks luggage you must believe in the face of that he pointed to the case which was still open in my hand that mr monk is guilty no i dont if thisi shook the caseis all the evidence you can bring monk heaved a sigh of relief and striver stared uneasily on what grounds do you say that he asked grimly on the grounds of commonsense mr striver i saw the eye on a small table in the drawingroom of the lodge near the middle french window mr monk placed it there it only proves his guilt more conclusively i think not in the first place if mr monk had been possessed of the eye he would scarcely be such a fool as to leave it about in the second case when i reentered the drawingroom the eye had disappeared and all the time from when i saw it to when i returned to the room mr monk was with me he could not have secured it again even thoughaccording to youhe placed it there which i dont believe you took the eye from the table how dare you say that cried the man but his color changed and i guessed that my chance remark asserted the truth on what grounds you have supplied the grounds yourself i said quickly by saying that you found the eye in mr monks dressingbag you found the watch case but you certainly brought the eye to place in it for the furtherance of your infernal plans you were working in the garden striver and saw by my face when i came out to meet mr monk that i was startled out of curiosity and jealousy you went up to the window saw the eye and secured it finding that i supported miss monk and you could not incriminate her you made use of the eye to incriminate mr monk i do not he stuttered changing color again and again you did and by your own showing for all i know you may have placed the eye on the table since it was easy to do so with the window open how could i get the eye do you accuse me of murder the police might if they knew all that we know but i shall give you the benefit of the doubt and say that you found the eye in the shop after the murder was committed but according to the police said monk doubtfully the murder was committed for the sake of the eye of course it was insisted striver and by you i am perfectly innocent in that case how did you get your money unless by stop i interrupted impulsively there also i can defend mr monk long before the murder he was living as wealthy mr wentworth marr in london as lord cannington informed me if he did not get the money until the eye was foundand by your own showing mr striver he could only find the hidden treasure in that wayhow could he pose long before as a rich man answer me that mr striver the gardener seeing that i could beat him on every point maintained a sullen silence mr monk cheered by my several defences of his actions leaned forward eagerly no doubt this is a false clue he said pointing to the case it may not be the real eye striver would never allow me to examine it in case he smiled bitterly i should destroy it which you would have done said the other bluntly i wouldnt trust you a single inch mr monk the eye is the one worn by my aunt right enough and contains the cipher of which she spoke look at the back remembering the glimpse i had seen of the concave of the eye when it was on the lodge table i delicately turned over the object of the case it may seem odd that i had not examined it before but the interest of the conversation between striver and monk had held me spellbound it was imperative as is obvious that i should lose no single word of the illassorted pair however i did now what i should have done before and tilted the eye to behold in the hollow the piece of silver i had seen before there it lay and looked more than ever like a threepenny bit monk bent forward curiously and stared its a silver coina threepenny bit he explained half to himself gabriel told me that he had engraved the cipher on a threepenny bit but he would never tell me where it was hidden a very ingenious idea to hide it in mrs caldershaws eye see it is fastened by a piece of gold wire to the center of the pupil it was as he said the coin was so fastened and in the dense black of the pupil appeared the glint of a tiny piece of gold in no other way could the coin have been kept in its place but as it was sunken a good way into the concave of the artificial eye the same when worn could not produce any irritation to the wearer it was as monk said a very ingenious idea i never saw it before he murmured and i believed that he was speaking the truth so this is how gabriel concealed his secret i tried to read what was on the coin but failed as the engraving was so very small have you a magnifying glass mr monk i asked not to my knowledge he said promptly however ill look for one and he rose to make a search i examined the eye again then closed the case and placed it on the table intending to pocket it when i had used the magnifying glass though i daresay said i to striver who was seated in his chair looking very dejected you can tell me what the cipher consists of he did not answer my question but leaned forward and buried his face in his hands to my surprise i saw the tears forcing themselves between his fingers i hate to see a man cry but on this occasion i was glad for these tears showed that striver had broken down he was not cut out by nature for a villain and now that i had thwarted his schemes he could contrive no new ones he was beaten and he knew that he was beaten i felt quite sorry for him badly as he had behaved striver i placed my hand on his bowed shoulders dont touch me he said in a choking voice and rising to his feet he walked rapidly to the end of the room where there was an ottoman here he flung himself down at full length sobbing bitterly i followed and waited until the paroxysm passed away then finding him in a gentler mood i hoped to get at the truth which i felt convinced he knew and indeed seeing that he had been concealed in the house during the commission of the crime he must know who had stabbed his aunt unless striver i said sharply pull yourself together and answer me did you murder this unfortunate woman no he sobbed in a stifled voice i did not i was hidden in the bedroom and came down to find her dead the rest as to taking your car and escaping i have told you whats to be done then i muttered much perplexed this is to be done he said sitting up with his handsome face tearstained and his hair dishevelled you have won and i have lost i surrender all claim to the hand of miss monk you never had any claim i reminded him sharply perhaps not was his dejected reply but i am a man and i cannot help my feelings gertrude is the only woman i have ever loved and the only woman i shall ever love she is lost to me because she loves you well i daresay it is better that she should marry a gentleman but i wishi wish he broke down again striver i said for the third time and placed my hand on his shoulder i am very sorry for you although you have not acted well all is fair in love and war he said sitting up again there are some things a gentleman cannot do even to win the woman he loves striver i said gently so all is not fair in love and war i am not a gentleman i never pretended to be a gentleman then be one now i urged you know the truth of this murder since you were in the house all the time i believe myself that you are innocent why should you think that he asked in a curious voice and with a curious look because i believe you to be a good fellow striver your nature has been warped by the influence of this mad love and by the influence of your dead aunt she always promised you miss monk as a bride and this fifty thousand pounds for yourself yes she did he said his bright blue eyes steadily fixed on me well then these things have drawn you into wrongdoing you love miss monk prove your love by preventing her from getting into trouble about this murder until the truth is discovered she is in danger of arrest because of her unfortunate visit to mootley and because of the cloak left behind perhaps perhaps but her father will say nothing he dare not no but miss destiny might she knows that her niece was at mootley on that night and threatens to betray her unless she receives half the fifty thousand pounds when it is found miss destiny threatens said striver rising and for the sake of money ah that old lady always was a miser well well cant you show your love for miss monk and thwart the aunt by telling the truth why do you think i know the truth you were in the house all the time i feel certain that you can unravel the mystery striver looked away and became very silent at this moment monk entered and began to bustle about hunter this was his valet i afterwards heard says that there is a magnifying glass in the desk here i paid no attention to him as i was looking at striver after a long silence the gardener spoke i do know the truth he said slowly and i shall save gertrudes good name marry her and may you be happy but i cried following him as he was walking towards the door i have nothing more to say said striver and disappeared i wondered if he was guilty after all and whether he intended to confess before i could think out the matter monk touched my elbow i cant find the magnifying glass he said handing me the case which he had picked up off the table better go to a jeweller and borrow one thanks i said slipping the case into my pocket and reaching for my hat and coat goodday mr monk dont go he urged me i have much to say and much to thank you for i put on my coat and made for the door i decline to remain in your company mr monk i said because you are a scoundrel and if you were not gertrudes father i would thrash you willingly old as you are for her sake only have i saved you how dare you speak to me in this way he cried furiously and followed me into the hall plucking at my sleeve because it is just as well someone should tell you the truth i retorted heatedly you have acted in the most cruel manner towards your daughter i have not i deny it he panted looking white and wicked you have lived in luxury in london while she has been practically starving down at burwain she knows that you are marr you told her he cried falling back a pace yes i was forced to tell her because lady mabel recognized your photograph in the drawingroom i warned you that lady mabel was going down to burwain to see mr westons airship you had no right to tell you promised if i went away to hold your tongue so i did for a fortnight not with regard to gertrude i was to tell her myself you never came back to tell her but bolted to america you never intended to return and would not have done so had not striver forced you to defend yourself i cant say if you are guilty or if he is guilty but i am quite sure that one of you is guilty however you have money from your australian cousin mr monk a new name and a secretary who knows what a blackguard you are so i wish you joy for the future my advice to you is to go to america and never return gertrude is done with you this struck him to the heart my little childmy own child exactly and you deserve your fate entirely goodday and goodbye and i walked out of the chamber and down the stairs that was the last i ever saw of mr walter monk alias mr wentworth marr on the way back to tarhaven and in the train i opened the case to again examine the famous glass eye it was gone the case was empty chapter xx the cipher here was a discovery well might i talk about the disappearing eye for it vanished every time it was found it had disappeared out of mrs caldershaws head when she was murdered it had disappeared from the drawingroom table and now it had disappeared from the watch case of mr walter monk and this final vanishing seemed to be the strangest of all i could not understand how it had taken place since i was in the room and the closed case was on the table all the time striver could not have secured the eye for i had held him in conversation then i remembered that mr monk had been hunting the smokingroom for a magnifying glass in order to decipher the inscription engaged with the repentant gardener i had paid very little attention to his movements so it was probable that when my back was turned he had taken the opportunity to slip the incriminating eye into his pocket also i recalled the fact that he had handed me the closed case himself recommending me to get a magnifying glass from a jeweller had i been clever enough to mistrust himas i had every reason toi should there and then have opened the case to see that the eye was safe but i had not done so and now in the train when monk was out of reach i discovered the loss of course i guessed that he had taken it so as to obviate any accusation being brought against himself and probably by this time he had got rid of it for ever it was useless for me to do what i settled on the spur of the moment to do and return by the next train to london from one of the intermediate stations monk would only lie and i could not force him to surrender the eyealways presuming that he had not destroyed itby threatening to tell the police the fulfilment of such a threat meant danger to gertrude and he would simply laugh in my face there was nothing for it but to continue my journey to burwain and consult with gertrude if i placed the matter before her she might see a way out of the dilemma and it was a dilemma for i had not found time to decipher what was on the threepenny bit and so could not hope to find the hidden money if i only knew what kind of a cryptogram gabriel monk had engraved on that piece of silver i felt certain that in one way or another i could read the same failing my own capability i knew a man in london who possessed a poelike talent for unravelling such puzzles and for gertrudes sake i desired to find her fortune since mr monknow that he had nothing to gain and knew that his daughter loved him no longermight withdraw the money he allowed her he might even sell the house and grounds for though the income was entailed the property was not then gertrude would be homeless and penniless until her father died and the five hundred a year by the entail reverted to her no wonder i was vexed at the loss of the eye on arriving at burwain mrs gilfin informed me that lord cannington had been inquiring for me and failing my company had passed the day in westons yard i did not get to the inn until seven oclock so weston always working late had not put in an appearance then i foundand to my great satisfactionthat dicky had gone in his motor to tarhaven with cannington to dine and sleep at the buckingham hotel the boy had left a note asking me to come over also when i returned but i sent a wire from the village postoffice excusing myself on the ground of fatigue and sat down to my dinner afterwardsabout eight oclock in facti walked to the lodge to explain my absence to gertrude she was in the quaint drawingroom arrayed in a dinner dress of some soft white clinging material and looked almost as pale as her frock there were dark rings round her eyes and a weary look on her face without a word she came forward to kiss me and sighed as she laid her head on my breast what is the matter my own i asked kissing the soft dark hair i am so tired she whispered i have had a white night as the french call it and all day i have been longing to talk to you why have you not been to see me cyrus what took you to london i was so disappointed when i received your note i wanted you so muchso very very much what for dear i made up my mind last night to tell you everything what if i know everything already gertrude withdrew from my arms and looked at me in a frightened way what do you know what have you learned dear i took her hand and led her to a chair near the fire sit down for i have much to tell you i have been to london in answer to a telegram from your father she rose from the seat in which i had placed her oh she exclaimed in a fright has he returned to england how foolish when she stopped when what gertrude i asked looking at her keenly if you know all you must know why i wish my father to remain absent from england she replied sinking to the chair with a white face never mind what i know tell me my father she began and then her voice died away in her throat and she cast a frightened look at the door i knelt at her feet and took her cold hands within my own we are quite safe dearest tell me tell me trust me fully i knew pretty well what she was about to say but wished her to voluntarily give me her full confidence it was my father i saw through the door she whispered bending over me anxiously he called to see anne on that day she came back and told me he was there i did not wish to meet him as already i had caught a glimpse of his face therefore i ran out of the back door leaving my cloak behind me why did you not wish to meet him because he would have insisted upon knowing why i had come to mootley if he had learned what i had found in the diary he would have got the secret from anne and then the money would have passed into his possession to make bad use of i thought it better to go and i fled on the impulse of the moment i had no time to think dear i believe that your father knew mrs caldershaw possessed the secret else why should he have come to see her then you guessed that i was shielding him yes i guessed and now i know for certain who told you cyrus your father himself gertrude rose unsteadily to her feet grasping my arm butbut she stammered has he confessed that he is guilty i rose also and at the same moment no dear he is the last man to confess anything that would get him into trouble he swears that he is innocent oh i hope soi think he must be she clasped her hands and her eyes shone in her pale face like twin stars papa is foolish andas i see nowselfish but he would never commit so cruel a murder i think he would do anything provided he was not found out i said in a cynical manner of course you left before the termination of his interview with mrs caldershaw so you cant say for certain if he is innocent or guilty but striver accuses him striver she grasped my arm again in her fright and he was concealed in the bedroom but he was asleep he said that he was asleep he wokeaccording to his storyat the sound of voices and saw your father in the shop he accuses him of the murder because he found the glass eye amongst your fathers luggage in america in america has joseph been to america yes he followed your father there to force him to insist upon the marriagewhich he apparently intended to bring about by threatening you then he foundso he saysthe glass eye in your fathers dressingbag and accused him to keep striver quiet your father made him his secretary and brought him back to england this morning i received a wire from your father asking for my assistance i went up andi shruggedthat is all it is only the beginning said gertrude quickly sit down and tell me all about your interview firstto set my mind at restis my father guilty i reflected i really cant say sometimes i think he is and again i think he is not there is much to be said for both opinions striverif anyoneknows the truth and yet he only bases his accusation on the finding of the glass eye but surely said gertrude in great agitation that is strong evidence yes i assented dryly if it were true but i believe that striver stole the glass eye from yonder table and took it to america to frighten your father into helping with the marriage if he had real true evidence against mr monk he would not have resorted to faked evidence with the glass eye on those grounds i believe that your father is innocent oh what a relief she sighed and sat down on the other hand i continued quietly your father has made me change my opinion by stealing the eye again what do you mean cyrus i took my seat beside her and gained possession of her hands then i related all that had taken place in the stratford street rooms she interrupted me frequently with ejaculations when i had finished she appeared more struck with strivers sudden collapse than with any other portion of my narrative he knows the truth and he will save my good name she said slowly to herself that would seem as though joseph knows for certain that my father is innocent since his name is my name not exactly my dear his name by act of parliament is marr and yours is monk but when you change it to vance i gathered her into my arms to kiss her fondly there will be no need for striver to bother there will always be a need until the truth becomes known murmured gertrude anxiously i shall never be safe from my aunts threats until the assassin of anne is found well then let us leave it to striver i said cheerfully he is ready to behave decently now that he finds you will never be his wife meanwhile i want you to go to london tomorrow and see your father gertrude shrank from the suggestion oh i dont want to see him again after he has treated me so badly besides he must be angry with me never mind you are strong enough to face his anger which is sure to be of a puny kind i wish you to see him so that you may regain the glass eye which i feel certain he took out of the case when my back was turned why do you want the glass eye to read the cipher and find the money gertrude shook her head i feel as though that money would bring us a curse cyrus already it has caused a murder and no end of unhappiness besides you can never read the cipher i should try dear and if i fail there is a clever friend of mine who can unravel anything as to the money or rather the diamonds they are rightfully yours and ought to be in your hands get the eye and i did not finish the sentence eliza suddenly opened the drawingroom door to deliver a letter to me it came by express said eliza and the boy is waiting at the door take him into the kitchen and feed him i said glancing at the superscription i did not recognize the writing you can go eliza for she still lingeredout of curiosity i expect i opened the envelope and besides the lettera long one written on foolscapthere was a folded paper which fell to the floor gertrude picked it up while i turned instantly to the signature joseph striver i read in wonderment what can he be writing about to me in such a hurry that it requires an express delivery read read cried gertrude with bright eyes and crushing up the folded paper in her hands without looking at it he said that he would save my good name perhaps that letter contains the truth i hastily skimmed the contents then walked towards the door gertrude very impatiently followed me where are you going why dont you read me the letter she inquired imperatively i shall read it when i have dismissed the messenger its all right and at once i went to the kitchen here i gave the boy a shilling and sent him off on my return to the drawingroom i found gertrude looking at the folded paper which she had smoothed out what does this mean she asked bewildered and i looked also the paper contained a rude drawing representing a kind of bird whether kite or owl or barndoor fowl i could not say around were a number of spots and beneath were two large letters an a reversed and an s twisted in the wrong direction what does it mean asked gertrude let us read the letter said i sitting down and we did so together she looking over my shoulder striver wrote that by this time no doubt i had found out the disappearance of the glass eye mr monk had taken it he said when my back had been turned and had destroyed it the glass portion he had smashed up and had afterwards gone out to throw the silver coin with the inscribed cipher into the thames thus wrote the gardener you can never learn the cipher from the eye itself but i enclose a drawing i made of what was on the threepenny bit while it was in my possession what it means i cant say or i should have found the treasure for myself you were right mr vance in thinking that i had taken the eye from the drawingroom table i did when you left the window i saw that you were disturbed and moreover was very jealous as i fancied you had just exchanged a word with gertrude on the spur of the moment i ran to the window when you turned the corner of the terrace with mr monk and saw the eye i was greatly amazed as i could not think how it came to be there and i was still more amazed to think you had not secured it i was a fool i interjected but i had not my wits about me the letter went on to say that finding he would make no impression on gertrude with me beside her striver had taken the eye to america in order to lay a trap for monk but he swore solemnly that monk did not possess the eye unless wrote striver he placed it on the drawingroom table i think myself that he is innocent as i watched him all the time he was talking to my aunt he did not leave the shop but after a quarter of an hour he went away down the road i believe he left his motor car at murchester and walked over henceas no one came to the corner shop on that afternoonhis visit was not noticed after he departed i went back to the bedroom to lie down and told my aunt i was weary she did not come up the stairs and i did not go down them she went into the back room and i lay down again in the bedroom thenbut i shall not tell you the truth now when the time comes you shall know all and gertrude need have no fear that she will ever be troubled again by the mootley murder thank god for that said gertrude but who is guilty i shrugged my shoulders we must wait until striver speaks out perhaps he killed his aunt himself and wished to escape abroad before confessing but let us read the rest of his letter and i continued the writer went on to say that he intended to leave england as he had plenty of money he could not return to burwain to see gertrude the wife of another so probably he would go to australia very foolish of him to tell us that seeing he may be guilty i said cyrus he knows that he can trust us she said rebukingly i am sorry for the poor man he is making amends i shall say so when i hear that he has told the truth about the murder i remarked grimly how he intends to do so i cant say but look gertrude do you see how he finishes your father after getting rid of the cipher coin in the river came back and took all his things away he told striverhere it isthat he was returning to america and would never come to england again welli paused poor papa sighed gertrude why could he not have come down and asked me to help him after all he is my father and i could never be hard on him i dont think he is worthy of your regrets i said for really mr walter monks behavior sickened me but as he has departed there is no use your going up to see him tomorrow about the eye especially as the eye is now destroyed said gertrude taking up the paper and the cipher is set down here what do you make of it cyrus i put strivers letter into my pocketthere was no more writing after the information of mr monks departure for americaand bent over the paper its a bird in the middle of a lot of dust i said dust gertrude pointed out two of the specks then dust has wings oh then its a bird midst a cloud of insects and these odd signs an a reversed and an s turned in the wrong direction gertrude thought for a moment then her face brightened cyrus what kind of a bird is this and she pointed it might be a peacock i said ironically mr striver has not much notion of drawing do you think it is an eagle she asked in an excited tone good heavens no i retorted did you ever see an eagle like that joseph is not an artist said gertrude impatiently he certainly is not clever neither are you cyrus for all your talent oh to think that the secret hidingplace should be in this very house what i stared alternately at gertrude and at the paper cant you see dont you understand she cried greatly excited an eagle amidst a cloud of fliesaquila non capit muscas i stared at her i have heard that sentence before and you have seen the drawing better executed in carving cyrus what is the first letter of the motto afor aquilaeagle yes and the last letter s the terminal for muscas for flies well she caught me by the hand come into the smokingroom and light the lamps oh by jove i saw her meaning now she referred to the heavy beam across the smokingroom to which mr monk had drawn my attention we ran hand in hand like children into the dark room gertrude struck a match and i taking the box from her handand a shaking hand it wasstruck another in a few moments the powerful oil lamps were illuminating the room brilliantly we both looked at the beam an eagle catching flies cried gertrude pointingaquila non capit muscas my ancestors queer old motto the diamonds are there hidden in the beam of course come and get a ladder from the outhouse no that wont do as eliza is so filled with curiosity i dont want her to suspect anything what are we to do i can place this chair on the table and as i am tall i can easily reach up to the beam i said suiting my actions to my words close the door gertrude so that eliza cant come spying gertrude who was all excitement promptly locked the door but how are you to get the beam open shall i get an axe nonsense i said consulting the paper of striver this is the hidingplace right enough the beam must open in some way but how what about the reversed letters questioned gertrude they are not reversed on the beam no but they are on the paper i know gertrude these letters on the beam are raised so as to give one a grip get a candle will you or hand up a lamp so as to lose no time she stretched with the lamp i held it close to the raised carving of the beam and particularly examined the first and last letters a and s circular lines appeared faintly round these which were not visible round the other letters i handed the lamp back what are you going to do asked gertrude replacing the lamp on its stand twist these first and last letters into the position indicated by the cipher then we shall see what will happen i put forth my strength to the a and found that with an effort it twisted with considerable ease hurrah i cried this is the secret the final s was more difficult to move but at last i contrived to get it twisted completely round gertrudes bright face looked up anxiously stand away stand away i cried hastily it was just as well that i had warned her for suddenly the whole broad board containing the motto clattered to the floor before i could save it the diamonds the diamonds cried gertrude excitedly a cavity was revealed and i passed my hand along it was empty gertrude the diamonds are gone i cried in dismay and our spirits fell to zero chapter xxi the airship who had removed the diamonds that was my thought for the next twentyfour hours but i could not answer my own question i certainly remembered how striver insisted that mr monk had secured possession of the fortune but only by getting possession of the eye could he learn where the jewels were hidden and by strivers own showing he had not been thus fortunate only when destroying the eye had he had it in his hands and then instead of reading the cipher he had thrown the coin upon which it was written into the thames moreover for many months monk had been masquerading as wentworth marr and had possessed the money to keep up the farce undoubtedlyas i thought after much reflectionthe story of australian legacy must be true mr monk on the face of it could not have looted the beam of its valuable contents but what astonished me was that monk should have thrown away the coin although it was natural enough that he should have destroyed the eye but why did he not at least attempt to read the cipher it seemed to be an extremely easy one as the repetition of the beams carving on the coin suggested the latin motto the reversed letters suggested a little hard thinking but presented no great obstacle the late gabriel monk had cut away the inscribed board and behind had hollowed out a place for the reception of the diamondsin a bag i presume also he had cut out the first and last letters of the saying in circular form and to these had attached pieces of iron when the letters were placed straightly these pieces of iron caught on to the inner part of the beam and so held the inscribed board when reversed they released the same it was ingenious but not difficult of solution and i wondered that monk had not read the cipher if he had he certainly would have guessed that the beam in the lodge smokingroom held the jewels and in that event would have searched on this assumption i thought that the man could not have examined the cipher but why he should not have done so puzzled me considerably however the case stood thus monk had returned to america or at all events had left england striver also had taken his departure and the jewels which belonged to gertrude had disappeared the gardener intendedso he saidto tell the truth and unmask the assassin of his aunt but unless he intended to denounce himself when at a safe distance i could not imagine what he intended to say so far as i could see there was nothing to do but to wait some communication from striver meanwhile i urged gertrude to marry me during the first month of the new year but i am afraid to marry you until the truth about annes murder is known cyrus she objected aunt julia still threatens me let us go and see your aunt now i said it was next morning that this conversation took place we can explain matters to her and she will be forced to see that you are innocent after all she only desires the half share of the fortune when she learns it is lost she will hold her tongue having nothing to gain by talking anxious to end all suspense gertrude agreed and we paid an early visit to miss destiny in the cold greyness of the day her tin house looked more dismal than usual and as we walked through the jungle path i wondered how a lady bred and born could live in so miserable a place she was not rich certainly but she could have afforded a better dwelling yet i daresay she was happy enough in her sordid home since all she cared for was money and so long as she possessed actual gold to gloat over cared little for the comforts it could bring it was a strange way of finding happiness miss destiny opened the door herself as lucindait appeared from what she saidhad gone to buy some food in the village the little old lady was dressed in her usual threadbare black silk with the addition of a knitted woollen shawl over her spare shoulders she looked extremely shabby also pinched and haggard but her black eyes were as bright as ever and she seemed to possess considerable vitality in her wiry frame the lovers she said with a shrill laugh and inviting us to enter so it is not to be joseph after all my dear gertrude it never was joseph replied her niece quietly aunt julia i have asked cyrus to come and see you about this threat you used to me threat miss destiny raised her eyebrows my dear child i used no threat you said that if gertrude did not give you half of her fifty thousand pounds when found that you would tell the police she had been to mootley oh i really didnt mean that mr vance said miss destiny cringing it was only a joke on my part then you dont accuse me of murder asked gertrude bluntly no dear certainly not and you dont want half gertrudes fortune i questioned miss destinys eyes narrowed and she looked venomous i certainly should have half the money gabriel said that he would leave me a legacy and he did not yet i slaved for many years looking after his house you got board and lodging for your services said gertrude coldly i ought to have got a legacy insisted miss destiny gabriel promised me some money but he left his income and the property to walter and the rest of his savings to you you owe me half and i mean to have half i dont say dear added miss destiny significantly that you murdered anne but if the police knew that you had paid her a visit to ask about the eye you might be asked unpleasant questions i did not ask about the eye because i did not know until later that the eye contained the cipher said gertrude calmly but after reading the diary i certainly went to ask anne to give me the cipher so that i might find what rightfully belonged to me half of it only snapped miss destiny and you certainly ran away with mr vances motor car because i saw you myself in your white cloak if you are innocentmind i dont accuse you of murderbut if you are innocent why did you run away so strangelya guilty conscience a guilty conscience my dear miss destiny i said indignantly for the malice of the little creature annoyed me it was joseph striver who wore gertrudes cloak and ran off with my car he told us so himself so you say she sneered and i say more listen and forthwith i related all that had been discovered down to the destruction of the glass eye and the throwing away of the silver coin by walter monk miss destiny listened unbelievingly and with a sneer apparently she did not credit a single word of what i was saying but when i came to the end she interrupted me with a scream the eye destroyed the eye destroyed she cried starting to her feet with surprising activity oh what a fool what a fool now the fortune can never be discovered it has been discovered put in gertrude what miss destiny wheeled round venomously and eagerly you have found the diamonds you told me that gabriel mentioned in his diary we have found the hidingplace i said sharply striver sent me a copy of the cipher which he took when the eyeas i have told youwas in his possession then give me half give me half shrieked miss destiny if you dont ill go to the police i swear ill go to the police i dont believe this young mans lies you were in the house and youyouyou she choked with anger gertrude arose revolted by this exhibition of sordid greed and could not speak i answered for her the jewels are gone miss destiny i said quietly gone her shrill voice fell to a mere whisper and the wild light of avarice died out of her black eyes gone impossible then her face lighted up again fiercely this is a lie to cheat me of my share she shouted even if the jewels had been found i remarked in a cool level voice you would have had none of them since they belonged to gertrude i am strong enough to save her from your malice either striver or walter monk is guilty if you go to the police i shall go also and tell what i have told you gertrude caught my arm no cyrus no my father dear this is not the time for half measures you did your best to save your father by refusing to tell me but if he is guilty he must be brought to book if only to thwart this womans evil intentions oh have done with your chatter cried miss destiny stamping like a small fury tell me the truth are the jewels indeed gone yes you will never see them again who took them i insist upon knowing who took them i dont know if i did i would get them back again then hunt for joseph striver said miss destiny furiously he is the thief impossible he sent me the cipher yes she sneered after he had stolen the jewels he could easily send you the cipher but he had the eye by your own showing he must have read the cipher he had taken the fortune oh she shook her fists in the air i wish these two hands were at his throat the little creature looked so evil as she shook and quivered in the sordid room that i touched gertrudes shoulder go away dear this is no sight for you then when she obeyed me and passed outside i turned to miss destiny you will understand that the jewels are lost for ever ill hunt the thief down ill hunt him down she breathed savagely even if you do the half share will not come to you i will look after gertrudes interest miss destiny laughed shrilly ah you marry her for her money what love gertrude at present has no money nor do i want any money with her but if striver has the jewels he shall be forced to give them up meanwhile if you say a word to anyone against gertrude i shall tell my story ill say no word until the jewels are in gertrudes possession it is not worth my while to say anything until then but when she has the fortune i shall have my half or she shall hang you are mad i said recoiling from her venomous looks yes mad at being tricked and cheated by joseph striver oh i know the man i might have guessed that he would not keep faith with me the fortune is gone the fortune is gone and she dropped into a chair yes i said with my hand on the door therefore hold your tongue miss destiny only crouched in the chair rocking herself to and fro the fortune is gone she moaned twentyfive thousand pounds was to have been my share i have lost twentyfive thousand pounds oh me oh me and leaving her still weeping and wailing over the loss i departed whether miss destiny was right or wrong regarding strivers possession of the diamonds i could not say day after day went by and the gardener did not appear to denounce the assassin of his aunt as he had arranged to do nor could he be found anywhere although i employed a detective to search for him we discovered that mr monk had given up the lease of his chambers and had sold his furniture he had disappeared to america and evidently had no intention of returning but his lawyer still continued to pay gertrude enough to keep the lodge going and herself in clothes but striver had vanished like a water bubble he had dissolved into thin air and all we could do was to wait until he chose to reappear i pointed out to gertrude that miss destinys mouth being closedshe would not speak until the jewels were recovered a very remote contingencyand her father along with the gardener having passed out of our lives it would be best to get married then we could leave burwain and settle in london as mrs vance she would forget all the storms of the past and with me as her companion could journey under brighter skies but gertrude refused steadily until my name is absolutely cleared by the assassin of anne caldershaw being brought to justice i shall remain as i am at the lodge and what if the assassin is your father gertrude i asked i dont believe it she replied firmly papa is weak and selfish but he would never murder an old woman so cruelly i believe that striver is guilty and has got my fortune as aunt julia says in that case hell never tell the truth he said that he would save my good name and i believe that he loves me enough to do so wait cyrus wait the end will come and the truth will come to light only then can i marry you with this promise i was forced to be content and remained at the robin redbreast which seemed likely to become my permanent home with gertrude i spent a quiet christmas as cannington had to return to his duties at murchester and weston was invited to spend the festive season at lady denhams country house there he saw a great deal of mabel and she relented from her attitude of snubbing him for he came back during the first week of the new year with a joyful light in his eyes congratulate me vance mabel has accepted me as her husband oh i shook his hand warmly i congratulate you with all my heart since you have secured a charming wife but can i congratulate mabel on the possession of an absentminded husband oh i am not so bad as i was said weston with quite a new ring in his voice i have had my lesson vance and see that mabel requires some attention in fact a very great deal when we marry she shall do as she pleases and have all the money she wishes to spend i think she would rather have love i said gravely i give her love he snapped rather crossly ill be with her morn noon and night if she wishes all i have to do is to launch my airship and then i shall marry mabel and be happy ever afterwards having solved the problem of flying i queried i really believe that i shall do so he said his face lighting up come and see my airship vance next week i intend to try a flight its nearly ready i have asked a reporter down from london and will admit the public into the yard and we shall have a great day is mabel coming his face fell no she says she is jealous of my airship but she will come down to take a trip in it when i make a successful flight i asked cannington but he cant get away from murchester never mind you will be there and you can bring miss monk thanks but we shant trust ourselves in your confounded balloon its not a balloon flared up dicky angrily and for the rest of the evening he explained his ideas i was not sufficiently an engineer to appreciate the cleverness of them during the week before westons trial flight a rumor ran through the village which surprised everyone it was said that miss destiny intended to go away from burwain as she had lived in the village all her life and seemed to be as deeply rooted as a tree it appeared strange that in her old age she should venture to seek fresh fields and pastures new but i guessed that she intended to go in search of striver whom she believed had possession of the jewels i tried to get speech with her but she would not admit me into her house nor would she come to the lodge in response to an invitation from gertrude i wished to learn if she knew the whereabouts of the exgardener since i guessed she was bent upon finding him but i could not learn where she was going although lucinda set the rumor afloat in the village that her mistress intended to leave burwain but i could guess the devouring flame of avarice in miss destinys heart which made her thus uproot herself she would go through fire and water to get the jewels which she believed striver possessed and i found myself pitying the man guilty as i believed him to be when i thought of that halting nemesis of a witch coming up to his side miss destiny was starting on the chase and she would never stop hunting until she pulled down her quarry death alone would end her pursuit however the days passed by and she still lingered in her miserable home burwain began to wear quite a festive air during those early january weeks for reporters came from london to inspect the airship and many idle people gathered outside the yard to pick up chance information dicky showed me his craft at a private view and explained the mechanism to me with certain reservations touching upon his particular method of flying his secrets i understood had to do with the steering of the vessel and with some way he had of driving her forward in the teeth of the wind i am so ignorant of technical terms that i cannot explain much that he told me nor would it be fair since inventors do not wish their ideas to be stolen but i grew almost as excited as dicky when the great day arrived it was a tuesday morning fine and sunny with scarcely a breath of wind and the inventor could have secured no finer weather for his attempt a crowd of people from tarhaven and gattlingsands and other places came to see the experiment and quite a number of reporters had appeared representing the most popular london journals the gates of the yard were thrown open and a considerable crowd gathered within the hitherto inviolated precincts amongst them i walked with gertrude beside me everyone in the village was there i verily believe to see the novelty of an airship taking flight even fat john gilfin with his nearly as stout wife waddled along looking at the queer machine bulking largely in the middle of the yard the airship consisted of a slim cigarshaped bag netted over from this a long narrow trough of basketwork was slung at each end of which was a propeller the light machinery to drive this was in the middle but this being hidden under a bonnet of tin i could not see what was used to set the wheels working that was one of westons secrets the inventor himself was busy in the trough adjusting various parts of the gear and shouting out orders to different workmen the whole ship itself was bound to earth by sundry ropes and was tugging and straining at them like a thing of life when those ropes were loosened the ship would flash up into the air like a released bird and then dicky seated behind his machine in the basketwork cradle would show his skill in steering it this way and the other as the wind was extremely faint he would have every advantage i forgot to say that there were steering vans like wings spreading from the trough and these could be raised or lowered at will but wanting technical knowledge as i have explained i fear my description of the famous craft is not particularly good it was an airship that was all i knew and i was curious to see it climb the sky amongst the crowd i unexpectedly saw the quaint little figure of miss destiny dressed in black as usual i pointed her out to gertrude and we tried to get near her as i was still curious to learn if she had any idea of strivers whereabouts but she kept her keen eyes on our every movement and dodged us with such success that we never could approach her what can she be afraid of asked gertrude perplexed shes afraid of being asked questions i replied i believe she knows where that man is to be foundthough lord only knows how she can have learned his whereabouts she intends to run him down and get the jewels all to herself but what will she do with them asked gertrude bewildered gloat over them i replied shortly but see the airship will soon be on the point of starting six ropes i added pressing forward if it needs that strength to hold down yon huge bag of gas i wonder how weston proposes to reach earth again hell have to remain a sky bird for ever the interest of the crowd became intense as four of the ropes were loosened and the airship strained desperately at the remaining two weston as he afterwards informed me had a method of releasing or separating the gas in some way whereby he could descend if he chose then by connecting up the gas again in the cigarshaped bag he could ascend i do not exactly understand how it was managed but it had to do with the transmission of gas from the upper bag to a lower one under the trough which i only noticed when the four ropes let the ship float a trifle high although interested in the airship i was much more taken up with the movements of miss destiny she likewise became absorbed in the start of the strange craft and forgot for the moment to keep her eyes on us i drew gertrudes arm within my own and stole forward to where she was pressing gently through the watching crowd gertrude uttered an ejaculation and pointed towards the gate there is lucinda she said in startled tones and two policemen with her i looked and sure enough lucinda walked beside a sternfaced man in plain clothes whom i knew he was none other than my old friend inspector dredge of murchester behind walked two burly policemen and they all four came steadily towards the crowd gathered round the airship what can be the matter whispered gertrude agitated i thrilled as a premonition of what the presence of dredge meant flashed into my mind however i had little time for consideration as the second rope was released from the ground and weston curled it up within the car only one rope remained to be loosened as weston laid his hand on it to draw it up giving the signal to the men below to let go lucindas cry wild and shrill arose fly mistress fly theyre after you theyll get you theyll a policemans hand on her mouth stopped her further speech miss destiny who was immediately in front of me turned quickly at the sound of the girls voice her face grew deathly white when she saw the inspector forcing his way towards her and she looked round like a trapped animal heedless of the roaring of the crowd excited by the sight dredge came up to miss destiny and laid a heavy hand on her shoulder i arrest you in the name of the king for the murder of anne he got no further miss destiny with a sudden snarl twisted out of his grip at the very moment weston gave the signal for the men below to loosen the last rope being in the fore front of the crowd she sprang into the open space and ran forward take me with you take me with you she screamed and as the men let go of the rope she grabbed hold of it with desperate and inconceivable quickness the next moment the airship shot up into the radiant sky and at the end of the rope which dangled from the car under westons hands miss destiny spun like a spider she uttered no sound she made no movement but hung on desperately while the ship soared i caught a glimpse of the amazement on westons face as it lessened before my eyes a shout of terror at the little womans terrible position came from the crowd dredge stood where he was paralyzed and gertrude screamed with fright lucinda beat her hands in despair the ship soared and swung to the right and that black figure still clung to the rope westonas we could seewas making preparations to descend but owing to some difficulty could not get his gear to work by this time the ship was at a considerable height and everyone was watching with terror the happening of this midair tragedy how miss destiny hung on so long i could not guess she seemed to have the strength of a fiend suddenly a gust of wind caught the ship as she receded and the rope with the little figure twisting at the end swung towards the rear of the car in a second it was in the grip of the stern propeller and we saw the sudden jerk of the rope upward a moment later and it was jerked out of the gripping hands of anne caldershaws murderess she fell a speck through the blue sky and a groan went up from the crowd at the sight of that terrible death chapter xxii the whole truth so miss destiny was the criminal after all and her confession alone revealed what had taken place in anne caldershaws back room shortly before i had arrived in my motor car to search for adventure inspector dredge came to the lodge that same evening to relate all that had taken place and to inform us how he had come to burwain the little womans body was found broken in pieces on the outskirts of tarhaven and small wonder considering the terrible height from which she had fallen we did not hear until the next day what weston thought as his airship proved to be unmanageable and drifted over toward the island of grain where he managed to descend there he remained for the night and came back by train to burwain in the afternoon of the ensuing day but neither gertrude nor i troubled about westons failure or absence we were far too much taken up with the story told by inspector dredge as you were so much connected with the matter mr vance said the sternfaced man when he appeared at four oclock in the drawingroom of the lodge it is only fair that you should know the truth i also am connected with the matter mr inspector said gertrude for i he interrupted her with a grave bow i know what you would say miss you were in the back room and left your cloak there which was afterwards worn by joseph striver when he escaped in mr vances motor car no blame attaches to you miss and i quite understand that you did not care to incriminate yourself by coming to explain to me yet if you had done so he ended with rebukeful emphasis we might have arrived earlier at the truth who told you all this i asked curiously striver himselfby letter that is said dredge bringing out some papers from the pocket of his overcoat he is an accomplice after the fact miss destiny who actually committed the crime is dead and her bodyor what remains of itlies at tarhaven waiting the inquest which will be held tomorrow but joseph will be searched for and arrested as he knew the truth all along why did he not tell it asked gertrude anxiously i think you are to blame miss or rather your sweet looks miss striver wished to use what he had learned in order to marry you but what did he learn i asked while gertrude blushed at the complimentary tone of the officer i am coming to that said dredge calmly all in good time mr vance two days ago i received a letter from joseph striver it stated that he was sailing from a certain port to some foreign land which he refused to name where is the letter written from there is no address given mr vance but the postmark is that of london it was posted at the general post office so striver has covered up his tracks very carefully by this time he is doubtless on the high seas and it will be difficult to trace him well i demanded impatiently and what did he say in his letter dredge took out an epistlewritten on foolscap as had been the one to meand spread it out on the table there is no need to read it he said gravely as i know the contents by heart yes go on gertrude and myself were all attention striver writes that he came to see his aunt knowing that miss monk was due for a visit he was informed of this fact by miss destiny striver went up to the bedroom while his aunt talked to miss monk who then arrived afterwards walter monk entered the shop and his daughteryou miss said the inspector with a dry nod departed by the back door i did not wish to meet my father said gertrude in low tones so i understand from strivers letter said dredge still dryly well then it appears that mr monk also knew of his daughters visit to mrs caldershaw through miss destiny but why should she have told everyone that i was going asked gertrude in an indignant voice cant you guess miss asked dredge pityingly miss destiny went over to mootley with the intention of murdering the woman for what reason i asked anxious to be fully satisfied the inspector heaved a sigh at my apparent stupidity you miss he said to gertrude had told miss destiny of your discovery of the diary and of your intention to ask mrs caldershaw for the cipher your aunt miss then guessed from sundry remarks that mrs caldershaw had let fall that the cipher was contained in the false eye worn by the woman miss destiny determined to get that eye even at the cost of murder and so told several people of your proposed visit so that she might throw the blame on them do you mean to say questioned gertrude horrified that my aunt deliberately intended to have me accused of murder you or striver or your father assented dredge coolly she had to save her own skin somehow you see miss but to continue striver was wakened from sleep by a quarrel between mrs caldershaw and mr monk as he waited the cipher which she refused to give up did he know that it was hidden in the eye i interrupted i dont think so he did not say so from what striver overheard but he could not get what he wanted and therefore went away and walked back to murchester as he had come he called himselfdredge referred to the lettermr wentworth marr yes yes we know that i said hastily it seems to me mr vance that you know much which you have not told me i had my reasons and very good ones said i stiffly no reasons should prevent your helping the police in the execution of their duty said dredge with an official air however as things have turned out for the best we can let that pass when mr monk departed he continued taking up the thread of his narrative striver told his aunt that he wanted to sleep and returned to the bedroom there he really did fall asleep but before doing so he heard the voice of miss destiny but she did not arrive until after the murder i exclaimed she arrived long before as you will read in her confession said dredge grimly let me proceed in due order if you please striver stole down the stairs as he was anxious to learn what miss destiny had to say to his aunt he heard her ask for the cipher mrs caldershaw refused to give it up saying she had it hidden in her false left eye which would never leave her head until she was dead ah said gertrude so that is how aunt julia learned about the eye i think she knew it before replied dredge with a shrug however when striver learned about the eye he retreated to the bedroom and threw himself on the bed to think how he could get it then he fell asleep when he awoke it was quite dark and we know the rest i interposed quickly he came downstairs and found his aunt dead then he heard me coming and managed to lock me in and escape with my car dredge nodded glancing meanwhile at the letter yes mr vance it is as you say of course striver knew that miss destiny had murdered his aunt so when she returned to burwain he taxed her with the crime she denied it and tried to throw the blame on her niece and on mr monk but striver threatened to tell the police and the woman confessed she said that she would find the money and give half to striver also that she would aid him to marry miss monk the idea cried gertrude angrily as if she could she hoped to force you by implicating you in the murder for that reason according to striver she left the eye on the table in this drawingroom what i started to my feet was it miss destiny who herself said dredge coolly she talked to striver in the garden then went to the windowthat one yonder said dredge pointing to the middle french windowand placed the eye on the table hoping that you miss would find it then she trusted that you would not be able to account for its possession and would be accused of the crime what a wicked woman oh what a wicked woman i think she was miss however she has paid for her wickedness by a most terrible death if you had seen the bodyhe stopped and ironnerved as he was shuddered after a pause he continued when miss destiny placed the eye on the table she went back to talk to striver and you mr vance found them together yes i did but why did striver go to the window did he know i cant be sure since he loved miss monk i dont think he would have lent himself to such a wicked plot even to marry her but he did go and secure the eye then he used it to frighten mr monk who afterwards destroyed it go on dredge shrugged his shoulders it seems to me that there is little chance of my telling you anything you dont know he said folding up the letter and replacing it in his breast pocket and that is all striver has to say i got out a warrant on the confession which he enclosed and came here this morning with two policemen i called at miss destinys house which was pointed out to me she was away and the girl lucinda tried to escape to give her mistress warning did lucinda know the truth yes she drove her mistress on that evening dredge stopped and waved his hands youll hear that in the confession whose confession miss destinys striver did not trust her and moreover was fearful lest he should be accused of the deed he swore to tell the police and give evidence against her unless she wrote out clearly what had occurred and signed it forced to do so she did as she was bid and striver held this confession over her head so as to compel her to do his bidding lucinda would have warned her mistress butguessing that miss destiny would witness the trial flight of the airshipi took the girl with me and went to mr westons yard you heard how she gave voice and saw how the mistress escaped sohe wiped his face with a shiverthat is ended god have mercy on the black soul of that woman amen to that i said while gertrude wept silently but striver seems to have behaved like a scoundrel never mind cyrus he has made amends whispered gertrude through her tearstears of which miss destiny was unworthy here said dredge spreading out another document is the confession of julia destiny signed by her in the presence of striver i need not read it he added folding up the precious paper and putting it away as i can give you a hasty prcis of the contents my time is short he glanced at his watch i have to catch a train in an hour at tarhaven i must be brief yes go on and make the telling as short as you can i said anxiously for miss monk cannot bear much more while i fondled gertrudes hand within my own the inspector related what miss destiny had written the wicked little woman had intended to get the eye even if she had to kill anne caldershaw to force it out of the womans head she had arranged to bring striver gertrude and walter monk to mootley so as to implicate them if possible and save herself from being accused of murder she therefore arranged with lucinda who was bound body and soul to her service to drive over early to mootley on the second day of her journey thither lucinda with the trap remained behind a hedge near murchester and miss destiny evading notice crept through the fields to the corner shop striver was up stairs but she did not know that as mrs caldershaw said nothing but she learned that gertrude had been and saw the white cloak left behind in the kitchen along with one of the blue glassheaded pins she also learned that monk had paid a visit so she was quite prepared to fasten the blame of her contemplated deed on anyone of them oh what a devil i murmured at this point of dredges narrative indeed you may so he said somewhat moved for the recital was really terrible well then while seated in the back kitchen miss destiny failing to get the eye from mrs caldershaw watched her chance to murder her she took up the blue glassheaded pin which she knew belonged to miss here she gave it to me herself said gertrude in a choked voice of course dredge nodded and so was certain that when used the blame would fall on you now how she managed exactly to kill mrs caldershaw she does not say went on the inspector wrinkling his brow in perplexity i think myself she playfully touched mrs caldershaw every now and then with the pin to emphasize what she was saying certainly mrs caldershaw would suspect nothing until miss destiny placing the pin directly over the heart drove it home with a sudden thrust the woman fell dead dead wailed gertrude not quite dead said the precise dredge she was bleeding from internal hemorrhage for she lived for sometime afterwards striver found her still alive and so did i i interposed i heard her last moan she bled inwardly to death said dredge rising and buttoning his coat i must go now if you will excuse me but the rest of the confession how did she get the eye i asked pulled it out of mrs caldershaws head said the inspector brutally she then escaped by the back door and went along a path leading through the wood of elms she knew of that having been to mrs caldershaws before mrs caldershaw told me how to go by that path said gertrude one question before you go mr inspector said i following him to the door if miss destiny had the eye for so long in her possession why did she not discover the secret she could not read the cipher strange it is not a particularly difficult one have you read it asked dredge striver said that he had sent a drawing of it to you yes we discovered the hidingplace of the jewels and found it empty now i wonder if miss destiny did read the cipher and steal the jewels she says she did not and here dredge looked again at his watch i really have no time to say more you must excuse me and he hurried away rapidly i turned to gertrude when we heard the door close behind him well said i with a half smile now that the truth has been discovered we can marry she sobbed oh cyrus can you marry the niece of a murderess i would marry you if you committed the crime yourself i said kissing her fondly and marry her i did two months later owing to the terrible death of miss destiny the story of her crime was not made public there was some talk of lucinda being brought in as an accomplice after the fact but as she apparently was a halfwitted creature she was left alone she confessed however that after committing the crime miss destiny had rejoined her and then the two had driven later to mootley to meet striverwho miss destiny thought was a womandriving my motor car i have often wondered since at the extraordinary nerve displayed by miss destiny on that fatal evening she arrived fresh from the commission of a brutal crime and played her part as a startled lady admirably all the time we were talking in giles house she had the eye in her pocket and knew the whole truth of the affair i was amazed at the strength of character displayed by the frail little creature it was extraordinary that avarice should have driven her to so desperate a course but having taken it she had managed wonderfully but for the unguessedof presence of striver in the house her wickedness would never have been discovered she was buried in tarhaven in an unhonoured grave and gertrude and i strove to forget her and her crimes as speedily as possible lucinda vanished when she found that the police intended to leave her alone and i never learned what became of her striver also had disappeared and we did not hear that he had been caught although i believe dredge made several attempts to find out his whereabouts but without success but of one person we did hear that was mr walter monk or as he still continued to call himself mr wentworth marr on the night before my marriage to gertrude i was with her at the lodge and cannington who had come down to be my best man was also present he was in great spirits and had been much impressed by the story of miss destinys wickedness which i had told him in detail adventures are to the adventurous said he gravely you certainly found a very good one with a happy termination and he glanced at gertrude it was strange i remarked musingly that you should have made that quotation as being by wentworth marr yes and at the time when we did not know who wentworth marr was dont speak of him cried gertrude with a shudder oh dear me i never would have believed that my father would act so wickedly oh i dont think he acted so very wickedly said cannington generously and to set her at her ease he changed his name legally enough and was a wealthy man as we know all he did was to suppressfor obvious reasonsthe fact that he possessed so charming a daughter well it doesnt matter now i broke in impatiently for every mention of her father brought sorrow to gertrudes face monk or marr or whatever he chooses to call himself is over the seas and wont come back gertrude tomorrow takes my name and my good fortune also mabel is to marry dicky in three months so that ends everything except dickys desire to conquer the air said cannington smiling he is awfully cut up over the failure of his last attempt he wants to begin and build another vessel straight away but mab swears she will not marry him if he doesnt promise to leave airships alone for at least twelve months after she becomes his wife that said i gravely will give dicky time to invent something worth talking about i thought his airship was rotten myself it failed in every point much better for him to keep his money and not waste it oh mab will see to that said cannington lightly but see miss monk wishes to speak to you vance whats up cyrus said gertrude quietly and producing a letter and you lord cannington i received this she tapped the letter from my father by this mornings post oh my sainted aunt cried cannington vivaciously whats it about but perhaps he rose to his feet you dont want to tell me ill go to the smokingroom while you talk to vance here gertrude put out a detaining hand no dont go lord cannington i know that cyrus has no secrets from you i wish both of you to hear what became of the diamonds which caused all the trouble i believe that striver has them i said firmly i believe that miss destiny got them said cannington nodding you are both wrong replied gertrude with strange composure my father possessed the diamonds your father never we exclaimed quite amazed by the speech my father went on gertrude with a firmness of which i had not deemed her capable considering what she had come through found a copy of the drawing on the silver piece in mrs caldershaws false eye amongst the papers of his brother shortly after uncle gabriels death he soon discovered the secret which i wonder aunt julia did not find out so easy did it appear to be she was less clever than wicked i said quickly does your father tell you that in the letter gertrude yes she said with a heavy sigh he heard from his lawyers to whom i gave notice that i was to marry you cyrus and he writes she shivered to send me his blessing oh lord this was from cannington who apologized you need not make excuses to me said gertrude rather bitterly for indeed as you do lord cannington i wonder at the man he robbed me of my fortune he allowed me to get into trouble he scarcely gave me enough to live on yet all the time her voice rose indignantly he was using my money as wentworth marr what do you think of such a man canningtons fist clenched itself and i bit my lip to prevent an oath if monk had been there i fear he would have had a sorry time between us and gertrude whose affections had been cast aside by her tricky father was an indignant as we were then the australian cousin i began she cut me short there never was any australian cousin nor any legal change of name you can read here what he says and she passed me the letter i read that amazing document which revealed the depths of walter monks heart he did not appear to be ashamed of himself but confessed that he had found the diamonds and had lived on the sale of them with a most appalling jocularity he seemed to exult in his cleverness and declared that he had done his daughter no wrong since the money coming from the sale of the jewels rightfully belonged to him then came another odd trait in the mans character he still he said had much of the fifty thousand pounds in his possession and therefore did not wish to keep the income left by gabriel if my brother wrote mr monk had given me the diamonds and you the income all would have been well and i should not have been forced to stoop to concealment which my soul abhors good lord muttered cannington again what a man therefore as i continued to read mr monk had made a gift of deed to his dear daughter of the house and grounds and also of the five hundred a year he never intended to return to england he said as he had an opportunity of marrying the daughter of a wealthy chicago merchant he ended his letterand a remarkable human document it wasby wishing gertrude and myself all happiness and bidding the girl remember how kindly her father had behaved in thus settling her for life finally in a postscript he asked his darling child to remember him in her prayers this last piece of impudence was too much for both cannington and myself we burst into peals of laughter and then felt ashamed when gertrude rose suddenly and left the room i followed hastily my own i caught her as she was springing up the stairs forgive us both we didnt mean it but the letter yes yes i know by this time she was sobbing on my breast but oh cyrus to think that i should be the daughter of such a man never mind it is said in scripture that a woman shall leave her father and mother and cling to her husband tomorrow you will be mrs vance and enter upon a life of unclouded happiness oh i hope so i hope so she murmured but the past has been so dreadful that i am afraid of the future you need not be i said stoutly i am by your side now to defend you all things connected with the mootley murder are at an end miss destiny is dead your father will probably marry his chicago heiress and remain for ever in the states striver has vanished with lucinda and neither of them will ever be heard of again and best of all the eye has been destroyed best of all whispered gertrude clinging to me fondly we are together my darling never to part never never never and i kissed her once twice and again i cant go back to the drawingroom said gertrude let me retire and take the boy back to the inn tomorrow when mabel comes down to be my bridesmaid we shall see one another again never to part any more she sped up the stairs and i took cannington still almost suffocated with laughter to the inn did you ever read such a letter vance he asked me i am sorry i laughed but the cheek the damned coolness never mind i said taking his arm im glad for gertrudes sake that she has got the money well repair the house and live in it and be happy for evermore im sure you deserve to be said the boy thoughtfully well i can only say one thing which i said when this romance of yours began dont say it confound you yes i shall adventures are to the adventurous there i laughed from sheer lightheartedness i could not help it so strange did it seem that my love story should end where it had begun in the quotation of the saying the end
